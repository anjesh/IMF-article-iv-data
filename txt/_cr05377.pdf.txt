EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. GDP growth has slowed since mid-2004, despite high oil prices, but remains
robust. The slowdown reflects mainly a sudden deceleration in the growth of oil output and
investments last summer, most probably due to supply disruptions and jolts to the investment
climate. The slowdown has also been due to emerging resource constraints. Fiscal policy has
so far offset much of the stimulus arising from the large terms of trade gains, but a major
relaxation is now underway as high oil prices and the swelling stabilization fund are
undermining support for the current policy for saving the oil revenue windfall. Monetary
policy has remained accommodative as the CBR has continued to resist ruble appreciation
through large unsterilized interventions. Meanwhile, structural reforms outside the banking
system have come to a virtual standstill.
Outlook. GDP growth is projected to amount to 5½ percent in 2005, compared to 7¼ percent
in 2004. The main downside risk is a weakening in consumption growth. On the other hand,
the fiscal relaxation that is currently in the pipeline could temporarily boost GDP growth
closer to last year’s level. Inflation is almost certain to exceed the official target again this
year, although the CBR is likely to allow just enough exchange rate flexibility to prevent it
from increasing above last year’s level. Vulnerabilities are likely to remain low, but a sharp
correction in the oil price could cause significant distress in the banking sector.
Policy discussions. The discussions focused on the following issues:
•

The amendment of the 2005 budget entails a significant relaxation of fiscal policy in the
face of emerging resource constraints and buoyant consumption. Staff warned that this
would to add to inflationary pressures and that further relaxation should be delayed until
cyclical pressures ease. The authorities felt that the risks were still manageable.

•

There is significant room for fiscal relaxation over the medium term. Stressing that the
oil wealth should be harnessed in support of reforms and other spending that promise to
bolster potential GDP growth, staff argued that there is little scope for increasing such
spending at this juncture without risking waste, due to the flagging reforms.

•

Staff advocated increased exchange rate flexibility, and warned that resisting
appreciation as fiscal policy is being relaxed poses a risk to stability. CBR officials
disagreed, saying that they would continue to pursue both inflation and exchange rate
targets. Staff expressed concern about the fact that the admission into the new deposit
insurance scheme had not entailed as strong a break with regulatory forbearance as
hoped for. CBR officials disagreed.

•

All key reformers within the government agreed with staff that reforms are at a standstill
and that the Yukos affair had damaged the investment climate. They also agreed that
complacency in this regard was due to high oil prices. Kremlin officials insisted,
however, that the delays in reforms are due to administrative obstacles that will soon be
overcome.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.
Russia is in its seventh year of robust GDP growth. Even as the import substitution
that powered the recovery from the 1998 crisis began to peter out—and partially reverse—
large and sustained terms-of-trade gains, in combination with increased political and
economic stability, helped propel a broad based recovery, which is still running its course
(Table 1). Higher oil output and investments have been the main conduits in this regard.
Rising oil prices have prompted not only an immediate oil output response, but also allowed
companies to bypass the weak financial system and use their own resources to introduce
technology that increases extraction from existing wells, reversing the decade-long
contraction in Russian oil output. Meanwhile,

Although still robust, real GDP growth has slowed by a third since mid-2004,
despite record high oil prices. It decelerated from 7½ percent in the first half of 2004 to a
provisional 5½ percent in the same period of 2005 (year-on-year). The slowdown mainly
reflects a sudden deceleration in the growth of oil output and investments from the third
quarter of 2004, with no clear evidence yet of a recovery. More recently, real wages and
consumption growth have appeared to be weakening as well, suggesting that all the main
sources of growth in recent years are now softening.

The softening is widely attributed to the confluence of policy induced supply
disruptions and jolts to the investment climate. The Yukos affair has been associated with
accusations of heavy-handedness on the part of tax authorities and other agencies and
broader concerns about state interventionism and backtracking on reforms. Such concerns
have been reinforced by the failure to reinvigorate reforms after the elections. The sharp rise
in marginal tax rates in the oil sector, to almost 90 percent at prices above $25 per barrel
(Box 1), might also have taken a toll on oil output and investments. While the impact of the
tax rise on profitability has been limited inasmuch as oil prices have continued to rise, the
increase in the share of the oil revenue windfall that is being taxed has reduced the impetus to
GDP growth from recent increases in the oil price. Meanwhile, the supply disruptions caused
by the change in ownership of Yukos last fall have not yet been fully reversed.

Box 1. Oil Taxation and the Oil Stabilization Fund
Oil Taxation
The Russian oil sector is taxed mainly through:
• the mineral extraction tax, which is levied on all extracted oil at a rate of 22 percent of the excess over
$9 per barrel;
• the export customs duty on oil, which applies to oil exports only when the Urals c.i.f. price exceeds
$15 per barrel. The rates are proportional to the level of the price of Urals. When the price is between
$15 and $20 per barrel the marginal rate is
Marginal oil tax rates*
35 percent; when the price is between $20 and
$25, the marginal rate is 45 percent; and when the
oil price is beyond $25 per barrel, the marginal
rate is 65 percent.

The combined marginal rate for these taxes is
22 percent for prices below $22 per barrel but
increases rapidly with the oil price to reach
88 percent when the price is above $25 per barrel.
The rates of these two taxes were substantially increased in August 2004 and again in January 2005;
especially for oil prices above $25 per barrel.1 The chart compares the increase in marginal rates at the
beginning of 2004 and 2005.

*Marginal tax rates for oil export tariffs and oil extraction

In addition, to the aforementioned taxes, oil companies are also subject to the profit tax, which is levied on
profits of all companies at a fixed rate of 24 percent. Oil derivatives are also subject to excises.
Oil Stabilization Fund
The oil stabilization fund (OSF) was introduced in January 2004 with the aim of saving the fiscal windfall
coming from the exceptionally high oil price. Revenues from the mineral extraction tax and the export
custom duty on oil in excess of the reference price of the OSF, which is currently $20 per barrel, are
earmarked for the OSF. At the current rate of extraction and export, each additional dollar in the oil prices
above $25 per barrel increases revenues earmarked for the OSF by about Rub 55 billion. In addition, the oil
stabilization fund is financed with the unspent fiscal surplus of the previous year, amounting to
Rub 106 billion in 2003, and Rub 218 billion in 2004.

By law, the resources of the OSF may be used to finance the federal budget deficit when the
current oil price is below the reference price, and also for other purposes such as repaying foreign
debt, if resources exceed Rub 500 billion. Thus far, the government has used OSF resources to
prepay the IMF (Rub 93.5 billion) in January 2005 and to prepay US$ 15 billion to Paris Club
creditors. As a supposedly temporary measure, resources from the OSF will be used to finance the
gap in the pension fund in 2005 that emerged due to the cut in the unified social tax. The reserves
of the OSF are currently deposited in an unremunerated account with the central bank.
_______________
1
The increase of the mineral extraction tax in January 2005 was implemented to offset the cost to the
budget of the repeal of the VAT on oil and natural gas exports to CIS countries. Such exports were
previously taxed at the standard rate of 18 percent; starting in January 2005, they became subject to a zero
percent Russian VAT rate as are all other Russian exports.

resource constraints became apparent when
the acceleration in domestic demand in 2004
spilled over entirely into much higher imports, while leaving GDP growth unchanged
compared to the previous year. This is broadly in line with staff calculations suggesting that
the output gap has been virtually closed and that at present GDP cannot grow by more than
5-6 percent without causing higher inflation.1
5.
Labor market conditions have also continued to tighten. Real wages grew by
11¼ percent in 2004, catching up with productivity gains in recent years and bringing unit
labor costs in rubles to broadly the same level as before the 1998 crisis. The rate of
unemployment fell to 7½ percent with reports of labor shortages in high-growth areas like
Moscow and St. Petersburg, where unemployment rates have dropped to 1½ percent and
2¾ percent, respectively. Labor market mobility remains limited, owing to severe housing
shortages among other reasons.

Core inflation remains entrenched despite the continued appreciation of the
ruble in real terms. Headline inflation climbed from 10 percent in June 2004 to 13¾ percent
in June 2005. This was largely the result of unseasonably high food prices and large increases
in administered prices—following their pre-election lull—while core inflation has been
entrenched at 10–11 percent since 2002. The ruble has continued to appreciate in real terms,
by 6¾ percent in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.

Competitiveness does not seem to be impaired, however. Although the CPI-based
real effective exchange rate is currently at almost the level prevailing prior to the August

appreciation since 1999 has been in line with or even somewhat slower than the change in

The real exchange rate is still below its equilibrium level. Compared with other transition
economies with similar levels of income (such as the Baltic states and Poland), Russia’s relative price
level, or its deviation from PPP, is still well below the level that could be expected given Russia’s
relative income level, suggesting real exchange rate undervaluation. While the real effective exchange
rate (REER) has appreciated substantially since 1999, it has not exceeded the growth rate of Russia’s
productivity differential, owing to the prudent policy of saving most of the permanent terms-of-trade
gain in the oil stabilization fund.

Russia’s productivity differential with the Euro area and the United States. In recent years,
unit labor costs in some non-fuel sectors appear to have increased faster than in the fuel
sector, suggesting that the former may be suffering somewhat from the real appreciation. Yet,
the share of the Russian non-fuel sector in world exports has remained broadly stable.
8.
Rising oil prices have further strengthened the balance of payments (Table 2).
Gross foreign reserves rose by $27 billion during the year through end-June 2005, to
$152 billion, more than 3½ times short-term debt. Public sector debt net of foreign reserves
has swung from a net liability of $140 billion shortly after the 1998 crisis to a net asset
position of almost $30 billion, suggesting a significantly reduced external vulnerability.
•

Higher oil and gas prices, and some further increase in oil export volumes,
boosted the current account surplus to 10 percent of GDP in 2004, more than
offsetting the impact of rapid domestic demand growth and real ruble appreciation.

•

Pre-payment of debt is causing the official capital account to turn sharply
negative. The authorities have reached an agreement with Paris Club creditors to prepay $15 billion of its debt. As a result, net public capital outflows will amount to
about 2¼ percent of GDP in 2005, compared to a very small outflow in 2004. The
authorities are considering prepayment of the remaining Paris Club debt of about
$28 billion in 2006–07. (Russia made early repurchase of all obligations to the Fund
subject to repurchase in March 2005.)

•

Net private capital outflows (including errors and omissions) rose considerably
in 2004, to 2 percent of GDP. The surge in outflows in 2004 was largely on account
of increased capital flight, possibly reflecting the concerns about the business climate
associated with the Yukos affair. However, the picture is mixed as capital inflows

- 12 -

also increased. Russian banks and companies have continued to take advantage of
narrowing spreads and increased market access to borrow on global capital markets.
Upgrades to investment grade by major rating agencies during 2004 and early 2005
further improved confidence and access to international capital markets. Meanwhile,
exchange rate policy has continued to contribute to the volatility in the capital
account. In the last quarter of 2004, the capital account recorded large net inflows as
investors were expecting an impending appreciation of the ruble. In the first quarter
of 2005, inflows remained high owing in part to a $6 billion loan to Rosneft for the
purchase of Yugansk, but outflows increased again.

B. Macroeconomic Policies
9.
Fiscal policy has so far offset much of the stimulus arising from the large terms
of trade shock. The headline general government surplus has increased every year since
2001 as the government has taxed and saved much of the rapidly increasing oil revenues
(Tables 3 and 4). Under the current WEO assumption about oil prices for 2005, which
translates into a price for Russian crude of $47 per barrel, the amended 2005 budget will
entail an overall surplus of 7½ percent of GDP, compared to 5 percent of GDP in 2004.2

The overall headline balance reflects improvements in the fiscal position that depend on the higher
price of oil. In this sense, it does not provide a reliable estimate of the underlying fiscal stance,
namely the impact on aggregate demand of fiscal policy had the latter not benefited from the oil
windfall. To measure this, it is preferable to use the constant oil price balance or the non-oil balance.
Changes in these two measures are meant to proxy the fiscal impulse to the economy if the budget
had not been boosted by the oil windfall. Chapter II of the accompanying Selected Issues Paper
discusses the various fiscal indicators.

But the government has been gradually increasing its spending of the oil
revenues, as evident from the increase in the non-oil fiscal deficit or the decline in the
surplus on a constant oil price basis. This surplus has declined in every year since 2001,
except in 2004, having dropped sharply in the run-up to the elections in late 2003. This
relaxation in the face of tightening resource constraints and buoyant overall demand is likely

to have added somewhat to upward pressures on prices and the ruble. Indeed, it has coincided
with the period of core inflation becoming entrenched and the pace of real ruble appreciation
picking up. Still, the relaxation has so far been measured inasmuch as the federal budget
would still have balanced at a price for Russian crude oil of only $22 per barrel in 2004,
suggesting that fiscal policy for the period 2001–04 as a whole did much to prolong the
recovery, preventing early overheating by partially taxing and saving the large terms of trade
windfall in the face of buoyant demand. As detailed below, however, the recent amendment
of the 2005 budget and current plans for the 2006 budget point to a significant relaxation of
this policy. The fiscal impulse excluding the oil sector has now turned notably positive (see
Text Table).
11.
Monetary policy has remained accommodative, notwithstanding some tightening
since mid-2004. Unsterilized interventions have caused large increases in reserve money in
recent years, and the attendant rapid growth in bank credits has contributed to the buoyancy
of domestic demand (Table 5). However, reserve money growth has slowed somewhat since
mid-2004, mainly because of an accelerated build-up of government deposits with the CBR
following the increase in oil taxation in mid-2004. The turmoil in the banking sector last year
may also have contributed to the slowdown in credit growth. Yet, this slowdown is largely
considered to have reflected weakening demand for credits as investment growth has
decelerated. Rising inflation, declining nominal interest rates, and larger capital outflows,
among other factors, suggest that monetary conditions have remained accommodative.

Box 3. Policy Implementation and Past IMF Recommendations
Fiscal policy: A key policy recommendation by the staff has been to tax and save oil revenue
windfalls as long as cyclical pressures persist. Despite the gradual reduction in the non-oil deficit,
fiscal policy has broadly been in line with the staff’s suggestions during the period 2001–04. Staff
have also urged that the VAT reform planned for 2004–05 be delayed or, at least, be revenue-neutral
to avoid exacerbating inflationary pressures. The authorities have decided to postpone this reform.
Much of the far-reaching structural changes with regard to the tax system and expenditure control are
in line with the considerable Fund TA advise given to Russia in these areas.
Monetary policy: Staff has recommended that monetary policy be primarily focused on inflationcontrol, unburdened of exchange rate considerations. The CBR has disagreed with this advice, and
continued to pursue dual targets with its monetary and exchange rate policies.
Banking sector reforms: The authorities have implemented many of the recommendations provided
by the large number of Fund-Bank TA missions since the 1998 crisis, but key problems remain to be
addressed, including full IAS accounting, strengthening of creditor rights, and the development of
strategic plans for the still dominant state banks. Overall, in the staff’s view significant progress has
been made in this area. Staff has also supported the proposal for a deposit insurance scheme on the
ground that this would provide the authorities with an opportunity to strengthen prudential standards,
abandoning the regulatory forbearance that has characterized supervision in the past. CBR officials
believe that the admission process has indeed achieved such a strengthening, as discussed in the
report.
Structural reforms: Staff has found the government’s long-term structural reform program to be
comprehensive and well-targeted, not least its focus on measures to improve the investment climate.
However, staff has also, since 2002, found that the implementation of this plan has been
disappointing, in particular as far as civil service, public administration, and natural monopolies are
concerned. Developments last year have reinforced the staff’s concerns in this regard.

- 16 -

C. Structural Reforms
12.
Structural reforms are behind schedule. The reforms of social benefits that came
into effect in early 2005 were an important step toward overhauling Soviet-era entitlement
programs, despite some dilution of the original plan and implementation problems. Other
reforms, however, have progressed only slowly, if at all, and are running well behind the
plans outlined by the government when it assumed office last year. In particular, the
unexpectedly strong opposition to the social benefits reform appears to have reduced the
resolve to move ahead with health and education reforms.
13.
In banking, implementation of the new deposit insurance scheme is well
underway. The first round of admissions into the deposit insurance scheme was completed at
end-March, 2005. Out of 1,137 banks that applied, 824 were admitted. Most rejected banks
were small as those admitted account for 98 percent of household deposits. Rejected banks
may apply again in a second round of assessments, to be completed by end-September 2005.
II. NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK AND MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK
A. Near-Term Outlook
14.
Real GDP growth is set to remain robust in 2005, but is unlikely to return to the
pace reached before last year’s slowdown. Staff projects GDP growth of 5½ percent for
2005 as a whole, broadly in line with private sector consensus, but less than recent
government forecasts of almost 6 percent. Consistent with developments in early 2005, both
exports and investment growth are expected to remain subdued compared with previous
years, high oil prices notwithstanding, as concerns about the investment climate linger and
supply constraints in the oil sector are unlikely to ease. Consumption continues to be the
main engine of growth, supported by accommodating macroeconomic policies.
15.
The near-term outlook is shrouded in much uncertainty, however. Activity and
investment indicators have been very volatile, while consumption growth has eased recently,
raising doubts about its projected strength. On the other hand, further fiscal relaxation this
year, as discussed below, could boost GDP growth closer to last year’s level than projected
by staff. But a durable rise from recent levels is ultimately likely to be checked by resource
constraints and increased expenditure switching to imports, especially in view of the
slowdown in investments and the real appreciation of the ruble.
16.
Inflation is likely to exceed the official target again this year. With emerging
supply constraints but, buoyant demand, and year-on-year inflation of 13¾ percent through
June, the official end-year target of 8½ percent is beyond reach. The staff’s projection of
11½ percent by the end of the year assumes that the CBR will again permit only limited
nominal appreciation, but no more than what would be needed to avoid year-end inflation
from being higher than in 2004. Staff projects a real effective exchange rate appreciation of
11 percent in 2005, well above the official target of 8 percent.

- 17 -

B. Medium-Term Framework
17.
Russia has the potential for sustained high growth over the medium-term,
provided it accelerates structural reforms. Since the 1998 crisis, Russia has realized
significant gains in total factor productivity and attendant rapid increases in real wages and
consumption, in spite of an investment-to-GDP ratio that is low compared to other emerging
market economies and a concentration of investments in primary commodity sectors. This
suggests considerable catch-up potential if policies succeed in accelerating and broadening
investment growth over the medium term. Key ingredients in this regard are structural
reforms and better public infrastructure, as well as decisive actions to reassure investors
concerned about interventionism and the even-handiness of the state bureaucracy, as
discussed below. Contingent on measurable progress in these areas, staff expects potential
output growth to be 6–7 percent over the medium term. Without such progress, it expects
growth to slow further in the coming years (Table 6).
18.
Balance of payments constraints are unlikely to restrict economic policies and
GDP growth over the medium to long term. Even conservative forecasts for oil prices are
significantly above the new, higher benchmark price for the oil stabilization fund of $27 per
barrel (see below), suggesting that Russia under current policies is still taxing and saving
what is at least partially a permanent terms-of-trade gain. Thus, there is considerable scope
for policies that will bring about or accommodate a gradual lowering of the savingsinvestment surplus, without jeopardizing balance of payments viability. This conclusion is
reinforced by the fact that external vulnerability considerations weigh much less on economic
policies following the decline in external debt to low levels and the sharp rise in foreign
reserves (Table 7). As the current account adjusts to the terms-of-trade gain, the ruble should
be expected to appreciate steadily in real terms (Box 2).
19.
Staff projections indicate there is considerable room for fiscal relaxation over
the medium term. Under conservative assumptions about oil prices, the projected headline
primary surplus is about 6 percent of GDP higher than the debt-stabilizing primary surplus
over the medium term. The staff’s mediumPublic Debt

perspective, by incorporating the implications of demographic changes, the fiscal position is
also favorable, as detailed in Box 4.
20.
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities appear low, barring a major deterioration in
macroeconomic policies. A main risk is a much faster and deeper drop in oil prices than
assumed in the staff’s base-line scenario. Sensitivity analysis suggests, however, that the
medium-term fiscal position is robust to sizable adverse shocks. Even a worse-case
scenario—with a sharp fall in the oil price to $15 per barrel, an initial contraction in GDP of
2 percent, and a major devaluation of the ruble—would leave public debt at about 34 percent
of GDP (Table 8). A similar quantitative exercise confirms that the external position is also
robust to sizeable disturbances (Table 9 and Figure 1).
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
21.
The discussions revolved around the policies needed to make best use of oil
revenues. The main topics were the reasons for the slowdown in economic growth and the
attendant implications for macroeconomic policies in the near term; the optimal pace and
timing of the fiscal relaxation warranted over the medium term and the associated linkages to
the structural reform program; the changes to monetary and exchange rate policies needed to
ensure that the fiscal relaxation does not jeopardize financial stability; and the prospects for
banking sector reforms.
22.
The authorities are in the midst of a major reevaluation of economic policies.
The discussions took place against a backdrop of considerable uncertainty about the reasons
for the sudden slowdown in investments and economic growth and much heightened
uncertainty about the short-term outlook. Consensus has yet to emerge among key policy
makers about the extent to which the slowdown was policy induced and about the need for
policy corrections. Meanwhile, the expectation that oil prices will remain high over the
medium term is leading to a fundamental reexamination of the current policy for taxing and
saving oil revenues. The view that these savings should be spent is increasingly taking hold,
but a medium-term strategy in this regard has yet to emerge. Finally, the unexpectedly fierce
opposition to social sector reforms appears to have made the authorities more cautious, and
expectations about the pace of reform have become notably less ambitious. Overall, there
appeared to be somewhat less of a consensus about the direction of economic policies than at
the time of the last Article IV consultations.
A. Fiscal Policy
23.
A major fiscal relaxation is under way. The recently proposed amendment to the
2005 budget will raise expenditures by 1¾ percent of GDP relative to the original budget,
financed by one-time back-taxes from Yukos and higher-than-budgeted revenues from oil
taxes not earmarked for the stabilization fund (mainly profit and excise taxes from the oil
sector). The increase is almost entirely on account of higher wages, pensions, transfers to
regions, and other recurrent expenditures. While the 2006 budget is still under preparation

- 19 -

Box 4. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability and Structural Reforms
Russia’s structural reform program entails significant fiscal costs in the medium and long term. Key assumptions
include:
•

GDP growth falls gradually from a conservative 5 percent per year in 2006–10 to a long-run level of 2 percent per year,
equivalent to that in the United States.

•

In line with market expectations, staff assumes that the nominal oil price remains constant at around
$50 per barrel until 2013, implying a gradual fall to $40 per barrel at 2004 prices, after which it will remain
constant in real terms at this level (equivalent to around US$36.60 Urals).

•
•
•

Energy taxes. The tax burden for the energy sector remains the same as in 2006, so that the ratio of energy tax revenues
to GDP declines in line with the contraction in the share of energy GDP.
Non-energy tax revenues gradually increase from about 28 percent of GDP, the level projected in 2006, to around
30 percent of GDP in 2050 reflecting the increase in the share of non-oil GDP.
Non-reform public expenditure will be contained at 30 percent of GDP.

Six major structural reforms are contemplated. Associated fiscal costs amount to about 4½ percent of GDP.
Civil Sector Reform. Public salaries need to be brought in line with those of the private sector, especially at the senior level.
The government has started implementing this reform in 2004, but an additional 0.6 percent of GDP per year is necessary
for further wage adjustments. In addition, civil employment should be reduced by at least one quarter by 2010
(World Bank).
Housing and Communal Service Reforms. These are necessary to provide appropriate incentives for improving efficiency.
However, higher utility tariffs will raise costs for budget organizations by about 0.5 percent of GDP a year (World Bank).
Pension Reform. The pension system will require additional funding to maintain a replacement rate of 30 percent. In
addition, the unified social tax cut has created an annual financing gap of about 1 percent of GDP, which will need to be
financed with transfers from the federal budget. Demographic dynamics will reduce the support ratio, resulting in an
additional need for transfers. Overall, expenditure on pensions increases by 2 percent of GDP per year by 2014 (World
Bank).
Health and Education Reform. At present, the general government is spending about 7 percent of GDP on education and
health. It is widely recognized that public wages have to be increased in these sectors; in addition, their infrastructure must
be upgraded. Thus, expenditure on education and health should rise by 1.4 percent of GDP.
Contingent liabilities seem rather limited (the largest one
would be associated with a major banking crisis through the
deposit insurance scheme and is estimated at about 2–3 percent
of GDP). In conclusion:
The endowment of natural resources allows costly structural
reforms, provided non-oil revenues (or expenditures) offset
in small part the trend decline in oil revenues to GDP.
Energy-related revenue will be 4.1 percent of GDP in 2050
(down from 13 percent of GDP in 2005, as the price of oil
declines and GDP increases). An increase in non-oil revenues (or
cut in expenditures) by around 2 percent of GDP is sufficient to
preserve sustainability. Public debt will not exceed 15 percent of
GDP by 2050 and will remain stable afterwards.
However, fiscal sustainability will be compromised if the
government implements these reforms while simultaneously
cutting non-oil revenues. For instance, permanently reducing
non-oil revenues by 2 percent of GDP compared to the baseline
would increase public debt to over 100 percent of GDP by 2050.

and key parameters are yet to be finalized, including the surplus target and the assumption
about oil prices, planned investment incentives in the form of VAT and profit tax reductions
will cost ¾ percent of GDP. Including the modest relaxation built into the original 2005
budget, the 2005 amendment and the plans for 2006 discussed with the mission will worsen
the balance of the federal government on a constant oil price basis by about 3 percent of GDP
compared to 2004 (1¾ percent of GDP in 2005 and 1½ percent of GDP in 2006). To fund
this increased spending, the benchmark oil price above which revenues are saved in the
stabilization fund will be raised from $20 to $27 per barrel. Taking into account the spending
financed by the profit and excise taxes on the oil sector that are not channeled to the
stabilization fund, staff estimates that the fiscal changes proposed by the government in
recent months entail an increase in the oil price at which the federal budget is in balance from
$22 per barrel in 2004 to, at least, $31 per barrel in 2006.
24.
Pressures to relax further are mounting. These pressures are being fuelled by the
swelling of the oil stabilization fund—to $50 billion by end-2005 under current oil prices,
despite prepayment of Paris Club debt—and the fact that the new benchmark price ($27 per
barrel) and the oil price assumption in the amended 2005 budget ($35 per barrel) remain
much below current prices. Proposals for using more of the oil revenue windfall range from
accelerated increases in wages and social expenditures—President Putin has promised that
public sector wages will be raised by 50 percent in real terms over the next three years (and
that pensions will be increased significantly as well)—to increased funding of infrastructure
and investment projects. While calls for further tax cuts have become somewhat muted as the
focus of the public debate has switched to the expenditure side—the previously planned VAT
reform has been postponed—the discussions showed that support for such cuts remain
strong.
25.
Officials of the Ministry of Finance acknowledged that a fiscal relaxation at this
juncture would increase inflationary pressures. They agreed that the recent relaxation was
large, but argued that the risks were still manageable. They also stressed that the relaxation
was measured considering the demands that they had faced in this regard.
26.
Ministry of Finance officials were confident that there would not be any further
large fiscal relaxations in 2005–06. Explaining that the debate on the fiscal stance in effect
had become a discussion about the appropriate benchmark price of the stabilization fund and
the oil price assumption underlying the budget, officials were adamant that the benchmark
price would remain at $27 per barrel and the oil price assumption very conservative. Thus,
while recognizing that a second amendment to the 2005 budget is likely this fall, they were
confident that this amendment would be small. Similarly, while resources would have to be
allocated in the 2006 budget for a new investment fund and for a down payment on the wage
increases promised by the president, they believed, that the budgetary envelope—to be
submitted to Parliament in August—would actually entail a small reduction in total
expenditures relative to GDP, in line with long-standing plans. Staff questioned the realism
of this, suggesting that the relatively small down payment might not be consistent with the
expectations that have been raised in this regard, and warning that higher wage and pension

- 21 -

payments would require transfers to the pension fund and regional budgets much above those
envisaged in the draft budget discussed with the mission.
27.
Staff agreed that there is ample room for fiscal relaxation over the medium term
but argued that such relaxation should be delayed until cyclical pressures eased. Under
the current outlook, a relaxation at this time would entail allowing more of the terms-of-trade
gain to translate into faster overall demand growth just as resource constraints were
beginning to bite. This would add to the already rising inflationary pressures and increase the
risk that the real ruble appreciation overshoot its long term path. In view of this, it would be
preferable if there were no increase in the non-oil deficit in 2005–06, and staff warned that
the increase reflected in the recent amendment of the 2005 budget and the preliminary plans
for 2006 would increase inflationary pressures. Taking note of the authorities’ view that the
proposed amendment of the 2005 budget could not be reconsidered, staff urged that further
fiscal easing be delayed until inflation is set on a clear downward path.
28.
Staff cautioned that the inflationary risks associated with the fiscal relaxation
pointed to the urgency of a change in macroeconomic policy mix. It noted that spending
more of the terms of trade gain will inevitably cause an accelerated real appreciation of the
ruble. Therefore, continuing to gear monetary and exchange rate policies towards resisting
such appreciation would exacerbate the inflationary risks associated with the fiscal
relaxation. In the staff’s view, the authorities’ confidence that the risks associated with the
2005 amendment were manageable hinged crucially, on a tightening of monetary policy
enabled by an increase in exchange rate flexibility, as discussed below.
29.
Besides its concerns regarding the cyclical conjuncture, staff argued that the
case against fiscal relaxation also rested on the limited scope for spending the oil
revenues effectively at this juncture. Oil revenues should be spent over the medium term
on reforms and other outlays that promise to raise potential GDP growth. Considering that
the total annual cost to the budget of the main structural reforms that still lie ahead amount to
only 2–3 percent of GDP over the next five years, which is well within the potential for fiscal
relaxation over this period, staff stressed that Russia’s oil wealth provides a welcomed
opportunity for accelerated modernization of the economy. It also noted that there is some
scope for lowering of the tax burden over the medium term without jeopardizing budgetary
resources for other reforms. However, with structural reforms mostly at a standstill, there was
only limited scope for increased spending on reforms at this time. Noting that the 2005
amendment is overwhelmingly for public sector wages and other recurrent spending, staff
acknowledged that there is a need for increased spending on wages, pensions and many
social services, but doing so without accompanying public sector reforms risked wasting
resources. Staff pointed to the delayed civil service, health and education reforms and noted
that public sector employment continued to increase steadily, contrary to the government’s
objective. In the staff’ view, current policies suggest that Russia’s oil wealth is not being
mobilized in support of reforms and investments that will raise potential growth over the
medium term. This led to the conclusion that a key challenge facing the authorities as far as
medium-term plans are concerned is to prepare an integrated program for accelerated
structural reforms and increased spending of oil revenues.

- 22 -

30.
Looking to the long term, the challenge is to decide how to distribute the
consumption of oil wealth over time. Staff suggested several possible criteria3 that would
provide guidance in this context. The choice between such criteria is in the end a political
decision, but two criteria calculated by staff indicate that the sustainable non-oil balance4
would be approximately 5–6 percent of GDP higher than the current actual non-oil balance.
In this connection, staff noted that a reform of the OSF that limited the scope for
discretionary adjustment in the trigger price in the context of short-run oil price
developments would facilitate better fiscal management.
31.
The authorities explained that they are taking steps to improve the allocation of
public funds among different programs. Specifically, they are: (i) developing a three year
budgetary framework; (ii) enhancing expenditure control mechanisms; (iii) adopting a new
government procurement law; (iv) revising procedures related to the compilation of the
federal budget, including the reduction of number of readings of the draft budget.
B. Monetary Policy
32.
CBR officials believed that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate.
They considered the end-year target of 8½ percent to still be achievable and argued that the
increase in inflation to 13¾ percent in June 2005 mainly reflected supply side shocks,
notably increases in administered prices and shortages due to quotas on certain meat imports.
On the assumption of more measured increases in administered prices and favorable seasonal
factors during the second half of 2005, they did not see a need for monetary tightening at this
time. More generally, they were less concerned about demand pressures than staff and did
not believe that the fiscal relaxation now in store would significantly increase the burden on
monetary policy.
3

One such criterion is to ensure stability of public debt as a share of GDP. In this context, the
difference between the actual primary surplus and the debt stabilizing primary surplus
determines how much public expenditure can increase (or non-oil revenues decrease), while
keeping constant the debt ratio. As shown in paragraph 20 , this difference amounts, on
average, to 6 percent of GDP in the medium term, entailing a non-oil federal deficit as high as
11 percent of GDP (it is about 5 percent of GDP now). Another criterion would be to generate
a permanent stream of income by preserving the stock of wealth associated with oil and gas
resources, as in the case of Norway. This requires that a fraction of the oil wealth be saved and
turned into financial wealth, so as to keep total oil wealth constant, while oil resources are
exploited and the value of oil in the ground declines. Staff estimates that the sustainable nonoil deficit corresponding to this rule would amount, in the medium term, to about 10 percent of
GDP. However, this ceiling could be increased to the extent that government spending adds to
human or physical capital, in which case total wealth remains unchanged even as energy
wealth declines.

4

The sustainable non-oil balance defines what the government can afford to spend over the medium
(or long) term without exhausting its energy assets.

- 23 -

33.
Staff argued that monetary policy was too accommodative, pointing to rising
inflationary pressures, declining interest rates, and large capital outflows, among other
factors. It did not believe that seasonal price changes and limitations on administered price
increases would be sufficient to bring about the deceleration in headline inflation required to
meet the end-year target. In this regard, it warned against using a policy of reduced increases
in administered prices to bear down on inflation and noted that headline inflation had
exceeded the target in recent years even when administered price increases had been delayed.
34.
Staff advocated increased exchange rate flexibility. It was concerned that the endyear inflation target could be missed by a considerable margin without such flexibility. More
generally, staff urged the CBR to subordinate its exchange rate target to the inflation target,
by standing ready to scale back interventions whenever inflation exceeds the charted course.
In this regard, the pace of inflation reduction was less important than the need to firmly
signal that the inflation target would not give way to the exchange rate target. Staff worried
that the spill-over of unsterilized interventions into inflation was set to quicken as spare
capacity was being soaked up, and stressed that increased exchange rate flexibility could no
longer be delayed now that fiscal policy is being relaxed if inflationary risks are to be
contained. Staff also argued that making clear to markets that monetary policy would be
firmly focused on reducing inflation rather than on limiting ruble appreciation will in time
increase short-term exchange rate uncertainty, discouraging speculative capital flows.
35.
CBR officials saw only limited scope for more exchange rate flexibility.
Acknowledging that the large interventions were making it difficult to control the monetary
aggregates, they accepted that some additional appreciation of the ruble could become
necessary if headline inflation does not recede as expected during the second semester.
However, they were reluctant to subordinate exchange rate policy to the achievement of the
end-year target. Stressing that limiting real ruble appreciation remained an important political
objective, CBR officials explained that monetary policy would continue to pursue dual
targets.
C. Financial Sector Issues
36.
CBR officials acknowledged that the rapid changes in the banking system have
increased vulnerabilities, but stressed that the risks of a systemic crisis remain low. The
increasing competition and declining margins, not least due to the renewed access to foreign
capital markets, have forced banks into new activities. Consumer lending and mortgages are
picking up, as is lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. In this regard, CBR stress
tests indicate that credit risk has increased somewhat even while non-performing loan ratios
have stayed low. A shock comparable to the 1998 crisis would result in a loss of 2¾ percent
of GDP in 2004 compared to 2¼ percent a year earlier. Equity and interest rate risks have
also edged up, and liquidity ratios—while still high by international standards—have
declined, amplified by increasing maturity mismatches and a segmented interbank market.
However, stressing that banks are generally well capitalized and sufficiently provisioned, and
that profitability and asset quality are good on average, CBR officials were confident that a
systemic crisis was very unlikely, although turbulence as in 2004 could not be excluded.

- 24 -

37.
Officials were satisfied that supervision and the framework for dealing with
problem banks had improved. The process for admission into the deposit insurance scheme
had resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of banks and strengthened prudential
standards. They were determined to tighten standards further, including by addressing
shortcomings in connected lending limits and consolidated supervision. Further banking
consolidation was also an important objective, and CBR officials expected the next round of
consolidation to start in 2006 in preparation for the increase in the minimum capital
requirement for banks to EUR 5 million effective in 2007. As to the framework for
addressing bank difficulties, it was still lacking in important areas, but had improved
significantly since last year’s turmoil due the adoption of the new Bankruptcy Law for
Financial Institutions in 2004. This will speed up the bank liquidation process, mainly by
circumventing clogged-up courts and preventing liquidators from abusing their positions.
38.
Staff welcomed the improvements, but noted that key reforms are delayed and
that the favorable environment could be masking more serious vulnerabilities. It argued
the current macroeconomic environment was ideal for tackling problems in the banking
system, and expressed concern about the much delayed adoption of international accounting
standards, the failure to address long standing problems in the judicial system, not least
regarding creditor rights, and the continued absence of a strategic plan for what to do with
the still dominant state banks. Moreover, noting that banks accounting for 98 percent of total
deposits had been admitted to the new deposit insurance scheme, staff questioned whether
the admission process had entailed the hoped for break with the regulatory and supervisory
forbearance of the past. CBR officials were adamant that they had adhered to strong
prudential standards during the admission process and assured staff that their resolve in this
regard had not been weakened by the widespread criticism of the CBR’s handling of last
year’s turmoil. They intended to continue to strengthen supervision and felt that they had
strong political support. While agreeing with staff that there was much uncertainty, not least
due to inadequate accounting standards and more general problems of corporate governance,
they were confident that the banking system would prove to be robust even in the event of a
notable deterioration in the environment, especially much lower oil prices, and reiterated that
any problems that might arise would be manageable.
D. Structural Reforms
39.
The authorities acknowledged that reforms were generally running well behind
target. Some officials candidly attributed the delays to political complacency about reforms,
in part due to high oil prices, and were generally reserved about the prospects for a major
acceleration of the pace of reforms. Others argued that limited administrative capacities had
been more of a constraint than expected, and were confident that the pace would pick up as
the constraints were overcome.
40.
Officials stressed that progress had been made in several areas. This included the
railroad sector, where current operations had been separated from management of
infrastructure and private operators had been granted access; the electricity sector, which had
seen the separation of transmission and distribution networks from production activities and

- 25 -

the establishment of an internal wholesale market for electricity; and housing sectors, where
use of mortgages had been facilitated, among other changes. There was general agreement
that reform of Gazprom was at a standstill.
41.
The fierce resistance to social benefit reforms had come as a surprise and was
tempering the pace of further reforms in the social area. This was a main reason for
delays in health and education reforms. Key officials stressed that concerns about the social
impact of reforms were now clearly weighing more on policy makers and that reforms in this
area were not only going to be slower than foreseen last year, but also require more
budgetary resources than previously expected.
42.
The mission welcomed the removal of the exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices on current transactions identified in mid-2004. It urged the authorities
to avoid regulations and procedures of implementation of the 2004 Federal Law on Foreign
Exchange Regulation and Foreign Exchange Control that could lead to new restrictions. It
also encouraged the authorities to remove the deposit requirements on international payments
of commissions and expenses channeled through R2 special bank accounts as they give rise
to an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval (Appendix I).
43.
Russia’s trade regime remains somewhat restrictive, but WTO accession is
expected to further liberalize the system. As to the accession negotiations, agreements
have been reached with trading partners accounting for almost 85 percent of Russia’s
external trade. The authorities indicated that upon entry into the WTO the average import
tariff on industrial products will be reduced from 10¼ percent to 7 percent and that on
agricultural products from 21 percent to 20 percent. There are still outstanding differences,
however, pertaining mostly to Russia’s dual energy pricing, subsidies to agriculture and
aviation, quotas on meat and poultry, and inadequate protection of intellectual property
rights. Staff urged the authorities to work towards an early resolution of these differences
holding up Russia’s WTO accession.
44.
The process of establishing the Common Economic Space (CES) has recently
run into opposition. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed in 2003 to establish
the CES as a free trade area combined with an agreement to unify technical regulations and
standards affecting trade, and creating coordination mechanisms for the cooperation in
macroeconomic policies and economic legislation. However, Ukraine has reservations on the
ground that participation could interfere with its intentions to seek closer cooperation with
the EU and eventually EU accession. The delay in agreeing on the CES could increase the
role of the Euro-Asian Economic Community, established by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Russia’s robust growth to date owes much to how high oil prices have been
handled by good policies, most notably by the gradual escalation of the taxation and
saving of oil revenues. This policy has served Russia well in that it has prevented the

- 26 -

windfall from causing demand pressures that could have exacerbated inflationary pressures,
due to the still limited productive capacities in the non-tradable sectors.
46.
It is therefore a matter of concern that this policy is being relaxed just as
investment is slowing and resource constraints are emerging, as evident in part from
the upward pressures on inflation and the ruble. Allowing more of the oil windfall to
translate into higher demand at this juncture will only exacerbate such pressures and at best
elicit a temporary output response. Until recently, the Ministry of Finance has been relatively
successful in resisting calls for a relaxation of this policy. But decisions since the spring of
this year have amounted to a weakening of the fiscal position by some 3 percent of GDP,
entailing an increase in the oil price required to balance the budget by almost 10 dollars per
barrel. This points to an unfortunate weakening of political support for the current policy of
saving oil revenues.
47.
Staff believes that the surplus on a constant oil price basis should not be reduced
further in 2005 and 2006. While the relaxation already entailed by the amendment of the
2005 budget will increase inflationary pressures, staff agrees that such pressures are likely to
be manageable provided that the exchange rate policy becomes much more flexible, as
discussed below. A further relaxation of the non-oil balance should be postponed, however,
until inflation is on a clear downward path. In terms of the ongoing debate within Russia
about what to do with the oil revenue windfall, this implies that the benchmark price for the
stabilization fund should not be increased again, and that there should be no further use of the
resources of this fund, except for prepayment of debt. Higher revenues from oil sector taxes
not covered by the stabilization fund should also be saved.
48.
Russia’s oil wealth offers a unique opportunity for accelerated modernization if
harnessed in support of reforms, including tax reforms, and investments that promise
to raise potential GDP growth. Even conservative medium-term forecasts suggest that the
scope for fiscal relaxation, once cyclical pressures ease, is well above the projected
budgetary cost of the key reforms that still lie ahead. This presents an enviable opportunity to
move boldly forward, one unavailable to most other emerging economies. However, the
scope for spending more on structural reforms in the near term without wasting resources,
including by spending more on infrastructure projects, is limited due to the slowness of
reforms in recent years. In this regard, while there is ample room for raising low public sector
wages and pensions, and strengthening basic public services over the medium term, not least
those that could alleviate poverty, doing so at this juncture where civil service, health and
education reforms are stalled risks being wasteful. While there is a case for a measured
increase in infrastructure spending that does not compete with the private sector, the capacity
to do so at a more accelerated pace also appears to be constrained by administrative
capacities not least by the slow civil service and public administration reforms. Spending the
oil wealth in ways that do not augment the productive capacity of the economy will at best be
a missed opportunity; at worst, it could force a deep pro-cyclical tightening if a sharp drop in
oil prices exposes unsustainably high public consumption and social transfers. This points to
a need for an integrated medium-term fiscal and structural reform plan for how to spend
Russia’s oil wealth.

- 27 -

49.
Inflation is running above target and the CBR is unlikely to be able to set it on a
steady downward path without increased exchange rate flexibility. The pace of inflation
reduction is less important than clearly signaling that the CBR will give priority to its
inflation target, standing ready to scale back interventions and allow ruble appreciation
whenever inflation exceeds the targeted path. Recent years have demonstrated that the CBR
can only curtail real ruble appreciation temporarily as interventions are ultimately reflected in
higher inflation. With pass through to inflation set to quicken as resource constraints become
more binding, continuing to allow real exchange rate considerations to have a significant
bearing on monetary policy even as fiscal policy is being relaxed points to an increased
inconsistency in the macroeconomic policy mix. Real appreciation is unavoidable as the
terms of trade gain is increasingly being spent and continuing to resist such appreciation
would pose a risk to macroeconomic stability.
50.
Banking reforms are progressing, but concerns about regulatory forbearance
persist. The process of admitting banks to the new deposit insurance scheme appears to have
strengthened prudential standards. But the fact that banks accounting for more than
98 percent of deposits have been admitted gives rise to doubts at to whether regulatory
forbearance is now entirely a thing of the past. While staff agrees with the authorities that
systemic risks are low and manageable at this stage, the rapid rise in banks’ balance sheets
suggests that such risks could rise without supervisory vigilance. In the staff’s view, the
banking system remains an important vulnerability, not least in the event of a major drop in
oil prices.
51.
Most of the government’s other reform priorities are running much behind
schedule, with many at a stand still. A concern in this regard is that the opposition to the
social benefit reforms appears to have reduced the resolve to push ahead with key reforms in
the health and education sectors. Looking further back, only very limited progress has been
made since 2001–02 in areas where reforms are strongly opposed by vested interests,
suggesting that complacency due to high oil prices and attendant robust economic growth are
a main reason for the apparent lack of urgency about structural reforms. The recent
slowdown is a timely reminder that high growth can ultimately not be sustained even in an
environment of record high oil prices, without much faster progress on structural reforms.
The priorities should be to advance reforms that promise to bolster the investment climate,
not least civil service and public service administration reforms, and reforms of the natural
monopolies.
52.
The Yukos affair has, rightly or wrongly, raised the specter of interventionism
and increased heavy-handedness by regulatory and law enforcement agencies. Despite
much welcomed attempts by senior officials to reassure investors, concerns about the ability
to control Russia’s pervasive bureaucracy linger. A determined acceleration of structural
reforms is in the staff’s view critical to overcoming such concerns and repairing the damaged
investment climate.
53.
Russia’s economic and financial statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. However, frequent revisions have raised concerns about data accuracy,

- 28 -

particularly in the real sector. Among other issues, the components of the CPI and PPI are not
readily available, and the weights are not disclosed, rendering the analysis difficult.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle

1/ Gross debt of the general government.
2/ changes in debt stock deriving from changes in interest rates, inflation, GDP growth, exchange rate. These changes are not due to fiscal policy
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Primary surplus which stabilizes the debt for the current real GDP growth and interest rates
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
9/ The oil shock also includes a contraction of GDP by 2 percent in 2005 with a moderate growth of 3 percent in the following years, a devaluation by 30 percent in 2005,
and a one-time increase in debt-generating expenditure equivalent to 5 percent of GDP in 2005

VII. Exchange Arrangements: Managed float. The exchange rate of the ruble is
determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, which was unified on June
29, 1999. The interbank market electronically links exchanges across the country.
The official rate of the ruble is set equal to the previous day's weighted average
rate in the interbank market.
The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996. In 2004, a new
Federal Law on Foreign Exchange Regulation and Foreign Exchange Control
(No. 173-FZ), as well as the implementing regulations of the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR) and the government came into effect. These effectively eliminated a
number of exchange restrictions introduced by the authorities after the 1998
Russian crisis: a) conversion operations through nonresidents’ S accounts; b)
repatriation restrictions on ruble balances of nonresidents not participating in the
GKO/OFZ novation; c) restrictions on advance import payments; d) restrictions on
nonresidents’ N-accounts; and e) use of a more depreciated exchange rate for
repatriation of S-account balances. At the same time, the passage of the new law

- 40 -

APPENDIX I

and its implementing regulations gave rise to a new exchange restriction subject to
the approval of the Fund: the requirement by residents to use a special bank
account “R2” to conduct transactions relating to external securities and to comply
with an unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) in rubles equivalent to
25 percent of the amount of a transaction for 15 calendar days. These rules apply to
resident payments of commissions and expenses to a nonresident third party for the
handling or acquisition of these external securities.
VIII.

Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
The last consultation was concluded on September 1, 2004.

IX. FSAP Participation and ROSCs
Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program during 2002, and
the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in May 2003, at the time of the 2003
Article IV discussion (IMF Country Report No. 03/147). An MFD TA mission on
key monetary, banking, and related issues took place in April 2004. In addition, a
long-term advisor on banking supervision will be in Moscow until October 2006.
A Fiscal Transparency ROSC mission, headed by Peter Heller (FAD), visited
Moscow in July 2003, and a new Data ROSC module was undertaken by a
mission in October 2003, led by Armida San Jose (STA).

APPENDIX II

RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
1.
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Bank’s Board in
June 2002, and the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) was approved in April 2005. Overall, the
Bank strategy envisages continued emphasis on support to implementation of structural
reforms at the federal and sub-national levels. In particular, the current CAS emphasizes the
need to (1) improve the business environment in order to encourage new firm growth;
(2) strengthen public sector management (including civil service reform, intergovernmental
finance reform and support of judicial reforms); and (3) safeguard against the social and
environmental risks of transition. The CASPR further emphasizes four areas for collaboration
with Russia for the remainder of the CAS period (through mid-2006) and for a subsequent
Country Partnership Strategy: (1) design and implementation of complex federal-level
institutional reforms, (2) regional development, (3) the establishment of an efficient
framework for developing private-public partnerships, and (4) Russia’s integration into the
G-8 framework. The World Bank Group (WBG)’s work in each of these areas is described in
more detail below.
Contribution to progress on CAS strategic pillars
Improving the business environment and enhancing competition
2.
Bank support for improving the business environment has taken several forms,
touching on the enabling environment for the private sector and supporting infrastructure. In
particular:
•

A Bank-supported survey (run by the Center for Economic and Financial Research, or
CEFIR) has been informing the investment community of improvements in the
investment climate due to implementation of the “de-bureaucratization” package.
Investment climate diagnostics in ten Russian regions, coordinated by the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service of the Bank and IFC, have helped to develop regional
strategies for improving the business climate. The Bank flagship analytical product—
Russia Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 2004 From Transition to
Development—was devoted to the analysis of constraints to the development of the
competitive environment in Russia. Russian Economic Reports, which have been issued
regularly by the Bank, provide an independent assessment of economic and social
developments in Russia, including reviews of the government’s reform effort. These
reports have attracted significant attention from key media as well as investors.

•

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided guarantees that aim
at increasing foreign investment and industrial restructuring. It has also continued to
work with several Russian regions on the development of investment promotion
programs. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has continued its strategic
presence in several sectors, most importantly manufacturing, infrastructure, and the
financial sector.

- 42 -

•

APPENDIX II

As a result of the Land Reform Implementation Support (LARIS) project, some 14
percent of all the districts (rayons) in Russia were supplied with automated land
registration systems and about 90 percent of all land in those districts is now inventoried
for purposes of the state cadastre. Over 60 percent of all cadastre enterprises were
supplied with modern digital equipment.

Strengthening public sector management
3.
The Bank has significantly contributed to the government’s effort to strengthen public
sector management in several areas:
•

Administrative and budget reform: The Bank is working closely with the government on
administrative and civil service reforms. In 2004, the Bank provided technical assistance
on the design of a performance-based budgeting system. The Bank has also worked to
improve monitoring and analytical capacity in the public sector, including a multi-year
project on Improving Measurement, Monitoring, and Analysis of Poverty.

•

Tax, treasury and customs: there are three projects under implementation that assist the
government in the development and upgrade of its administrative, methodological and
human capacity to deliver core government functions: collecting taxes and duties, and
managing budgetary flows through the federal treasury. The Tax Modernization loan is
helping the authorities to launch a country-wide modernization effort. The Customs
Development loan pilots ways to accelerate customs clearance—and hence improve trade
facilitation by customs—while improving the efficiency of collecting fiscal revenues.
The Treasury Development loan assists the government in increasing the efficiency of
processing budget flows, and improving financial control over them.

•

Fiscal federalism: jointly with the ministry of finance, the Bank has developed and
piloted an effective federal-level fiscal instrument for supporting economic, budgetary
and fiscal improvements at the regional level. Under the Fiscal Federalism and Regional
Fiscal Reform loan, the Regional Fiscal Reform Fund provided incentive-based fiscal
grants to 15 participating regions that have implemented broad-ranging reforms of their
fiscal and asset management, and budget execution, and have adopted more transparent
regulations for equalizing transfers and tax sharing.

•

Public service delivery at the local level: the Bank has been a major provider of
financing for investment in local services. The Municipal Water and Heating Systems
loans aim to significantly increase the efficiency of communal services delivery in
participating regions, upgrade infrastructure, and alleviate the financial burden on
municipalities. The completed Community Social Infrastructure Project developed and
tested a model of the regional social infrastructure development fund.

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

Mitigating social and environmental risks
4.
During the CAS period, the Bank has been involved in various aspects of social
policy development and implementation at the federal and regional levels:
•

Health care: Bank support to government reform in the health sector has two main
objectives: (i) helping Russia establish a health care system that is accessible, affordable,
and efficient; and (ii) strengthening the public policy response to premature mortality and
the risks of HIV/AIDS. Through the Health Reform Implementation loan, the Bank is
assisting the government to design and pilot methods of health sector restructuring, new
financing mechanisms, and medical protocols. The Bank is supporting the government’s
implementation of its Strategy on the Prevention and Control of Social Diseases. A
US$150 million project is enhancing the country’s capacity to prevent the spread of
HIV/AIDS.

•

Education: in the education sector, the Bank has successfully supported (i) reform of
university level social science education, (ii) development of secondary school textbook
provision (Education Innovation Project), and (iii) development and piloting of regional
models for secondary education upgrade (Education Reform Project). The education
reforms supported by the Bank have led to the introduction of a single entrance exam for
all institutes of higher education in 16 regions and have helped universities introduce
better governance systems and increase efficiency in the use of resources. The pioneering
E-learning in Schools project is ensuring better access to quality education for students in
several remote destinations.

•

Strengthening the social protection system: the Bank is concentrating on the design of
upgraded social assistance and on reforms of social service provision for vulnerable
groups (the poor, children at risk, residents of the North). The Bank completed an
analysis of the labor market and child welfare policies at the regional level. The Northern
Restructuring Pilot Project is providing support in an efficient and affordable manner for
migration from the North.

•

Environment: until a few years ago, Russia was one of the world’s largest producers of
ozone depleting substances. This is no longer the case thanks to the Bank-funded
program and the Global Environmental Facility administered by the Bank. The
Sustainable Forestry project has supported drafting of the new Forestry Code, increasing
efficiency of the forest management institutions, and revising the forest lease policies.

Government current priorities and CASPR focus areas
5.
Russia’s strong fiscal position and access to financial markets limit the need for
sovereign borrowing, while at the same time the country still faces major tasks on many
fronts. Some, like housing and communal reform, are related to an unfinished transition,
while others, like public-private partnerships, aim at creating new drivers for economic
diversification and growth. Progress in transformation across a vast country is

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

understandably uneven, and attention must be focused on the growing gap between
prosperous and lagging regions. Capacity and financial constraints slow down local
implementation of well-designed reforms. Tackling these constraints on a large scale requires
all the resources Russia can mobilize domestically and internationally.
6.
Russia is interested in defining a partnership with the World Bank that would respond
to the country’s strengths and remaining challenges. This would follow the path of the
Bank’s involvement in other middle-income countries. Consultations in the course of
preparation of the CASPR have indicated that the government remains committed to
collaborating with the Bank as a source of development knowledge and project
implementation capacity. At the same time, the Russian authorities express strong preference
for a more flexible arrangement that would allow them to tap Bank skills through a wide
menu of instruments and services. The government’s priorities for further collaboration with
the WBG are discussed below.
Design and implementation of complex federal-level institutional reforms
7.
At the federal level, demand for the Bank’s assistance is now limited to high
complexity areas where there is a benefit from the Bank providing an efficient framework for
tapping international experience, and, even more importantly, efficient project
implementation mechanisms. One of possible options is that the Bank would provide only the
start-up and pilot financing and would help to set up project implementation mechanisms for
Federal Targeted Programs. Scaling up such projects would become the government’s
responsibility. Such a project framework may significantly increase the efficiency of
government spending on investment and structural reforms, if relatively large volumes of
government co-financing would leverage the Bank funds.
Regional development
8.
At the sub-national level, the development agenda is huge, and demand by local
authorities for stable project financing and project management expertise is far from being
saturated even in the most prosperous of regions. Work at this level will concentrate on a
small number of regions agreed with the government and be supported by a three-pronged
approach in order to address the diverse economic, social and human development needs of
Russia’s regions:
•

Well-performing and creditworthy regions may benefit from lending without sovereign
guarantees currently available through the IFC municipal development facility (demand
for such lending is significant, and Russia is interested in the WBG developing further
the instruments required for an increased regional involvement).

•

For those regions that are making progress, but are not at the cutting edge of reforms, the
Bank will continue to support programs that use a competitive model for accessing funds,
and will provide technical assistance and—if necessary—project finance to support this
approach.

- 45 -

•

APPENDIX II

For the poorer and less advanced in terms of reforms regions, support for efficient and
effective design and implementation of federal targeted programs will remain the main
instrument. In all three types of regions, subnational-level projects will become a tool for
strengthening implementation of national reform efforts, and improving local
restructuring capacity.

Establishing efficient framework for developing private-public partnerships
9.
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) represent a new dimension in the government’s
efforts to improve competitiveness and achieve a range of public policy goals. The WBG will
assist the government in designing and implementing programs to facilitate emergence of
public-private partnerships, including the necessary legal and regulatory structures. These
partnerships would help improve efficiency in targeted sectors, tap many sources of finance,
and provide better service to consumers. Infrastructure projects (transport and the housing
and communal sector) will initially be the primary focus. Yet the Bank will also put effort
into providing assistance to formation of PPPs in other key sectors, e.g., in education,
healthcare, science and technology. Given an apparent regional dimension of PPPs
formation. Support by the WBG will include advisory services, the use of guarantees and
project finance.
Russia’s integration into the G-8 framework
10.
Ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol, approaching accession to WTO, and
Russia’s upcoming chairmanship at G-8 present opportunities for the use of Bank technical
expertise and development experience. The mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol offer
Russia unique opportunities to upgrade its energy infrastructure. The Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and carbon finance instruments and advisory services will present the key
avenues for engagement. With regard to WTO accession, the Bank will continue analytical
work and technical assistance to facilitate knowledge creation on accession opportunities and
costs, in particular in the Russian regions. The Bank will also provide analytical support on
global development issues for Russia’s chairmanship of the G-8, in line with previous
experience with other G-8 countries.
11.
In terms of operational modalities, discussions with the government indicate strong
interest in more flexible access to a broad menu of Bank instruments (AAA, TA, lending,
guarantees). The Bank-supported projects are to be fully integrated into the Russian
Federation budget, including its Federal Targeted Programs, with a three to five year
planning horizon to better support the government’s mid-term development programs. The
government is interested in flexible co-financing arrangements that would minimize
sovereign borrowing. More specifically, the government is already moving to increase its
share of financing (up to 80 percent, and, possibly, even more) under some of the on-going
and future projects, and expresses strong interest in the development by the Bank of a facility
for sub-national lending without a sovereign guarantee. Other instruments of significant
interest include investment loans with contingent disbursements, partial credit risk
guarantees, and fee-for-service work with no borrowing requirements.

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

Russian Federation: Statistical Issues
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes. Russia has a reasonably comprehensive and timely statistical
database, but difficulties remain in terms of data accuracy and frequent data revisions. State
and private enterprise activities are measured through forms sent to firms included in
enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly replacing full-count collections. The
authorities are generally cooperative in reporting data to the Fund, mainly through the
resident representative office, and during missions. Data are provided on a timely basis,
albeit with a few exceptions. Russia produces a wide range of regular, timely publications on
financial and economic statistics. The authorities report data for the Fund’s International
Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade
Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
2.
A draft ROSC module on data dissemination practices was prepared in 1999–2000,
but never published. A new ROSC data module was prepared in October 2003 and the
authorities approved the publication of the report on the IMF website on April 25, 2004,
which was posted in May 2004.
3.
On January 31, 2005, the Russian Federation became the 60th subscriber to the
SDDS, marking a major step forward in the development of the country's statistical system.
However, data on central government operations have not been updated since the Russian
Federation subscribed to the SDDS and their National Summary Data Page (NSDP) is
currently disseminating data only for the reference periods of October and November 2004.
4.
The Russian Federation is redisseminating historic data on the reserves template on
the following IMF webpage: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm, and historic
data on its external debt on the following World Bank webpage:
http://www.worldbank.org/data/working/QEDS/sdds_countrydata.html.
National accounts
5.
The State Statistics Committee (Goskomstat) compiles and publishes quarterly and
annual national accounts data on a timely basis, using the 1993 System of National Accounts.
Source data are obtained from surveys of businesses and households, including financial
surveys of businesses and employment surveys of households, and are supplemented by
administrative data. There has been much effort to improve coverage, but further progress is
needed in covering small and medium enterprises. The estimates of gross domestic product
(GDP) are compiled by type of economic activity and expenditure category; however, the
estimates by type of activity are considered more accurate. The statistical discrepancy
between the production and expenditure approaches is generally no more than 2 percent,
which is acceptable by international standards. The data are also presented by income
category. Estimates of the financial account by institutional sector are not compiled although
these estimates are needed.

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

6.
The delay in finalizing a modern statistics law⎯requiring firms to provide data and
with realistic penalties for noncompliance, together with a guarantee of confidentiality⎯is an
impediment to further improvement of national accounts data.
7.
The authorities do not publish separate data on export and import volumes. Revisions
to the data are not flagged when the data are disseminated. As a result, it is difficult for users,
including the Fund, to maintain any form of consistent time series.
Prices
8.
Goskomstat compiles a good quality national consumer price index (CPI), developed
with Fund technical assistance. Since January 2003, as a result of achieving moderate
inflation in the recent years, Goskomstat has stopped the weekly publication of headline
inflation and continued only with monthly reports; in addition, Goskomstat has started the
publication of monthly core inflation data. Further improvements could be made on the basis
of a new household budget survey—which has been under consideration for some time—and
by the current efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the index. World Bank
and TACIS assistance is available in these areas. Goskomstat also publishes a producer price
index. The State Customs Committee has initiated the development of foreign trade price
indexes.
9.
Since November 2003, the monthly CPI and PPI are presented in two formats: (i) as
an index using annual average prices for 1995 as the reference (1995=100) and (ii) as a
percentage of a previous month (the previous month and the same month in the previous
year). However, data on the basic components of the CPI and PPI are not readily available in
time series format, and the weights of the CPI and PPI components are not disclosed,
rendering time series analysis difficult.
Government finance statistics data
10.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the federal and local governments and quarterly information on revenues,
expenditures, and financing of extrabudgetary funds. The published functional
classification of expenditure differs slightly from international standards. Expenditure data,
classified by economic type, need improvement. Presently, they are compiled with a long
delay on an annual basis, with a publication lag of one year. Data on domestic and external
federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made public only in summary form on an annual
basis; in addition, there is no unified debt monitoring and reporting system. In the context of
a work program for statistical improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing
improvements in the coverage and quality of GFS data, although expenditure data remain
poor. The reform of budgetary accounting is well advanced. Its objectives include the
introduction of accrual accounting for the whole of government. The latest data provided for
publication in the GFS Yearbook for 2002 were reported on an accrual basis, in accordance
with the methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The Treasury has

- 48 -

APPENDIX III

been reporting aggregate government finance data for publication in IFS on a cash basis since
April 1996.
Monetary statistics
11.
Monetary data are reasonably comprehensive and generally in accordance with
international standards. The data ROSC mission in 2003 identified the following
methodological issues: (1) the scope of monetary statistics did not include financial
institutions issuing deposit substitutes, such as mutual funds and financial companies, and
credit institutions in the process of liquidation; (2) classification and sectorization were in
line with the methodological guidelines, except that securities repurchase operations of credit
institutions with nonresidents (currently at insignificant levels) were not treated as
collateralized loans, and financial derivatives (which are at an initial stage of development in
Russia) were not included in the instrument classification; and (3) the basis of recording
broadly followed methodological recommendations, except that monetary gold and securities
for investment purposes were not valued at current market prices. In addition, accrued
interest was not included in the underlying instrument. Following the data ROSC, the
authorities included all unoperational credit institutions in the coverage of the monetary
statistics and reclassified their deposits as restricted deposits. The Central Bank of Russia
(CBR) intends to revise further its compilation procedures to conform fully with the
guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
12.
Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported
for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available.
13.
In October 2004, STA requested the CBR to carry out a pilot compilation of
monetary data using new Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). This project has not been
concluded yet by the CBR.
External sector statistics
14.
The balance of payments is compiled on the basis of the fifth edition of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). In cooperation with the Fund, significant progress has
been made with regard to balance of payments statistics. More detailed data have been
published and new data sources have been developed. Though significant improvements have
been made to enhance the quality of balance of payments statistics, there remains room to
improve the coverage of certain components of the current and the capital and financial
account. In particular, there is scope to improve the detail of data available to the public
especially on the financial account to analyze the relatively complex flows.
15.
The State Customs Committee needs to substantially improve the coverage and
valuation of exports and imports. Merchandise imports data published by the State Customs
Service are subject to large adjustments for under recording, especially for “shuttle trade” by
individuals, smuggling, and undervaluation. Large, persistent differences between partner
country and customs data on imports remain, although statistical agencies are seeking to
reconcile the data with those of partner countries. The CBR has developed a methodology for

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

calculating components of export and import transactions unrecorded by the customs
authorities. Goskomstat needs to improve the coverage and quality of surveys on direct
investment, and trade in services including travel. The CBR has moved toward direct data
collection to address these limitations.
16.
Russia is disseminating the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity. However, published historic series on reserves have not been corrected for
changes in definitions. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on
a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional detail on reserves
and reserve liabilities through the central bank balance sheet, but this is not as comprehensive
as the reserve template, which is disseminated with a lag of twenty days.
17.
Quarterly external debt data are now published by sector, maturity, instrument, and
currency, with a lag of one quarter as prescribed by the SDDS. Moreover, while
improvements have been made, there are a number of gaps in data, notably the lack of a debt
service schedule. For surveillance purposes, information on gross external payments, for
example, for the banking system, is needed for monitoring liquidity risk. There is also a need
to monitor corporate sector off-balance sheet obligations and more generally, information on
interest and exchange rate exposure of the sector.
18.
The CBR has commenced publishing an annual international investment position for
all sectors with data starting in 2001. The international investment position for the banking
sector is now available on a quarterly basis.

As of August 3, 2005

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 7, 2005
The following information on fiscal developments, which has become available since the
release of the staff report, does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Since the issuance of the staff report, the Russian authorities have formulated a
second supplementary 2005 budget, which will be submitted to the Duma later this year, and
have submitted a draft 2006 budget to the Duma. The discussion in the staff report reflects
only the first supplementary 2005 budget and key assumptions for 2006 are different from
those of the draft budget. The following summarizes the main changes and their implications,
based on a preliminary assessment of the information available as of last week.
2.
The oil price assumptions for both 2005 and 2006 have been revised upward resulting
in higher revenue projections and hence larger headline fiscal surpluses (see Table 1).
However, spending plans have also been increased in light of the higher revenues, thereby
increasing the deficit on the basis of a constant oil price in both years. As a result, the oil
price at which the overall budget would balance has increased to almost $29 per barrel in
2005 and almost $34 per barrel in 2006 (to be compared with the $27 and $31, respectively,
shown in the staff report).
3.
Staff estimates that the second supplementary budget for 2005 entails an additional
fiscal impulse (excluding the oil sector) of about ½ percent of GDP (see Table 2).
4.
The revisions do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal, notably the staff’s
concern that the policy for taxing and saving oil revenues should not be relaxed at this
juncture when supply constraints are emerging and upward pressures on inflation and the
ruble are already intensifying.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 21, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Russian Federation
On September 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
Russia is in its seventh year of robust economic growth. This strong performance was ignited by
the sharp depreciation in the wake of the 1998 crisis, and subsequently sustained by large
terms-of-trade gains, in combination with increased political and macroeconomic stability.
Higher output and investment in the oil sector have been key conduits of the broad based
recovery, which is still running its course.
While still vibrant, the economy has softened notably since mid-2004, despite record high oil
prices. Yearly GDP growth decelerated from 7½ percent in the first half of 2004 to 5½ percent in
the same period this year, mainly owing to lower growth in oil production and investments.
Consumption has remained buoyant and has been the main source of domestic demand
growth, fueled by continued rapid increases in real wages.
The softening mainly reflects a confluence of policy induced supply disruptions and jolts to the
investment climate. The Yukos affair has triggered serious concerns about state interventionism
and the government’s commitment to reinvigorate flagging structural reforms. The sharp rise in
oil taxation since the middle of last year might also have taken a toll on oil output and
investments, although profitability in the oil sector has remained high amid rising oil prices.
The softening is also likely to have been due to the gradual tightening of resource constraints
that has been evident for a number of years, not least in the oil sector and in labor markets in
high-growth areas. Reflecting such resource constraints, the acceleration in domestic demand
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2growth in 2004 as a whole spilled over into much higher imports, but left GDP growth
unchanged compared to 2003.
Fiscal policy has offset much of the stimulus arising from the large terms of trade shock.
The headline surplus of the general government has increased every year since 2001 as the
government has taxed and saved much of the rapidly increasing oil revenues. Under the current
oil price outlook, staff projects that the budget will entail an overall surplus of 7½ percent of GDP
in 2005, up from 5 percent of GDP in 2004, and 6½ percent of GDP in 2006.
However, the underlying fiscal stance is being relaxed, until recently gradually, and now more
rapidly. The fiscal surplus on a constant oil price basis has been declining, except in 2004, as
the government has gradually increased spending of oil revenues. This relaxation has taken
place at a time of tightening resource constraints and buoyant overall demand and has therefore
contributed to inflationary pressures and a faster pace of real ruble appreciation. Still, the
relaxation was measured until recently, but is set to quicken significantly following the
amendment of the 2005 budget. Preliminary plans for 2006 entail a further relaxation.
The relaxation has required an increase in the benchmark price below which oil revenues are
not saved in the stabilization fund from US$20 per barrel to US$27 per barrel.
Monetary policy remains relatively lax. While reserve money growth has slowed somewhat since
mid-2004, mainly because of an accelerated build-up of government deposits with the Central
Bank of Russia, it remains high, as do the increases in broader aggregates. Rising inflation,
declining interest rates, and large capital outflows point to a continued accommodative stance.
The economy is expected to continue to grow robustly, although not at the pace seen before
last year’s slowdown. Staff projects GDP growth of 5½ percent in 2005, fuelled by consumption.
Both exports and investment are expected to remain subdued compared to previous years, high
oil prices notwithstanding, as concerns about the investment climate linger and supply
constraints in the oil sector are unlikely to ease in the near future. Inflation, which was already
running at an annual rate of 7¾ percent in the first half of 2005, is likely to exceed the official
target again this year. External vulnerability has been greatly reduced since the 1998 crisis
owing to a very favorable balance of payments position and large foreign reserves of more than
3½ times short term debt.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the strong performance of the Russian economy in recent years, which
has been due not only to high oil prices, but also to a generally prudent fiscal policy stance.
Under the current outlook for oil prices, Directors expected economic growth to remain robust
and external vulnerabilities low over the near term. Directors saw the strong fundamentals as
creating a window of opportunity to propel forward the structural reform agenda, which is
lagging behind in key areas.
Directors considered that the policy of gradually escalating the taxation and saving of oil
revenues as oil prices have surged has served Russia well, by preventing over-heating in the
face of limited productive capacities in the non-tradable sectors. At the same time, a number of
Directors recognized the growing pressures to relax the fiscal stance against the background of
the country’s social and infrastructure development needs and large oil revenue inflows.
Nevertheless, noting emerging capacity constraints in some sectors, Directors were generally

-3concerned that the recent significant and pro-cyclical relaxation of fiscal policy, with
amendments to the 2005 budget and plans for 2006 that would weaken the non-oil fiscal
balance, would exacerbate already-rising inflationary pressures and quicken the pace of real
ruble appreciation.
Directors therefore strongly advised that fiscal policy not be loosened further. To that end, the
benchmark price above which oil revenues are saved in the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) should
not be increased again; the use of the OSF should continue to be limited to the prepayment of
debt; and additional higher-than-budgeted revenues from oil should be saved. Directors also
pointed to the risks associated with increasing spending while key reforms are lagging. While
they acknowledged the need to raise public sector wages and pensions, bolster infrastructure
investment, and strengthen poverty-alleviating public services, they were concerned that the
necessary reforms to modernize and rationalize related social and public administration
infrastructure to ensure spending efficiency in these areas were not yet in place. Directors also
cautioned that steadily increasing recurrent expenditures that do not raise potential growth rates
could worsen the risk of having to undertake a sharp pro-cyclical fiscal tightening in the event of
a large drop in oil prices.
Directors recognized that, over the medium term, and once cyclical pressures ease, there will
be scope for fiscal relaxation, even over and above the expected budgetary cost of the needed
structural reforms. They observed that Russia’s oil wealth, if utilized to underpin reforms that
raise potential growth rates, including tax reforms, can lay the basis for accelerating the
modernization of the economy. More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to develop
an integrated medium-term fiscal and structural reform plan for utilizing Russia’s oil resources.
Regarding monetary and exchange rate policies, most Directors considered the practice of
targeting both inflation and the exchange rate to be unsustainable, and called on the Central
Bank of Russia to clearly signal to markets that the inflation target takes precedence over other
objectives. They urged the CBR to allow the ruble to appreciate if inflation runs above the
targeted path. In that vein, most Directors expressed concern that continuing to let real
exchange rate concerns bear on monetary policy, even as fiscal policy is being relaxed, will
impart an inflationary bias into the macroeconomic policy mix.
Directors were encouraged by the progress made in banking sector reforms. Systemic risks are
low and appear manageable, and the process of determining the eligibility of banks for the new
deposit insurance scheme appears to have strengthened prudential standards. However, many
Directors were concerned with the consequences of continuing regulatory forbearance; in this
regard, they noted that in some cases, the standards for admitting banks to the insurance
scheme may have been interpreted too leniently. Directors cautioned that, without supervisory
vigilance, the rapid increase in banks’ balance sheets could raise systemic risks, particularly in
the event of a major drop in oil prices.
Directors were concerned that, with ample oil revenues, complacency has set in and key
structural reforms have come to a virtual halt. They saw the recent weakening in investments
and slowdown in economic growth even as oil prices have surged as a sign that high growth
may be difficult to sustain over the medium term without a more determined effort to accelerate
reforms. In this regard, priority should be given to reforms that could bolster the investment
climate, nurture new private enterprises, and promote economic diversification, especially civil
service and public administration reforms.

-4Directors observed that the Yukos affair had given rise to concerns about state intervention and
heavy-handedness on the part of regulatory and law enforcement agencies. They welcomed
attempts by senior officials to reassure investors, but noted that concerns in this regard are
likely to linger as long as reforms lag.
Directors welcomed the removal of the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices on
current transactions that had been identified previously. However, they urged the authorities to
remove quickly the new restrictions that have resulted from implementing regulations
accompanying the new Federal Law on Foreign Exchange Regulation and Foreign Exchange
Control.
Directors welcomed Russia’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard in
January 2005. They noted that Russia’s economic and financial statistics are broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes, but expressed some concern about data accuracy and the frequency
of data revisions.
Directors welcomed the prepayment of all of Russia’s outstanding financial obligations to the
Fund, and its participation in the Fund’s financial transactions plan.
