MONGOLIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation, Third Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement, and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department in Consultation with Other Departments
Approved by Nigel Chalk and Dhaneshwar Ghura
December 7, 2009
Stand-By Arrangement. An 18-month Stand-By Arrangement in the amount of
SDR 153.3 million (300 percent of quota) was approved by the Board on April 1, 2009.
The second review was approved by the Board on September 21, 2009. All endSeptember performance criteria for the third review were met.
Executive Summary. The global economic crisis and collapse in copper prices last
year hit the Mongolian economy hard. The loose macro-policies pursued during the
preceding boom years had made the economy particularly vulnerable and the situation
deteriorated markedly earlier this year. International reserves were being depleted,
there were insufficient funds to finance the 2009 budget, and the fourth largest bank
had to be intervened. Since then, the authorities’ strong policy implementation under
the Fund-supported program has helped to quickly stabilize the economy. Though
growth is likely to be slightly negative this year, the outlook for 2010 is favorable as
the economy is projected to rebound sharply driven by development of the mineral
sector. Looking forward, Mongolia stands to benefit enormously from its vast mineral
deposits. Maximizing these benefits will require a continued commitment to fiscal
discipline, a flexible exchange rate, and a sound banking system. Staying the course
with such policies will help ensure that Mongolia’s considerable mineral wealth is
transformed into lower poverty, rising household income, and a steadily improving
standard of living for all of Mongolia’s citizens.
Past Advice. The 2008 Article IV Consultation was concluded on June 4, 2008.
Executive Directors recommended tightening monetary and fiscal policies to address
the risk of economic overheating and developing a medium-term fiscal framework to
limit pro-cyclicality and ensure debt sustainability.
Discussions. A staff team visited Ulaanbaatar, October 28–November 10, 2009
consisting of S. Barnett (Head), J. Bersch, T. Feridhanusetyawan (APD), J. Hartley
(SPR), J. Gottschalk (FAD), I. W. Song (MCM), and P. Ramlogan (Resident
Representative). Mr. Na (OED) participated in the discussions.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Context. Mongolia was hit hard by the global financial crisis and the collapse in
copper prices last year. The pro-cyclical macro-policies pursued during the preceding boom
years made the economy particularly vulnerable. Indeed, other copper producers faired better
in many respects (Box 1). By early 2009, the balance of payments position had become
critical, and the authorities devised an ambitious adjustment program, supported by Fund
resources. Since then, the economy has stabilized, a product of the authorities’ strong policy
implementation and a rebound in international copper prices.
2.
Growth and inflation. Real growth averaged 9 percent during 2004–08, but is
expected to be slightly negative this year as a result of the global crisis and the necessary
tightening of policies. Nevertheless, the economy is now bottoming out and, driven by
investment in the newly signed Oyu Tolgoi mining project, should recover strongly next year
(Figure 1). Inflation peaked at over 30 percent last year but has declined sharply in recent
months and should settle at around 6 percent by end-2010.
3.
Politics. Presidential elections this summer proceeded smoothly and Mr. Tsakhia
Elbegdorj of the Democratic Party, the junior member of the governing coalition, defeated
the incumbent. In late October, Prime Minister Bayar submitted his resignation due to ill
health and Mr. S. Batbold was elected Prime Minister. The coalition government that has
ruled since 2008 is widely credited with creating the political consensus necessary to bring
the protracted negotiations on the Oyu Tolgoi mine project to a conclusion. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for 2012.
4.
Macro-policies. Prior to this year, a pro-cyclical fiscal policy, tightly managed
exchange rate, and passive monetary policy led to overheating, inflation, a credit boom, and,
ultimately, significant balance of payments pressures earlier this year (Box 2). The legacy of
these policies is still being felt. On the fiscal front, many of the initiatives of the past few
years—including a cut in the VAT rate, lowering of social security contributions, the
introduction of untargeted universal transfers, and civil service wage increases—permanently
increased the deficit. In the financial sector, the rapid credit growth during 2006–08 has led
to a worsening of credit quality leaving the banking system undercapitalized and with weak
balance sheets.
5.
External sector. The trade balance has been volatile, reflecting significant terms of
trade shocks. The current account improved significantly this year, primarily through a
slowdown in imports, but is set to worsen next year as a result of a surge in imports
associated with the development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine. In the coming years, the current
account deficits will be largely financed by FDI inflows and private loans. Large current
account surpluses are expected after production at Oyu Tolgoi starts in 2013.

Box 1. Comparison of Selected Copper Producing Countries1
Macro-economic management in resource-dependent economies is challenging. Export earnings
and fiscal revenue are subject to large fluctuations driven by swings in global resource prices. For
Mongolia, copper is a key export and the collapse in its price last year was the trigger for
Mongolia’s economic troubles. However, not all copper producers were hit equally hard by the
global economic downturn.

was absorbed by the nominal
exchange rate instead of inflation. For example, the real appreciation in Mongolia and Chile was
virtually the same, but inflation in Chile was much lower. This highlights the importance of
exchange rate flexibility in such resource-dependent economies that face volatile international
prices.
After copper prices fell, the contraction in Mongolia was much larger than in other economies.
Real GDP growth, which had been among the highest in Mongolia, fell precipitously. Only Peru
had a similar decline.
Part of the reason that output volatility in Mongolia was so large is related to the highly
procyclical government spending in Mongolia. For other copper producers, real government
spending picked up following the decline in copper prices, providing counter-cyclical support for
the economy. In direct contrast, Mongolia was forced to contract spending sharply to reduce its
fiscal deficit to a level that was consistent with available financing. Given the rapid expansion of
spending in 2007–08, this subsequent fiscal contraction was unavoidable but contributed to the
sharper slowdown in growth experienced in 2008 and during the course of this year.

Box 2. The Recent Boom-Bust Cycle From a Macro-Policy Perspective

Initially, the surge in mineral revenue led
only to a gradual increase in spending and
absorption. In 2006, very little of these
resources were spent, bringing about sizeable
improvements in the fiscal and current account
balances relative to 2005. In 2007, fiscal policy
fully spent the additional resources and the
fiscal balance returned to its 2005 level. This
set the stage for a large economic boom. While
initially monetary policy was relatively tight,
monetary conditions loosened considerably in
the latter half of the year as evidenced by fast
money and credit growth. This led to a sharp
rise in inflation, real exchange rate
appreciation, and a rapid increase in imports.

The spend-and-absorb approach provides a useful analytical framework for assessing Mongolia’s
macroeconomic policies during the recent copper price boom-bust cycle.1 This approach looks at how
monetary and fiscal policies determine the

The boom ended abruptly in late 2008 when copper prices slumped, reducing exports, government
revenues, and foreign exchange inflows. Despite the drop in revenues, government spending remained
high, leading to a drawdown of government deposits. In the absence of a monetary tightening, this
contributed to a high level of imports and a large deterioration in the current account. The resulting drain on
the central bank’s international reserves made the tightly managed exchange rate unsustainable and led to a
sharp depreciation in late 2008. Fiscal policy also became unsustainable as the deficit rose. However, the
authorities then implemented an ambitious Fund-supported adjustment program that succeeded in restoring
macroeconomic stability by mid-2009.

Program performance. All performance criteria for the third review were met. The
indicative limit on the budget deficit was breached by a small margin due to higher-thanexpected capital spending, but the annual deficit target should be met since mineral revenues
are projected to pick up in the fourth quarter. The structural benchmark to place Anod Bank
into receivership was met with some delay and the authorities are committed to passing a
social transfer reform law by February 1, 2010.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Outlook. There was broad agreement on the growth and inflation outlook although
the authorities felt that growth this year could be slightly higher than the staff’s forecast.
There is some uncertainty as to the extent that growth in the fourth quarter could be
dampened by closures related to a H1N1 flu outbreak. Growth should recover strongly next
year given the substantial investment in the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The medium-term prospects
are favorable with growth accelerating sharply as Oyu Tolgoi production starts in 2013
(Box 3). Staff and the authorities agreed that the deflation of recent months was due to
temporary factors and inflation would likely bounce back next year to around 6–8 percent.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
Exchange rate. The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate and
have intervened on both sides of the market to smooth volatility and opportunistically build
international reserves. The central bank

9.
Monetary policy. The hike in policy rates earlier this year was instrumental in
stabilizing market conditions. Since then, the central bank has appropriately lowered interest
rates in line with evolving market conditions. The authorities indicated that, going forward,
monetary policy would continue to be geared to achieving low inflation and safeguarding
international reserves. The authorities were also cautious on the prospects for further easing,
given that inflation is expected to rebound to around 6–8 percent next year. The central bank

Box 3. The Long-Run Effect of Scaling Up Mining Production1
The Oyu Tolgoi mine will be a key driver of long-term economic growth. In October 2009, the

The increase in the relative role of the
mining sector could make the economy
more vulnerable to commodity price shocks. The simulations highlight the benefits, especially
in terms of lower inflation, of maintaining a flexible exchange rate. Likewise, adoption of the
planned Fiscal Responsibility Law would make an important contribution to insulating fiscal
policy from price shocks and smoothing the economy’s adjustment to higher mineral output,
which will facilitate development of the nonmineral economy.

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
A large mining project drives the economic outlook over the medium-term and complicates any
assessment of the equilibrium real exchange rate. Nevertheless, the available information does
not indicate the current level of the real exchange rate is out of line with medium-term
fundamentals.
Traditional indicators. The current account balance is expected to be quite volatile over the
next several years. Imports related to the development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine are sizeable and
will result in significant current account deficits in the next few years. Then, the current
account will rapidly swing to surplus once production from the mine starts. Finally, like other
commodity producers, the current account outlook is highly sensitive to expected commodity
prices. These substantial structural changes will imply large swings in the equilibrium
exchange rate over the next decade.
Quantitative assessments. The real effective exchange rate has depreciated by some
20 percent from the peak in October 2008, and the current level appears broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals as
indicated by the Equilibrium

Implications. The structural changes the Mongolian economy will experience in the coming
years are expected to lead to substantial shifts in the real exchange rate. A flexible exchange
rate, therefore, will be indispensable in helping to facilitate adjustment through the nominal
exchange rate rather than prices. Moreover, a flexible exchange rate would also help the
economy absorb the large terms-of-trade shocks that are likely as a result of Mongolia’s
increased reliance on commodity exports.

indicated that, in any case, a further
lowering of policy rates would likely do
little to spur credit growth and stimulate the
economy given the weakness of bank
balance sheets caused by the overhang of
lending from the 2007–08 credit boom.
Nevertheless, the authorities believed that
credit growth should pick up as the
economy recovers, and that there were
already signs that the contraction in credit
was bottoming out.

10.
Inflation targeting. Over the long-run, inflation targeting, coupled with a flexible
exchange rate, should provide an appropriate monetary framework for Mongolia. However,
the introduction of such a regime is still some years away as the central bank needs to build
capacity in inflation forecasting, amend the legal framework to make inflation the central
bank’s main policy goal, and develop a better understanding of how the monetary
transmission mechanism works. The authorities have a tentative timetable to introduce
inflation targeting starting in 2012.
B. Fiscal Policy
11.
Fiscal stance. The authorities remain committed to restoring health to public finances
and are targeting a budget deficit of 6½ percent of GDP for 2009 and 5 percent of GDP in
2010. Strong copper prices, however, may well provide some room to increase spending this
year. Staff advised that revenues in excess of budget forecasts should be saved, particularly
given the substantial fiscal financing needs over the next three years. The authorities,
however, indicated they were contemplating the introduction of a new program aimed at
boosting the construction sector by providing subsidized mortgages to civil servants, funded
by higher mineral-related revenues. In November, Parliament authorized Tog 80 billion in
financing for this program, but the authorities are planning that any spending on this program
would fit within the deficit target. Staff expressed significant reservations as to whether this
was the best use of fiscal resources, particularly given the still-high level of poverty in the
country (more than one-third of all Mongolians live below the poverty line).
12.
2010 budget. In late November, Parliament passed a 2010 budget targeting a
5 percent of GDP deficit. However, the government’s proposal to increase social security
contributions, which would have boosted revenue some 1 percent of GDP per year and also
reduced imbalances in the pension system, was rejected. In addition, the underlying
assumption for copper prices was increased, increasing mineral revenues by around
1½ percent of GDP above the government’s submitted budget draft. These revenues were
then earmarked to financing a significant increase in universal social transfers, delivering on
a campaign promise that was made by both major parties. Staff expressed reservations about
the amendments made to the budget. The 2010 budget now implies only minimal adjustment
in the nonmineral balance indicating a weakening fiscal effort. In addition, the creation of a

10
new entitlement program will further limit fiscal flexibility going forward. Both of these
factors will make it more difficult to achieve the needed fiscal adjustment in 2011 and
beyond. The transfers also run counter to the program goal of replacing universal transfers
with higher benefits that are specifically targeted to the poor. While the authorities
recognized the approved budget was now somewhat less conservative, they noted that the
copper price assumption was still well below both spot and forward prices. Moreover, the
authorities indicated they were fully committed to the deficit target and would adjust
spending, if needed, to offset any revenue shortfalls. They will also ensure that any revenue
over-performance would be saved to help meet future financing needs and limit the procyclicality of spending.
13.
Structural fiscal reforms. The authorities intend to submit their Fiscal
Responsibility Law to Parliament by end-December alongside a complementary integrated
budget law. The government plans to have both laws passed by February 1, 2010. These laws
will be critical for providing an institutional framework to promote fiscal discipline and to
contain pro-cyclicality (Box 5). The authorities also plan to soon submit a new social transfer
reform law to Parliament to increase benefits to the very poorest and generate fiscal savings
through better targeting. Passage of this law was delayed over concerns that early
implementation could worsen poverty since the government still lacks an effective
mechanism to target benefits. To ensure that the poor are fully protected, the means-testing of
benefits will be phased in over the course of next year as the authorities develop their
institutional capacity to identify the poor. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank
will continue to provide assistance in this area.

need for fiscal discipline but also indicated that there were good prospects to sign an
agreement to develop a large coal mine (Tavan Tolgoi) which would provide substantial
additional revenues in the coming years. As such, the need for a significant further
adjustment in budget spending may be less pressing than indicated by staff’s forecasts. While
prospects may be improved by future development of mineral resources, staff advised
prudence in undertaking new spending commitments until a sustainable flow of mineral

Box 5. Fiscal Responsibility Law
Mongolia’s mineral wealth is an economic blessing that, if well managed, will lead to lasting economic
prosperity. But prosperity is not guaranteed. Indeed, international experience shows this blessing often
becomes a resource curse.1 The challenge, therefore, is to ensure that the substantial mineral deposits are
exploited to promote strong, sustainable, and equitable growth with low inflation.
The government plans to adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Law to promote the needed budget discipline by
constraining policymakers’ discretion. The law would put in place three complementary rules that would
function as a fiscal “circuit breaker” and would work together to ensure fiscal discipline:


A ceiling on the “structural” deficit. The structural deficit adjusts the deficit for swings in copper
prices. Specifically, revenue projections would be based on a “normal” or smoothed copper price
instead of the actual copper price. This helps insulate the budget from copper price volatility, and
prevents fiscal policy from transmitting copper price shocks to the rest of the economy. This is the
main rule to prevent a repeat of boom-bust policies. A similar such rule has worked well in Chile. The
plan is to target structural budget balance, albeit with a transition period before that target is achieved.



A debt ceiling. This rule would prevent excessive borrowing against future wealth—a common
mistake among resource economies. High public debt makes the economy vulnerable to commodity
price changes, other shocks, or financing constraints. A debt ceiling also reinforces the government’s
commitment to fiscal sustainability. The authorities plan to set the ceiling at 40 percent of GDP.



A ceiling on expenditure growth. Rapid spending growth is bad for the economy (leading to
overheating and inflation) and, from a fiscal perspective, is difficult to manage without reducing
quality and efficiency. This rule is a safeguard that would apply when structural revenue is rising fast,
such as when the Oyu Tolgoi mine comes on line. In more normal times, it would generally be nonbinding.

In addition to the numerical rules, the Fiscal Responsibility Law will also incorporate procedural and
transparency reforms to strengthen budget discipline. This includes, for example, strengthening the role of
the medium-term framework in setting aggregate ceilings for the budget process and requiring mandatory
cost estimates for program proposals to ensure consistency with the fiscal framework. The government also
plans to adopt an organic budget law that will complement the Fiscal Responsibility Law in promoting
sound budgeting.
At the end of the day, the Fiscal Responsibility Law will only work if policymakers adhere to it. The fiscal
rules and the annual budget must become a binding constraint on policy. This means that all new policy
initiatives with fiscal consequences would have to be made consistent with the fiscal policy framework
before being adopted. Policies that boost spending, for example, would have to be paid for through
spending cuts elsewhere or new revenue measures. Policymakers are in effect agreeing to “tie their own
hands” to safeguard fiscal discipline. This fiscal discipline will, in turn, yield huge benefits in helping to
convert Mongolia’s substantial mineral wealth into economic prosperity.

revenues were established (which may not be until 2015). Until then, the deficit should be
constrained by the availability of noninflationary fiscal financing. Moreover, public debt was
already high, although it should fall rapidly in the coming years, particularly as repayments
to the Fund come due (see Debt Sustainability Analysis).

C. Banking System
15.
Anod Bank. The rapid expansion of credit in past years is now leading to a steady
increase in nonperforming loans and which has precipitated sequential bank failures. Anod
Bank was taken into conservatorship in December 2008 and the authorities have recently
appointed a receiver to liquidate the bank. Potential lawsuits by minority shareholders are,
however, presenting a legal constraint to liquidating the bank and the authorities have
decided to preemptively offer to settle with these shareholders, costing the budget around
Tog 5 billion. While the authorities shared staff concerns of the precedent this would set,
their legal advisors have indicated that, in the absence of such a step, the central bank would
remain unable to liquidate the bank until minority shareholders claims were determined by
the courts. This would be a very lengthy process that could take several years to resolve.
16.
Zoos Bank. The authorities have also appointed a receiver at Zoos Bank, the only
other publicly listed bank, following a significant loss of the bank’s deposits and the
discovery that the bank was insolvent, in part a result of significant accounting irregularities.
An external audit of the bank is underway and losses could be considerable (perhaps up to
2 percent of GDP). The authorities plan to use a “good bank, bad bank” model to resolve
Zoos and have already moved the performing assets from the bank into a new, governmentowned bank.
17.
Banking system. The remainder of the banking system remains under stress as
highlighted by an increase in nonperforming assets and falling capital adequacy ratios (even
after excluding Anod and Zoos Banks). The three largest banks, which make up 70 percent of
the system, still report capital adequacy ratios that are 2–3 percentage points above the
regulatory minimum. However, some mid- and small-sized banks have weaker balance
sheets and it is unclear whether the current system of loan provisioning fully reflects
expected losses. The mission, in conjunction with an overlapping MCM technical assistance

13
mission, has discussed contingency plans 20

Banking system strategy. The authorities intend, as a first step, to assess the strength
of the banking system by undertaking external audits of all the banks, supported by World
Bank financing. Bank-by-bank plans will then be developed to recapitalize the system, with
the support of MCM technical assistance. The public debt projections assume that bank
restructuring will cost around 5 percent of GDP in addition to the 3 percent of GDP already
deployed to cover the cost of Anod Bank. Stringent conditions would be placed on the use of
public resources and existing shareholders would be required to either inject new capital or
be the first to bear losses. The authorities also intend to implement legal reforms to
strengthen the central bank’s powers to intervene and resolve individual institutions,
including the power to write down existing shareholder capital, to transfer assets and
liabilities to a healthy bank, to quickly license a new bank, and to effect mergers. Staff advice
was to proceed expeditiously with bank restructuring. However, there is a strong possibility
that some restructuring of corporate entities may also need to be undertaken in the coming
months, particularly for those sectors that were hit hard by the economic downturn or where
banks are significantly exposed to individual corporations.
19.
Supervision. The authorities intend to further strengthen bank supervision. The
central bank has already completed on-site inspection of all the banks and appointed a
comptroller in one mid-sized bank where there are concerns about the health of the bank’s
balance sheet. The authorities are also committed to improving the loan classification system
for restructured loans and to closely monitor such loans. Staff encouraged the authorities to
promptly pass the Banking Law (submitted to Parliament in October) which includes
provisions that will strengthen prudential requirements, increase the legal protection for bank
supervisors, and more clearly define connected parties.
D. Other
20.
External financing. It was agreed that the authorities should be cautious in
undertaking new nonconcessional external borrowing. The government should also keep in
place the current prohibition on government guarantees. Earlier this year, the government
borrowed US$75 million for on-lending to gold mining operations and the authorities remain

14
committed to having these loans repaid to the budget by the end of the year. As part of the
Oyu Tolgoi agreement, the government will receive advance payment loans of
US$250 million (of which US$100 million has already been disbursed) as well as loans to
finance the government’s 34 percent equity stake in the mine. For program purposes, both of
these loans are considered domestic financing since the lender is technically a resident
company (despite being majority owned by an international mining conglomerate). The
advance payment loans will be repaid from the general budget while the government’s equity
share borrowing will be repaid from accrued dividends (the government will not be liable for
the loan in the unlikely event that dividends are insufficient).
21.
Program issues. The authorities continue to work to reach agreement on their
remaining arrears to bilateral creditors. The mission again discussed with the authorities the
options for a successor concessional arrangement but the authorities have chosen to reserve
judgment on that possibility until a later date.
22.
Data. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance. As flagged by the
Safeguards Assessment, staff reiterated that external auditors need to be given access to
central bank’s vaults by end-2009 to provide assurances on the reliability of monetary data
aggregates and to resolve the qualified audit opinion that arose in 2008.
23.
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Mongolia has made progress
in their goal of becoming EITI compliant by next year. The EITI audit report covering the
company payments and government receipts for the fiscal year 2006 has been published and
the 2007 report is being verified by the EITI National Council. The EITI validation is
expected to be completed by March 2010.
24.
Trade and investment policies. The authorities remain committed to maintaining a
free trade and investment regimes. Such policies will strengthen Mongolia’s competitiveness
and facilitate the structural changes in the economy associated with the development of the
Oyu Tolgoi project.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Macro-outlook. Growth this year is likely to be around -1 percent, reflecting the
impact of the global crisis and the necessary tightening of policies. The economy, however,
is bottoming out and real GDP growth is projected to pick up substantially next year to
around 8 percent, boosted by capital expenditure related to the ongoing construction of the
Oyu Tolgoi mine. Inflation has fallen sharply this year reflecting global price movements and
the success of the authorities’ stabilization program. Over the medium term, real growth is
expected to be high, driven first by investment in the mining sector and, subsequently, by a
rapid expansion in mineral output. However, prudent macroeconomic management will be
required to ensure that Mongolia’s substantial mineral wealth translates into prosperity for all
of its citizens.
26.
Fiscal stance. Fiscal policy was loosened substantially in 2007–08 and the
nonmineral fiscal deficit increased by 13 percent of GDP. This extraordinary loosening will

15
now need to be unwound in order to return the budget deficit to a level that can be
comfortably financed without generating inflation or crowding out lending to the private
sector. The ambitious consolidation undertaken this year was a major down payment on the
needed adjustment. However, fiscal restraint will be necessary for several more years to fully
restore health to government finances. For 2010, the overall balance should be limited to
5 percent of GDP, in line with the budget passed by Parliament, and the deficit should
continue to fall in the coming years. The 2010 target implies only a modest consolidation in
the nonmineral balance. While this should support the economic recovery, it will be
important that any revenue over-performance is saved to prevent a return to the pro-cyclical
policies of the past. Continued adjustment will be needed in 2011, in part to offset the
considerable revenue loss emanating from the planned elimination of the windfall profits tax.
Such consolidation could be achieved through expenditure rationalization, including
reductions in subsidies, universal transfers, and investment spending. The decline in the
deficit will need to continue until the revenue from Oyu Tolgoi starts to enter the budget (in
around 2015). A larger fiscal deficit simply cannot be reasonably financed without either
crowding out the private sector or overly relying on costly foreign borrowing. Indeed, the
financing situation will become increasingly difficult after 2010 since donor budgetary
support will decline. Therefore, the advance payments associated with the Oyu Tolgoi project
will need to be saved in order to meet the expected financing needs in 2011 and beyond.
27.
Structural fiscal reforms. The prompt adoption of a Fiscal Responsibility Law will
help institutionalize a lasting commitment to fiscal discipline. For that fiscal framework to be
successful, it will be critical that the law is comprehensive in nature, covering all aspects of
government revenue and spending. The costs of all spending initiatives will need to be
explicitly determined and will need to be consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Law’s
numerical targets. Reform of the social transfer regime is another critical priority. The new
social transfer system will need to be designed to ensure better protection for the poor and
vulnerable groups by moving away from universal transfers toward more targeted benefits.
The recent increase in universal transfers, therefore, is a step in the wrong direction that will
reduce fiscal flexibility and increase fiscal risks going forward.
28.
Exchange rate policy. The reforms to exchange rate management are working well,
allowing the Bank of Mongolia to rebuild international reserves. Looking ahead, a flexible
exchange rate will be crucial for macroeconomic stability. It will help insulate the economy
from external shocks, facilitate the continued rebuilding of international reserves, and reduce
inflation. As production from Oyu Tolgoi takes off and Mongolia becomes wealthier, the real
exchange rate will naturally begin to appreciate. A flexible exchange rate would allow this to
occur through a stronger nominal exchange rate rather than through higher inflation. In
addition, allowing for greater flexibility will give the central bank greater autonomy in
pursuing an independent monetary policy that is calibrated to Mongolia’s own circumstances
and geared toward maintaining low inflation and robust growth. Returning to the tightly
managed exchange rate of the past would run the risk that movements in the real exchange
rate will again show up in higher inflation. This would have a significant and negative impact

16
on the very poorest and most vulnerable in society, raising both poverty and income
inequality.
29.
Monetary policy framework. The Bank of Mongolia should consider moving, over
time, to an inflation targeting framework, which would provide a nominal anchor consistent
with a flexible exchange rate. While such a move is some years away, much can be done in
the interim to lay the technical groundwork for the adoption of inflation targeting. This
includes enhancing inflation forecasting and improving the monetary policy transmission
channel by promoting financial market deepening and strengthening the banking system. In
the meantime, monetary policy should continue to be geared toward achieving stable and low
inflation, safeguarding international reserves, and containing exchange rate volatility by
targeting monetary aggregates.
30.
Near-term monetary policy. Earlier this year, the central bank raised interest rates,
which helped to quickly stabilize market conditions. Since then, markets have remained calm
and inflation has decelerated sharply allowing the central bank to gradually and appropriately
lower the policy interest rate. Going forward, the central bank should continue to adjust
interest rates prudently and in line with evolving market conditions and the inflation outlook.
Inflation is expected to rise from the current very low levels and stabilize at around 6 percent.
A cautious approach, therefore, will help enhance the credibility of the central bank’s
commitment to low inflation while also safeguarding international reserves. Moreover, at the
present juncture, efforts to further loosen monetary policy are unlikely to jumpstart credit
growth or provide substantial demand impetus since banks already hold excess liquidity and
are constrained by weak balance sheets.
31.
Banking system. The rapid expansion of credit during the boom years is now taking
its toll on the banking system. Nonperforming loans have increased sharply and capital
adequacy ratios have fallen. The central bank has responded proactively and vigorously to
handle problems in individual banks, as they arise, and to maintain the integrity of and
confidence in the Mongolian banking system. They should continue with this approach.
Further public money may well be needed to restructure the banking system. If so, the
injection of public funds should be intimately tied to governance and structural reforms at the
recipient bank. Such reforms would include changes in management; a dilution of
shareholders’ ownership; ensuring transparent, fit, and proper bank ownership and
management; improving risk management systems; and strengthening lending practices. In
addition, continued progress in strengthening supervision is needed to prevent a recurrence of
banking system instability and secure a sound and stable banking system.
32.
The need to avoid a repeat of boom-bust cycles. What would happen if there was a
return to the policy mix of 2007–08? For example, if the Oyu Tolgoi advance payments were
spent today, the fiscal adjustment process were halted, and the exchange rate again became
tightly managed, the government would run a significant risk of running out of financing
resources in the next one–two years. Even with relatively high copper prices this could lead
to a repeat of the near-crisis experienced earlier this year. The end result would be high and
rising inflation, large current account deficits, and a depletion of international reserves. The

17
difficult measures undertaken by the government in the context of the current policy program
will have all been in vain.
33.
Program performance. The authorities have had strong policy implementation,
exemplified by the fact that all the principal performance criteria—for this and all previous
reviews—have been met. The indicative limit on the fiscal deficit was slightly missed for
end-September, but the end-December fiscal target should be comfortably met as revenues
are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter. Some of the structural benchmarks will be
completed with a modest delay. However, the authorities are committed to them and have
made demonstrable progress toward fulfilling them.
34.
Risks. Despite the success of the program to date, there remain considerable risks.
Weaknesses in the banking system have now become the primary risk facing the government.
It is likely that difficult decisions will be needed in the near future to restructure some banks,
including writing down the equity stake of some existing owners. There is also a possibility
that the recent deposit outflow at Zoos Bank could be repeated at other banks, leading to
capital outflows and pressure on the currency. This would require a prompt and decisive
response from the authorities. Fiscal policy also represents a source of risk. There already are
significant political pressures to immediately spend the large advance payments received as
part of the Oyu Tolgoi agreement and any mineral revenue over-performance. The
government will have to show strong political will to resist such pressures and avoid
complacency.
35.
Summary. The economy has now weathered the worse of the crisis and is set to
rebound strongly starting in 2010. Looking forward, Mongolia stands to benefit enormously
from its vast mineral deposits. Maximizing these benefits will require a continued
commitment to fiscal discipline, a flexible exchange rate, and a sound banking system.
Staying the course with such policies will help ensure that Mongolia’s considerable mineral
wealth is transformed into falling poverty, rising household income, and a steadily improving
standard of living for all of Mongolia’s citizens.
36.
Staff recommends completion of the third review and that the next Article IV
consultation takes place on the 24-month cycle since Mongolia is currently under a Fund
arrangement.

ATTACHMENT I
December 3, 2009

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Our macroeconomic policies, supported by the Stand-By Arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund, have successfully stabilized market conditions, boosted international
reserves, and lowered inflation. We have also signed a major international agreement to
develop the Oyu Tolgoi mine which should sustain growth in Mongolia for years to come.
Our objective remains to achieve strong, sustainable, and equitable growth with low inflation
and healthy public finances. In the coming months, we intend to press ahead with key
reforms aimed at strengthening the banking system, restoring health to the budget,
maintaining a flexible exchange rate, and shielding low income groups from the effects of the
crisis. The attached Memorandum of Economic Policies (MEP) describes our
macroeconomic policies for the remainder of 2009 and 2010.
Given the success to date of the program, and our observance of all end-September
performance criteria, we request the completion of the third review. Quantitative targets and
structural policies of our program are outlined in Tables 1 and 2. The fourth review is
scheduled to take place on or after March 15, 2010 and the fifth review is scheduled to take
place on or after June 15, 2010.
During the period of the arrangement, the Mongolian government will maintain the usual
close policy dialogue with the Fund and consult with the IMF before modifying measures
contained in this letter or adopting new measures. We will continue to provide the IMF with
the necessary information for program monitoring and authorize the IMF to publish this letter
and the attached MEP.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
S. Bayartsogt
Minister of Finance

L. Purevdorj
Governor of Bank of Mongolia

28
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC POLICIES
1.
Growth and inflation We expect the economy to rebound from around zero growth
this year to roughly 8 percent next year, spurred by investments that will accompany the
development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The prospects for the medium term are favorable
owing to the significant upswing in mineral exports once the Oyu Tolgoi project comes on
stream in 2013. Inflation was -1.1 percent in October and is projected to reach 2 percent by
December and below 8 percent at end-2010.
Fiscal Policy
2.
The 2009 fiscal targets. Restoring heath to public finance remains our top priority.
With the recovery in copper prices, we expect the 2009 deficit to be lower than the
government’s target of 6½ percent of GDP. We will, as planned, require the banks to repay
the budget for the net lending to the gold mining sector that was undertaken earlier this year.
3.
The 2010 budget and beyond. We are committed to limiting the 2010 budget deficit
to 5 percent of GDP as in the budget passed by Parliament. If revenue comes in lower than
projected in the budget, we will fully offset any shortfall with a reduction in spending to
ensure that program deficit targets are achieved. On the other hand, if revenues exceed
budget forecasts, we intend to save the additional revenues to help meet future financing
needs and limit pro-cyclicality of spending. We intend to continue the process of fiscal
adjustment after 2010 as we recognize the financing situation will become increasingly
difficult in the coming years as donor budgetary support will be scaled down. In this regard,
we will fully incorporate any advance payments we receive for the Oyu Tolgoi mining
project in the budget as a financing item.
4.
Maintaining fiscal responsibility. We will submit by end-December a Fiscal
Responsibility Law to Parliament. The law will promote fiscal discipline by enhancing
transparency, strengthening accountability, and establishing numerical rules that would limit
the fiscal balance, government debt, and spending growth. A complementary organic budget
law is under preparation. We plan to pass both laws by February 1, 2010.
5.
Protecting the poor. A social transfer reform law will soon be submitted to
Parliament that aims to better assist Mongolia’s most vulnerable citizens by increasing the
benefits to low income households. At the same time, modest fiscal savings will be generated
through a significant improvement in the targeting of social transfers to ensure that resources
go to the most needy groups. Implementation will be phased in over the coming year as we
improve our capacity to carry out effective means-testing to target the poverty benefit. We
appreciate the support of donors in preparing this reform, and will continue to work with the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank on its implementation. We will pass this law by
February 1, 2010.

29
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
6.
Exchange rate policy. We remain fully committed to a flexible exchange rate to
provide a shock absorber against terms of trade volatility and to safeguard international
reserves. Our intervention strategy is guided by the goals of rebuilding international reserves
and allowing the exchange rate to move in line with market conditions while smoothing
excess volatility due to temporary imbalances. We will consult with Fund staff on the
appropriate policy response if, during any 30 day period, our net sales in the foreign
exchange auctions exceed US$30 million.
7.
Monetary policy. Our primary objective for monetary policy continues to be oriented
toward achieving and maintaining low inflation and macroeconomic stability. Inflation has
decelerated sharply and we expect it to stay below 8 percent through 2010. This has created
some scope for the central bank to lower policy interest rates in October and the central bank
will continue to adjust interest rates prudently and in line with evolving market conditions
and the inflation outlook.
Banking System Reforms
8.
Banks. We are taking decisive action to bolster confidence in the banking system and
ensure financial stability. We appointed a receiver to begin the process of liquidating Anod
Bank. The government, by the end of this year, will fully reimburse the central bank for any
resolution costs it has incurred. A receiver has also been appointed to Zoos Bank and an
external audit has been initiated. External audits at other banks will start soon, and ten will be
completed by end-January 2010. Public money may well be needed to restructure the
banking system. If so, we will tie the injection of public funds to governance and structural
reforms at the recipient bank. Such reforms would include changes in management; ensuring
transparent, fit, and proper owner/managers of the bank; improving risk management
systems; and strengthening lending practices. We are committed to responding proactively
and vigorously to handle problems in individual banks, as they arise, and to maintain the
stability of and confidence in the Mongolian banking system. In this regard, we will continue
to enhance our supervision efforts and fully intend to enforce all existing regulatory
requirements for all banks.
9.
Supervision. A robust banking system is a top priority of the government, and
enhancing supervision is an integral part of our strategy. Toward this end, we will improve
the loan classification system for restructured loans, including by clarifying the definition,
tightening the rules for upgrading, and requiring monthly reporting. The Banking Law was
submitted to Parliament in October that aims to reinforce prudential requirements, strengthen
legal protection of bank supervisors, and more clearly defines connected parties.

30
Other Policies
10.
External financing. We are committed to prudently managing any further
nonconcessional borrowing within program ceilings and we will maintain the current
prohibition on government guarantees. We remain committed to resolving the remaining
bilateral official arrears.

liabilities. For program monitoring purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities
of the BOM shall be valued at program exchange rates and gold price as described on
paragraph 6 above.
10.

Gross international reserves of the BOM are defined as the sum of



monetary gold holdings of the BOM;



holdings of SDRs;



Mongolia’s reserve position in the IMF;



foreign currency assets in convertible currencies held abroad that are under the direct
and effective control of the BOM and readily available for intervention in the foreign
exchange market, or the direct financing of balance of payments imbalances and are
of investment grade or held with an investment-grade institution;



excluded from the definition of gross reserves are capital subscriptions in
international institutions, assets in nonconvertible currencies, and gross reserves that
are in any way encumbered or pledged, including, but not limited to, reserve assets
used as collateral or guarantee for third-party external liabilities.

35
11.

International reserve liabilities of the BOM are defined as the sum of



all outstanding liabilities of Mongolia to the IMF;



any foreign convertible currency liabilities of the BOM to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to and including one year;



commercial bank foreign currency deposits held at the BOM, commercial bank
foreign currency current accounts held at the BOM, any foreign currency claims on
residents.
C. Net Domestic Assets of the BOM

12.
A ceiling applies to the level of net domestic assets (NDA) of the BOM. The ceiling
on NDA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of support from bilateral and
multilateral donors (excluding IMF) in excess (short) of the programmed level cumulative
since April 2009. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward by the amount of
nonconcessional debt disbursed during the program period, with the exception of any
amounts drawn under a swap arrangement with China. The ceiling on NDA will also be
adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of Oyu Tolgoi tax prepayment loans disbursed
in excess (short) of the programmed level.
13.
NDA will be calculated as the difference between reserve money and the sum of NIR
and other net foreign assets (ONFA) of the BOM.
14.
ONFA is defined as the sum of (i) BOM’s monetary gold pledged as collateral for
external loans to domestic private companies and (ii) other net foreign assets of the BOM,
including the difference between accrued interest receivables on gross international reserves
of the BOM and accrued interest payables on international reserve liabilities of the BOM and
deposits of international financial institutions.
D. Net Domestic Credit to the General Government
15.
A ceiling applies to the net bank credit flows to the general government (NCG)
measured cumulatively from the beginning of the year. The ceiling on NCG will be adjusted
downward (upward) by the amount of support from bilateral and multilateral donors
(excluding IMF) in excess (short) of the programmed level cumulative from the beginning of
the fiscal year. The ceiling will also be adjusted downward by the amount of nonconcessional
debt disbursed during the program period in excess of the programmed level.
16.
NCG is defined as the sum of (i) net borrowing from the BOM (ways and means
advances, loans, holdings of restructuring bonds, holdings of treasury bills and other
government bonds, and the government liabilities to the IMF minus deposits); (ii) net
borrowing from commercial banks (loans, advances, holdings of restructuring bonds, and

36
holdings of treasury bills and other government bonds minus deposits); and (iii) net change in
domestic government debt held by parties other than the BOM and commercial banks. NCG
excludes government deposits lost or government debt (or other liabilities) issued to pay for
the resolution of Anod Bank.
IV. FISCAL AGGREGATES
A. Fiscal Deficit
17.
An indicative ceiling target applies to the general government fiscal deficit measured
cumulatively from the beginning of the year.
18.
Fiscal deficit is defined as total general government revenue and grants minus total
general government expenditure and net lending. The principal costs of resolving Anod Bank
are excluded from expenditure and net lending, but the corresponding interest payments are
included. If gold mining loans on-lent to commercial banks are not fully repaid back to the
government by end-2009, then the fiscal deficit indicative targets for (i) end-2009 will be
adjusted upward by the amount of unpaid loans; and (ii) the end-June 2010 target will be
adjusted downward by the amount of unpaid loans as of end-2009.
V. DOMESTIC PAYMENT ARREARS
19.
Domestic payment arrears for the purpose of the program are measured on the basis
of the stock of government payables and liabilities that exceed its due-for-payment date by
more than 60 days. If this stock is equal or smaller than Tog 3.5 billion, the program
considers domestic arrear accumulation to be zero. If this stock exceeds Tog 3.5 billion, the
difference is considered to constitute domestic arrear accumulation. The program aims for
zero domestic arrear accumulation under this definition. Overdue claims that are arrears
under the definition of the performance criteria subject to litigation shall be excluded from
the application of the performance criteria.
VI. EXTERNAL DEBT
A. Medium- and Long-Term External Debt
20.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the central government, the
BOM, or other agencies on behalf of the central government of new nonconcessional
borrowing debt with nonresidents with original maturities one year or more. The ceiling
applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been
received. However, with respect to swap arrangements with People’s Bank of China, only
amounts actually drawn under such arrangement would count toward the ceiling and all such
drawings, regardless of the duration, would be considered to have an original maturity of
more than one year. Secondary market transactions of Oyu Tolgoi tax-prepayment loans with
nonresidents are not considered external financing for the purpose of the program.

37
21.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the program, is set out in Executive Board
Decision No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 24, 2000 (see Annex I).
22.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) the use of Fund resources; (ii) lending from the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development; (iii) debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts, to the
extent that such debt is incurred on more favorable terms than the existing debt;
(iv) concessional debts; and (vi) any togrog-denominated treasury bill and government bond
holdings by nonresidents.
23.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the central government, the BOM, or other agencies on behalf of the central
government to service a loan in the event of nonpayment by the recipient (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or indirectly through any other obligation of the central
government, the BOM, or other agencies on behalf of the central government to finance a
shortfall incurred by the loan recipient.
24.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt. The NPV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the
NPV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same
margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD would continue to be
added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years,
1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). Loans provided by a
private entity will not be considered concessional unless accompanied by a grant or grant
element provided by a foreign official entity, such as both components constitute an
integrated financing package with a combined grant element equal to at least 35 percent.
B. Short-Term External Debt
25.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the central government, the
BOM, or other agencies on behalf of the central government of new nonconcessional
borrowing debt with nonresidents with original maturities of less than one year. The ceiling
applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been
received.
26.
For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision
No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 24, 2000 (see Annex I).

38
27.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of
the BOM; (ii) debts to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts; (iii) togrogdenominated treasury bills, government bonds, and BOM bills held by nonresidents;
(iv) normal import financing; and (v) amounts drawn under any swap arrangements with
People’s Bank of China. A financing arrangement for imports is considered to be “normal”
when the credit is self-liquidating.
VII. EXTERNAL PAYMENT ARREARS
28.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the general government or the
BOM. External payments arrears consist of external debt-service obligations (principal and
interest) that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual
agreements. However, overdue debt and debt service obligations that are in dispute will not
be considered as external payments arrears for the purposes of program monitoring.
VIII. DATA PROVISION
29.
The authorities have committed to using the best available data, so that any
subsequent data revisions will not lead to a breach of a performance criterion. All revisions to
data will be promptly reported to the Fund’s Resident Representative. The likelihood of
significant data changes, including definitional changes, will be communicated to Fund staff
as soon as the risk becomes apparent to the authorities.
30.
Data required to monitor performance under the program, including those related to
performance criteria and indicative targets will be provided electronically or in hard copy to
the Fund’s Resident Representative by the 20th day of each month, unless otherwise
indicated. The data to be reported are listed below, and the reporting responsibilities are

ANNEX 1. GUIDELINES ON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN DEBT
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 12274, as revised on August 24, 2000
9.
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through
the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency)
or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal
and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial
loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing
the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified
period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service
life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.
For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made
during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will
not give rise to debt.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), conducted with
respect to the Stand-by Arrangement approved in April 2009, was finalized on June
17, 2009. Previous safeguards assessments were completed in March 2002 and
November 2003. The 2009 update assessment found that the BOM has continued to

3

improve its safeguards framework since the 2003 assessment. The BOM’s financial
reporting and audit practices generally comply with international standards. However,
some aspects of the oversight mechanism should be strengthened and certain external
audit scope limitations removed.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:
On May 27, 1993, Mongolia moved from a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to
a floating exchange rate system. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating.
BOM’s official exchange rate is the midpoint of the previous days’ average buying and
selling rates of transactions in the interbank market and transactions between banks and
their clients. The official rate is announced each weekday except for national public
holidays, and the BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market.
Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement
has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement,
retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.
This change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment
that there has been a substantive alteration in the country’s exchange arrangement or
other policies. Due to rapid currency depreciation between October 2008 and
February 2009, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to “other managed
arrangement” from a stabilized arrangement as of November 1, 2008. On
March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the
determination of the exchange rate mainly by market forces and therefore, effective
March 24, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to
floating.
Mongolia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on
February 1, 1996. Mongolia imposes two multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to
Fund jurisdiction. First, the modalities of the multi-price auction system give rise to an
MCP since there is no mechanism in place that ensures that exchange rates of accepted
bids at the multi-price auction do not deviate by more than 2 percent. Second, given the
way the official exchange rate (reference rate) is determined (based on the previous
days' weighted average exchange rates) and the fact that the official rate must be used
for the government's current international transactions, the absence of a mechanism and
infrastructure that ensure that the official rate does not deviate by more than 2 percent
from the commercial rate also gives rise to an MCP (Country Report 09/254
08/14/2009). Further progress is needed to develop the screen-based system which
enables the Bank of Mongolia to trade at spot exchange rates. The Bank of Mongolia
intends to institute and introduce the screen-based system in the inter-bank market by
March 31, 2010. The Executive Board approved the multi-price auction MCP until June
22, 2010 (Decision No. 14365 of June 23, 2009). Mongolia imposes exchange
restrictions for security reasons in accordance with United Nations Security Council

4

Resolution No. 92/757 concerning certain transactions with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that have been notified to the Fund under
Decision 144 (11/4/94).
IX.

Article IV Consultation:
The 2008 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 08/200) was concluded by
the Executive Board on June 4, 2008. Mongolia is on the 12–month cycle.

Recent Financial Arrangements:
An 18- month Stand-by Arrangement in an amount of equivalent to SDR 153.3 million
(300 percent of quota) was approved on April 1, 2009. The first review was completed
on June 23, 2009, and the second was completed on September 21, 2009.
A three-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in
an amount equivalent to SDR 40.81 million (80 percent of quota), with a first annual
arrangement in an amount of SDR 18.55 million (36.3 percent of quota), was approved
on June 25, 1993. The second annual arrangement in an amount of SDR 11.13 million
(21.8 percent of quota) was approved on November 23, 1994. The ESAF arrangement
lapsed on June 24, 1996.
A three-year arrangement under the ESAF/PRGF in an amount equivalent to
SDR 33.4 million (65.4 percent of quota), with a first annual arrangement in an amount
of SDR 11.13 million (21.8 percent of quota), was approved by the Executive Board on
July 30, 1997. The first year arrangement lapsed on July 30, 1998. The second annual
arrangement of SDR 14.8 million (29 percent of quota) was approved on June 16, 1999.
The first review under that arrangement was completed in January 2000 and the
arrangement lapsed on June 15, 2000. The ESAF/PRGF arrangement lapsed on
July 29, 2000.
A three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an amount equivalent to
SDR 28.49 million (55.8 percent of quota), with the first year of the arrangement in

5

an amount of SDR 12.21 million (23.9 percent of quota), was approved by the
Executive Board on September 28, 2001. The first and second review under the PRGF
was completed on September 12, 2003, and the Executive Board approved the
extension of the PRGF through July 31, 2005. The arrangement expired on that date
without the completion of the third and subsequent reviews.
XII.

FSAP Participation:

ANNEX II. MONGOLIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
Mongolia became a member of the World Bank Group in February 1991. Bank lending to
Mongolia, currently on IDA-only terms, represents about 11 percent of the country’s overall
official development assistance flows. Given the economic downturn, an Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) was prepared and endorsed by the World Bank Board in May 2009. The ISN
provides a bridging framework for assistance over an 18-month period. As conditions
stabilize and there is a clearer planning horizon, it is anticipated that a four-year Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) will be prepared, supporting Mongolia’s medium-term agenda.
The ISN positions the Bank to support the Government’s immediate crisis response and ease
the fiscal adjustment, but also to support renewed efforts to make reforms that will improve
the medium-term management of the country’s mineral-based economy. In particular, the
ISN focuses the World Bank Group assistance program on three strategic areas:




Improving macro and fiscal sustainability in a mineral-based economy;
Protecting the poor and vulnerable; and
Encouraging transparent and prudent mining investments and a more competitive and
stable medium-term business investment climate.

In light of governance concerns, mechanisms to promote greater accountability and
transparency, including a more informed and inclusive policy dialogue, will be promoted
throughout the program. To provide this support, the Bank Group is adapting its program to
respond to evolving needs. The ISN program has the following features:


Ongoing IDA projects and technical assistance activities have been being refocused to
build capacity in crisis management and support medium-term policy reforms as part of
the donor-supported stabilization package. For instance, to assist with the fiscal reform
agenda, an existing TA project is financing IMF-supervised consultants.



The majority of new IDA resources have been shifted from previously planned
investment projects to development policy credits (DPCs). Two DPCs totaling around
SDR 40 million and representing two-thirds of the notional IDA-15 envelope
(SDR 60 million), will support key policy reforms in the three strategic areas outlined
above and provide budgetary support to help fill the fiscal financing shortfall. A first
DPC of SDR 27 million was approved in late June 2009. The second DPC is planned for
June 2009. Remaining IDA resources will support TA and investment operations
determined to have a high impact on the above strategic priorities.



The Bank Group’s analytical and advisory program is intensifying its emphasis on justin-time policy advice and analytical products to respond to the crisis. Ongoing technical
assistance is being re-aligned to emerging needs, particularly in the financial sector.



The Bank currently administers approximately $32 million of grant trust funding
supporting education reform, sustainable livelihoods, environmental improvements,
public administration, and governance enhancement. To meet emerging priority needs,
additional trust fund resources are being sought for high impact activities.



Strong emphasis on joint work and close coordination with the IMF, AsDB, Japan, and
other external partners.

With this broad framework, the World Bank’s main sectoral activities include:


Public Sector Management and Governance. The Bank, in partnership with the IMF, is
working with the government to strengthen its public financial management framework
through a combination of analytical advice and technical assistance projects including the
ongoing Economic Capacity Building Technical Assistance and Governance Assistance
projects.



Financial Sector. The World Bank Group has actively supported capacity building and
reforms in the financial sector with an emphasis on strengthening banking supervision
and credit risk management capacity of commercial banks. The Bank, together with the
IMF and other development partners, is now actively engaged with the Bank of Mongolia
and the Government to address emerging problems in the financial sector. The IFC is also
playing a significant role in the World Bank Group’s investments and transactions in the
Mongolian financial.



Mining Sector. A Mining Technical Assistance project is providing support to the
government in establishing key pieces of the policy, fiscal, legal, regulatory, and
institutional framework for the mining sector, in cooperation with the IMF, AsDB, GTZ
and EBRD.



Rural Sustainable Development. The Bank Group is building on a long-term package of
assistance for rural populations focused on scaling up and institutionalizing successful
approaches from ongoing projects. These include projects to reduce vulnerability of
herders, provide basic social infrastructure investment, enhance access to rural financial
and ICT services, and improve environmental management.



Social Sectors. The World Bank is active across a range of social sectors, including on
pensions and on social welfare/transfer schemes (in partnership with the AsDB),

10

education and labor markets. A new Poverty Assessment is also underway, based on new
2007/08 household survey data.


Other sectors in which the Bank is engaged in Mongolia through investment lending,
technical assistance or analytical work include private sector development, urban
sustainable development, infrastructure and judicial and legal reforms.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue to address weaknesses in the
financial and real sectors through investment and advisory service programs. This work
includes: (i) strategies to assist investment clients with liquidity; (ii) developing the nonbank
financial sector including leasing; and (iii) providing training to help banks through the crisis,
such as best practices in NPL management and corporate governance. Where feasible,
Mongolia will participate in IFC initiatives aimed at helping developing countries address
private sector crisis-related problems, for example to support microfinance institutions,
relieve liquidity stress, expand trade financing, and provide banks with skills to help them
cope with the crisis.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) would be able to supplement the
work of the Bank and the IFC by offering its guarantee products in support of private
investment into the country.

11
ANNEX III. MONGOLIA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991. In
line with AsDB’s poverty reduction strategy, AsDB entered into a Poverty Partnership
Agreement (PPA) with the Government of Mongolia in 2000. Within the framework of the
PPA, in October 2005, AsDB formulated its Country Strategy and Program (CSP)
for 2006−08.
AsDB has been a leading development partner in Mongolia, which is eligible for, and
borrows from AsDB's concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. AsDB
allocates its concessional special fund resources to eligible member countries, including
Mongolia, based on an annual country performance assessment. The assessment focuses on
indicators of sustainable economic growth, socially inclusive development, governance and
public sector management, and portfolio performance.
AsDB has provided loans for 39 projects totaling $705.1 million in the agriculture, education,
energy, financial, health, industry, telecommunications, transport, and urban development
sectors as of August 31, 2009. AsDB has also approved and implemented 145 technical
assistance projects for Mongolia totaling $71.4 million. Grants funded by Japanese special
funds (Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and Japan Fund for Information, Communication
and Technology total $28.6 million and have been increasing in recent years. Four JFPR
projects, totaling $8 million, and two amounting to $4.0 million, were approved in 2008 and
so far in 2009, respectively.
Mongolia became eligible for 100 percent ADF grant financing for the period 2007–08.
Six grant projects and one grant program, totaling $105.2 million, were approved during this
period. The total active loan and grant portfolio as of August 31, 2009 consists of 12 loans
amounting to a net total of $219.5 million and seven grants totaling $105.2 million.
Since late 2008, AsDB has worked with the government to formulate a response to the global
economic crisis, in close cooperation with other development partners. When the economic
crisis struck, the new CPS 2009–13 was at an advanced stage of preparation. AsDB and the
government agreed to postpone finalization of the CPS until the economy had stabilized and
implementation of the government's medium-term plans resumed. For the meantime, the
Country Operations Business Plan 2009–12 has been prepared, which is specifically designed
to the challenges posed by Mongolia's deteriorating economic environment.
Mongolia’s 2009–10 country ADF allocation was set at $91.1 million, of which half has been
made available as grants. An additional $27.9 million was made available from the resources

identified to address the global financial crisis. Three regional projects have also been
included in the program for a total amount of $56.0 million. For 2009, AsDB provided a
$60 million Social Sector Support Program (SSSP). The Program is cofinanced by the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, under a parallel cofinancing arrangement, for an amount
of $50 million. The SSSP will assist the government to protect and improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of social sector outlays geared to the needs of the poor, while providing a
program loan and grant to supplement the assistance provided by the IMF and other
development partners.

ANNEX IV. MONGOLIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance, but further improvements are needed,
especially on national accounts and government finance statistics. There is also a need for
broadening the dissemination of macroeconomic data to the public. Mongolia participates in
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). A data ROSC mission visited Mongolia in
September 2007 to update the May 2000 assessment of the macroeconomic statistics against
the GDDS, complemented by an assessment of data quality based on the IMF’s Data Quality
Assessment Framework.
The IMF Statistics Department has provided support to the National Statistics Office (NSO)
in implementing its Program of Statistics Development for 2006–10. It aimed to strengthen
the statistical capacity in conformity with the GDDS plans for improvement and to place
Mongolia in a position to subscribe the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
On national accounts and price statistics, deficiencies persist in the annual and quarterly
production accounts that detract from the accuracy of the data, including the estimation of
capital formation and deflators to derive constant price estimates of GDP. While a proper
methodological treatment of animal losses due to harsh winters has been finalized, efforts are
needed to improve coverage of the informal sector and small-scale activity, especially in the
services sector. Furthermore, the construction of expenditure-based national accounts in
constant price terms would serve as a useful check for the production side estimates.
Experimental estimates, requiring some further refinements, were produced in August 2008.
The first real sector technical assistance mission following the September 2007 ROSC took
place in November 2007, and the final mission in August 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure-derived
weights from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey . The NSO has published
a national CPI for Ulaanbaatar and 21 aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and a housing
price index since October 2008. Progress is still needed on wages and earnings data. The
August 2008 mission reviewed the CPI and provided the appropriate worksheets to address
some issues. Development of the producer price index for mining, manufacturing, and
electricity is complete. A retail price index and a construction index were under development
in 2008.
The concepts and definitions used to compile fiscal statistics generally follow the guidelines
of the GFSM 1986. No formal decision has yet been taken on adopting a migration path to
the GFSM 2001 methodology, although the new framework is planned to be used for
compiling fiscal statistics. The classifications used for sub-annual and annual fiscal statistics
follow broadly the classifications of the GFSM 1986, but with some differences for
financing.

14

Monetary and financial statistics broadly conform to the concepts and definitions of the
MFSM methodology. The Bank of Mongolia’s (BOM’s) monetary survey covers the central
bank and 16 operating commercial banks, but excludes savings and credit unions, which
increasingly compete with commercial banks in collecting deposits from households. The
September 2006 STA mission recommended actions aimed at correcting misreporting of
government deposit data by commercial banks. The June 2008 mission recommendations
include extending the coverage of monetary statistics to include savings and credit unions as
depository corporations and collecting supplementary data, such as repurchase agreements,
accrued interest, and financial derivatives, from commercial banks. The September 2009
mission provided recommendations to reconcile the BOM and the Ministry of Finance data
on government financing, and finalized the standardized report forms for the BOM and other
depository corporations for the International Financial Statistics publication. The mission
also recommended to include data on nonbank financial institutions (microfinance
companies) in the compilation of financial corporations survey.
Regarding balance of payments statistics, the BOM follows the concepts and methods in the
Balance of Payment Manual fifth edition. The BOM has started disseminating the balance of
payments according to the IMF standard presentation table and the international investment
position from the third quarter of 2009. The coverage has been widened by extending the
International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) to nonbank financial institutions and by
increasing the number of direct reporting private enterprises as a result of the semi-annual
external sector statistics seminar. Further improvement is needed in the analysis of balance of
payments and the quarterly survey on direct investment of foreign investment enterprises.
As regards dissemination, the NSC publishes monthly and annual Statistical Bulletins in
English and Mongolian. These publications include data on population, employment,
national accounts, prices, household income and expenditure, central and local government
revenue and expenditure, and external trade. The BOM publishes an Annual Report and a
monthly Statistical Bulletin, which includes summary statistics for the central bank,
consolidated balance sheet for commercial banks, and interest and exchange rate data.

Debt Sustainability Analysis under the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income
Countries1
Approved by Nigel Chalk and Dhaneshwar Ghura
December 7, 2009

Based on the external Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Mongolia’s risk of debt distress
remains low.2 Although the debt ratios will rise significantly over the next two years with the
government receiving front-loaded foreign financing, the debt outlook is expected to recover
and improve over the medium term. The public DSA suggests that in light of the signing of
the Oyu Tolgoi mining agreement, domestic debt is expected to rise significantly in the
medium term. However, risks are mitigated by the future associated mineral revenues
starting in 2013 and do not lead to a different sustainability assessment than under the
external DSA.
A. Background
1.
This update reflects new information regarding the recently signed Oyu Tolgoi
mining agreement and its impact on the short-, medium-, and long-term outlook. This
update assumes that maintaining prudent macroeconomic and structural policies, including
establishing a fiscal framework to avoid pro-cyclical policies, will be key for Mongolia to
resume sustainable growth. Specifically, in light of tight financing conditions in the coming
years, there is little choice but to continue fiscal adjustment until revenues from the Oyu
Tolgoi mine, net of amortization, start to hit the budget (around 2016). Good macroeconomic
policies will also help avoiding the “resource curse” which will represent a major challenge.
2.
The nonconcessional debt limit under the program is linked with the debt
sustainability analysis. The program includes a 35 percent minimum concessionality
requirement but with added flexibility on nonconcessional external debt.3 Under this ceiling
1

This is a Fund staff update to the joint World Bank/IMF DSA presented in the report for the request
for SBA (Country Report No. 09/130). The fiscal year for Mongolia is January-December.
2

Mongolia is rated as a medium performer based on the 2008 World Bank’s Country Performance and
Institutional Assessment Index and the debt sustainability uses the indicative threshold indicators for countries
in this category.
3

Due mainly to the nonconcessional nature of the SBA, the average grant element of total new borrowing falls
to 24–27 percent in 2009–10.

2
US$100 million have been used, of which $75 million have been disbursed for gold
operation financing and which are expected to be fully repaid in 2010.
B. Developments in 2009
3.
This year was marked by the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement.
Economic activity has slowed more than expected in 2009, but a sharp rebound is projected,
driven largely by capital expenditures related to the Oyu Tolgoi mine. In addition, copper
prices are rebounding, mainly driven by renewed Chinese demand, and are projected to
be 20 percent higher on average over the medium term and 4 percent in the long-term than
projected in the SBA request.
4.
Several other major mining projects are being explored which could further
improve the outlook. The Tavan Tolgoi deposit, close to the border with China, could
transform Mongolia into a major world coal producer. Other investment projects are being
considered to tap into Mongolia’s vast mineral resources.
5.
Domestic debt will increase due to borrowing agreements signed with the mining
conglomerate. The government will borrow US$250 million for budget financing and
around $540 million to finance its 34 percent equity share in the project. As both loans will
be contracted from a resident company, their impact is reflected in the public DSA. The
advance payments for the Oyu Tolgoi project will be saved in 2010 in order to meet the 2011
financing needs and beyond.4
6.
The banking system’s financial position has been deteriorating. Costs associated
with the restructuring will be fiscalized through the issuance of government bonds in
2009–10 at an estimated 8 percent of GDP. The injection of public funds will be tied to
governance and structural reforms.
C. Medium-Term Macro and DSA Assumptions
7.
Compared to the previous DSA, the macroeconomic outlook has improved,
supported by Mongolia’s strong policy implementation under the SBA-supported
program. Market conditions have improved and monetary policy has brought down inflation
and rebuilt international reserves with comfortable margins compared to program objectives.
In addition, copper prices have been buoyed by restocking in China. Short-term prospects
depend on the speed of economic recovery in China, the main recipient of Mongolian
exports, and in the rest of the world.

4

These loans are expected to be repaid in 2014–17. The advance payment loans will be repaid from the general
budget while government’s equity share borrowing will be repaid from accrued dividends (the government will
not be liable for the loan in the unlikely event that dividends are insufficient).

 The real GDP growth outlook is
dominated by the Oyu Tolgoi mine.
Real growth is expected to bottom-out
in 2009 at -1 percent and to rebound
to over 8 percent in 2010, boosted by
Oyu Tolgoi-related capital
expenditures. Once production from
the Oyu Tolgoi mine starts in 2013, it
will boost growth up to 25 percent.
Real GDP growth is expected to
average 11 percent over the medium
term, taking into account the impact
on the nonmineral economy.

 The balance of payments will go through large swings. The current account will remain in deficit
until 2012 due to large imports of mining-related investment goods. As the project comes on stream,
it will jump into a surplus in 2013 and, as the project tapers off, converge to a surplus of 1 percent of
GDP by 2029.

restraining expenditure growth during periods of high mineral revenues and enable the authorities to
save a substantial fraction of mineral revenues.

8.
The baseline assumes a strong institutional framework and macroeconomic
policies to minimize Dutch disease effects. Following the surge in mining production from
the Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia will likely experience a substantial real appreciation creating
challenges to maintaining low inflation and developing the nonmineral economy. The
baseline assumes a restrained fiscal policy, supported by the adoption of a Fiscal
Responsibility Law, and a flexible exchange rate so that real exchange rate pressures feed
though the nominal exchange rate. Finally, it assumes that structural fiscal reforms including
pensions, civil service, and subsidy reforms will contribute to improve the business climate
and the overall competitiveness of the economy. The authorities have made progress in
becoming Extractive Transparency Industry Initiative (EITI) compliant by next year.

Mongolia’s external risk of debt distress remains low (Figure. 1). External debt
ratios will remain broadly in line with the previous DSA over the medium term. Conversely,
comparing the previous baseline debt ratios using the same respective PV of debt does not
show a substantial difference. The
Public Sector Debt-to-GDP Ratio
one-off borrowing in 2009–10 will
80
lead to a temporary but significant
70

increase in the level of public debt

60
but will fall rapidly in 2012–14. The
50
debt service-to-exports and debt
40
service-to-revenues ratios will peak
30
in 2011–12 but will stay below the
20
threshold. Pursuing fiscal adjustment
10
in the period before the mining
0
project comes into stream will be key.
10.
Stress testing shows that a one-time 30 percent exchange rate depreciation relative to
the baseline in 2010 would breach the threshold over the 2010-12 period. However, with the
Oyu Tolgoi mine starting production in 2013, the adverse effects of the depreciation would
be gradually unwound. The exceptional access under the SBA and the broad program
framework have bolstered international reserves and restored confidence in the currency
making the probability of a depreciation of this magnitude relatively low.

The risks for fiscal sustainability have increased over the medium term but
remain low (Figure 2). The baseline
Government Deposits (Cumulative, in millions of US$)
includes (i) fiscalization of the banking

sector losses through domestic bond
800

issuances, and (ii) loans to the
600
government from the local mining
500

company for acquiring the
300
government’s equity share and a pre200
100
payment on future revenues. However,
0
the government will receive dividends
from its 34 percent equity share and
government deposits are expected to increase providing a comfortable fiscal reserve cushion.

The scenario assumes a more sizable real appreciation than the baseline. When

scenario assumes a significant real exchange rate appreciation and a deterioration in the
current account balance over the long term. However, this country-specific alternative
scenario does not result in indicators significantly breaching thresholds.
F. Conclusions
13.
The overall assessment has not changed with the last DSA and the external DSA
indicates that Mongolia remains at low risk of external debt distress. The short-term
macroeconomic outlook has improved due to strong performance under the SBA and a more
favorable global outlook than envisaged at the outset of the program. The increase in
domestic debt, albeit from a low level, does not lead to a different sustainability assessment
that under the external DSA.

5

In the last joint Bank-Fund DSA (Country Report No. 09/130), a 20 percent lower copper price than in the
baseline scenario (US$4,500/ton vs. US$5,100/ton in the current baseline) during 2010–15 showed that the
economy remained vulnerable to changes in commodity prices despite the substantial increase in export
volumes expected with the Oyu Tolgoi mining project.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Mongolia
On December 22, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mongolia.1
Background
The global economic crisis and collapse in copper prices in 2008 hit the Mongolian
economy hard. The loose macro-policies and tightly managed exchange rate pursued
during the preceding boom years had made the economy particularly vulnerable and the
situation deteriorated markedly earlier in 2009. The authorities then adopted an ambitious
adjustment program supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement that, thanks to their strong
policy implementation, has helped to quickly stabilize the economy.
After averaging 9 percent during 2004–08, real growth is expected to be slightly negative in
2009 as a result of the global crisis and the necessary tightening of policies. Nevertheless,
the economy is now bottoming out and is projected to recover strongly in 2010 driven by
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

investment in the Oyu Tolgoi mining project. Inflation, after peaking at over 30 percent in
2008, has declined sharply in recent months and is expected to settle at around 6 percent
by end-2010. Medium-term prospects are favorable as Mongolia stands to benefit
enormously from its vast mineral deposits and growth is expected to accelerate sharply
around 2013 when production at the Oyu Tolgoi mine begins.
The authorities are making progress toward restoring health to public finances. An
ambitious fiscal consolidation in 2009 is helping to unwind the considerable loosening of
fiscal policy that took place during 2007–08. The budget deficit is projected to be 6½
percent of GDP for 2009 and 5 percent of GDP for 2010. Moreover, the authorities are
committed to adjust spending, if needed, to offset any revenue shortfalls but to save any
revenue over-performance. The government aims to adopt by early 2010 a Fiscal
Responsibility Law to lock in fiscal discipline and a comprehensive social transfer reform to
increase benefits to low-income households.
Exchange rate and monetary policies implemented earlier in 2009, especially the hike in
interest rates, were instrumental in stabilizing market conditions. Since then, the authorities
have appropriately lowered interest rates in line with the sharp decline in inflation and
evolving market conditions. The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate
and a monetary policy geared toward low inflation and safeguarding international reserves.
The rapid expansion of credit during the boom years is now taking its toll on the banking
system. The central bank is committed to strengthening the banking system and, as
needed, acting promptly and decisively to bolster confidence. Two troubled banks were put
into receivership in late November 2009 and the authorities are preparing a comprehensive
bank restructuring plan with Fund staff assistance. The authorities already have in place an
emergency facility for liquidity support and a blanket deposit guarantee which provide a
strong basis for maintaining financial stability. Progress has also been made in
strengthening supervision and a new Banking Law has been submitted to Parliament.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mongolian authorities’ continued strong performance
under the Stand-By Arrangement. The economy has weathered the worst of the global
crisis and is projected to rebound strongly in 2010, driven by investment in the Oyu Tolgoi
mining project. The medium-term prospects are also favorable given Mongolia’s vast
mineral wealth, although prudent macroeconomic management will be required to ensure
that these resources translate into prosperity for all of its citizens.
Directors supported the authorities’ policy priorities to restore health to public finances,
rebuild international reserves while maintaining a flexible exchange rate, bolster confidence
in the banking system, and protect the poor. They cautioned that a return to the procyclical
policy mix of 2007–08, even with relatively high copper prices, could lead to a repeat of the
fiscal and balance of payments pressures experienced earlier in 2009.
Directors saw the ambitious fiscal consolidation already undertaken as a good down
payment on unwinding past fiscal loosening. They stressed that continued fiscal adjustment,

3

in particular expenditure rationalization, will be essential to fully restore health to
government finances.
In this regard, many Directors observed that the 2010 budget, as amended, implies only a
modest adjustment. However, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to
limit the 2010 fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP by adjusting spending, as needed, and to
save any revenue over-performance. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to save
the advance tax prepayment from Oyu Tolgoi mines to meet future financing needs. The
authorities should be cautious in undertaking new nonconcessional external borrowing.
Directors underscored the importance of implementing structural fiscal reforms to
strengthen the effectiveness of fiscal policy. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to adopt a
Fiscal Responsibility Law and an integrated budget law, which together will help
institutionalize fiscal discipline, strengthen fiscal management, and enhance fiscal
transparency. Directors expressed concerns about the increase in untargeted, universal
social transfers in the 2010 budget, and urged the authorities to promptly pass a law to
increase transfers to low-income households and improve the targeting of benefits.
Directors commended the authorities’ success in managing the exchange rate and
monetary policies. The authorities’ continued commitment to the flexible exchange rate
regime will be crucial to maintain macroeconomic stability, insulate the economy from
external shocks, and help facilitate an adjustment of the real exchange rate to structural
changes related to the development of the mineral sector. Directors considered that any
further monetary easing should be undertaken cautiously, especially as inflation is expected
to rebound in 2010. While the current targeting of monetary aggregates remains appropriate
in the near term, the authorities could consider moving toward an inflation targeting
framework over the medium term.
Directors underscored that strengthening the banking system should be a top priority. They
urged the authorities to continue to take prompt and strong actions to address problems in
individual banks, and supported the central bank’s decision to put two problem banks into
receivership. To bolster confidence, the authorities should develop comprehensive bank
restructuring plans expeditiously, building on the results of the ongoing external audits, and
continue to strengthen banking supervision. Directors also emphasized that any public
financial support to banks should be tied to governance and structural reforms of the
recipient banks, and that existing shareholders should be required to either inject new
capital or be the first to bear losses.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Mongolia
On December 22, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mongolia. 1
Background
The global economic crisis and collapse in copper prices in 2008 hit the Mongolian
economy hard. The loose macro-policies and tightly managed exchange rate pursued
during the preceding boom years had made the economy particularly vulnerable and the
situation deteriorated markedly earlier in 2009. The authorities then adopted an ambitious
adjustment program supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement that, thanks to their strong
policy implementation, has helped to quickly stabilize the economy.
After averaging 9 percent during 2004–08, real growth is expected to be slightly negative in
2009 as a result of the global crisis and the necessary tightening of policies. Nevertheless,
the economy is now bottoming out and is projected to recover strongly in 2010 driven by
investment in the Oyu Tolgoi mining project. Inflation, after peaking at over 30 percent in
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Statement by Hi-Su Lee, Executive Director for Mongolia
and Suk-Kwon Na, Alternate Executive Director
December 22, 2009

The Mongolian authorities wish to express their utmost appreciation to the Fund and its staff for their
constructive cooperation thus far in resolving the economic crisis facing the authorities. The recent
signs of economic stabilization are a product of the authorities’ strong policy implementation and the
Fund’s full-fledged advice through the recurring consultations and extensive technical assistance
missions.
Macroeconomic Outlook
2.
Compared to the average 9 percent real growth during 2004-08, this year’s growth has shrunk
due to the globally-evolving crisis and the sharp decline in the price of copper. Nonetheless, it is very
encouraging that the authorities and staff have agreed that the Mongolian economy is bottoming out
and stands ready to recover at a strong pace to above 8 percent next year. A major international
agreement for the development of the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mine in October 2009 has provided
meaningful momentum for this recovery, concurrently stimulating significant structural changes in
the economy. The role of the mining sector will likely increase with OT mining production starting in
2013, thus the medium-term macroeconomic outlook seems favorable. However, given the policy
challenges in the period ahead, the authorities will strive to adopt prudent and premeditated
macroeconomic management to maximize the contribution of their mineral wealth into economic
success.
3.
Double-digit high inflation rate in the recent boom-bust period has dropped sharply and will
be stabilized at a stable low level of 2 percent at end-December and below 8 percent at end-2010,
compared to staff’s projection of 6 percent at end-2010. The current account balance has
considerably improved from -14 percent of GDP last year to around -4 percent this year, owing to the
big drop in imports and increasing copper price. Although there will be some deterioration in the
current account balance in the near future in relation to OT-related investments and imports, the
current account in the medium-term is expected to show large surpluses as OT mining starts
production soon while, in the interim, expected short-term deficit could be financed by FDI inflows
and private loans.
Program Performance and Objectives Forward
4.
As well noted by staff, all performance criteria for the third review were successfully met.
The scope of the breach in the indicative target of the government deficit for end-September is
minimal enough to be addressed. Related to this, the authorities are confident that the end-December
fiscal target will be comfortably observed, given the expected pick-up in mineral revenue in the
fourth quarter. Even though there is a modest delay in some structural benchmarks, these are mostly
technical matters and, accordingly, the authorities have displayed meaningful progress at the crucial
points and are committed to achieving them in due course.
5.
The authorities reaffirmed their strong commitment to the policy objectives forward, as well
pointed out in their Letter of Intent. Aiming to achieve a strong, sustainable and equitable growth

coupled with low inflation and prudent public finances, they place a strong emphasis on crucial
reform measures, targeting at strengthening the banking system, restoring health to the budget and
maintaining a flexible exchange rate. Given the considerable risks in the years ahead, they will take
prompt and decisive actions to cope with imminent problems on one hand, and take forward-looking
and productivity-enhancing measures on the other hand.
Fiscal Policy
6.
Despite the determined fiscal consolidation undertaken this year, the first priority still remains
to make public finance healthier and sustainable. The authorities fully agree with staff that fiscal
restraint will be warranted for several years ahead to bring government finance into a sustainable
path. Thus, they are committed to sticking to the budget deficit of 6½ percent of GDP for 2009 and 5
percent in 2010. With regard to the gold mining-related loan that was carried out earlier this year, the
authorities will try their best to encourage banks to repay their budget for the net lending to the gold
mining sector.
7.
It is pleasing to note that the authorities’ debt distress level remains low and their debt outlook
is expected to recover and improve over the medium term owing to foreseen mineral revenues
starting in 2013, despite some increase in debt ratio over the next two years. Staff’s various concerns
with respect to the 2010 budget were fully delivered to the authorities, encouraging their cautious and
deliberate implementation of the budget. Going forward, the fiscal situation in the near future will
deteriorate with the elimination of the windfall profit tax in 2011, as well as the decrease in donor
budgetary support. Staff’s well-prepared briefing on the medium-term projection with regard to
expected mineral revenues has helped the authorities to fully recognize the importance of fiscal
prudence in a consistent manner. In this environment, the authorities reaffirm that any possible
revenue shortfall lower than that projected in the budget will be fully compensated by a reduction in
spending, while more revenue surplus than the budget forecast will be saved for future needs and for
counter-cyclicality purposes. Mindful of staff’s advice on the need for observing fiscal prudence until
the time of sustainable mineral revenues, the authorities strongly commit to continue their efforts for
fiscal adjustment in 2010 and onwards.
8.
From the institutional viewpoint, the authorities will submit to Parliament by end-December a
Fiscal Responsibility Law, as well as a complementary organic budget law, with the aim of obtaining
approval for them by February 1, 2010. These laws would substantially contribute to promoting fiscal
discipline by establishing numerical rules that would effectively control fiscal balance, government
debt, and spending growth.
9.
A social transfer is another big item for both better assisting the poor and the needy and
creating fiscal saving by better targeting. Although there have been some setbacks in the upgrading
system thus far, the authorities will soon submit the new social transfer reform law to Parliament in
order to achieve the aforementioned goals, aiming at passing the law by February 1, 2010. Given
that one major concern for the delay in this reform was institutional weakness in identifying the poor,
the authorities will strive to improve their capacity for effective means-testing. In this light, the
authorities appreciate the support of donors in preparing this reform, and will stand receptive to the
advice from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
10.
The authorities have weathered the turbulent period with well-considered monetary policy –
the hike in policy rate earlier this year and the timely and appropriate reduction consistent with
market situations – following the Fund’s advice. For the time being, their key objective for monetary
policy will remain unchanged at maintaining low inflation and contributing to macroeconomic
stability. While closely monitoring the inflation development, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) will
continue to take a vigilant and cautious stance in preserving international reserves and adjusting
interest rates, which should be prudent and in line with evolving market conditions. Going forward,
for the medium-term goal of introducing an inflation targeting framework, they will invest sufficient
efforts to lay the technical foundation step by step, including by improving inflation forecasting and
advancing the monetary transmission channel.
11.
The authorities fully agree with staff that a flexible exchange rate would be an undisputable
factor to relieve terms of trade volatility and prevent higher inflation which would mainly emanate
from operation of OT mining in 2013. In light of this, their intervention will focus on smoothing
excess volatility caused by temporary imbalances and thus make the exchange rate determined in line
with market conditions. They welcome staff’s estimation that the current level of the real exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Banking System
12.
The authorities are well cognizant that, despite the recent success in addressing the crisis by
the help of the program, fragilities in the banking sector respectively and as a whole still remain as
the Achilles’ heel to the Mongolian economy, for the time being. The authorities highlight that
bolstering the integrity of and confidence in the banking system are one of the key objectives to be
achieved at current juncture, so that they are committed to responding proactively and vigorously to
deal with problems in individual banks, as they arise.
13.
The issue of Anod and Zoos banks has been timely addressed by the authorities’ suitable
measures depending on their own situations, such as appointing a receiver and accelerating the
liquidating process. In particular, proactive measures are being considered in dealing with Zoos
Bank, coupled with an external audit currently underway. On the other hand, the authorities are now
striving to prevent the recent deposit outflow at Zoos Bank from happening at the other banks. The
injection of public money, which is ensured to restructure the banking system, will be deliberately
implemented in a way to improve governance and facilitate structural reforms at the recipient bank.
14.
The authorities fully note that the banking system itself still faces challenges, like increasing
non-performing assets and deteriorating capital adequacy ratios, along with some concern about the
integrity of the current loan provisioning system. In dealing with the latter problem, the authorities
intend to increase the effectiveness of such system by clarifying the definition and tightening the
relevant rules, as well as by obligating regular reporting. They welcome the well-deliberated
discussion with staff on contingency plans in case of additional bank distress, and also continue to
strengthen their supervision efforts and to fully enforce all regulatory requirements on hand for all
banks. In terms of legal framework, they will redouble their efforts in passing the pending revised
Banking Law and continue to seek the options for a robust legal and regulatory system.

Other Issues
15.
There has been some reshuffling in the cabinet in late-October after the presidential election
in May 2009. The newly-elected Prime Minister clearly delivered his and his administration’s firm
political ownership of the Fund’s program during the meeting with the mission team, while
commending the Fund for its timely and insightful policy advice in getting out of the crisis. In detail,
the authorities are committed to keeping the non-concessional debt within the program ceiling by
prudent management and continue to maintain the current prohibition on government guarantees as a
disciplinary measure. They also underscored their sustained commitment to resolve the remaining
bilateral official arrears within the foreseeable future.

As a resource-abundant country, the authorities have made progress in becoming a member of
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Increased transparency in the mining sector,
along with fiscal consolidation efforts, would constitute a conduit for preventing recurrence of the
past boom-bust cycle and ultimately contribute to sustainable and stable economy. The government’s
free trade and investment policies need to be pursued more rigorously in preparation for the aftercrisis period.
Conclusion

Given that the authorities are not free from various policy challenges, they continue to
maintain a cautious and proactive stance in managing their economic policies. Rather than being
complacent with achievements made thus far, they intend to focus on possible threatening matters
which they could face during the recovery period, while robustly contemplating on the possible
optimal options. The authorities believe that the frequent and close consultations with the Fund on the
important policy measures are essential in swiftly stabilizing economy. In this regard, staff deserve
the credit for their timely and effective advice on fiscal and banking areas. Spurred by the assistance
from the Fund and donors, the authorities stand ready to take additional measures, if necessary, to
accomplish the government’s social and economic objectives under the SBA.

In conclusion, my Mongolian authorities wish to express their exceptional appreciation to the
Fund and its staff for their sustained and appropriate policy advice in resolving the current crisis and
further instituting the fundamentals of a sustainable economy. They also extend their deepest
gratitude to the Fund’s mission chief, Mr. Steven Barnett, and his team for their hard work and
precious advice in setting up Mongolia’s economic reform program.
