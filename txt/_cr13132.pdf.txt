STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 29, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic growth has been sluggish since 2010, while a gradual fiscal
consolidation under a Fund arrangement stalled in late 2011, leaving the public debt on
an upward trend and raising external vulnerabilities. El Salvador faces a prolonged
electoral period, with presidential elections in February 2014 and congressional elections
one year later; this may constrain the scope for policy action.
Outlook. Economic growth is expected to remain sluggish and the fiscal deficit is
unlikely to decline exacerbating financing pressures. Main risks to the outlook stem from
lower-than-envisaged growth in the U.S. economy and loss of confidence during the
electoral period. Key challenges facing the economy are to increase potential growth
(which for many years has lagged behind regional averages), reduce the fiscal deficit and
the level of public debt, and rebuild the buffers of the dollarized economy to deal with
shocks.
Focus of the consultation. Discussions centered on the appropriate policies to ensure
economic stability during the transition to a new government in mid-2014 and tackle
longer-term challenges. Staff urged the authorities and presidential candidates to start a
national dialogue on the key economic challenges, especially on fiscal sustainability,
during the prolonged election.


Near-term policies. Policies should give priority to stabilizing the public debtto-GDP ratio and closing identified financing gaps, through a fiscal effort of
some 2 percent of GDP in 2013-14, while reinforcing liquidity buffers in the
banking system.



Medium-term strategy. The goal to increase El Salvador’s potential output
growth to regional levels should be facilitated by enhancing competitiveness,
improving the business climate, and deepening banking reforms. Several years
of strong fiscal performance, anchored on strict control of current expenditure
and higher tax revenues, would be necessary to underpin the strategy.

OVERVIEW
1.
El Salvador’s economy recovered slowly from the global financial crisis of 2008-09.
Output growth was sluggish in 2010-11, as low rates of domestic investment, low competitiveness,
and a weather related-shock held back the recovery. The large fiscal stimulus allowed in 2009-10 to
mitigate the negative impact of the global crisis elevated the fiscal deficit and public debt. At the
same time, the fully-dollarized regime firmly anchored a low rate of inflation.
2.
Performance under a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the Fund was mixed. Under
the 3-year precautionary SBA, the authorities preserved financial stability and adopted successive tax
reforms. However, fiscal consolidation stalled in late 2011, as strong political opposition
discontinued the revenue and expenditure policies envisaged under the arrangement. The third
review of the SBA was completed in September 2011, and since the authorities and staff did not
reach agreement on policies in the ensuing period, the SBA expired in March 2013 (Box 1).
3.
The government has indicated that it is committed to prudent policies through the
end of its five-year term in June 2014. The authorities began a dialogue on fiscal policy options
with all political parties in October 2012. Presidential candidates are aware of the risks associated
with the weakened fiscal position and agree that a high-level dialogue would be useful to enable
corrective actions. However, a divided political landscape may hinder the dialogue.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

continued in early 2013 (Figures 1 and 2). Persistently

5.
The external current account deficit
widened to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2012. A decline in export prices (mainly coffee) and higher
profit repatriation pushed the deficit up, despite some pickup in workers’ remittances. Borrowing by
the public sector and commercial banks, and foreign investment covered most of the current
account deficit; excluding an Eurobond placed in late 2012 (see below), the underlying balance of
payments in 2012 recorded a small deficit (Figure 3). At end-2012, the gross international reserve
position was US$3.2 billion, about three-fourths of the level that may be considered “adequate” for
El Salvador (Annex II).

7.
The government’s financing needs were large. Government financing requirements
reached $1.9 billion (7.9 percent of GDP) in 2012 and were covered by increased reliance on shortterm debt (Letes) and borrowing from commercial banks, driving up the cost of borrowing (Figure
4). In November 2012, the government tapped the Eurobond market, for the third time in four years,
and placed a 12-year bond for US$800 million (3¼ percent of GDP).1 Resources from the placement
are being used to prepay short-term debt. Excluding this operation, the public debt rose to
54¼ percent of GDP at end-2012, from 52¼ percent a year earlier.
8.
The financial system remains sound. Banks appear to be well capitalized and liquid, with
low overdue loans and adequate provisioning. While the exposure of the banking system to public
debt was substantial at end-2012 (45 percent of capital), it has declined by more than one-half
following the debt pre-payment noted above. With bank deposits growing modestly, banks
borrowed abroad to accommodate a moderate increase in credit demand from the private sector,
and a declining trend in lending rates recorded since 2009 was slightly reversed (Figure 5).

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Staff presented a baseline scenario to anchor the discussions. The scenario assumed a
continuation of current policies and real GDP growth of 1½ percent in 2013-14 and 2 percent over
the medium term. Domestic investment was assumed to remain subdued, constrained by structural
weaknesses and a wait-and-see attitude during the electoral period. Inflation was projected to hover
around the level of key trading partners. Despite the projected decline in oil prices, the external
current account deficit was projected to remain at about 4½ percent of GDP per year, largely
reflecting the sizable fiscal deficit.
10.
The scenario highlighted the looming difficulties in financing the fiscal deficit. Under
current policies, the fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize at about 4 percent of GDP which would

previous two placements made in 2009 and 2011 had maturities of 10 and 30 years and carried an average yield of
7⅜ and 7⅝ percent, respectively.

make the public debt dynamics unsustainable over the long term. While the successful Eurobond
issuance has reduced immediate financing risks, identified financing gaps over the medium term
would leave El Salvador vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. Persistently large government
financing requirements, if covered with short-term financing, would increase borrowing costs and
rollover risks, further weakening the debt dynamics (Annex IV).
11.
External competitiveness would remain low. While the real effective exchange rate
appears to be broadly consistent with fundamentals (see Annex II), other indicators suggest a steady
loss of competitiveness and deterioration in investment climate in recent years. This could be
intensified if the government’s plan to increase the minimum wage by 10 percent this year
materializes. Over time, low competitiveness would pose risks to the stability of the balance of
payments.

Risks to the scenario are tilted to the downside (Box 3).



External conditions. Weaker-than-expected U.S. growth, e.g., due to fiscal shocks, would have
adverse spillovers, through exports and remittances, on El Salvador’s economic activity and
tax revenue. The scope for inward real spillovers from neighboring countries, however,
appears to be modest (Annex III). Higher-than-projected world oil prices would widen the
external current account deficit, weaken growth, and possibly, deteriorate the fiscal accounts
through higher energy subsidies. An increase in investor risk aversion, whether caused by a
global or regional shock (e.g., reflecting developments in neighboring countries), could raise
borrowing costs and limit access to international capital markets by banks and the
government.



Policy implementation. Spending pressures in the run-up to the upcoming two rounds of
elections may increase the fiscal deficit above 4 percent of GDP in 2013-14. This would
accelerate the deterioration of the public debt dynamics (which is highly sensitive to shocks
to the primary balance, growth, and interest rates, as indicated by staff simulations) relative

Confidence shocks. Electoral uncertainty and
concerns about fiscal solvency may trigger
deposit outflows. In the absence of a lender-oflast resort, this may deteriorate borrowing
conditions and weaken economic activity, in
turn affecting tax revenue. In response, a strong
front-loaded fiscal adjustment may be necessary.

13.
The authorities considered that the baseline scenario was too pessimistic. They were of
the view that ongoing improvements in the investment climate would support a pick-up in growth
in 2013-14, and that the ongoing fiscal dialogue would enable revenue measures that would help
lower the fiscal deficit in 2013 and reach broad agreements on a fiscal consolidation strategy (¶15).
The authorities reiterated their view that staff’s public debt dynamics were unduly influenced by
pension payments, and that sustainability risks were lower than suggested by staff because those
payments are covered with resources from private pension funds (see Box 2).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions focused on the contours of a strategy to safeguard macroeconomic
stability in the near term and enhance the resilience of the economy over the medium term.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the near-term priority should be to reduce vulnerabilities
during the electoral period and the transition to the new government by strengthening the fiscal
position and increasing banks’ liquidity buffers. There was also agreement that the medium-term
strategy should focus on improving conditions for private-sector led growth, maintaining
sustainable public finances, and completing ongoing financial reforms to strengthen buffers. Staff
encouraged the authorities and presidential candidates to transform the ongoing fiscal dialogue
into a national dialogue to build support for this strategy.

A. Near-term Policies
Safeguarding macro stability
15.
The authorities aim at lowering the fiscal deficit to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013 and
3 percent in 2014. They expect to propose new tax revenue measures to congress by mid-year and
have taken steps to control spending, including by reducing the transportation subsidy. The
authorities estimated that these actions would yield fiscal savings of about 1 percent of GDP on an

annual basis.2 3 The 2014 budget would incorporate the full-year impact of these actions, resulting in
a further decline in the deficit. Staff welcomed the fiscal efforts but cautioned that, under more
conservative revenue projections and including election-related spending, the fiscal deficit may
remain at about 4 percent of GDP during 2013-14 and give rise to financing pressures.
16.
Staff recommended more ambitious fiscal targets for 2013 and 2014. To stabilize the
debt ratio, staff advised the authorities to set a fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in 2013 and
2 percent in 2014. Staff acknowledged that these more ambitious targets may have an adverse
impact on economic activity, but argued that these costs would be smaller than those implied by the
adjustment that would be necessary if downside risks materialize. Staff proposed the following
measures to attain the proposed reduction in the deficit:


On the financing side, staff supported plans to amortize the short-term debt to reduce
costs and rollover risks, and encouraged the authorities to secure as early as possible the
long-term financing to cover the projected deficits for 2013-14.

2
Planned revenue measures include: (i) a financial transaction tax of 0.25 percent on bank operations by economic
agents above US$500; (ii) a property tax of 1 percent on urban real estate with value above US$350,000, and (iii)
removal of income tax exemptions to newspaper and book-publishing companies; with an expected combined yield
of 0.3 percent of GDP.
3

Other expenditure measures include: (i) extending a freeze on selected current outlays; (ii) reducing the cost of the
subsidy on propane gas; and (iii) limiting the carryover of unspent appropriations from previous budgets.
4

The financial activity tax is levied on a measure of the value added of the financial system (profits and wages paid
by institutions). This tax does not appear to discourage financial intermediation, while the financial transaction tax
tends to reduce bank services, as agents try to avoid paying the tax.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The authorities were in broad agreement with staff recommendations, but noted that the feasibility
of additional measures during 2013-14 depended critically on reaching consensus with other
political parties. If that consensus proved elusive, the authorities would give priority to securing new
external financing at reasonable terms to cover the fiscal deficit.
17.
There was agreement that banks would benefit from maintaining relatively large
liquidity buffers during the electoral period. The capital buffers currently held by banks seem
sufficient to manage high credit risk, including from exposure to the public sector.5 Banks may also
be able to accommodate moderate deposits losses (of up to 10 percent of total deposits), but
higher buffers are desirable given the large share of short-term deposits. The authorities also noted
that resource constraints are making it difficult to activate the newly-created lender-of-last-resort
facility, and said that they are considering a transitory increase in liquidity requirements to underpin
financial stability.

B. Medium-term Challenges
Improving growth prospects
18.
The authorities agreed that it is necessary to develop broad-based consensus on a
medium-term growth strategy for El Salvador. For many years, growth and domestic investment
in El Salvador have been much lower than in neighboring countries. Main stakeholders are aware
that the key to unleash growth resides in policies that enhance human capital, upgrade
infrastructure, lower the cost of doing business, and develop local capital markets. Nonetheless,
support for undertaking those policies has been half-hearted. Staff’s estimates show that closing the
investment gap (of up to 10 percent of GDP) with the region or with Chile, Mexico, and Peru could
raise El Salvador’s potential growth to 4-4½ percent per year (see Annex I).
19.
Staff supported the government’s initiatives to promote investment, which could help
improve conditions for growth. Staff cautioned the authorities to not make the initiatives
dependent on costly tax exemptions or new fiscal contingencies, and advised to continue reducing
crime and perceived corruption by mobilizing the anti-money laundering (AML) framework.6 The
authorities’ initiatives cover two broad areas:


Private sector participation on infrastructure projects. The authorities are encouraging
private sector participation in the management of the major port, the expansion of the main
airport, and new projects for electricity generation and public transportation. In addition, the
authorities expect that ongoing initiatives to develop the coastal area, provide support to
low-income farmers, and set up a public-private partnership framework (PPPs) would boost

5

Based on previous technical assistance, the authorities prepared stress tests that revealed low vulnerability to credit
risk arising from a prolonged period of lower output growth than that assumed in the baseline projection.
6

This should include measures to mitigate the risk posed by cash operations and ensure that politically exposed
persons are subject to enhanced customer due diligence (CDD) measures, in accordance with the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) standard.

growth in several sectors (e.g. agriculture, tourism, and high value-added manufacture). With
weak prospects for external demand, the authorities noted that renewed focus on regional
integration could raise export growth. Staff advised the authorities to strengthen capacity to
manage PPPs. In particular, they need to set up a sound legal framework (comprising
principles of value for money, transparency, and containing fiscal risks) that integrates all
costs (including contingent liabilities) in the budget and in their fiscal sustainability analysis.
The authorities agreed with this advice and expect congressional approval of this framework
by year-end.


Business climate. Steps towards improving the business climate include: (i) legislation to
reduce red tape, clarify investment rules (on contract enforcement, dispute/resolution,
electronic signature, and insolvency), and strengthen the AML framework; (ii) efforts to
continue lowering crime; and (iii) upgrading key business indicators (with assistance from
the World Bank).

Strengthening the fiscal position
20.
Staff recommended framing the national dialogue on fiscal policy in terms of
medium-term targets for public debt. There was agreement that the current level of debt was

attain those targets in the seven-year horizon.
21.
Staff welcomed recent improvements in tax administration and public financial
management. These include the creation of a special unit to monitor large taxpayers, improved
coordination between the tax and customs agencies, and further strengthening tax auditing
capacity. On the expenditure side, the authorities highlighted their plans to adopt a treasury single
account by mid-2014 and the shift to a programmatic coverage of the budget, which would
facilitate the adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework by 2015. Staff welcomed these
plans and encouraged the authorities to also develop a plan to gradually unify the budgets of the
various government entities.

22.
It was agreed, however, that the initiatives underway were not a substitute for a
strong fiscal consolidation strategy comprising both expenditure and revenue measures.


Expenditure. Staff argued that current primary spending had to be lowered gradually to the
levels prevailing prior to the 2009 crisis. The

preliminary assessment suggests that unfunded fiscal liabilities of the pension system (comprising a
public and a private component) range from 65 to 75 percent of GDP, and raises important equity
issues, as half of those liabilities represent benefits accruing to only 10 percent of affiliates (see
Box 2). Staff agreed that the assessment underscored the urgent need for parametric changes to
lower benefits, increase contributions, and extend retirement ages. The authorities noted that they
plan to work on developing a proposal to reform the pension system that could be taken by the
new government, but indicated that there was little public support for this reform.

24.
Staff advised against changes in the accounting treatment of pension liabilities. The
authorities explained their plans to absorb in the government accounts those private pension
accounts that receive defined benefits, as well as their counterpart assets (mainly, government
securities). They argued that this operation would reduce El Salvador’s public debt and make it more
comparable to neighboring countries (which have pay-as-you-go pension schemes). Staff strongly
advised against this operation, stressing that it would not remedy the underlying imbalances of the
pension system, because the gap between benefits and contributions would not be reduced, making
unfunded liabilities less transparent than at present.

The authorities are keen to complete pending financial reforms. Although financial
supervision has improved, the pace of adoption of the recommendations of the 2010 FSAP Update
has recently slowed (Box 4). The authorities intend to make further progress towards risk-based
supervision and improve cross-border consolidated supervision. In addition, they are seeking
congress’ support for frameworks to facilitate bank resolution, broaden the perimeter of supervision,
and create investment funds, though it is unclear whether sufficient support will exist before the new
government takes office. Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the reserves of the deposit
insurance fund and set up a liquidity fund in line with the new central bank’s liquidity framework.
26.
Staff advocated a gradual adoption of Basel III standards. Staff argued that El Salvador is
well placed to make the transition to Basel III standards, since banks already maintain levels of
capital and liquidity that comply with those standards (Annex V). In particular, staff recommended
the adoption of stricter definitions of capital and the introduction of new capital requirements, but
advised against reducing liquidity requirements to Basel III standards until the lender-of-last-resort
facility and the liquidity fund were activated. The authorities said that they would consider these
suggestions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Since 2010 economic growth in El Salvador has been sluggish and vulnerabilities have
risen. Although the financial system has remained sound and inflation low, anchored by full
dollarization, the recovery never gained strength. Output growth has been the lowest in Central
America, owing largely to weak private investment and severe supply constraints. The fiscal
consolidation strategy of the government, which was supported by a Fund arrangement, stalled in
late 2011 due to lack of broad political support. As a result, the fiscal deficit has hovered around
4 percent of GDP since 2010 and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has kept rising.
28.
Policy inaction in the long electoral period that lies ahead may heighten risks. Staff
advised the authorities and all political groups to initiate a national dialogue on short- and mediumterm priorities for El Salvador. The latter should comprise measures aiming at improving growth
prospects, restoring fiscal sustainability, and making the dollarized economy more resilient to
shocks.
29.
Fiscal consolidation should not be further delayed. Staff projections suggest that under
current policies the fiscal deficit would stabilize at about 4 percent of GDP during 2013-14; this level
of deficit would keep the public debt ratio on an upward path and increase financing pressures. Staff
urges the authorities to lower their fiscal deficit targets for 2013-14 to reduce these risks.
Broadening the scope of the revenue measures currently contemplated and keeping current
expenditure in check would be necessary to attain these fiscal targets. A transitory increase in
liquidity requirements, to strengthen buffers in the banking system during the electoral period,
would also be advisable.

30.
The government should promote a national dialogue to develop a medium-term
growth agenda. El Salvador’s weak growth performance is well documented and all key
stakeholders are aware of the reforms that are needed to reduce the long-standing investment gap
and unleash growth potential. The authorities should take advantage of this common understanding
of key obstacles to build broad consensus on a medium-term growth strategy. At the same time,
they should move forward with their initiatives to create a framework for PPPs, foster private
participation in infrastructure, and reduce red tape, while taking steps to prevent that these
initiatives lead to new tax exemptions or create fiscal contingencies.
31.
A strategy to strengthen the fiscal position should be the second pillar of the national
dialogue. Staff recommends framing that discussion in terms of medium-term targets for the public
debt-to-GDP ratio and aiming at reducing the public debt ratio to about 40 percent of GDP by 2020.
The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise revenue and expenditure measures including
improving the targeting of subsidies, lowering the earmarking of revenue, further reducing tax
expenditure and evasion, and raising the VAT rate to levels observed in other Latin America
countries. A comprehensive reform of the pension system to put it on a strong financial footing and
reduce inequalities should also be a part of the strategy.
32.
Staff encourages the authorities to complete the reform agenda for the financial
system. Staff welcomes the progress in adopting risk-based supervision and improving cross-border
consolidated supervision, but progress in other areas has slowed. Staff encourages the authorities to
focus their efforts on securing resources to activate the new liquidity framework of the central bank,
especially the lender-of-last-resort facility, and raising the reserves of the deposit insurance fund to
strengthen the financial safety net. It is also important to move forward with the financial reforms
aimed at facilitating bank resolution and broadening the perimeter of supervision.
33.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
The previous Article IV consultation combined with the first review under the SBA with El Salvador focused on
the need to regain the fiscal space used during the 2008-09 crisis and enhance the resilience of the financial
system (IMF Country Reports 10/307). Directors recommended:


Strengthening fiscal policy gradually to strike a balance between supporting an economic recovery
and placing the debt-to-GDP ratio on a modest declining path. The authorities reduced the fiscal deficit
in 2010, but fiscal policy slippages emerged in late 2011 and the public debt ratio rose through 2012.



Implementing a broad tax reform to support the planned fiscal consolidation. The authorities raised
the marginal income tax and some excise tax rates, and eliminated exemptions in two steps in 2010 and
2012 (with a combined yield of 1.2 percent of GDP). However, other tax reforms were not pursued.



Improving the targeting of energy subsidies to the poor to make room for higher social
investment. The authorities made good progress in 2010, but it was largely reversed in April 2011
following a temporary surge in oil prices. Presently, subsidies on the consumption of electricity and liquid
propane gas benefit disproportionally the wealthy.



Advancing banking reforms to shift to risk-based supervision, strengthen the financial safety net,
and develop the local capital market. The authorities have issued most regulations on financial risk
management, set up a lender-of-last-resort facility, and made progress in improving the bank resolution
process.



Improving the business climate to foster investment and lift growth prospects. The authorities have
been able to reduce crime and improve the road network. However, insecurity and perceived corruption
continue to affect the investment climate.

Box 2. El Salvador—Subsidies and Pension Payments
For several years, payments on subsidies and pensions have been a burden to the public finances and have
raised equity questions. To deal with these issues, reforms are required to target subsidies only to the most
vulnerable, and reduce the actuarial deficit of the pension system and increase its fairness.

SUBSIDIES
Subsidies on the consumption of electricity, liquid propane gas (LPG), and public transportation averaged
1½ percent of GDP yearly during 2008-12, but low-income households received only one-third of the
amount spent, highlighting the need to improve the targeting of subsidies.



Targeting. The coverage and magnitude of subsidies are relatively large. Presently, over 80 percent
of households receive a subsidy on electricity and LPG, both granted to those consuming up to
200 kWh of electricity. The subsidies represent

the budget. Urban families benefit the most from these tariffs since only some 5 percent of rural
families have access to drinkable water.

PENSION SYSTEM
Pensions paid by the government reached almost 2 percent of GDP per year during the last five years. As
these outlays were financed with debt placements with private pension funds, government debt held by
these funds has accumulated rapidly, reaching 10 percent of GDP at end-2012 (one-fifth of total public
debt).



Financial position. Individual pension accounts have been replacing a pay-as-you-go scheme since
1998, but unfunded fiscal liabilities continued to accumulate, as successive legal changes in the
2000’s provided defined benefits to some accounts (which are unlinked to contributions as in the
old scheme) and guaranteed a minimum pension. On a preliminary basis, the authorities estimate
that unfunded liabilities presently amount to 65-75 percent of GDP and that pension payments
would rise gradually to 2-3 percent of GDP yearly by the end of this decade.



Equity. The authorities estimate that defined benefits in both pension schemes have large
distributional implications. Over half of the unfunded liabilities are due to only 10 percent of
affiliates. On a flow basis, 20 percent of current pensioners (mostly, high-income) presently receive
about 50 percent of the overall pensions paid by the government. Effectively, present defined
benefits provide large subsidies to a small group of the population at the expense of current and
future generations of taxpayers.

1/ Includes gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector and external debt of the central bank.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I. El Salvador: Assessing Potential Output1
El Salvador’s growth performance has been lagging the strength of the region for many years.
This is largely the result of low rates of domestic investment mostly associated with a weakening
of the business climate, loss of competitiveness, and vulnerability to external shocks. Raising
potential growth would require reforms to substantially increase investment and productivity.

Background
1.
Historically, economic growth of El Salvador has been below the level observed in the
CAPDR region.2 Real GDP growth decelerated from nearly 4 percent during 1993-2002, which
included the period of reconstruction after the end of the civil war in 1992, to under 2 percent
during 2003-12. Conversely, growth in the region accelerated somewhat from 4 percent to 5 percent
over the same period. Such a growth differential is largely the result of a large investment gap with
the rest of the region. Over the two decades, the rate of domestic investment amounted to
16 percent of GDP in El Salvador compared to 23 percent in regional peers (Figure AI.1). Moreover,
during the most recent decade, foreign direct investment attracted by El Salvador was only half of
the level received by other CAPDR countries (5 percent of GDP). From a longer perspective,
investment gaps with the region also persisted during 1960-90.
2.
Key underlying factors behind this performance in growth include weaknesses in
competitiveness and vulnerability to shocks.


The authorities have identified weak productivity and high cost of doing business, including
those arising from violent crime, as key constraints for growth in recent years.3,4 Deficiencies
in physical infrastructure, human capital, and financing to small- and middle-sized
businesses are also impediments for growth. In particular, according to UNESCO indicators
for 2010, over 40 percent of population had either no schooling or incomplete primary
education compared to 23 percent in Latin America, with emigration constituting a major
drain on skilled workers in El Salvador. Moreover, competitive indicators also deteriorated in
recent years relative to the region (Annex II).



In addition to spillovers from abroad (Annex III), El Salvador is highly susceptible to natural
disasters. The direct and indirect costs associated with losses to existing infrastructure, crops,
housing, and other losses of revenue have been estimated at 20 percent of GDP over the

period 2000-12, compared to an average of only 1½ percent in other countries in the
region.5

Potential Output Estimates
3.
The average potential output growth of El Salvador in 1998-2012 was the lowest in the
region. Two standard methodologies were used to estimate potential output (the Hodrick-Prescott
(HP) filter and the production function (PF) approach).6 The period 1998-2012 was selected to
exclude the growth rebound experienced in the immediate years after the end of the civil war, and
thus analyze a period that could capture underlying growth. The results show that potential growth
averaged 2 percent in this period, compared to 4½ percent in the region.7
4.
Moreover, potential output growth appears to have been declining over time. Both

(14 percent of GDP), the PF approach projects an average growth of 2 percent over the period
2013-23. The macroeconomic projections prepared for the staff report imply that El Salvador would
broadly grow at its potential over the medium-term. Two additional illustrative scenarios were
prepared:

Pessimistic scenario. The persistence of low growth could create an uncertain environment
that may reduce domestic investment with a negative feedback on growth. To illustrate this
low-growth trap, a decline in investment (by one-standard deviation) would lower potential
growth to 1.2 percent over the long term.



OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database (EM-DAT), Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium (www.emdat.net).

6

The PF approach uses a Cobb-Douglas production function, assuming an elasticity of labor of 0.5 and a
depreciation rate on the stock of capital of 5 percent per year.
7

The estimates are sensitive to the selected sample period: potential growth for El Salvador was 2.6 percent for the
period 1964-2012; 3 percent for the period 1990-2012; and between 2.5-2.8 percent for 1994-2011.
8

Based on Bai-Perron methodology, structural declines in potential output growth were identified in 1994, 1997, and
2007, while a structural increase in growth was captured in 2003.

36



Optimistic scenario. Restoring the rate of growth of 4 percent observed in 1993-2003
would require a substantial increase in both the contribution of capital, consistent with a rate
of domestic investment of 20 percent of GDP, and the contribution of productivity, which
will require efficiency-enhancing reforms.

6.
An alternative approach also suggests that raising potential output would require
substantial increases in investment and productivity. Based on a GMM (dynamic panel) system,
Swiston and Barrot (2012)9 estimate that El Salvador would boost potential growth to about
4-4½ percent by bringing physical and human capital to levels comparable to those in Chile,
Mexico, and Peru—that is, by bringing the rate of domestic investment to 25 percent of GDP and
extending the average level of education by two years. El Salvador could further increase potential
growth by an additional 1-1½ percentage points by undertaking reforms in other areas (mainly,
deepening of the financial system and broadening the export base, including through greater
regional integration).

Annex II. El Salvador: Balance of Payments Stability
Assessment1
El Salvador’s real effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
However, competitiveness challenges and financing vulnerabilities could threaten balance of payments
stability over the long term, while the foreign reserve position could be strengthened to provide better
protection against adverse shocks.

Current Account Balance, Exchange Rate, and Competitiveness
CGER Assessment

1.
Developments. El Salvador’s REER has
remained relatively stable during the last decade, as
domestic inflation has been broadly similar to that in
trading partners. Since 2000 the REER depreciated
only by about 5 percent, while the regional peers
demonstrated a much larger change in the REER
(from 37 percent of appreciation in Guatemala to
10 percent of depreciation in Panama).
2.
Assessment results. Methodologies
developed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) suggest that
El Salvador’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals, with estimations ranging from an
overvaluation of 8 percent to an undervaluation of
2 percent.


Under the macroeconomic balance
approach, the current account deficit norm of
El Salvador is estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP
taking into consideration medium-term
fundamentals, including a sustainable fiscal
deficit path. Meanwhile, the underlying
current account deficit is projected at
4.4 percent of GDP, taking into account the
baseline fiscal deficit path. A comparison of
this norm and the underlying current account

balance, using standard trade elasticities, yields an overvaluation of 8 percent, which largely
reflects the impact of a large fiscal deficit.


Under the external sustainability approach, the net foreign asset (NFA) position, as
measured by the net international investment position (see below), would stabilize at the
benchmark level of 2011 (-54 percent of GDP) with a current account deficit norm of
3.4 percent. This suggests that the REER is overvalued by 7 percent. However, if the precrises level of the NFA was a benchmark (-44 percent of GDP), the estimated REER
overvaluation would be larger, at about 11½ percent.



The equilibrium real exchange rate methodology suggests a small undervaluation of
about 2 percent.

designed to cover the short-term public debt and one-month of public spending. The latter would
provide protection under an adverse shock on tax revenue. Based on the alternative metric,
El Salvador’s foreign reserve position would be somewhat weak, as it would cover some 76 percent
of the metric. It should be noted, however, that the alternative metric is very demanding, since the
policy for financial stability is aimed to deal with the unlikely event of a very large deposit outflow
from the banking system.

This buffer may comprise the resources derived from the present policy for the financial system, including: (i) the
liquidity requirements (22 percent of deposits), (ii) the lender-of-last-resort facility (up to 8 percent of deposits over
the medium term), and (iii) the deposit insurance fund (5 percent of deposits).

Annex III. El Salvador: Assessing Spillovers1
External disturbances spill over to the Salvadorian economy mainly through its trade and financial
linkages. Growth shocks in the United States, the main trading partner, appear to have a large impact
on the country’s economic activity, while planned fiscal consolidation abroad and financial stress in the
Euro area were estimated to have small to modest effects on El Salvador. Outward spillovers from
El Salvador to the region appear to be negligible.

Key Linkages
1.

El Salvador is a small open economy with important linkages abroad:



Trade. While the trade flows are relatively large (over 60 percent of GDP), diversification of
trading partners of El Salvador is fairly limited. The main trading partner is the United States
(about 40 percent of Salvadorian trade), followed by CAPDR countries (25 percent of trade),
and other Latin American countries (15 percent of trade). Trade with the Europe and Asia is
modest, although China is becoming an important source of imports (7 percent of total).

Spillovers from Abroad
Impact on Growth
2.
A multi-country VAR analysis was used to assess the impact on El Salvador of a decline
in domestic demand in main trading partners. Following the approach described in Poirson and
Weber (2011), real GDP was decomposed into long-run growth, domestic factors, and foreign
factors.2 Accordingly, foreign factors drove deviations from long-run growth in El Salvador, boosting
the economy prior to 2008 and depressing growth during the global crisis, while domestic factors
played a marginal role.

2014, respectively). Based on past experience the likelihood of a broad region-specific shock
is low.



China. The growth shock in China would have a similar intensity as the shock in CAPDR. The
shock would propagate to El Salvador mainly through its impact on U.S. growth.



Europe. A growth shock in Europe would have a negligible effect on El Salvador, since the
U.S. growth would not be significantly affected by the shock.

3

The VAR results underestimate the spillover on growth as there is no second-round effect on other countries’
domestic component, but take into account third country effects through the foreign component—e.g., the impact
on El Salvador of the fall in China’s domestic demand channeled through the United States. The VAR included the
following countries for the period 1975-2012: Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, Peru,
Spain, Sweden and the United States, as well as CAPDR countries.

The spillover of the growth shock through remittances appears to be low in El Salvador, see Swiston, A., 2012,
“External Linkages and Economic Integration as of 2009,” Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic:
Challenges Following the 2008-09 Global Crisis, pp. 5-32, Washington: International Monetary Fund.

4.
As for fiscal spillovers, the impact of automatic spending cuts in the United States
would be moderate. Fiscal sequestration in the United States would slow growth in El Salvador by
0.2 percent in the near term, and by up to 0.6 percent cumulatively over a two-year period. This
effect has been incorporated into the baseline projection of the staff report. Conversely, the
anticipated fiscal consolidation in Europe would have a negligible effect on El Salvador.

Banking and Sovereign Stress Spillovers
5.
The direct spillovers to El Salvador from stress in international banks were assessed
based on the RES/MFU Bank Contagion Module.5 The module estimates potential vulnerability of
the Salvadorian economy stemming from international banks that operate in El Salvador or are
involved into direct cross-border lending, based on the BIS banking statistics.6
6.
Foreign credit availability to Salvadorian borrowers would be moderately affected by
large losses in claims of international banks on selected economies. Based on the default rates
on the private and public sector assets assumed in the table below, the module estimates the losses
on the international banking systems. If the banks do not hold excess capital to cover such losses,
they would have to deleverage (reduce their foreign and domestic assets) to restore their required
capital adequacy ratios, thus squeezing credit lines to El Salvador and other countries.7 The largest
direct impact of this shock in terms of reduction in foreign banks credit to Salvadorian borrowers
would stem from combined losses in U.S. and Canadian assets (nearly 5 percent of GDP), followed
by a default shock in European assets (3½ percent of GDP). These shocks would imply a reduction in
credit to El Salvador by about 8 and 6 percent, respectively.

5

For methodological details see Cerutti, Eugenio, Stijn Claessens, and Patrick McGuire, 2012, “Systemic Risks in
Global Banking: What can Available Data Tell Us and What More Dare are Needed?” BIS Working Paper 376, Bank for
International Settlements.
6

The analysis may understate potential spillovers, since exposure of resident banks not-reporting to BIS is not
captured. This omission could be important, since Colombian banks (not included in BIS data) own about two-fifths
of the Salvadorian banking system. The analysis also ignores the negative indirect effects of deleveraging in
international banks on global market confidence, balance sheets of corporates, and economic activity, which could
affect Salvadorian and foreign banks, including through an increase in nonperforming loans.
7

Bank recapitalization and other supportive policy actions at the host and/or home country are not assumed.

8.
The importance of spillovers from El Salvador to neighboring countries appears to be
limited. The main channel of transmission of shocks from El Salvador to the region is through the
trade linkage, but the share of Salvadorian trade in total trade of individual neighbors is modest,
suggesting that the potential for real spillovers from the Salvadorian economy is small. The other
channel for propagation is financial sector (e.g., cross-border bank lending and portfolio and foreign

direct investment links), but these linkages between El Salvador and its neighbors are also small.
There could be potential for pure market contagion through investor perception of regional risk,
e.g., in response to adverse economic or political developments in either El Salvador or its
neighboring countries, but this is by nature difficult to gauge, and there are no signs of such
contagion at present.

Annex IV. El Salvador: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
The public debt of El Salvador is large and continues to grow, posing risk to fiscal sustainability over
the long term. Returning to pre-crisis debt levels would restore fiscal space to manage shocks and
reduce financing needs to more manageable levels, but a fairly gradual adjustment could still lead to
moderate output gaps.

Overview
1.

Developments. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose substantially from about 42½ percent at
end-2008 to 54¼ percent at end-2012. Key drivers were
Decomposition in Debt Dynamics
as follows:



Over the period 2003-08, the debt ratio increased slightly
as the size of the primary deficit was moderate and
largely offset by the effect of a positive growth-interest
rate differential.

(Percent of GDP)





In contrast, the large buildup of public debt recorded in
the following four-year period resulted from a widening
of the primary deficit during the 2008-09 global crisis,
which was only partly reversed, and the effect of a
negative growth-interest rate differential, as growth
weakened (Annex I).
From a regional perspective, El Salvador
experienced one of the largest increases in public
debt over the latter period, as the primary deficit
was relatively large. This trajectory was
compounded by the effect of a weak growth
performance relative to regional peers (Figure
AIV.I). By the end of 2012, El Salvador had the
highest debt ratio in the region, even if public
debt arising from the transition to individual
pension accounts is excluded.2

Baseline scenario. The public debt ratio is
projected to rise to 63 percent by 2018, and further to
66 percent by 2020, mainly because the primary deficit would remain at over 1 percent of GDP in
the medium and long terms. Such a trajectory faces substantial risk:

The exclusion of pension-related debt makes the El Salvador’s stock of public debt more comparable to those in
neighboring countries, which have pay-as-you-go pension schemes.



Bound tests indicate that the public debt path is sensitive to shocks, as slippages in the
primary deficit, lower growth, or higher interest rates would further accelerate the debt
dynamics. Based on past experience, the likelihood of these shocks is high (Table 9 and
Figure 6).



Stochastic simulations show that the median public debt forecast would exceed 80 percent
of GDP by 2018. 3 These forecasts consistently exceed baseline projections for the public
debt and are subject to considerable medium-term risks, as evidenced by the width of the
fan chart presented in the main text of the staff report (¶12).

maturity of public debt stood at 8 years, with only
15 percent of the stock maturing over the next 5 years (or an average amortization of 1½ percent
per year). A large share of this stock (70 percent of total) was subject to fixed interest rates, which
limited exposure to interest rate volatility. The existence of a stable investor base was also a source
of strength, with domestic private pension funds and official creditors holding a large portion of
public debt (70 percent).

5.
Risk perception. The perception of sovereign debt risk is moderate, with spreads averaging
450 basis points in 2012, compared to 180 basis points in the highest-rated countries in Latin
America. El Salvador maintained investment grade level during 2002-09, but ever since two of the
rating agencies have been gradually downgrading its sovereign debt-risk rating, and presently, the
country stands three notches below investment grade level.

3

The stochastic simulations were made by (i) estimating the implicit fiscal reaction function to public debt
developments and the output gap in past fiscal behavior, and (ii) producing frequency distributions of the debt paths
under growth, interest rates, and fiscal shocks of similar magnitude observed in the past.

Restoring Debt Sustainability
6.
Alternative long-term debt targets were used to assess the required effort to achieve
debt sustainability. The estimated size of the sustainability gap depends on the speed of the fiscal
adjustment and the scope of the public debt target. 5


Debt stability. Maintaining the public debt ratio at 55 percent in 2013 and beyond would
require a sustained fiscal effort of 2 percent of GDP, which would shift the primary balance
into a small surplus (0.2 percent of GDP). This type of fiscal consolidation, however, would
still result in relatively high gross financing needs and limited fiscal space to react against
adverse shocks.



Pre-crisis debt level. Reducing the public debt ratio to pre-crisis levels (42 percent) by 2020
would result in a sustainability gap of 5 percent of GDP relative to 2012-levels. Closing this
gap would raise the primary surplus to 3¼ percent of GDP and move the overall fiscal
balance into a small surplus, while financing needs would decline to manageable levels
(3-4 percent of GDP). A gradual adjustment, with some moderate front-loading, spread out
over a 6-year period through 2018 is projected to result in moderate output gaps (see
below).



Debt level to improve risk perceptions. Lowering the public debt ratio to levels that could
support investment grade (35 percent of GDP by 2020) would require a sustained effort of
7 percent of GDP, assuming that the adjustment is spread out over the same six-year
period.6

It is worthwhile noting that the adjustment predicated under these scenarios could subsequently be
relaxed as a small primary surplus would stabilize debt once the target was met. Moreover, if the
fiscal consolidation would also target a strengthening of the foreign reserve position to the
adequacy level discussed in Annex II, the gradual adjustment envisaged under these scenarios
would need to be supplemented by an additional effort of 0.8 percent of GDP per year.
7.
The debt-reduction scenarios consider a moderate up-front fiscal effort to mitigate
output losses. El Salvador faces the challenge of undertaking fiscal consolidation, while minimizing
its impact on growth. To reconcile both objectives, simulations were prepared based on a model of
optimal fiscal consolidation. 7 In light of the small output gap in 2012, the simulation pertaining to

Annex V. El Salvador: Implementing Basel III Standards1
Due to comfortable capital and liquidity levels in the banking system, El Salvador is well placed to
perform a gradual transition to the stricter Basel III standards, without dampening credit supply and
economic activity in the near term.
1.
While Basel III standards seek to enhance the soudness of the banking system, there is
risk that more demanding rules could dampen growth. Basel standards have been upgraded
through stricter capital and new liquidity guidelines to address weaknesses uncovered during the
2008-09 global crisis. Meeting the enhanced requirements, however, may lead banks to transitorily
curtail the credit supply and thus affect economic activity.
2.
El Salvador is well placed to gradually implement key Basel III standards. The banking
system is already in compliance with most of Basel I standards and has made good progress in
applying Basel core principles. At end-2012, banks had capital adequacy ratios of 17 percent, well
above the required level of 8 percent under Basel I standards (and 12 percent under Salvadorian
rules). Also, the shift to risk-based supervision is advancing, while the integration of the
superintendencies of banks, pension funds, and securities in 2011 has facilitated the application of
consolidated supervision.
3.
Banks will likely face small capital gaps under the stricter standards. Adjusting for Basel
III definitions, risk-weighted assets (RWA) in the Salvadorian banking system would increase by
some 20 percent, while common equity would decline by only 1½ percent—this impact compares
favorably to some countries in the region. Thanks to the present capital position, banks would be
able to meet all of the new capital requirements, although the application of a recommended
countercyclical buffer (2½ percent of RWA) would result in a capital gap of 1½ percent of RWA—
this gap is still smaller than those that could arise in some countries in the region.

that raising the capital adequacy ratio by one
percentage point would lower economic activity in El Salvador by only 0.05 percent, with the effect
dissipating in two years. The estimated impact is low compared to the estimations made for other
countries by the BIS Macroeconmic Analysis Group.

6.
The transition to Basel III standards should be tailored to the features of the banking
system. These standards would be appropriate for El Salvador, given the size and complexity of the
banking system, and would also guide improvements in supervisory practices and skills, as well as in
the regulatory and risk management frameworks.


Short-term priorities should focus on upgrading capital definitions and introducing the new
capital requirements, although the recommended countercyclical buffers may take longer to
implement. However, required liquidity levels should not be reduced until the liquidity
facilities envisaged by the central bank become fully activated, particularly the lender-of-last
resort window.



Over the medium term, it is important to strengthen the supervisory processes (the so called
“Pillar II” under the Basel accord) and upgrade practices for market discipline and
transparency (Pillar III).



In the long term, additional elements should be considered, such as macroprudential
instruments and capital charges for systemically important financial institutions.

7.
Challenges to the transition to Basel III strandards seem manageable. Most of the
regulatory changes associated with implementation of those standards fall under the powers of the
central bank. At the industry level, the presence of large international financial groups in El Salvador
should facilitate the transition, since these banks are subject to stricter prudential practices dictated
by home countries

2

Both liquidity requirements provide for full coverage of liabilities maturing within a 30-day and one-year period.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely. The dollar is used
as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no limitations. All payments may be made in
either dollars or colones. The BCR has the obligation to exchange colones for dollars upon request
from banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C8.75 per U.S. dollar. As a result, El Salvador
has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal tender category. El Salvador has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EL SALVADOR

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.

Collaboration. In the context of the joint management action plan (JMAP) for Bank-Fund

collaboration, the IMF team led by Mr. Garza (Mission Chief) met on several occasions with the
World Bank team led by Mr. Razafimandimby (Senior Country Economist) to discuss El Salvador’s
main macroeconomic challenges, identify macro-critical structural reforms, and coordinate the work
of both teams.
2.

Macroeconomic challenges. The teams have agreed that the challenges facing El Salvador

are to safeguard fiscal sustainability, deepen financial reforms, and boost growth. The priority is to
place the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path and reduce the government’s financing
needs. Improvements in competitiveness and the business climate are needed to unleash the
growth potential of the dollarized economy and elevate standards of living.
3.

Structural reforms. Based on this shared assessment, the teams have identified four macro-

critical structural reform areas:


Fiscal sustainability. The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise expenditure and
revenue reforms to lower the fiscal deficit, while raising infrastructure, security, and other
social spending. In particular, the increase in current primary spending recorded during the
global crisis of 2008-09 should be reversed, including subsidies and wages, and the tax
effort should be aligned with country peers. The pension system should also be put on a
sound financial footing.



Public financial management. The focus should be on addressing shortcomings in the
budget process, including by: (i) adopting a medium-term expenditure framework;
(ii) introducing a unified budget for the nonfinancial public sector; and (iii) broadening
coverage of autonomous and decentralized institutions. By resolving these weaknesses, the
authorities’ ability to control public expenditure and execute the investment budget will
improve.



Financial system. The priority should be to strengthen its crisis preparedness and increase
financial intermediation by: (i) making operational the central bank’s lender-of-last-resort
facility and setting up an additional liquidity fund; (ii) shifting to risk-based supervision and
improving cross-border consolidated supervision; (iii) addressing deficiencies in bank
resolution procedures and strengthening the deposit insurance scheme; and (iv) improving
the legal framework for El Salvador’s capital markets.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR



Competitiveness. There is a need to boost domestic investment in El Salvador, which for
many years has remained low in terms of GDP and compared to regional peers. Weaknesses
in areas such as security, education, and innovation, and lack of private participation in large
infrastructure projects weigh on investment and growth.

4.

Division of labor. The teams agreed on the following division of labor:


Fiscal sustainability. The IMF (the Fund) will continue to provide advice on macro-fiscal
issues, including fiscal consolidation, and technical assistance (TA) to strengthen tax
collection and reduce evasion. Building upon previous TA on tax policy, the Fund support
will focus on improving control of large taxpayers and enhancing auditing capacity, as well
as strengthening customs control while facilitating trade through risk-management
schemes.



Public financial management. The Fund will further assist the authorities in implementing
medium-term expenditure framework, setting up a treasury single account, and enhancing
capabilities in debt sustainability analysis. The World Bank is undertaking a regional study on
public expenditure review in the social sector in Central America.



Financial system. The Bank and the Fund will continue to cooperate as needed in assisting
the authorities in implementing the 2010 FSAP Update advice. The Fund will provide
assistance with norms and procedures to shift to risk-based supervision, cross-border
consolidation supervision, and the liquidity policy of the central bank. The Bank will provide
new assistance on the regulatory framework for the provision of mobile financial services
and insurance.



Competitiveness. The Fund will also assist in strengthening the framework for publicprivate partnerships and managing potential fiscal risks through regional seminars. The
World Bank has also been working to strengthen the legal framework for public-private
partnerships and to improve the investment climate. The World Bank is also providing TA to
build the institutional capacity for technology and innovation.

5.
Information sharing. The teams have agreed to share information on progress in the above
macro-critical structural reform areas.
6.

Work programs. The following table lists the teams’ work programs through April 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 2013)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: National accounts data are based on 1990 weights and compiled under
the 1968 SNA, although a project is underway to transition to the 1993 SNA and update the
series to 2005 weights. The project also envisages the publication of quarterly national accounts
by expenditure, which are currently available only on an annual basis.

B. Data Standards and Quality
El Salvador is a subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
1998. El Salvador is taking a flexibility option for the periodicity of the labor market and
wages/earnings data category and will continue at this time to publish annual data with a
timeliness of one quarter after the end of the reference year. A data ROSC was published in
December 2004

International Monetary Fund

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW

May 22, 2013

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
El Salvador
On May 20, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with El Salvador. 1
Background
The economy recovered slowly from the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Output growth was
sluggish in 2010-12, owing to low rates of private investment, declining competitiveness,
and weather-related shocks. Inflation remained low, firmly anchored by the fully-dollarized
regime. Despite weak economic activity, the external current account deficit widened to
5.25 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012, partly due to lower export prices.
This deficit exceeded the underlying capital account surplus. The foreign reserve position
as of end-2012 may not be sufficient to absorb large adverse shocks.
The overall fiscal deficit in 2012 remained close to 4 percent of GDP, broadly the same
level as in 2010-11. The revenue gain from income tax measures taken early in 2012 and
strict control over current expenditures were offset by higher public investment and
spending on security, health, and other social projects. Generalized subsidies and pension
payments continued to place a burden on the public finances. The government’s financing
needs were large, amounting to nearly 8 percent of GDP in 2012. The stock of public
sector debt continued to grow, reaching 54.25 percent of GDP at end-2012.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The banking system appears well capitalized and liquid. At end-2012, the average capital
adequacy ratio was 17 percent, while overdue loans declined to under 3 percent of total
loans, with provisioning fully covering these loans. During 2012, total bank deposits
increased by just 2.5 percent, while credit to the private sector grew by 4 percent.
El Salvador faces presidential elections in early 2014 and congressional elections one year
later. The long electoral period may reduce the scope for corrective fiscal policies. Output
growth would remain subdued as investment would remain low due to long-standing
structural weaknesses. The overall fiscal deficit will likely stay at 4 percent of GDP in 2013
and beyond, increasing the public debt further, keeping government’s financing needs high,
and elevating external vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that, while El Salvador enjoys low inflation and a resilient financial system,
output growth is weak, and vulnerabilities from the fiscal deficit and debt are high. They
urged the authorities to build a broad consensus on a short- and medium-term strategy to
ensure fiscal and debt sustainability and bolster the economy’s resilience and growth
potential.
Directors concurred that the short-term priority should be to maintain macroeconomic
stability and investor confidence during the electoral period. They encouraged the
authorities to exercise restraint on public sector wages and poorly-targeted subsidies, and
broaden the scope of envisaged revenue measures. Over the medium term, a gradual
reduction in the public debt ratio to pre-2009 levels by the end of the decade should anchor
El Salvador’s macroeconomic strategy. This would strike an adequate balance between
restoring fiscal buffers and supporting priority infrastructure and social spending. Directors
emphasized that fiscal consolidation should encompass revenue and expenditure,
including improving the targeting of subsidies, lowering the earmarking of revenues,
reducing tax expenditure and evasion, and increasing the rate of the value-added tax.
Directors also stressed the need for pension reforms to ensure sustainability and reduce
inequalities in the system.
Directors noted that a temporary increase in banks’ liquidity buffers would help safeguard
financial stability during the election cycle. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to make
progress in implementing risk-based and cross-border consolidated bank supervision. They
stressed the importance of adopting the outstanding recommendations of the 2010
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update, including activating the newlycreated lender-of-last-resort facility, facilitating bank resolution, and raising the reserves of
the deposit insurance fund. A gradual implementation of key Basel III standards would also
be important.

3

Directors emphasized that a sustained increase in investment is necessary to raise
El Salvador’s potential growth. They saw broad consensus on a medium-term strategy
aimed at bolstering competitiveness and improving the business climate as critical. In this
regard, they supported the authorities’ initiatives to promote private investment in key
infrastructure areas, set up an effective framework for public-private partnerships, and
reduce red tape.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Rojas and Mr. Acevedo Flores on El Salvador
May 20, 2013
We would like to thank staff for their thorough analysis and balanced report on the country’s
economic situation, and the main challenges that El Salvador faces ahead in order to attain
higher growth rates and achieve fiscal sustainability. The authorities appreciate the frank and
constructive dialogue during the consultation process and the frequent policy discussions
held with the Fund. They broadly agree with the identified medium term challenges facing
the economy, but they would like to emphasize the following points:
Economic Growth
Boosting growth definitely remains the main challenge for the country. Growth has been
modest for many years, undermining fiscal sustainability and eroding social conditions.
El Salvador’s growth has been below that of Central America, Latin America, and world
averages for almost two decades (since the Tequila Crisis)—in particular the decade that
followed the adoption of full dollarization in 2001, with the lowest growth in the Salvadoran
economic history excluding the period of civil war during the 1980s. This trend worsened
amid the recent global recession, and the recovery has been quite slow. After dropping
3.1 percent in 2009, real GDP growth has averaged 1.5 percent during 2010-2012.
The key underlying factors behind this growth performance have been well documented and
include low productivity levels due to low human capital, physical infrastructure
deterioration, low private sector investment (including low flows of FDI), poor security
conditions owing to gang-related activity, and political uncertainty. With the exception of
political uncertainty, most of these factors have been present at least since the mid 1990s. So
far, political institutions have failed to generate the necessary conditions to improve the
country’s business climate and boost growth, while productivity growth has been virtually
nonexistent. It is particularly worrisome that, according to the macroeconomic projections
prepared for the Staff Report, under current investment trends potential growth would remain
around 2 percent over the long term.
Fiscal stance
When the current administration took office in June 1st 2009, it encountered a fiscal deficit
close to 6.3 percent of GDP. As a result of efforts to advance a program of fiscal
consolidation, the fiscal deficit has steadily declined from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2009 to
3.4 percent in 2012, and the objective is to further reduce it to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013.
Roughly half of last year’s fiscal deficit is explained by pension liabilities, which averaged
1.7 percent of GDP per year between 2009 and 2012. At the same time, the public debt-toGDP ratio rose from about 42½ percent at end-2008 to 54¼ percent at end-2012. Almost
10 percentage points of the outstanding public debt are due to pension liabilities.
Although El Salvador public debt is not that high if we measure it, for instance, by European
standards, the authorities are well aware that reducing the debt burden is imperative to

2
guarantee fiscal sustainability in the long term. Returning to pre-crisis debt levels would
restore fiscal space to manage shocks and reduce financing needs to more manageable levels.
However, the government’s options to ease the burden appear to be quite limited, given
El Salvador’s poor track record of fostering growth and the polarized political environment
ahead of next February’s presidential election. Moreover, authorities are concerned that a too
drastic fiscal adjustment might self-defeat the goal of improving growth prospects. Also,
despite the government’s commitment to stabilize public finances, there exists high risk that
the election year will complicate fiscal consolidation efforts by raising pressure to increase
spending beyond current targets. Politicians do not always appreciate the virtues of being
fiscally responsible.
Monetary regime
The authorities’ space of maneuver to foster growth and in turn stabilize public finances has
been further complicated by the monetary regime. Since the adoption of full dollarization in
2001, El Salvador has been trapped into a risky combination of low growth, fiscal imbalances
and hard currency that has proven to be a lethal trap in other countries. Dollarization has
helped to consolidate monetary stability and to maintain inflation low, but inflation rates
were actually lower when El Salvador had a de facto pegged exchange rate before
dollarization was adopted (the Latin American economies that have consistently maintained
the lowest inflation rates in the last decade have not been the dollarized ones). On the other
hand, dollarization seems to have affected the competitiveness of Salvadoran exporters and
has failed to sufficiently lower local interest rates. In the end, it has not led to more
investment and growth over the long term, as its advocates promised when it was adopted.
Macroeconomic performance under dollarization has been in general quite poor.
Nevertheless, despite the economic costs associated with this monetary regime, the
government is committed to maintain this arrangement. The authorities are convinced that
the costs of abandoning dollarization exceed potential benefits in the medium term. Hence,
much of the focus of the government policy is on boosting productivity and lowering crime
to promote investment.
Economic policies
The authorities are committed to a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation process as described
above, recognizing that in the last year of the Funes Administration there will be severe
limitations to pursue the fiscal consolidation effort.
Assuming that the main challenge to resume growth is to create a better environment for
attracting new private investment, the government has introduced new pro-investment laws
and decrees in early 2013. The measures include cutting red tape for construction projects, a
new public-private partnership law (now in Congress), and reforms to free-trade zones.
El Salvador is also working with the U.S. in its Partnership for Growth initiative to create
programs that remove obstacles to growth. The initiative is focused on crime and security as
well as on raising productivity in the tradable sector of the economy. El Salvador is also in a
good position to get potential new funding from a second program from the Millenium

3
Challenge Corporation, which should sustain U.S. aid to the country in the coming years and
provide a modest impetus for GDP growth, although its impact would be felt during the next
presidential term.
On the fiscal side, the government is working to further advance fiscal consolidation
gradually. In addition to implementing a hiring freeze in much of the public sector, it has
worked on reducing subsidies for transportation (which however would be politically
difficult if oil prices rise). Also, the Administration plans to introduce new tax measures in
Congress, after getting approval of its legislative agenda of laws designed to promote
investment and growth.
Conclusion
We would like to close this statement by reiterating our appreciation for the thorough
analysis that underlies the report prepared by the IMF mission team. The authorities fully
agree that the key challenges facing the economy are to increase growth, reduce the fiscal
deficit and the level of public debt, and rebuild the buffers of the dollarized economy to deal
with shocks. They welcome the goal to increase El Salvador’s potential output to regional
levels, which should be facilitated by enhancing competitiveness and improving the business
climate. They also agree that policies should give priority to stabilizing the public debt- toGDP ratio and closing financing gaps, although they are afraid that the fiscal effort suggested
by the Staff Report for 2013-14 might not be achievable due to political factors.
The authorities are committed to guarantee an orderly political transition to the next
Administration in early 2014 and are looking forward to find the appropriate policies to
ensure economic stability during this transition. They would greatly appreciate the support
from the IMF to start a national dialogue on the key economic challenges, especially on fiscal
sustainability, during this difficult period.
