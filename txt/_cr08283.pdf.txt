Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and
Request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Robert Sharer and Mark Plant
May 8, 2008

Discussions: Discussions took place in Bamako (February 7–20) and concluded in Washington
(March 18–21, 2008). The staff met with Mr. Abou-Bakar Traoré, Minister of Finance; Ms. Bah
Fatoumata Néné Sy, then Minister of Economy, Industry and Commerce; Mr. Idrissa Traoré,
National Director of the BCEAO; and other senior officials. It also met with representatives from
the donor community, the private sector, trade unions, civil society organizations, and the
University of Bamako. The mission comprised Messrs. Beaugrand (head), Anayiotos, Camard,
Thomas (all AFR), and Wane (resident representative).
PRGF arrangement: The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF arrangement with total
access of SDR 27.99 million (30 percent of quota), which would help finance additional costs
arising from higher food and oil import prices in 2008. Mali’s outstanding loans from the Fund
were SDR 8 million (9 percent of quota) at the end of March 2008.
Political and Regional Developments. The domestic political situation is stable. President
Touré won a second term in April 2007 and appointed a new government in September.
However, there has been growing discontent in recent months, stemming from increases in food
and fuel prices and from relatively low pay for contractual teachers. Tensions in Kidal, Mali’s
northeastern region, are also a source of concern. The security situation in neighboring Côte
d’Ivoire is improving, facilitating regional trade.
Article VIII. Mali has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on current international transactions.
Publication. The authorities consent to the publication of this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments. Economic growth in Mali slowed to 3 percent in 2007, reflecting the
impact of late and heavy rainfall on agriculture, especially cotton. Inflation was subdued at
about 2 percent but surged to 6 percent in February 2008, mainly because of higher cereal
prices. The basic fiscal balance turned from a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to a
deficit of 1.1 percent in 2007. The terms of trade improved slightly because higher gold
export prices more than offset the surge in oil import prices.
Article IV Consultation. The consultation focused on the authorities’ strategies for
managing shocks and raising economic growth. The discussions gave special attention to
medium-term economic policies to accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty,
including efforts to boost competitiveness, enhance the environment for private sector
activity, develop financial intermediation, and implement other structural reforms. The
authorities generally concurred with the staff’s suggestions.
•

Fiscal issues. The authorities should strive to regain fiscal space over time to address
potential shocks. Tax and customs administration need to improve further to broaden
the revenue base. The authorities also need to intensify efforts to reduce low priority
spending (including untargeted transfers) and increase social spending.

•

Competitiveness. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate was broadly stable in
recent years, but other measures suggest that the real exchange rate level is moderately
overvalued. Meanwhile, Mali’s share of the BCEAO’s reserve position has risen to
about 6 months of imports.

•

Financial sector. A recent FSAP mission highlighted priority issues for the authorities
to address to ensure that the banking sector is stable and supports growth and poverty
reduction objectives.

•

Structural reforms. Priorities are to improve agriculture and work toward food
security, restructure and privatize public enterprises, and reduce impediments to private
sector development.

New program. The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF arrangement to help
address the challenges posed by Mali’s economic vulnerability and raise its growth potential.
The program aims to strengthen the fiscal position and accelerate structural reforms, thereby
increasing the resources available for poverty reduction.
Program risks. The proposed PRGF entails manageable risks. Mali is subject to various
exogenous shocks that have adverse effects on the economy and the budget, but the
authorities have previously demonstrated their capacity to weather such shocks, by
implementing the measures necessary. Staff support the authorities’ request for a new PRGF.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Mali’s economy has doubled in size since the democratic transition of the early
1990s. Sound macroeconomic management has produced growth averaging almost 5 percent
and raised the tax ratio from less than 10 percent of GDP to around 16 percent. Together with
external aid, including HIPC and MDRI debt relief, the increase in resources has fueled rapid
expansion of poverty-reducing spending and helped sustain economic growth. Nonetheless,
Mali is still very poor and highly vulnerable to natural and external shocks. Agriculture, the
mainstay of the economy, has been buffeted by recurrent droughts, floods, locust infestation,
diseases, and depressed world prices for cotton—owing in part to domestic subsidies to
cotton farmers in advanced countries.
2.
The authorities are requesting a new PRGF arrangement for 2008–11 in an
amount equivalent to 30 percent of quota (Attachment I). Over one-half of the PRGF
amount would be disbursed in 2008 to finance part of the higher food and oil import costs.
The authorities believe continued Fund support will help them to maintain sound economic
policies, increase the economy’s resilience to shocks, and frame a reform program that
supports their second-generation growth and poverty reduction strategy. Fund support to
Mali would also help to secure continued donors assistance.
3.
Mali is a long-term user of Fund resources. Four three-year arrangements were
completed from 1992 through 2007 (the last PRGF expired in November 2007),1 with all
amounts fully drawn (see Informational Annex). An Ex Post Assessment in December 2003
concluded that Mali had a satisfactory record of performance but faced deep-seated
problems, especially in the cotton sector. The authorities have been responsive to policy
recommendations formulated during the last Article IV consultation in December 2005
related to the cotton sector, food security, fiscal space for poverty reduction, the financial
sector, and private sector development (Box 1).2 In recent Executive Board meetings on Mali,
most Directors expressed their appreciation for Mali’s performance on the PRGF-supported
program, although a number were disappointed by slow progress in structural reforms.
4.
Mali has not been able to reduce poverty much. Over the last 15 years, it has
increased income levels, school enrolment rates, and access to basic social services (from
very low bases), and education outcomes are starting to rise. Still, Mali’s development
indicators—especially those related to literacy—are among the lowest in the world, reflecting
acute underinvestment in education in the first decades after independence. Mali still lags
behind other countries in the region, and its prospects for achieving most of the MDGs by

producer price mechanism to tackle budget risks.

Prices set at, or close to, the floor.

• Implement formula for fuel prices to safeguard
revenue objectives.

Formula adopted, but implemented with lags in order
to smooth fluctuations in fuel prices.

• Develop comprehensive plan to chart CMDT
privatization and begin implementing the strategy.

CMDT medium-term privatization plan in place; the
authorities are committed to completing privatization
in 2008–09.

Food Security
• Address impediments to food trade, particularly at
a regional level.
Fiscal Space and Poverty Reduction
• Address issues on budgetary policies relating to
pensions, the efficiency of spending, and social
safety net payments to help create fiscal space.

Issue discussed at regional level, with limited
progress.
Slow progress with pension reform; significant
headway in rationalizing expenditure and increasing
poverty reduction spending.

• Revise strategy to explicitly link growth and
poverty reduction and maintain a realistic
assessment of growth potential.
Financial Sector
• Strengthen supervision, with reduced forbearance
for missed prudential ratios.

Link between growth and poverty reduction is
highlighted, but without an action plan to achieve
ambitious growth objectives.

• Examine ways to reinvigorate financial
intermediation and private sector lending.
Enabling Growth
• Address competitiveness issues through reforms
that reduce the costs of doing business and factor
price flexibility.

A new Financial Sector Development Strategy
addresses, inter alia, limited access to credit.

• Implement program of structural reforms
regarding privatization and management of state
enterprises.

Slow progress; failed farming out of electricity
company; delays in privatizing other state enterprises
(e.g., telecommunications company).

Progress made in observing prudential ratios.

One-stop shop to be set up soon to reduce time and
cost of doing business.

Box 2. Mali: Attaining the Millennium Development Goals
Despite a stable democratic system and sound economic performance for more than a decade,
Mali has only modestly reduced poverty, which fell from an estimated 68.3 percent in 2001 to
64.4 percent in 2006 (the 2001–06 PRSP target was 47.5 percent).1 Poverty dynamics differ by
geographical areas. While poverty fell in the urban areas from 37.4 percent in 2001 to
31.4 percent in 2006, it increased slightly in the rural areas, from 79.2 percent in 2001 to
79.5 percent in 2006. The significant structural barriers to development include high illiteracy,
low health indicators, undeveloped infrastructure, and distance to markets. Mali’s per capita
income growth, while steady, allows only limited progress toward the MDGs (Table 1).

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Economic growth slowed from 5.3 percent in 2006 to less than 3 percent in 2007.
Favorable weather and record gold production boosted growth in 2006, but late and heavy
rainfall affected agriculture in 2007, especially cotton (Tables 2–6, Figure 2). Inflation
remained subdued in 2007 at 2.3 percent (12-monthly rate) but surged to 6 percent in
February 2008 as cereal prices rose. Although the terms of trade improved further—higher
gold export prices more than offset the increase in oil import prices—the impact was
unevenly distributed (especially since gold is an enclave sector).3 Thus, last year real
purchasing power of the urban population declined. The government tried to offset higher
import costs using the windfall from higher gold prices to provide tax breaks for food and
fuel imports and announcing wage increases for civil servants (5 percent for 2008 and
another 5 percent for 2009). With almost half of tax revenue coming from international trade,
however, these measures undermined the fiscal outturn, and the basic balance turned from a
3

Moreover, gold output was down in 2007 because some mines faced temporary problems such as large rock
formations, which slowed excavation operations.

10
surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to a deficit of 1.1 percent in 2007. The overall fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) also widened to 8½ percent of GDP, against 7½ percent in 2006.
6.
The balance of payments weakened in 2007. The trade balance turned into a deficit,
compared with a surplus in 2006, largely because gold output was lower. Foreign exchange
reserve accumulation slowed from the robust levels of 2005–06, leaving reserve cover steady
at about 6 months of imports. Thus, the contribution of net foreign assets to broad money
growth was only 1 percent for 2007, against 11 percent in 2006. A smaller cotton harvest to
finance, a less favorable economic environment, and persistent weaknesses at state-owned
banks all contributed to a decline in credit to the economy of 0.8 percent.
7.
The authorities have continued to advance their structural reforms. In December
2007, four regional subsidiaries of the state cotton ginner (CMDT) were chartered as a
precursor to privatization. The National Assembly in January 2008 approved a law granting
the housing bank (BHM) greater powers to collect on nonperforming loans (NPLs), and the
Council of Ministers in March approved a draft law to reform the civil service retirement
fund (CRM). In April, the authorities completed the tariff study for the electricity company,
which the electricity and water regulatory commission is considering, and they launched a
tender for privatizing the International Bank of Mali (BIM). The authorities are also revising
their financial sector development strategy (FSDS), based in part on the conclusions of the
regional and Mali-specific FSAP missions in November 2007 and February 2008.
8.
Despite its record of sound financial management, Mali is facing tall challenges.
In view of persistently weak social indicators, slowing economic growth, and pressures on
the budget, staff framed the 2008 Article IV consultation discussions as an opportunity to
broaden the diagnosis of economic conditions and prospects to feed into preparation of a
possible Fund-supported program. The staff updated its assessment of Mali’s competitiveness—in parallel with the work of the 2008 WAEMU consultation mission4—and focused on
avenues to raise the growth potential over the medium term.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on how the authorities plan to manage shocks and raise
economic growth. They helped highlight policies that would make Mali’s economy more
resilient to natural hazards and adverse terms of trade. They also gave special attention to
medium-term economic policies to accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty,
including efforts to boost competitiveness, improve the environment for private sector
activity, deepen financial intermediation, and accomplish other structural reforms. The
authorities generally concurred with the staff’s suggestions.
A. Coping with Exogenous Shocks
10.
Food security is an overarching concern. The government is giving food security
top priority for the next few years and has set ambitious objectives to increase irrigation,
notably in the Niger inland delta area managed by the Office du Niger (OdN).5 Staff
expressed their full support, but pointed out that over the years the canals have not been well
maintained, and water charges fall far short of operating costs. Moreover, given the
predominance of smallholder agriculture, there is limited scope to introduce modern
agricultural methods or marketing practices. At the same time, rising cereal prices have led
the authorities to introduce customs exemptions on imports. Staff cautioned that such
subsidies risk reducing incentives for agricultural production. The authorities indicated that
farmgate prices are not closely linked to market prices, owing in part to logistical constraints.
In the short run, food security is ensured through a combination of food aid, reserve stocks of
cereals, and temporary tax exemptions in response to high import prices.
11.
Irrigated agriculture helped to cushion the impact of late rains and flooding on
cereals production in 2007, but cotton production fell sharply. While cereals production
matched the good harvest of 2006, 2007 seed cotton output dropped by 40 percent from
2006, which itself was 20 percent below 2005. The latest decline mainly reflected adverse
weather (cotton in Mali is exclusively rain-fed), but stagnating producer prices also gave
farmers an incentive to diversify away from cotton.
12.
The authorities are committed to making the cotton sector more competitive by
breaking up and privatizing CMDT, the ginnery. Meanwhile, the current mechanism for
setting the procurement price, which allocates 60 percent of estimated cotton revenue to the
growers and the rest to the ginner, will remain in place.6 CMDT’s assets are being transferred
to the new regional subsidiaries slated for privatization. The government will assume
5

At present, only 10 percent of the irrigation potential in the Niger delta is used. Many donors—including the
European Union, France, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation—have committed large amounts to
develop the Niger delta region.

6

Although the mechanism has now been in place for three years, there is little evidence that CMDT has
responded to the incentives it provides to cut costs and curb losses.

13
CMDT’s publicly guaranteed external debt, but it is not yet clear how its other liabilities are
to be distributed. The 2008 budget subsidy to CMDT (0.3 percent of GDP) does not fully
cover its losses for 2007/08, and the company’s balance sheet may deteriorate further in
2008/09. Staff therefore urged the authorities to ensure that its deficits are curtailed and begin
to consider how to wind up CMDT once it divests the subsidiaries.
13.
The recent strengthening of the terms of trade conceals risks. After bottoming out
in 2005, Mali’s terms of trade rose markedly as gold prices surged (Figure 3), more than
offsetting increases in oil import prices. The gains benefited the gold mining sector and lifted
government revenue from gold to about 3 percent of GDP in 2007. Gold revenues will likely
increase further because some tax holidays expire in 2009 and new mines come on stream in
2008 and 2011, although the benefits will be somewhat offset by the aging of some mines.
Moreover, the added investment will reduce short-run tax receipts, and the outlook for gold
output and prices over the medium term is highly uncertain. Meanwhile, rising oil and food
import costs and stagnating cotton prices have adversely affected the entire economy.
Considering the uncertainties about future gold revenues, staff suggested to allocate a greater
share of the windfalls from higher gold prices to develop infrastructure and to help diversify
the rest of the economy.

B. Fostering Faster Economic Growth
14.
Mali’s recent growth rates are not sufficient to reduce poverty significantly,
particularly for the large rural population. The authorities recognize that the challenges of
attaining the MDGs would be eased if economic growth rose substantially. The discussions
therefore revolved around the following themes: (a) sound macroeconomic policies, including a sustainable budget position; (b) enhanced competitiveness; (c) public administration
reform to improve and decentralize the provision of key public goods and promote public
investment; (d) a stronger financial sector; and (e) structural reforms directed to speed
growth.
Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
15.
The authorities have set ambitious medium-term macroeconomic objectives. The
2007–11 GPRSP (second generation PRSP), as part of the government’s long-term vision of
“Mali 2025,” emphasizes raising annual economic growth to 7 percent per annum to mobilize
resources for poverty reduction. The GPRSP spells out three strategies: (a) building infrastructure and the productive sectors, especially by improving the business environment;
(b) pursuing public sector reforms, particularly through decentralization, the rule of law, and
the fight against corruption; and (c) reinforcing the social sectors, with better delivery of
basic services.7 While emphasizing faster growth, the GPRSP also recognizes the central
importance of macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.
16.
The planned growth-enhancing reforms need to be broadened to support Mali’s
ambitious poverty reduction goals. The authorities should sequence priority actions, with
explicit links between the budget and the poverty reduction strategy (see JSAN). Such links
are to be detailed in the forthcoming GPRSP progress report, based on an updated poverty
analysis (using the 2006 household survey). The authorities are also considering adopting a
results-based management system for the GPRSP and MDGs, drawing on UN and World
Bank expertise. Despite the ambitious objectives staff argued, and the authorities agreed, that
baseline macroeconomic projections should rely on conservative assumptions. Accordingly,
the medium-term framework assumes annual real GDP growth of about 5 percent over the
medium run, tracking long-term trends (Table 7).

7

These strategies are detailed in 14 priority areas covering all activities relating to administration, civil society,
the private sector, and productive sectors: (1) food security and rural development; (2) development of smalland medium-size enterprises; (3) protection and sustainable management of natural resources; (4) consolidation
of public administration reform; (5) reform of the business environment; (6) financial sector development;
(7) development of infrastructure; (8) promotion of democratic governance and public freedoms; (9) capacity
building for the civil society; (10) strengthening of regional and subregional integration initiatives; (11) creation
and promotion of long-term jobs; (12) development of access to basic services; (13) HIV/AIDS control; and
(14) integration into the multilateral trade system.

15
17.
Mali has been one of the countries most compliant with the WAEMU convergence criteria. It currently meets 4 of 5 primary criteria, and 2 of 4 secondary criteria
(Table 8). Further progress toward meeting the criteria would require returning the basic
balance to surplus; raising tax revenue to 17 percent of GDP; and pushing the external
current account deficit (excluding official transfers) below 5 percent of GDP. The authorities
intend to meet the first two objectives by 2010 but, given current levels of grant-financed
assistance and investments in the mining sector, the last will take longer.
18.
The balance of payments situation is fragile, and Mali depends heavily on
foreign exchange inflows. The combined total from external aid, gold exports, and personal
transfers is 16½ percent of GDP (based on official estimates), and may be up to 25 percent
taking into account personal transfers through informal channels. Remittances from Malian
expatriates provide an added fillip to the economy, and the authorities are working to revalue
the impact of these inflows, which are substantially understated in official data.
Enhancing Competitiveness
19.
Mali’s competitiveness has been eroding gradually since 2000. Staff argued, and
the authorities generally agreed, that deteriorating competitiveness is a major reason for the
lackluster GDP growth, and that without determined policy measures, the GPRSP mediumterm growth target of 7 percent is probably out of reach. Staff also pointed out that the
economy is stable and relatively strong—especially with the continued buildup of net foreign
assets at the BCEAO—thanks to foreign exchange inflows. Mali’s economy might therefore
be subject to Dutch disease effects, with large but sustainable domestic and external
imbalances at the cost of below-potential economic growth.
20.
There is a need to raise productivity growth and diversify exports. Mali’s CPIbased real effective exchange rate (REER) has been broadly steady in recent years because
low inflation has offset the nominal appreciation of the CFA franc against the U.S. dollar
(Figure 4), but other measures—notably the nontradable/tradable price ratio and some
estimates of the equilibrium exchange rate—are worrisome. A number of estimates suggest
that the level of the exchange rate is moderately overvalued (Box 3). Meanwhile, Mali’s
share of the BCEAO reserve position rose during 2005–07 to about 6 months of imports.
Staff believe Mali’s lack of competitiveness stems primarily from structural causes that
should be addressed by improving the business climate, diversifying the economic base,
alleviating impediments to trade, and raising productivity. Overall, however, the authorities
and the staff agreed that its exchange system has served Mali well—with a solid anchor for
low inflation supported by tight financial discipline.

Defined as the price ratio of nontradables to tradables.

Box 3. Mali: Real Effective Exchange Rate Developments
Despite the large appreciation of the CFA franc against the U.S. dollar since 2001, Mali’s REER
seems only moderately overvalued. Over 2000–07, the REER increased by 9 percent and the
ratio of nontradable to tradable prices increased by 15 percent, compared with nearly 50 percent
for the U.S. dollar exchange rate. The moderate real appreciation was because inflation in Mali
was relatively low and most of its trading partners appreciated as well (WAEMU-wide estimates
found Mali’s REER to be the least overvalued in the zone).
Estimates of overvaluation using the fundamental equilibrium approach are inconclusive. The
various methods (using the autoregressive distributed lag model, the Johansen model, and multicountry panel data estimates) yield results for 2006–07 ranging from a 24 percent undervaluation
to a 16 percent overvaluation. The strength of Mali’s share in the BCEAO international reserve
position and the stable long-term balance of payments outlook seem to run counter the notion of
serious overvaluation in Mali.

Fiscal Space and Public Administration Reform
21.
The 2007 turnout left the budget in a somewhat weaker position to address
potential shocks and avoid a buildup of costly domestic debt. In view of the uneven
implementation of the September 2007 revenue package and a gradual erosion of the level of

17
taxes on petroleum products, achievement of the 2008 budget revenue targets might be out of
reach. Maintaining poverty reduction programs may require the authorities to cut spending
below budget in non-priority areas in order to avoid a large deterioration in the basic fiscal
balance. Staff emphasized that with continued implementation of fiscal reforms and prudence
in programming spending increases, the basic balance deficit could be eliminated by 2010.
22.
While healthy revenue mobilization has permitted double-digit spending growth
in recent years, a tight focus on the composition of spending is essential to budgetary
stability and poverty reduction efforts. In the 2008 budget, outlays for basic health and
primary education are nearly unchanged relative to GDP. Staff argued that further efforts to
cut wasteful and inefficient spending, specially poorly targeted transfers, could free resources
for poverty reduction. Moreover, the wage bill is set to reach 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008, up
from 5.0 percent in 2007, reflecting both across-the-board increases in base salaries and
allowances and higher contributions to the civil service pension fund, and the ratio of wages
to tax revenue is approaching the WAEMU ceiling of 35 percent. In view of the need to
recruit additional teachers, health workers, and other personnel for the social sectors, staff
recommended rationalizing the status of the different classes of public sector workers,
reviewing allowances, and reforming the salary structure.
23.
The government has adopted a comprehensive action plan to modernize public
finance management, and recently expanded it to respond to the recommendations of the
May 2007 report on public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA). Priorities are
better monitoring of budget execution, particularly with respect to cash management and
financial obligations to the private sector, tightening financial control, and clearer
relationship between the General Auditor and other control entities. Public procurement is
also being reviewed. Mali has been accepted as a candidate country for the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the authorities are moving ahead to ensure full
disclosure and reconciliation of mining sector revenues.
24.
The authorities are decentralizing public administration with the support of
partners, notably the European Union and the World Bank. While progress is encouraging, a prerequisite for devolving greater financial responsibility to local authorities is enhancing their management capacity. In particular, staff stressed the importance of ensuring control
of how the decentralized entities recruit personnel.
Private Sector Development
25.
The authorities are promoting private enterprise to foster economic growth.
Strengthening the productive sector ranks high among the GPRSP priorities. Notwithstanding
significant progress in recent years, however, private enterprises still face severe impediments. Mali is ranked 158th out of 178 countries on the World Bank’s 2008 Doing Business
survey and even fares less well than other sub-Saharan African countries (Figure 5). Staff
discussed measures planned to improve the business climate, such as reducing the time to set

18
up a business, securing property rights and strengthening the property law, cutting transport
cost, and improving access to energy.

26.
Reforms to enhance prospects for rapid growth include improving the business
climate and increasing efficiency to promote productivity growth. The authorities
recognize that reinforcing the operations of public enterprises—perhaps including further
privatization—and reducing impediments to private sector development (related to business
start-up, property registration, licensing, labor market regulation, and contract enforcement)
is essential to growth.8 The authorities intend to accelerate financial sector reforms,
especially easing access to credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Financial Sector Reforms
27.
The financial sector needs to be firmed up to support private sector
development. As highlighted in the conclusions of the regional and Mali-specific FSAP
missions, banks are not well grounded and are vulnerable to exogenous shocks that might

8

The Presidential Investor’s Council has called for three ranges of measures: (a) establishing a one-stop shop
for setting up new companies; (b) facilitating trading in real estate; and (c) shortening the delivery of building
permits by, e.g., accelerating the conduct of environmental surveys.

19
destabilize them.9 Financial intermediation has leveled off since 2003 and, at about 18 percent, the ratio of credit to the economy to GDP is low. While Mali’s banking system as a
whole has excess liquidity, average capitalization is short of need and several banks are in
breach of prudential norms (Figure 6). Exposure to the cotton sector is high, and BHM,
which is being restructured, has a persistently large NPL portfolio. To enhance the efficiency
and soundness of the financial sector and boost growth, the authorities intend to strengthen
the balance sheets of public institutions, increase private ownership, and expand access to
bank credit.10
28.
The authorities intend soon to finish restructuring banks and further advance
privatization. State participation in credit institutions has placed excessive risks on the
budget and hampered financial sector development. Staff encouraged the authorities to
ensure that conditions are in place for successful privatization of BIM, and to support BHM
in its efforts to recover NPLs using the enhanced authority granted by the law enacted by the
National Assembly in January 2008. Restructuring BHM will likely entail significant costs:
to safeguard its cash flow in the short term, the authorities are closely monitoring its financial
position. As the FSAP mission recommended, staff suggested that the government refrain
from direct lending for housing and instead entrust management of housing loans to financial
professionals. The authorities should also strive to improve systems for managing deeds and
help establish regional mechanisms to mobilize long-term financial resources.
C. Other Issues
29.
Mali’s statistics are adequate for effective surveillance and it is working to
strengthen capacity.11 Staff reviewed Mali’s progress in implementing the GFSM 2001
methodology (a pilot program), and discussed ways to better monitor companies in which the
state is a shareholder, as well as prospects for extending coverage of public finance statistics
to the nonfinancial public sector. The authorities indicated interest in additional technical
assistance to implement the findings of the GFSM 2001 pilot study, e.g., to compile a
government balance sheet.
30.
Further trade liberalization, particularly related to the forthcoming Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU, could help make Mali more competitive.
Trade policy issues are normally handled by WAEMU, but negotiations with the EU are
conducted by ECOWAS, with assistance from the WAEMU commission; Mali has not
pursued a separate interim agreement. The Malian authorities, who are concerned about
9

The main recommendations from the FSAP mission cover financial sector supervision and stability, bank
restructuring, cash flow and public debt management, access to financial sector services, microfinance, housing
finance, and the legal and judicial system.

Additional information on Mali’s financial system is provided in the forthcoming FSSA report.

Statistical Issues are summarized in the Informational Annex and the pilot study on Mali’s fiscal data is
discussed in an Information Note prepared by the Statistics Department in consultation with AFR.

20
possible revenue losses from an EPA, support the regional position that accompanying
measures—including financial assistance to offset the impact of liberalization—should be in
place before an EPA is signed.
31.
Staff and the World Bank have updated Mali’s debt sustainability analysis.
Having benefited from considerable HIPC and MDRI debt relief, Mali is at low risk of debt
distress (see Supplement). Because implementing the GPRSP will require large public
investments, particularly in infrastructure, the authorities are seeking additional resources.
Somewhat larger borrowing can be sustainable over the long run, if debt management
continues to be prudent and nonconcessional borrowing is avoided.12
IV. NEW ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRAM
32.
The authorities are requesting a three-year PRGF arrangement to help address
the challenges posed by Mali’s economic vulnerability and raise its growth potential.13
The proposed program would further the objectives set out in the 2007–11 GPRSP:
(a) increase the resources available for poverty reduction, by both mobilizing more domestic
revenue and possibly securing scaled-up development assistance; (b) improve external
viability, mainly by strengthening the fiscal position; and (c) raise growth potential by
accelerating structural reforms.
33.
The program calls for strengthening the fiscal position over time without
constraining aid-financed outlays (Tables 2–7; MEFP, ¶ 7). An important objective is to
eliminate the deficit of the basic balance by 2010 (something Mali is committed to under the
WAEMU convergence framework),14 which provides an appropriate reference point for the
authorities to focus on medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability. The 2008 fiscal outlook
is more difficult than envisaged in the initial budget because of lower grant aid and higher
costs associated with the surge in food and oil import prices. Temporary customs exemptions
on rice imports and a partial pass-through of higher oil prices entail foregone tax revenue of
more than 1½ percent of GDP in 2008. To address the difficult situation, the government is
scaling back spending plans to limit recourse to domestic financing.

12

In 2007, the electricity company (EdM) contracted a commercial loan on an emergency basis from the
Islamic Development Bank, with government guarantee. This operation had a marginal effect on Mali's longterm debt sustainability. The authorities intend to seek more favorable terms for this loan.
13

The authorities also considered the option of a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) but judged that the PRGF is a
more appropriate framework for Mali considering its unfinished structural reform agenda.

14

Because the basic balance is defined as revenue (excluding grants) minus current expenditure, domestically
financed investment and net lending, it excludes both foreign-financed capital expenditure and expenditure
financed by HIPC debt relief. Additional budget support would be accommodated in part through a program
adjuster (TMU, ¶ 9).

The understandings reached with the authorities on the main economic targets
are in line with the Article IV discussions. Assuming normal weather, growth is projected
to recover to 5.4 percent in 2008, up from an estimated 2.8 percent in 2007. As in the past,
inflation would remain low at some 2–3 percent.15 With the expected increase in government
revenue, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would be at about the same level as in
2007. The external current account balance (excluding official transfers) is projected to
improve, despite lower cotton exports and continued growth in imports, as the value of gold
exports surges. Gross international reserves would remain at about 6 months of imports
(Tables 2–6).
A. Fiscal Management
35.
The program aims to raise government revenue by broadening of the tax base.
To offset the revenue loss from the partial pass-through of higher oil prices and customs
exemptions on rice imports, the authorities are working to curtail tax expenditures and
improve administrative efficiency. For customs, the authorities are committed to phasing out
discretionary exemptions and maintaining a floor for taxes on petroleum products.16 To
improve customs control, scanners are being used for containerized merchandise and the
monitoring of import valuation has stepped up. Discontinuing discretionary exemptions will
help reduce economic distortions, ensure a level playing field for investors, and foster
transparency. To improve tax administration, the authorities are expanding computerization
and enhancing auditing capacity.
36.
Budget expenditure is set to increase in 2008 to respond to GPRSP priorities and
the impact of salary increases. The general pay hike, larger contributions to the pension
fund, and recruitment for the social sectors mean the increase in the wage bill will outstrip
GDP growth. For the program, the authorities have decided to contain total outlays below the
amounts approved in the Finance Law (by 2 percent of GDP) by saving on goods and
services (½ percent of GDP) and lowering capital expenditure. The expenditure cuts entail a
strict containment of nonpriority outlays, and the deferral of some investment projects. This
should limit the deterioration in the basic deficit from an estimated 1.1 percent of GDP in
2007 to 1.9 percent in 2008. Should revenue collections fall short, the authorities are
committed to cut spending further to adhere to the ceiling on net domestic financing.
37.
The 2008 budget increases social outlays to a level consistent with those
programmed in the GPRSP. The authorities are determined to ensure that allocations for
15

Notwithstanding upside risks, especially from food and energy prices, the authorities expect that inflation can
be contained in 2008, if rains are normal.

16

See MEFP, ¶ 8, and TMU, ¶ ¶ 17–20. There remains a scope to grant exceptional customs exemptions,
subject to a decision of the Council of Ministers. This provision will also likely be used in 2008 to reduce fuel
costs for EdM. The administrative measures under way or planned for 2009 are in line with the
recommendations from FAD’s recent tax and customs technical assistance missions.

23
basic services, such as primary education and health clinics, are maintained or raised (MEFP,
¶ 9). Further increases in social outlays are possible if additional financing materialize from a
donors roundtable to be convened shortly in Bamako.
38.
The government intends to prepare a revised 2008 budget law in June/July. The
revised budget will detail the impact of the new international environment and spell out
changes in expenditure priorities such as steps to speed up the expansion in rice output.
Beyond the current year, the Ministry of Finance expects that lower import prices will allow
restoring in part the taxation levels prevailing in 2006–07, which should facilitate
achievement of a revenue ratio of 17 percent within two to three years. However, it would
also stand ready to introduce new tax measures and contain spending to secure achievement
of the basic balance objective.
B. Structural Reforms
39.
The program gives renewed impetus to structural reforms. Mali made progress in
the 1990s and early 2000s in such areas as rationalizing public resource management,
privatizing, improving the viability of the cotton sector, restructuring commercial banks, and
modernizing regulation. In many respects, however, progress was slow and some goals
remained elusive.
40.
Understandings have been reached on reforms to be undertaken in 2008 and on
an agenda for the medium term. The focus is on measures to raise agriculture production
and food security and thus help reduce the volatility of food prices; reform macrocritical state
enterprises like the public utilities, cotton ginnery, and banks; and increase the contribution
of the private sector to growth (see MEFP, ¶ 13).17 In line with the GPRSP, over the next
three years the authorities expect to complete the restructuring of CMDT and BHM, split and
farm out the water and electricity utilities, and make the administration business-friendly.
41.
Over the long term, the paramount challenge is to increase productivity,
improve competitiveness, and thus raise economic growth (MEFP, ¶ ¶ 14–16). The
authorities recognize that these objectives are demanding and that progress is likely to be
gradual. They are crafting a comprehensive strategy for accelerating growth, a draft of which
they will submit for discussion during the forthcoming donor roundtable.
C. Program Modalities
42.
The program provides for quarterly quantitative indicators and semiannual
performance criteria, and semiannual reviews. Quantitative indicators include ceilings on
17

The 2008 budget includes provisions for restructuring costs with respect to SOTELMA and a capital transfer
to CMDT. Additional costs associated with the restructuring of EdM, CMDT, and BHM will likely be incurred
in 2009–10.

24
(a) net domestic financing of the government; (b) external arrears; (c) contracting or
guaranteeing of nonconcessional loans; and (d) short-term borrowing; and indicative floors
on (e) budget revenue and the basic balance. Structural indicators include continuous
implementation of two measures to secure the government revenue base, reforms of
SOTELMA and OdN, and a new regulatory system for water and electricity (MEFP, ¶ ¶ 17–
18, and attached Table 1). The first review, to be completed by November 2008, would cover
budget developments, competitiveness, and reforms at OdN and EdM.
43.
Program performance criteria and benchmarks are macrocritical. The
authorities see the current privatization of the telephone company as essential not only to
foster competition in telecommunications but also to secure government revenue and prevent
a deterioration in the company’s financial position.18 Restructuring and reform of OdN is
over time expected to help achieve food security and improve resilience to shocks.
Strengthening of the electricity and water subsectors is designed to place EdM on a sounder
footing and make energy more available. Other elements of the authorities’ structural reform
agenda—e.g., in the cotton and financial sectors and the business environment—are being
monitored by the World Bank.
44.
Access under the program would help Mali cope with a difficult international
environment in 2008. Of the proposed amount of SDR 27.99 million, SDR 12.99 million
would be made available upon Executive Board approval and SDR 5 million at the time of
the first review, with subsequent semiannual disbursements of SDR 2 million (Table 9). Fund
financing would cover about one-fourth of the additional import costs in 2008, and represent
one-fifth of overall balance of payments support from international financial institutions over
2008–10. Mali currently has low outstanding loans with the Fund (SDR 8 million) and its
overall debt level is manageable (23 percent of GDP). Under the proposed arrangement,
Mali’s outstanding Fund loans would reach 3.6 percent of budget revenue and 2.3 percent of
exports of goods and services in 2010 (Table 10).
45.
Mali is expected to continue using Fund technical assistance extensively. The
authorities have expressed satisfaction with the assistance from AFRITAC-West and IMF
headquarters and desire further support in several areas. Mechanisms to coordinate technical
assistance, especially in the fiscal area, where the PAGAM/PEFA action plan makes clear
what is needed, appear adequate.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Mali has made much progress over the years in securing a sound environment
for economic growth and poverty reduction. The authorities have a solid track record of
performance in four Fund-supported programs since the early 1990s. They have consolidated
18

SOTELMA accumulated tax arrears in 2007 and it defaulted on external debt obligations in March 2008.

25
economic stability and advanced structural reforms, though often with delays. Yet Mali’s
social indicators still lag behind those of other developing countries, and economic growth
has slackened in recent years.
47.
The authorities recognize the importance of designing policies to make the
economy more resilient to shocks and boost competitiveness. The 2008 Article IV
discussions gave the Malian authorities and Fund staff an opportunity to reassess economic
developments and prospects. Notwithstanding short-term considerations and the day-to-day
pressures of budget management, the authorities must steadfastly focus on the fundamentals
that are critical to executing their growth and poverty reduction strategy successfully; the
program for which they are requesting PRGF support is an appropriate starting point.
48.
As staff and the authorities agree, Mali’s competitiveness has been deteriorating
since the early 2000s. Despite much uncertainty in the extent of misalignment, there is little
doubt that much must be done to reinvigorate economic activity, diversify exports, and
generate employment for a growing population. The CFA franc-based fixed exchange system
has served Mali well, providing a solid anchor for economic stability, and Mali’s external
position (as measured by its share in BCEAO international reserves) has continued to
strengthen. However, macroeconomic equilibrium may be consistent with suboptimal
economic growth, especially considering the vast inflows of foreign exchange from external
aid, gold exports, and personal transfers.
49.
In the short run, sound budget management is crucial. The 2008 fiscal position is
under much pressure owing mainly to the recent surge in food and oil prices. The authorities
are committed to taking resolute action to protect the revenue base, especially to rein in
customs exemptions effectively and preserve a minimum level of taxation on petroleum
products, and to cut overall spending below the ceilings approved in the original Finance
Law. Expenditure priorities are well grounded in the 2007–11 GPRSP, but it is important to
ensure that the wage bill remains well within the ceiling set by the WAEMU convergence
criteria. The authorities have made much progress in strengthening public finance
management and are clearly committed to addressing the shortcomings highlighted in the
2007 PEFA report and producing EITI-consistent revenue reports later this year.
50.
In the longer run, structural reforms are essential to raise Mali’s growth
potential. The authorities must be steadfast in executing their plans in a timely manner,
especially divesting the state’s shares in SOTELMA, restructuring the OdN, and reforming
regulation of water and electricity. While steps to raise productivity and enhance
competitiveness will take time to yield results, the policy measures planned under the
program will help move Mali into the right direction. In the months ahead, the authorities
need to balance carefully the desire to alleviate the impact of increases in food prices with the
imperative of boosting incentives to expand irrigation and cultivation. A preferred approach
would be for the government to limit its intervention through targeted subsidies for the most
vulnerable groups.

26
51.
The risks to the proposed program are manageable. Mali is subject to recurrent
exogenous shocks that may have adverse effects on the economy as a whole and especially
the budget. Access under the proposed PRGF is below norm. The substantial up-front
disbursement would help Mali cope with the sharp increases in food and oil import costs in
2008. For 2009 and beyond, the authorities are committed to continue raising revenue and
adjust expenditure to maintain a sustainable fiscal position, and they have previously
demonstrated their capacity to implement additional measures as the need arises.
52.
The data provided are generally adequate for Fund surveillance. Moreover, the
authorities are well aware of deficiencies in their data compilation systems and are working
diligently, with Fund support, to address them.
53.
Staff recommends approval of Mali’s request for a three-year PRGF
arrangement.
54.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mali will take place in
accordance with the July 15, 2002 Executive Board decision on consultation cycles.

Attachment I. Mali—Letter of Intent
Bamako, May 5, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The Government of Mali implemented the program supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for 2004–07 in a generally satisfactory manner and
was thus able to mobilize all the planned disbursements. Compliance with the program
parameters made it possible to maintain macroeconomic stability and to meet most of the
convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
Progress was also made in implementing structural reforms and strengthening social
programs in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for 2002–06. The
Government approved a Second Generation PRSP—the Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (GPRSP) 2007–11—in December 2006. On the basis of its performance, Mali
benefited from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.
2.
Because the progress made under the last PRGF does not constitute a sufficient
achievement, the Government requests continued Fund support. The Memorandum on
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) annexed to this letter outlines the policies of the
Government of Mali for 2008–11. The Government asks that its program—which seeks to
reduce poverty by improving the competitiveness of the economy and accelerating growth
while preserving macroeconomic stability—receive support from the IMF under a new
PRGF arrangement in an amount of SDR 27.99 million, and it hereby requests the first
disbursement in an amount of SDR 12.99 million.
3.
The Government considers that the PRGF is the appropriate instrument at the present
time to maintain a close economic policy dialogue with the Fund and to signal to the
international community its commitment to sound policies. Mali has a well-established
tradition of macroeconomic stability but its overall situation remains vulnerable and the
international environment in 2008 is particularly challenging. The Government is determined
to adhere to the timetable for implementing the program as envisaged in the MEFP.
4.
The Government believes that the policies and measures set out in the MEFP are
adequate to meet the objectives of the PRGF-supported program. In line with its firm

39
commitment to reach the objectives of the program, it will swiftly adopt any additional
measures necessary to attain them. The Government will consult with Fund staff on its own
initiative or at the request of the Fund’s Managing Director before adopting such measures,
or if there are changes in the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultations.
5.
The Government will provide Fund staff with any information required on progress
made in implementing the economic and financial policies and monitoring program
objectives. During the program, the Government will not introduce or intensify any exchange
restrictions, multiple currency practice, or import restriction for balance of payments
purposes, nor conclude any bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with
Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
6.
The Government authorizes the Fund to publish this letter, the annexed MEFP, and
the staff report relating to this request.
Yours truly,
/s/
Abou-Bakar Traoré
Minister of Finance

Attachment I. Annex I: Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
The year 2007 was not satisfactory in terms of economic growth in Mali. Late rains
led to a fall in agricultural production and rural incomes. The sustained rise in oil and cereals
prices on the international market produced adverse effects, particularly in urban areas.
Although the mining sector benefited from a significant increase in the price of gold, Mali’s
primary export product, gold production fell appreciably owing to geological problems.
Moreover, the depreciation of the dollar reduced export earnings, which derive mainly from
raw materials whose prices are quoted in dollars.
2.
Despite these exogenous factors, inflation remained moderate with price increases
averaging 1.4 percent; but real GDP growth 2007 is estimated at only 3 percent. The
collection of fiscal revenue was below forecast by an amount equivalent to 1 percent of GDP,
and preliminary estimates suggest that the basic budget balance recorded a deficit of
1.1 percent of GDP. The fall in exports due to lower gold and seed cotton production led to
an external current account deficit (excluding official grants) of 9.8 percent of GDP,
compared with 6.4 percent in 2006. Nevertheless, international reserves continued to grow,
reaching the equivalent of six months of imports at end-2007, and thanks to the MDRI,
Mali’s external debt burden declined markedly (23 percent of GDP, against nearly 50 percent
in 2005).
3.
In 2008 most macroeconomic indicators should be favorable, provided that weather
conditions are normal. Inflation is expected to remain at around 2½ percent and GDP growth
should reach 5 percent. The external position should strengthen in view of the high price of
gold; the trade balance would improve and foreign exchange reserves would remain stable at
about six months of imports.
Development Strategies
4.
The strategy to revive the Malian economy rests on three pillars. First, mobilization
of the resources needed to reduce poverty remains a fundamental priority, especially to
promote agriculture, ensure food security, and strengthen basic social services. Second,
because it is essential that financial stability underpin development, the Government aims to
create fiscal space to cope with potential shocks while at the same time striving to meet the
WAEMU convergence criteria, in particular by increasing the basic budget balance. The third
pillar of the plan, indispensable for robust and sustainable economic growth, is to seek gains
in competitiveness by improving the business climate to foster private sector growth. The
Government is convinced that these components, implemented concurrently, will help raise
medium-term growth, which should reach about 7 percent a year.
5.
The cornerstone of the economic and social development strategy remains a
sustainable reduction in poverty and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) for 2007–11 sets the
main approaches. The focus is on the pursuit of structural reforms, improved governance, the

41
expansion of basic infrastructure, private sector development, and human capacity-building.
Budgetary resources in 2008 are expected to be within the range of GPRSP forecasts, and
allocations to the most critical social sectors are consistent with the targets of the MediumTerm Fiscal Framework (MTFF) adopted by the Council of Ministers with the GPRSP. To
ensure that those resources are used effectively for poverty reduction, the Government will
take account of the GPRSP priorities, strengthen budgetary devolution and decentralization,
and monitor resources use at all levels.
6.
The National Assembly approved a law granting enhanced foreclosure powers to the
Banque de l’Habitat du Mali (BHM) in January 2008, and more vigorous efforts to collect
bad debts are under way. Reform of the Malian Retirement Fund (CRM), which revises the
parameters of the system to reduce gradually the CRM deficit and its cost to the Government,
was submitted to the National Assembly in March for consideration during its April 2008
session. The Government expects to publish the decree implementing the reform by end-July
2008, and in the near future it intends to launch new reforms of the general pensions system
(INPS). Somewhat behind schedule, the Government launched a call for bids in April for the
sale of its shares in Banque Internationale du Mali (BIM), and it intends to complete the
process as soon as possible.
Fiscal Policies
7.
Mali is vulnerable to external or natural exogenous shocks. Without the fiscal space
to respond rapidly to ad hoc demands, there is a risk that macroeconomic stability and the
development program will be undermined. The Government considers that in the mediumterm, a zero basic balance is the most appropriate budget target for responding to emergent
needs. In 2008 the deficit in the basic balance should be 1.9 percent of GDP, compared with
1.1 percent in 2007, reflecting the budgetary impact of the terms of trade. The aim is to
reduce the deficit to 1 percent of GDP in 2009 and achieve balance in 2010. In order to
respect the programming of expenditure to reduce poverty, measures have been implemented
to correct the downward trend in the tax to GDP ratio observed since 2005.
8.
On the basis of the measures in place, total budget revenue is projected at
CFAF 606 billion, equivalent to 17.1 percent of GDP, compared with 17.3 percent in 2007.
The Government is continuing to improve tax administration and broaden the tax base, in
particular by implementing the recommendations of recent IMF technical assistance
missions. At the Tax Directorate this involves in particular expansion of computerization,
enhanced monitoring of registration, and strengthened audit programs. A sub-directorate will
be established in 2009 to manage small and medium-sized enterprises. With regard to
Customs, the Government has decided to eliminate all exemptions that do not have an
explicit legal basis (with possible temporary exceptions duly approved by the Council of
Ministers). Existing exemptions will be more closely monitored and limited, in particular by
stricter application of the legislation providing for possible exemption. Moreover, the
implementation of the scanning of goods and enhanced monitoring of customs valuation will

42
allow better control of the tax base. With regard to oil products, the Government has not been
in a position to fully pass the increase in import prices through to retail prices. However, it is
committed to maintaining a minimum level of nominal taxation, as described in the attached
technical memorandum of understanding. The related increase in the retail prices of oil
products is a prior action under the program.
9.
The Government budget is under much pressure, especially as a result of the
readjustment of bonuses and allowances and the general increase in salaries (5 percent
effective January 1, 2008, and another 5 percent effective January 1, 2009). For 2008, total
budget expenditure is capped at CFAF 913½ billion (25.8 percent of GDP, compared with
25.3 percent of GDP in 2007), of which CFAF 480 billion is for current expenditure and
CFAF 362 billion for capital expenditure. At the same time the Government has decided to
strengthen its policy in favor of the social sectors. Thus, recurrent expenditure on the priority
social sectors (i.e., education and basic healthcare) will represent 41.5 percent of total
recurrent costs in 2008, compared with 40.8 percent in 2007. The Government also would
like to put into action its announced support for infrastructure and the productive sectors,
especially through reduction in untargeted transfers.
10.
Improving the quality of public spending remains a top priority. In coordination with
our external partners, measures have been included in the Government Action Program for
Improving and Modernizing Public Finance (PAGAM-GFP) to respond, among other things,
to the conclusions of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise.
An action plan incorporating PEFA measures has been prepared for 2008. Efforts are under
way to pursue implementation of the PAGAM-GFP/PEFA action plan, in particular by
completing the connection of authorizing officers (ministries, institutions, regions) to the
computerized expenditure system; improving the execution rate of programs by devolving
parts of the Procurement Office to the regions; reviewing the Procurement Code; shifting
gradually all donors from projects to budget support; and putting in place an economic and
financial analysis unit to help strengthen the capacities of the Finance Committee of the
National Assembly.
11.
With regard to financing, the Government will continue a policy of prudent
borrowing, both domestically and externally. To ensure debt sustainability, the Government
reaffirms its commitment to select high-quality projects and make use of external financing
on concessional terms only. Moreover, the Treasury intends to expand the issuance of bills
and bonds to improve cash management and finance capital imports. For 2008, total
Government financing is capped at CFAF 156 billion (4.4 percent of GDP), including
CFAF 116 billion for external financing and CFAF 40 billion for domestic financing.
Improved Competitiveness
12.
Mali’s economic growth rate has averaged nearly 5 percent a year since the mid1990s, which represents an annual increase in per capita GDP of 2 percent. However, the

43
growth rate has fluctuated significantly from year to year, and it has been on a downward
trend since the beginning of the present decade. The GPRSP-mandated rate of 7 percent is
essential for sustained poverty reduction, but requires far-reaching reforms to improve the
business climate and the competitiveness of the Malian economy.
13.
Increasing competitiveness calls for significant changes, primarily in the quality and
availability of developed land and basic infrastructure; the cost and reliability of services like
electricity and communications; the cost and quality of the workforce; and financial sector
reforms. These far-reaching changes can only be successful as part of a medium-term
approach and the Government is determined to launch the necessary reforms immediately.
The program’s main measures, covering food security, transport, the cotton sector, energy,
telecommunications, and the financial sector, are as follows:
•

Food security. The Government intends to improve all economic activities in the
primary sector by relying on, inter alia, irrigation, the modernization of farms, and the
development of an efficient agro-industrial sector. It aims to reduce the risks over the
long term and cushion the impact of cyclical food crises. The strategy is based on
using agro-ecological potential, especially by controlling water flows and managing
local development, diversifying activities, promoting the professional expertise of
those active in the sector, coordinating agricultural activities, and ensuring income
security for producers and operators. In particular, the strategy will be executed in the
Niger Delta region. The reform master plan for the Office du Niger (OdN) and a
performance contract between the state, producers and OdN will be adopted shortly
by the Council of Ministers, and the company’s institutional modernization plan
should be completed by end-2008. The development of new land will continue
(100,000 hectares, including 60,000 hectares at OdN, by 2012). Finally, an incentivebased financing framework will be put in place with the creation of the National
Agricultural Development Fund, as provided for in the Framework Law on
Agriculture, and the establishment of a mechanism to finance hydro-agricultural
systems and attract private investment.

•

Transport and marketing. The Government intends to develop marketing channels
for foodstuffs to improve distribution, in particular by implementing the second
Transportation Sectoral Program (PST 2), designed to improve transport conditions
for rural and urban communities, and by pursuing policies to overcome domestic and
external transportation constraints through diversification of the country’s supply and
export routes. The support measures envisaged include capacity-building,
rehabilitation, and modernization of public transport vehicles and strict application of
transport and safety legislation.

•

Cotton. The creation of four subsidiaries of the cotton company (CMDT) should be
completed by December 2008, in line with the timetable prepared in consultation with
the external partners in 2005 and approved by the Council of Ministers in October

44
2006. In the meantime, the committee that monitors the financial situation of CMDT
will continue to meet monthly, and it will examine the company’s recurrent
difficulties and advise on ways and means to reduce the sector’s losses. Moreover, the
existing process for setting procurement prices will be retained for the 2008/09 crop
year based on principles intended to balance the sector’s accounts, while steps will be
taken to properly manage the transition with the identification of private buyers for
the subsidiaries.
•

Energy. An action plan to ensure the medium-term viability of the electricity and
water sector was adopted at end-2005. The plan includes a tariff study and
preparation of an economic and financial model, an optimal investments analysis, an
institutional survey, and the auditing of Énergie du Mali (EdM). The tariff study will
be completed in May 2008 and, based on that study, the Energy and Water
Committee will make proposals on price adjustments, which will be implemented as
soon as possible. The optimal investment plan and the financial simulations are due in
May 2008, and the audit of EdM will be completed by end-June 2008. In the medium
term, the linking up of electricity grids at the regional level and the construction of
new hydroelectric plants will make it possible to lower costs and increase the
availability of electricity.

•

Telecommunications. It is expected that the call for bids to sell the Government’s
shares in Société de Télécommunications du Mali (SOTELMA) will go out in
September 2008 and the process will be completed by year-end. This privatization
will make it possible to consolidate SOTELMA’s market position through new
investment, extend access to telephones, and improve the quality of service. Increased
competition in the sector should encourage expansion of the supply of telephone
services and facilitate access to telecommunications services for the maximum
number of users, in particular in rural areas and at lower cost, while ensuring the
collection of taxes and fees on telecommunications.

•

Financial sector. The Council of Ministers adopted an updated version of the
financial sector development strategy in April, based on the analysis of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) carried out in February 2008. In the short-term,
measures include: privatization of Banque Internationale du Mali (BIM) through the
sale of 51 percent of the Government’s shares to a leading bank; restructuring of the
Banque de l’Habitat du Mali (BHM) and the Fonds de Garantie Hypothécaire du Mali
(FGHM), in particular by raising their capital, to ensure sound financing for housing;
social security reform to improve the financial situation and management of the social
security institutions (CRM and INPS), to help transform them into key institutional
investors and strengthen capital markets; and improving efficiency in the monitoring
and supervision of microfinance institutions.

45
14.
The Government intends to ensure that future wage increases are linked to
productivity to encourage labor market conditions conducive to growth. In the public sector,
which serves as a benchmark for the entire formal sector, the Government plans new
measures to boost labor productivity, including better incentives to enhance performance and
devolve public services. Moreover, studies are under way on rationalizing wage policy,
correcting distortions between different categories of Government employees, and
simplifying the system of bonuses and allowances. With regard to management of
contractual staff in the health and education systems, recruited on behalf of local authorities,
the following measures were implemented in 2008 to improve control of the payroll:
(i) extension of the computer system used to manage the salaries of contract staff to cover
those in the healthcare sector, and diligent registration of employees to facilitate data
processing of salary statements; (ii) creation of a national database to improve the monitoring
of staff; and (iii) adoption of a ministerial decree with detailed rules Governing the
organization and functioning of committees that oversee the reclassification and promotion
of local government contractual staff.
15.
The Government has launched a program of measures to improve the business
climate and facilitate private sector activity. On the regulatory front, planned reforms will
make it possible to remove obstacles facing entrepreneurs. Efforts will focus in particular on
setting up a one-stop shop to streamline business start-up procedures; lowering the cost of
recording property transfers; using collective bargaining procedures; improving the
functioning of commercial courts and arbitration boards; and simplifying and standardizing
transit documents for international trade. With regard to institutions, a number of measures
are under way or will be implemented in 2008. The Agency to Promote Investment in Mali
(API-Mali) has been operational since March 2008, and has recruited three sectoral directors;
the one-stop shop will shortly be in place and make it possible to start up a new business
within 72 hours, with two procedures instead of the current 11; the Government also intends
to cut the cost of starting a business to one-fifth of the present cost. In addition, a study is
being prepared on export development. The report, expected in 2008, will make proposals on
the establishment of an export promotion agency (ADEX).
16.
The accelerated growth strategy aims to lay the foundations for sustained growth and
lasting poverty reduction. The priorities in 2008 for mobilizing productivity gains concern
(i) macroeconomic measures to reduce the cost of factors of production and increase their
availability; (ii) sectoral measures to boost productivity, by providing basic infrastructure and
land suited for industrial and commercial use; and (iii) promotion of a dynamic and
competitive private sector, particularly with regard to rice production, the processing of
agricultural products, and tourism. Improving the industrial base is also an important part of
overall competitiveness. Industrial policy seeks to boost the creation of new businesses and
restructuring of existing ones, revive production, promote investment, and create jobs. The
drafting and implementation of the Framework Law on the Private Sector (LOSP) should
sustain and reinforce the efforts to develop the sector. Looking ahead, the integration of the
Malian economy into the multilateral trade system is also an important component, which

46
means taking an active part in negotiations on the Doha Round, on the Economic Partnership
Agreements (EPAs), and on access under the African Growth and Opportunities Act
(AGOA), to enable Mali to win and retain market shares.
Program Monitoring
17.
Table 1 lists the program performance indicators and benchmarks for 2008–09. The
indicators are defined in the attached technical memorandum. To provide for contingencies,
the monitoring framework provides for an adjustment mechanism (described in detail in
paragraph 9 of the memorandum), to be used if there is a gap between nonproject external
assistance and program projections.
18.
The conclusion of the first PRGF review, scheduled for November 2008, will be
based on achievement of performance criteria at end-June 2008. The review will focus on
fiscal developments and competitiveness indicators, as well as reform programs at the OdN
and EdM. The second program review is scheduled to be completed by end-May 2009 on the
basis of the performance criteria at end-December 2008.

Attachment I, Annex II: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding defines the performance criteria and
benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement. It also sets out the frequency and deadlines for data reporting to the
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program-monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the Government is defined as the central administration
of the Republic of Mali and does not include local administrations, the central bank, or any
other public entity with autonomous legal personality that is not included in the table of
Government financial operations (TOFE).
3.
The definitions of “debt” and “concessional loans” for the purposes of this
memorandum of understanding are as follows:
(a)

Debt is defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (see Decision of the Executive Directors of the IMF No. 12274-00/85,
August 24, 2000).

(b)

A loan is considered concessional if, on the date the contract is signed, the ratio of the
present value of the debt, based on the reference interest rates, to the nominal value of
the debt is less than 65 percent (i.e., a grant element exceeding 35 percent). The
reference interest rates used in this assessment are the commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). For debts with a maturity exceeding 15 years, the ten-year
reference interest rate published by the OECD is used to calculate the grant element.
For shorter maturities, the six-month market reference rate is used.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Financing of the Government; Subceiling on
Net Domestic Bank and Market Financing of the Government

4.
Net domestic financing is defined as the sum of (i) net bank credit to Government, as
defined below, (ii) other Government claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions,
and (iii) nonbank financing of the Government.
5.
Figures on net bank credit to Government are calculated by the BCEAO. Figures on
nonbank financing are calculated by the public treasury, and are final in the context of the
program.
6.
Net bank credit to Government is defined as the balance between Government debts
and Government claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The scope of net

49
bank credit to Government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
and is consistent with established Fund practice in this area. It implies a broader definition of
Government than that specified in paragraph 2 by also including local governments, and
selected autonomous government agencies and projects. Government claims include the
CFA franc cash balance, postal checking accounts, secured liabilities (obligations
cautionnées), and all deposits with the BCEAO and commercial banks of public entities, with
the exception of industrial or commercial public institutions (EPICs) and public enterprises,
which are excluded from the calculation. Government debts to the banking system include all
debts to these same financial institutions. Deposits of the cotton stabilization fund and
Government securities held outside the Malian banking system are not included in the
calculation of net bank credit to Government.
7.
Nonbank financing of the Government is defined as nonbank market financing and
other nonbank financing. Nonbank market financing includes sales net of repayments of
Government bills and bonds held outside national banking institutions. Other nonbank
financing of the Government includes proceeds from the sale of Government assets,
repayments on domestic debt to nonbank creditors, and other net claims on the treasury. The
receipts from sale of Government assets are defined as the proceeds from the sale, effectively
received by the Government during the fiscal year, of all or part of the shares held by the
Government in privatized enterprises. In the event that payments in respect of these sale
transactions are expected to extend beyond the fiscal year, the residual will be included in the
calculation of nonbank financing of the Government in each of the subsequent years, in
accordance with the annual scheduling of the expected payments.
8.
Net domestic bank and market financing of the Government is defined as the sum of
(i) net bank credit to Government, as defined above, (ii) other Government claims and debts
vis-à-vis national banking institutions, and (iii) nonbank financing of the Government
through the issuance of securities to nonbanks.
Adjustment factor
9.
The ceiling on the change in net domestic financing of the Government will be
adjusted down (up) if external budgetary assistance exceeds (falls short of) the program
amount. Budgetary assistance is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief (excluding project
loans and grants, IMF resources, and debt relief under the Initiative for Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries). Adjustment will be made at a rate of nil percent for amounts up to
CFAF 10 billion; 50 percent for amounts from CFAF 10 billion up to CFAF 25 billion; and
75 percent for amounts in excess of CFAF 25 billion.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Public Payments Arrears
10.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of external payments due and
unpaid for external liabilities of the Government and foreign debt held or guaranteed by the
Government. The definition of external debt provided in paragraph 3(a) applies here.

50
11.
Under the program, the Government will not accumulate external payments arrears,
with the exception of arrears arising from debt under renegotiation or being rescheduled. The
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears will be applied
on a continuous basis throughout the program period.
C. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt with a Maturity of One Year or More
Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the Government and/or Public Enterprises
12.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Borrowing (Executive Board
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85)
(8/24/00)), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has yet
been received.
13.
The concept of Government for the purposes of this performance criterion includes
Government as defined in paragraph 2, administrative public institutions (EPAs), scientific
and/or technical public institutions, professional public institutions, industrial and/or
commercial public institutions (EPICs), and local governments.
14.
Starting on the date of program approval by the Executive Board of the IMF, a ceiling
of zero is set for nonconcessional borrowing. This performance criterion is monitored on a
continuous basis.
15.
The Government undertakes not to contract or guarantee external debt with a maturity
of one year or more and a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the
reference interest rates corresponding to the borrowing currencies provided by the IMF). This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Borrowing, adopted by the Executive Board on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which no value has
yet been received. However, it does not apply to financing granted by the IMF and treasury
bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) regional market.
D.

Ceiling on Short-Term External Debt Newly Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Government and/or Public Enterprises

16.
The definition in paragraph 12 applies to this performance criterion. Short-term
external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Import- related credit,
CMDT foreign borrowing secured by the proceeds of cotton exports, and debt-relief
operations are excluded from this performance criterion. Treasury bills issued in CFA francs
on the WAEMU regional market are also excluded. In the context of the program, the
Government and public enterprises will not contract, or guarantee, short-term external debt.
This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.

51
E.

Floor on Taxation of Petroleum Products

17.
Starting on the date of program approval by the Executive Board of the IMF, the
Government shall maintain taxation of petroleum products at or above minimum nominal
levels as follows:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

Gasoline, all grades (essence)
Diesel fuel (gasoil)
Distillate diesel oil (DDO)
Other fuel (except kerosene)

CFAF 255 per liter
CFAF 110 per liter
CFAF 130 per liter
CFAF 100 per liter

18.
These minima shall apply to all imports of a given product through a given corridor in
excess of 100 tons in a calendar month. Reductions of up to10 percent in total taxation may
apply on corridors other than Abidjan and Dakar.
19.
Taxation for the purposes of this performance criterion is defined to include valueadded tax, import duties, excise taxes (notably the Domestic Tax on Petroleum Products,
TIPP), and statistical tax. This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis,
using the monthly regulatory order setting the retail price structure of petroleum products.
F. Customs Exemptions not Explicitly Provided for by Law
20.
Starting on the date of program approval by the Executive Board of the IMF, the
Government shall permit no customs exemption that is not explicitly provided for by law.
Exemptions not subject to this provision include, but are not necessarily limited to, those

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MALI
Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund1
Approved by Robert Sharer and Mark Plant (IMF)
and Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Braga (World Bank)
May 8, 2008
The 2008 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Mali is at a low risk of debt
distress. The outlook remained broadly stable since the previous DSA, completed in October
2007. Further fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to reduce vulnerability to shocks, and
strengthened debt management would help Mali further reduce its risk of debt distress.
I. BACKGROUND AND MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
1.
As a result of the HIPC and MDRI initiatives, Mali’s stock of external debt has
declined significantly.2 Mali’s stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt has
declined from 49.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 20 percent in 2006; at end-2007 it increased
slightly to 22.9 percent of GDP3. Total public debt at end-2007 was estimated at US$1,542
million (i.e., 24 percent of GDP, of which 1.1 percent was domestic debt).
2.
The baseline scenario reflects prudent macroeconomic projections and is in line
with Mali’s historical experience (Box 1). The medium-term outlook envisages continued
macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth, supported by continued structural
reforms, highly concessional borrowing, and a moderate scaling up of aid. Exports are
projected to drive growth over the medium term based on an increase in gold production
Prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff. ADB staff was consulted during the
preparation process.

1

HIPC debt relief was granted by all multilaterals, Paris Club bilateral creditors, and three
non-Paris Club creditors (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China). Negotiations with four countries
are ongoing.

2

This reflects new concessional loans from IDA and the ADB, and a non-concessional loan
from IsDB.

3

2
spurred by the high international gold prices. In the long term, however, gold production is
projected to taper off, resulting in slightly lower growth of GDP and exports, and slowing the
improvement in the current account deficit. The fiscal deficit (including grants), upon which
net public borrowing depends, is projected to hover around 4 percent of GDP throughout the
DSA period.

Box 1. Mali: Debt Sustainability Analysis: Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2008-26
• Real GDP growth is projected to average 4.9 percent a year during 2008-13 and remain around 5 percent a
year thereafter, assuming lower gold production from 2012 onward and rainfall returning to its long-term
average level.4
• Consumer price inflation is projected to remain at about 2.5 percent a year, in line with the WAEMU
convergence criterion.
• The basic fiscal balance is projected to improve from an average deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in the
period 2008 to 2013, to a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in the long run; grants are assumed to increase
on average by 3 percent per year during 2008-13.
• Exports are projected to grow by 7.3 percent a year during 2008-13, compared to a growth rate of
13 percent during 2002-2007, reflecting slower gold exports. Imports are projected to grow at 6.4 and
7.7 percent in the medium and long term respectively. International reserves are expected to remain high,
at about 6 months of imports of goods and services during the projection period.
• The terms of trade and real exchange rate are projected to remain unchanged from 2013 onward. Public
sector net external new borrowing is expected to average about 2.3 percent of GDP a year. It is assumed
that 70 percent of the new borrowings will come from multilateral sources and the remaining 30 percent
from bilateral sources.
• It is assumed that there will be no new public sector domestic medium and long-term (MLT) loans. The
current MLT domestic loan stock is assumed to be amortized linearly through the period 2008-2013.

II. RESULTS OF THE EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
3.
Mali’s external debt ratios have changed little since the last DSA and have
remained well below the indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario. Although
Mali’s external debt ratios are projected to increase steadily over time, they are projected to
remain below the applicable indicative debt thresholds over the period 2008–26 under the
baseline scenario (Figure 1 and Table 1). 5 The NPV of debt-to-GDP is expected to climb
The 2007 PRSP projects an annual economic growth of 7 percent. The teams assumed a
more conservative approach, taking into account the current pace of economic reform,
assuming that the economy will grow at its historical trend rate of 5 percent per year.

4

Based on the World Bank classification, the external debt burden thresholds relevant for
Mali are (i) NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (ii) NPV of debt-to-revenue of 250
percent; (iii) NPV of debt-to-GDP of 40 percent; and (iv) debt service-to-exports and revenue
ratios of 20 and 30 percent, respectively.
5

3
from about 14 percent in 2007 to 31 percent in 2026. As gold production tapers off, NPV of
debt-to-exports is projected to increase from 48 percent in 2007 to 106 percent in 2026. The
debt service-to-exports ratio is expected to increase from 3 percent in 2007 to 5 percent in
2026.
4.
The standard sensitivity tests reveal some vulnerabilities (Table 1 and Figure 1).
The threshold for the ratio of NPV of debt-to-GDP is breached in the later years of the
projection period for the alternative scenario that assumes new public loans on less favorable
terms and for the bound test that assumes a 30 percent depreciation relative to the baseline in
2008. However, all debt service ratios remain below the indicative thresholds in all scenarios
examined.
5.
Mali remains at low risk of debt distress. Even though the indicative threshold is
breached under two scenarios, there are important factors that mitigate the risks identified by
the analysis. Regarding the 30 percent depreciation shock, Mali’s real exchange rate has
remained broadly stable, and recent econometric studies on Mali’s real exchange rate parity
are inconclusive. For the WAEMU zone as a whole, the studies indicate that any
misalignment is modest, suggesting that a shock of such magnitude would be unlikely. The
establishment of mechanisms to ensure closer consultations between the authorities and the
IMF and Bank staffs mitigates the risk of less concessional lending. In addition, upcoming
Bank-supported technical assistance in debt management will further strengthen debt
management structures and analysis.6 Finally, it should be emphasized that the breaches
occur at the end of the projection period – therefore, there is ample time for policy reactions
should future DSAs point to a worsening debt situation.

In the past, Mali has generally contracted concessional loans. In 2007, a non-concessional
package was contracted from the IsDB in the amount of US$71 million (about 1 percent of
Mali’s 2007 GDP). Based on the economic merits of the package, IDA granted a waiver on
its non-concessional borrowing policy.

4

III. RESULTS OF THE PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
In the baseline scenario, Mali’s public debt increases moderately over the
projection period (Figure 2 and Table 4). The NPV-of-debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to
increase from 64 percent in 2007 to 135 percent in 2026 (incl. grants).7 The debt-service-torevenue (excl. grants) ratio is projected to remain low, declining from 10 percent in 2007 to
4 percent in 2026. Thus, Mali’s public debt is considered manageable, as long as the
authorities implement a cautious debt strategy.8
7.
The sensitivity analysis shows that Mali’s public debt is vulnerable to shocks. If
GDP growth were to be permanently lower by 1 percentage point compared to the baseline,
adversely affecting revenue collection, and without any offsetting adjustment, the NPV of
public debt (incl. grants) would reach 196 percent of revenue by 2026 (Table 2 and Figure 2)
compared to 135 percent under the baseline. Similarly, if the projected 2008 primary deficit
of 3.5 percent—atypically high for Mali—remained constant throughout the projection
period (as opposed to the projected drop to an average of 0.2 percent), the NPV of public
debt-to-revenue would climb from 64 percent in 2007 to 192 percent by 2026 (Table 4). The
sensitivity analysis underscores the importance of continuing to pursue sound
macroeconomic policies to achieve high GDP growth rates and low public sector deficits.
IV. CONCLUSION
8.
Mali’s risk of debt distress is low. Most debt indicators are below the relevant
country-specific debt-burden thresholds. Under two sensitivity tests, the NPV of debt-toGDP breaches the threshold in the outer years of the projection period, but strong mitigating
factors would render these scenarios unlikely. Results of the total public sector debt ratios
confirm the results of the external DSA. Going forward, Mali would need to deepen fiscal
consolidation, enhance competitiveness, and follow a prudent debt strategy, in order to
strengthen its debt sustainability.

Excluding grants, the NPV-of-debt-to-revenue ratio is projected to increase from 75.8 percent in 2007 to 152 percent in 2026.

Mali’s current debt strategy relies on lower cost concessional external financing, thereby
reducing the stock of the government’s domestic borrowing and promoting the “crowding in”
of credit to the private sector.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. Projections also includes contribution from price
and exchange rate changes. The large residual in 2006 is due to MDRI.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at
the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
2
Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed
during the interim period.
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and completion
points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the decision point
(or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed at
the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in
footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key
structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

IX.

Safeguards Assessments

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union that includes Mali. The most
recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The
assessment indicated progress has been made in strengthening the bank's safeguards
framework since the 2002 assessment and identified some areas where further steps would
help solidify it.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management have been established and follow-up on internal and external
audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The monitoring results of the first half of 2007 indicate certain vulnerabilities remain in
internal control systems and legal structure, while there has been some progress in improving
the external audit process (through adopting a multi year audit program), establishing an
audit committee, expanding disclosures in the notes to financial statements on financial
positions with the Fund by countries, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of the
internal audit function.

Exchange Rate Arrangements and Summary of Exchange Restrictions

Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the union, has no restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 50 = F 1 from 1948 until
early 1994. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the new parity set
at CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the Euro at a
rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1.
As of June 1, 1996, Mali and other members of WAEMU accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Mali’s exchange
system has no restrictions on making payments or transfers for current international
transactions and the country does not engage in multiple currency practices.
Sharing a common trade policy with other members of WAEMU, Mali has shifted key trade
policy-making to the sub-regional level. The common external tariff (CET) was adopted in
January 2000. Mali complies with the union’s tariff rate structure and has effectively
dismantled internal tariffs. WAEMU tariff reform has reduced the simple average custom
duty from 22.1 percent in 1997 to 14.6 percent in 2003 (latest available): the maximum rate
is 20 percent. Imports to Mali are not subject to quantitative restrictions.
Because Mali has signed the Cotonou Convention, its exports to the European Union
generally enjoy nonreciprocal preferential treatment in the form of exemption from import
duties. Malian goods enjoy nonreciprocal preferential access to the markets of developed
countries other than the European Union under the Generalized System of Preferences. Mali
is also eligible to benefits from the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act. At
the WAEMU level, officially Mali experiences no regulatory impediments to its exports.
XI.

Article IV Consultations

Mali’s Article IV consultation cycle is governed by the provisions of the July 2002 decision
on consultation cycles. The Executive Board completed the 2005 Article IV consultation
(Country Report No. 06/73) on December 19, 2005.
XII.

ROSC/AAP

Regarding the HIPC Assessment Action Plan, a May 2004 mission concluded that progress
had been achieved. The number of tightly defined benchmarks observed by Mali had
increased from 8 out of 15 in 2001 to 11 out of 16, and significant advances were made in the
areas where the benchmarks were not yet met. The report put forward an action plan to
strengthen Mali’s budget management capacity, with the view to helping Mali meet all 16
indicators in the medium term. One of the priorities the mission identified in many areas was
to extend beyond the procedural monitoring of compliance with the rules to emphasize
effectiveness and efficiency based on a tighter focus on risk management.

Appendix II. Mali: IMF-World Bank Relations
(April 7, 2008)1
A.

Partnership in Mali’s development strategy

1.
Mali’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (GPRSF) adopted by the
Government in December 2006, comprises programs over the 2007-11 period grouped under the
following three pillars: (i) infrastructure development and strengthening of the productive sectors
(including food security, rural development, SME development, and sustainable natural resources
management); (ii) strengthening the structural reform agenda (comprising public sector reforms,
investment climate, financial sector, governance, and capacity of the civil society); and (iii)
strengthening of social sector services (including promotion of job creation, improved access to
basic social services, and HIV/AIDS).
2.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting the
Government’s macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for enhanced
Bank-Fund collaboration. This includes participation of Bank staff in the meetings with the
Malian authorities on the Fund’s program review missions, and IMF staff participation in Bank
development policy missions as well as in Bank internal review meetings on key operations or
studies. The IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in social and
structural areas, with close collaboration on a few structural areas that have a particular impact on
macroeconomic stability. The Fund’s dialogue and conditionality are consistent with the
structural programs agreed with the Bank, and the Bank’s policy framework with Mali is
elaborated consistent with the Governments’ macroeconomic framework agreed with the Fund.
B.

World Bank Group strategy

3.
The World Bank Group’s strategy, outlined in the new joint IDA-IFC Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board of Directors on February 5, 2008 selectively supports
key pillars of the 2006 GPRSF. The CAS covers the period FY08-11 and has two strategic
objectives: (i) promote rapid and broad-based growth; and (ii) strengthen public sector
performance for service delivery. Within the two CAS pillars, the Bank will focus on (a) private
sector led growth by addressing key constraints such as productivity, energy, transport, and
finance and by linking the country to the rest of the world; b) governance; and (c) capacity
development. The Bank also supports Mali under the Bank’s Regional Integration Assistance
Strategy (2001), notably the programs for connection to the West Africa Power Pool,
harmonization of country policies and/or regulatory frameworks (telecommunications,
agriculture, and financial sectors), water resource development of the Niger and Senegal Rivers,
strengthening of road transport corridors and transit facilitation, and strengthening the regional
payments system. The Bank’s assistance to Mali in its support to regional integration will be
fully aligned with the regional PRS and UEMOA regional economic program (REP) priorities.

This note is updated on an annual basis by World Bank staff.

9
4.
As of December 2007, the IDA portfolio in Mali consists of 14 operations totaling $622.4
million in net commitments, of which $353.5 million (57 percent) remain undisbursed. Including
the regional operations, the portfolio amounts to $723.8 million. Close to 47 percent of the IDA
portfolio is concentrated in the rural development sector and more than 22 percent in the
transport sector.. Since FY07, the Bank has provided budget support through Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs) underpinned by a medium-term program. In light of the limited IDA
allocations,, the FY08-FY11 CAS envisages yearly PRSCs and self-standing investments in key
projects in the energy, agriculture and urban sectors.
5.
Recently completed non-lending activities include a Macroeconomic Growth and Water
Variability study, Poverty Assessment, Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), a
Diagnostic Trade Integrated Framework Study, urban sector review, health and education country
status reports, transport and growth study, a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the cotton
sector, and a Country Economic Memorandum providing analysis on Mali’s growth performance
and prospects. The Bank has also assisted with development of medium-term expenditure
frameworks (MTEF) for health, education, transport, and agriculture-livestock-fisheries sectors.
In FY07, the Bank was the lead donor for Mali’s Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) review. Ongoing non-lending activities include a Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), and three studies: Demography
and Economics, Rural Finance and Governance Diagnostic. Going forward, the Bank will focus
on tackling constraints to growth and service delivery. The FY09 indicative knowledge program
includes a growth note on mining, a study on remittances, an investment climate assessment
(ICA) update, a country environmental assessment and a skills development study.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION

6.
Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization
including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial stability and
risk management.
7.
Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where both
institutions have conditionality, including cotton sector reform, privatization and regulatory
reform (telecommunications, banking, financial and energy sectors), pension reform, and
measures to improve the investment climate. The Bank also leads in other areas such as:
agricultural competitiveness/diversification; rural development (irrigation, roads, support to
producer organizations); private sector development (strengthening the investment climate,
telecommunications sector, airport improvement, mining regulation and environment
management, small-scale mining, access to business services, support to small/medium
enterprises); urban development (land/housing market development, water/road infrastructure);
transportation policy/infrastructure; energy sector reforms; and social sectors (health, education
and social protection, including HIV/AIDS). The Bank’s work in structural areas includes
analytical work and dialogue on trade and growth policies, which form part of the overall
economic policy dialogue. The Bank collaborates closely with other donors in all areas of its
sector dialogue with Mali. Harmonized donor support is established in some sections (health,
education, Office du Niger, cotton) and is being established in other sectors, namely rural water

10
supply and sanitation. The Bank is lead donor in the dialogue to harmonize donor budget support
to Mali.
8.
Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund collaborate in assessing
performance of HIPC resource use. Both also monitor progress on budgetary and public
expenditure management, yet emphasize different aspects of the Government’s reform program
in the respective support operations to Mali. The Bank emphasis in this area is on strengthening
all phases of the public expenditure system—budget preparation, execution, and controls—to
support the Government’s objectives of progressive shifts toward result-based budgeting and
improved expenditure management. Bank support is at the national level in the finance ministry
(global MTEF, integrated information technology system, audit capabilities, budget reporting)
and sector ministries (selected sector MTEFs, inter- and intra-sectoral allocations), as well as at
de-concentrated levels of the government (IT system, capacity building). The Fund’s emphasis is
on fiscal management, expenditure management (including financing of transfers to parastatals),
revenue enhancing measures, and audit capabilities. Table 1 summarizes the areas of Bank-Fund
collaboration in Mali.

Appendix III. Mali: Statistical Issues
(As of March 2008)
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, there is considerable
scope for improving coverage, timeliness, and availability of economic and financial data.
Mali has been participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
September 2001 and has advanced the implementation of its short- and medium-term plans
for improvement. The metadata posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB), last certified in June 2003, require updating.
Real sector
There are weaknesses in the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of national accounts data.
The main reason has been the inadequacy of real sector data, owing to insufficient funding
and technical staffing of the National Directorate of Statistics and Data Processing (DSDP).
With the support of AFRITAC West, a mission conducted in November 2007 found that
significant progress has been made in the compilation of the 2004 national accounts and a
more efficient organization of work has been put in place.
In collaboration with other West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
member countries, the DSDP has been compiling and publishing a harmonized consumer
price index (CPI) for Bamako, on a monthly basis since early 1998. Index weights and,
possibly, extension of coverage to additional cities is under review.
Government finance statistics
As part of the process of economic integration among the member countries of the WAEMU,
Mali has made significant progress in bringing its fiscal data in line with the common
framework that has been developed with technical assistance from the Fund (the harmonized
table of government financial operations – TOFE). However, effort are needed to improve
the timeliness of the TOFE. Work is progressing with the assistance of AFRITAC West and
AFRISTAT to expand the coverage of the TOFE to public agencies and local governments.
Staff have begun discussions with the Ministry of Finance on issues relating to the adoption
of the revised 2001 GFS methodology. Fiscal data are re-disseminated on the BCEAO’s and
the WAEMU’s website, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance launched a website
in 2006.
In July 2007 a GFS mission visited Bamako to advance further the implementation of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The authorities responded favorably and a page
for Mali was introduced in the 2007 issue of GFS Yearbook. To date the authorities have
supplied six years of annual GFS data and they are preparing to disseminate quarterly data to
STA for publication in IFS. In January 2008, the Minister of Finance issued a decree
committing the government to the development of a database which will facilitate the
balance sheet approach to analysis of the public sector; among the first steps will be an
inventory and appraisal of the fair market value of Mali’s nonfinancial assets.

13
Public debt statistics are prepared and monitored by separate agencies: external debt by the
National Public Debt Directorate (NPDD) and domestic debt by the National Directorate of
the Treasury and Government Accounting. The NPDD uses CS-DRMS accounting software.
Debt data and projections are of generally good quality, although there is scope for
improving the coverage of debt relief (multilateral and bilateral) and the presentation of
passive debts. A procedure for regularly updating exchange rate projections is needed.
Monetary data
Preliminary monetary data for Mali are prepared by the national agency of the Bank of
Central African States (BCEAO) and released officially by the headquarters of the BCEAO.
The dissemination of monthly monetary data from the BCEAO takes from four to six weeks
consistent with GDDS recommendations. Data are posted on the BCEAO website with a
considerably longer lag.
In June 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of currency in
circulation in member states. The revised method, based on updating sorting coefficients
(“coefficients de tri”), has been applied retroactively from December 2003. The revised
estimates increased the export of CFA franc banknotes from Mali to other member states,
from 2003 resulting in a reduction of currency in circulation and a reduction of the
counterpart net foreign assets in the BCEAO national balance sheet. Parallel revisions were
also made to the balance of payments. Nonetheless, the national BCEAO balance sheets
remain estimates based on the calculation of banknote movements and are therefore subject
to error.
In March 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s methodology, the
BCEAO reported to STA test data for the central bank for June 2005 for all member
countries using the Standardized Report Form (1SR). In response to STA’s comments, the
BCEAO has recently provided a revised 1SR and indicated that the form for Other
Depository Corporations (2SR) is being prepared.
Balance of payments data
In December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of payments
statistics was formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the
countries participating in the WAEMU. The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance
of payments statistics with a lag which is longer than the recommendation of the GDDS
guidelines. The BCEAO national agency compiles quarterly balance of payments statements,
which, however, are not sufficiently robust for publication.
The foreign assets of the private non banking sector are not well covered in the financial
accounts, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, obtained through partial surveys of
residents’ foreign assets. The BCEAO has recently implemented a compilation system
allowing commercial banks to report data on payments involving nonresidents; however,
these data are not used to produce annual balance of payments statistics.
The multi sector statistics mission that visited Mali during April 22-May 6, 2003 found that
the balance of payments compilation system is generally sound and encouraged the

14
authorities to integrate banking settlement sources and disseminate the balance of payments
within the recommended timeliness, as set by the GDDS. Implementation of these
recommendations is pending.
Annual statistics on balance of payments and international investment position are reported
to STA on a regular basis.
Poverty Statistics
The PRS Annual Update identifies a key set of poverty indicators for monitoring of the PRS
implementation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
MALI
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and Request for a Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility—
Supplementary Information and Supplementary Letter of Intent
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Robert Sharer and Mark Plant
May 27, 2008
1.
This supplement provides updated information on Mali’s request for a new three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (please refer to this Country
Report).
2.
In the attached letter addressed to the Managing Director, the Minister of Finance of
Mali states that the authorities were unable to meet the prior action for the program—to reach
floor levels for the taxation of petroleum products—owing to developments in international
oil prices (Attachment I). The authorities were concerned that a large price hike at this
juncture could prove inordinately disruptive at the start of the planting season, especially
considering the continuing pressures on food prices and uncertainties about the 2008/09 crop.
Retail petroleum prices were raised by 2½ percent in mid-May, whereas 8–9 percent would
have been required at that time to protect the revenue base. There is now a financing gap of
CFAF 12 billion (0.4 percent of GDP).
3.
The authorities intend to meet their original commitment later, but the timetable for
further increases in tax rates is not yet clear. To close the emerging financing gap, they are
renewing efforts to raise tax and customs collections and further curtailing capital
expenditure, which implies deferring, or slowing the implementation of, several investment
projects. The 2008–09 budget projections are essentially unchanged at this stage, apart from
symmetrical reductions in 2008 revenue and expenditure (by CFAF 12 billion).
4.
Given the unusual challenges Mali is facing, staff believes that the expenditure cuts
are the most prudent way to respond to the revenue shortfall. Staff is urging the authorities to
adhere to the agreed floors on petroleum taxation, which will likely require further price
hikes in the coming months, and to restore the levels set earlier as soon as conditions permit.
5.

Staff recommends approval of Mali’s request for a three-year PRGF arrangement.

Attachment I. Mali—Letter of Intent
Bamako, May 27, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
This letter supplements the request dated May 5, 2008. It modifies some elements of
the 2008 program, taking into account recent economic developments.
2.
In view of the sharp increase in oil prices on international markets, the Government
of Mali has not been in a position to fulfill its commitment to reach the established minimum
levels of taxation on petroleum products (MEFP, ¶ 8, and TMU, ¶¶ 17–19). The price
increases implemented on May 14 were limited to CFAF 15 per liter, whereas increases of
about CFAF 55 were necessary under the program. As a result, the prior action was not
fulfilled, resulting in a financing gap of CFAF 12 billion in the 2008 budget.
3.
The Government is committed to preserving the stability of public finances, and it has
adopted additional measures to raise revenue and curtail expenditure. These measures, which
take effect immediately, should safeguard the program’s objectives.
4.
Regarding revenue, the Government is determined to adjust retail prices on petroleum
products regularly so as to maintain the planned level of revenue. However, given
developments in the international oil market, the timetable for fully restoring oil product
taxation is uncertain. During the period of the program, the Government is committed to
preserving a minimum level of cumulative taxes and duties on petroleum products as
specified below (these replace the figures in ¶ 17 of the TMU):
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

Gasoline (all grades)
Diesel fuel
Distillate diesel oil
Other fuel (except kerosene)

CFAF 224 per liter
CFAF 93 per liter
CFAF 110 per liter
CFAF 72 per liter

In addition, the Government intends to redouble its efforts to boost revenue collection at the
tax and customs departments.

3

5.
Regarding expenditure, the Government has decided to save an additional
CFAF 12 billion by postponing investment projects, and it is committed to protecting priority
spending, especially for the social sectors. Thus, aggregate expenditure in the 2008 budget is
capped at CFAF 901.5 billion, of which CFAF 480.2 billion is current expenditure and
CFAF 350.4 billion capital expenditure. These figures could be revised upward should the
revenue outturn be significantly better than expected.
6.
The modifications to revenue and expenditure will be ratified through a
supplementary budget law.
7.
The Government authorizes the Fund to publish this letter as well as other documents
relating to the 2008 Article IV consultation and PRGF request.
Yours truly,
/s/
Abou-Bakar Traoré

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 29, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Mali
On May 28, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mali.1
Background
Mali’s economy has doubled in size since the democratic transition of the early 1990s. Sound
macroeconomic management produced average economic growth of almost 5 percent, and
raised the tax ratio from less than 10 percent to around 16 percent of GDP. Together with
external aid, including debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the increase in resources has fueled a rapid expansion of
poverty-reducing spending and helped sustain economic growth. Nonetheless, Mali is still very
poor, and activity remains highly vulnerable to natural and external shocks. Agriculture, which is
the mainstay of the economy, has been buffeted by recurrent drought, flood, locust infestation,
diseases, and depressed world prices for cotton—owing in part to subsidies in advanced
countries.
Economic growth slowed to less than 3 percent in 2007, reflecting the impact of late and
excessively heavy rainfall on agriculture, especially cotton (Table 1). Inflation remained
subdued, at 2.3 percent (12-monthly rate), but surged to 6 percent in February 2008, mainly
because of higher cereals prices. Although the terms of trade improved slightly, with higher gold
export prices more than offsetting the increase in oil import prices, the impact of these shifts
was unevenly distributed (especially since gold is an enclave sector). Thus, the urban
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
population’s real purchasing power declined in the past year. The government tried to offset
higher import costs, providing tax breaks for food and fuel imports and announcing wage
increases for civil servants (5 percent for 2008 and another 5 percent for 2009). With almost half
of tax revenue coming from international trade, however, these measures led to a weakening of
the fiscal outturn, and the basic balance turned from a surplus of 0.3 percent in 2006 to a deficit
of 1.1 percent in 2007.
The balance of payments weakened in 2007. The trade balance turned from a surplus in 2006
into a deficit, largely owing to lower gold output. Foreign exchange reserve accumulation slowed
from the robust levels of 2005–06, leaving reserve cover steady at around 6 months of imports.
As reserve accumulation slowed, the contribution of net foreign assets to broad money growth
was only 1.2 percent for 2007. The smaller cotton harvest to finance, the less favorable
economic environment, and persistently weak conditions at the state-owned banks all
contributed to a decline in credit to the economy of 0.8 percent.
The authorities have continued to advance the implementation of structural reforms. In
particular, in December 2007, four regional subsidiaries of the state cotton ginner (CMDT) were
chartered as a precursor to privatization. The National Assembly approved in January 2008 a
law granting the housing bank (BHM) greater powers to collect on non-performing loans, and
the Council of Ministers approved in March a draft law to reform the civil service retirement fund
(CRM). In April, the authorities completed the tariff study for the electricity company, which is
under consideration by the electricity and water regulatory commission, and they launched a
tender for privatizing the state-owned International Bank of Mali (BIM). In addition, the
authorities revised their financial sector development strategy, based in part on the conclusions
of the FSAP mission in February.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Malian authorities for their good performance under Fundsupported programs in securing a sound environment for economic growth and poverty
reduction. Directors noted that, notwithstanding the progress made over the years, growth has
been inadequate to make a significant reduction in poverty, and the economy is still vulnerable
to natural and exogenous shocks. Rising oil and food import costs, as well as stagnating cotton
prices, have put considerable pressure on the fiscal position.
Directors commended the authorities for their ambitious medium-term economic policies aimed
at raising the growth potential and boosting external competitiveness. They emphasized the
importance of adhering steadfastly to the policy priorities, notably to strengthen budget management and pursue structural reforms in key areas such as food production, telecommunications,
water and electricity, and the financial sector. Restructuring state-owned enterprises, particularly in the cotton sector, is also a priority. Most Directors were of the view that continued
support from the Fund through a new financial arrangement would help Mali cope with the
increasing challenges and deepen the authorities’ reform agenda. A few Directors, on the other

3
hand, noted a limited impact of the current food and fuel shocks on the balance of payments
and expressed reservations with regard to the need for Fund financial assistance in these
circumstances.
Directors agreed that the CFA franc-based fixed exchange rate system has served Mali well,
and that it has provided a solid anchor for economic stability. They nonetheless stressed the
need to avoid an erosion of competitiveness and encouraged the authorities to continue
monitoring developments closely. At the same time, structural reforms should be accelerated to
reinvigorate economic activity, diversify exports, and generate employment for a growing
population. Effective use of the windfalls from higher gold export prices for the development of
infrastructure would also help to improve competitiveness.
Noting the fiscal impact of increases in food and oil prices, Directors underscored that sound
budget management will be critical to fiscal sustainability and poverty reduction efforts. In this
context, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to protect the revenue base, notably by
reining in customs exemptions and preserving a minimum level of taxation on petroleum
products, and to readjust expenditure ceilings while protecting priority spending. It will also be
important to intensify efforts to raise additional funds from donors, and to ensure that the wage
bill remains well within the ceiling set by the WAEMU convergence criteria. While recognizing
the need to alleviate the impact of higher food prices, Directors saw scope for better targeting
subsidies for the most vulnerable groups so as not to reduce incentives to expand irrigation and
cultivation. They welcomed the progress achieved in strengthening public finance management
and encouraged the authorities to address the shortcomings highlighted in the 2007 report on
public expenditure and financial accountability.
Directors discussed financial sector developments based on the staff’s Financial Sector Stability
Assessment. They considered that there is a need to strengthen Mali’s banking system,
particularly in view of the persistently large exposure to a few borrowers and the high level of
nonperforming loans, notably at the state-owned housing bank. They encouraged the
authorities to step up their efforts to restructure the banking system and to enforce prudential
regulations in an even-handed manner. Directors welcomed the preparation by the authorities of
a financial sector development strategy designed to enhance the efficiency and soundness of
the financial sector in support of private sector development.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF’s efforts to promote transparency of the IMF’s
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 29, 2008

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$45.7 Million PRGF Arrangement for Mali with
Front-Loaded Disbursement to Address Higher Food and Fuel Prices

On May 28, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Mali in
an amount equivalent to SDR 27.99 million (about US$45.7 million) to support the
government’s economic program for 2008-11. To help Mali finance costs arising from
higher food and oil import prices, the Executive Board supported a front-loaded
disbursement schedule, making more than half of the total amount available during 2008. An
initial disbursement of SDR 12.99 million (about US$21.2 million) will be available
immediately.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion on Mali’s request for a PRGF
arrangement, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Malian authorities are to be commended for the implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms under previous Fund-supported programs.
These policies have boosted Mali’s economic growth, raised average per capita income, and
reduced inflation. Mali’s attainment of the completion point under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative has led to a reduction in the country’s debt burden
and an increase in social spending. The external sector has improved, underpinned by the
strong performance of the mining sector.
“In spite of the progress made, poverty remains widespread and the economy is still
vulnerable to exogenous shocks. To address these issues and assist Mali in progressing
toward the Millennium Development Goals, the new three-year PRGF- supported program
seeks to bring the economy to a higher growth path, maintain macroeconomic stability, boost
cereal production and continue to implement strong social policies. The program is fully
aligned with the authorities’ Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.

2

“To create fiscal space to respond to shocks, the PRGF-supported program focuses on
pursuing fiscal consolidation by increasing government revenue, through an improvement in
tax administration and policy, and strengthening public expenditure management. For 2008,
the budget will seek a balance between lightening taxation on energy and food to dampen
price increases and the revenue needs underlying social spending plans, supported by a frontloading of Fund access under the new arrangement. Indeed, to implement its ambitious
program, Mali will remain heavily dependent on foreign financial assistance. To avoid
raising the debt burden, the authorities plan to rely on grants and concessional loans.
“The authorities’ efforts to enhance the economy’s competitiveness and improve the business
climate are also welcome. Of particular importance are reform and privatization of key
parastatal enterprises, including in the energy, telecommunications, and cotton sectors; the
restructuring the Niger River Authority to improve irrigation services; and the strengthening
of the financial system,” Mr. Portugal said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that
PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned poverty and reduction strategies
adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners and
articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that
PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for
macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF
loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½year grace period on principal payments.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Mali’s economy has doubled in size since the democratic transition of the early 1990s. Sound
macroeconomic management has produced growth averaging almost 5 percent and raised the
tax ratio from less than 10 percent of GDP to around 16 percent. Together with external aid,
including the HIPC debt relief initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI),
the increase in resources has fueled rapid expansion of poverty-reducing spending and helped
sustain economic growth. Nonetheless, the country remains poor and highly vulnerable to
natural and external shocks. Agriculture, the mainstay of the economy, has been buffeted by
recurrent droughts, floods, locust infestation, diseases, and depressed world prices for
cotton—owing in part to domestic subsidies to cotton farmers in advanced countries.
Economic growth slowed from 5.3 percent in 2006 to less than 3 percent in 2007. Favorable
weather and record gold production boosted growth in 2006, but late and heavy rainfall

3

affected agriculture in 2007, especially cotton. Inflation remained subdued in 2007 at annual
2.3 percent but surged to 6 percent in February 2008 as cereal prices rose. The government
tried to offset higher import costs by using the windfall from higher gold prices to provide
tax breaks for food and fuel imports and announcing wage increases for civil servants. With
almost half of tax revenue coming from international trade, however, these measures
undermined the fiscal outturn, and the basic balance turned from a surplus of 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2006 to a deficit of 1.1 percent in 2007. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
also widened to 8 ½ percent of GDP, against 7 ½ percent in 2006.
Program summary
The PRGF-supported program aims to help Mali address the challenges posed by its
economic vulnerability and raise its growth potential. The program is in line with the
objectives set out in the 2007-11 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP): a)
increase the resources available for poverty reduction by mobilizing more domestic revenue
and possibly securing scaled-up development assistance; b) improve external viability,
mainly by strengthening the fiscal position; and c) raise growth potential by accelerating
structural reforms.
The program calls for strengthening the fiscal position over time without constraining aidfinanced outlays. The program aims to raise government revenue by broadening of the tax
base. Although budget expenditure is set to increase in 2008 to respond to GPRSP priorities
and the impact of salary increases, the authorities intends to contain total outlays below the
amounts approved in the Finance Law (by about 2 percent of GDP) by saving on goods and
services and lowering capital expenditure, and are preparing a Supplementary Finance Law
to that effect. The expenditure cuts entail a strict containment of nonpriority outlays and the
deferral of some investment projects.
The program gives renewed impetus to structural reforms. The focus is on measures to raise
agricultural production and food security and thus help reduce the volatility of food prices;
reform macrocritical state enterprises like the public utilities, cotton ginnery, and banks; and
increase the contribution of the private sector to growth. Over the longer term, the challenge
is to increase productivity, improve competitiveness and thus raise economic growth.
Assuming normal weather, growth is projected to recover to 5.4 percent in 2008, up from an
estimated 2.8 percent in 2007. Inflation would remain low at some 2-3 percent. With the
expected increase in government revenue, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) would
be at about the same level as in 2007. The external current account balance (excluding
official transfers) is projected to improve, despite lower cotton exports and continued growth
in imports, as the value of gold exports surges. Gross international reserves would remain at
about 6 months of imports.

Statement by Lauren W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Mali
May 28, 2008
1.
I thank Management and staff for the candid policy dialogue that they have
maintained with my Malian authorities. I am also thankful to Directors for the valuable
financial and policy support that the Fund has continuously provided to Mali under their
guidance. As noted by the Secretary, my authorities have already consented to the Fund
publication of the staff report.
2.
Mali’s overall satisfactory performance under previous PRGF-supported programs
translated into a number of positive outcomes, including sustained macroeconomic stability,
strong economic growth, and improved debt sustainability. These outcomes would have
hardly materialized without the sound macroeconomic and structural policies put forward by
the authorities. Despite these commendable achievements, significant challenges still remain
that continue to constrain the authorities’ efforts to accelerate growth and improve social
welfare, thus necessitating perseverance in the implementation of prudent macroeconomic
policies.
3.
In addressing these challenges, it is the authorities’ belief that continuous Fund
support of their economic program will be helpful. During the last Board discussions on
Mali, we noted that the authorities intended to determine the nature of the program
relationship they wish to maintain with the Fund based on their assessment of the country’s
specific circumstances. In this light, they have come to the conclusion that, at this current
juncture, a PRGF continues to be the Fund arrangement which fits best the country’s
specifics and reform needs.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY CHALLENGES
4.
Over the past decade, Mali’s economy grew annually by a rate of about 5 percent on
average. In 2007, the pace of growth is estimated to have been about two points lower than
this rate, mainly on account of the adverse impact of weather vagaries on agricultural
production. Before surging early this year due to rising food prices, average consumer price
inflation was contained below 2 percent in 2007. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
is estimated to be about 8.4 percent of GDP which is slightly higher than its 2006 level.
Overall, Mali’s macroeconomic performance has remained relatively strong, owing to a
variety of factors key of which is the authorities’ prudent economic management. As a matter
of fact, Mali has met since 2006 all five primary convergence criteria set by the regional
economic and monetary, except for the one related to the ratio of basic fiscal balance to GDP
which is estimated to have been missed in 2007.
5.
The Article IV consultation and the negotiation of the proposed program provide once
again an opportunity for the authorities to benefit from Fund advice in the process of coping
with the current policy challenges facing the country. Key among these challenges are
mitigating the impact of food and energy price increases and accelerating growth.

2
Mitigating the impact of food and energy price increases
6.
The authorities’ initial policy response to food price increases has included granting
temporary customs exemptions on rice imports, notably with a view to protecting lowincome consumers. Indeed, it is an open debate whether these exemptions are well-targeted,
cost-effective and friendly to domestic production. But even if they are proven otherwise,
they might well have helped avoided possible costlier tensions on the social front from the
authorities’ perspective. Similar concerns make it also difficult for the authorities to ensure
full pass-through of higher oil prices. Nevertheless, the authorities have decided to maintain
continuously a minimum level of taxation for petroleum products.
7.
In order to offset the negative budgetary impact of the policy measures taken to cope
with food and energy price increases, the Council of Ministers approved on May 7 a series of
current and capital expenditure cuts amounting about CFA 40 billion. More recently the
authorities decided to effect further budgetary cuts in order to offset additional tax revenue
losses estimated to be incurred in the energy sector. In performing these cuts, an effort was
made by the authorities to preserve resources allocated to key priority sectors. In addition to
the authorities’ adjustment efforts, the proposed augmentation of access with a frontloaded
disbursement will be helpful in mitigating the impact of the energy and food price shocks.
We are appreciative of the flexibility of the policy and financial support that Management
and staff propose in support of the authorities’ efforts to cope with these shocks. Mali’s case
underscores however potential tensions that may arise between the objectives of proposed
access augmentation and program conditions. Due care will need to be taken by staff in close
consultation with country authorities to deal with such tensions whenever they risk
materializing.
8.
Going forward, it is the authorities’ intention to take necessary actions toward
ensuring food security and improving electricity generation capacities. In particular, these
actions will aim to increase electricity production at reduced costs through the installation of
new hydroelectric plants and the setup of regional electric grids. They will also aim to
expand irrigated land and the use of modern farming techniques, notably by restructuring
Office du Niger which is the authority in charge of irrigation services. They will also take
part in a coordinated effort at the regional level to achieve food self-sufficiency through the
implementation of a three-year plan that was devised last month by WAEMU finance
ministers.
Accelerating Growth
9.
One of the authorities’ key objectives reiterated in Mali’s second generation PRSP is
to improve the living standards of the Malian population, particularly poor households. To
achieve this objective and thus accelerate progress toward the MDGs, growth acceleration is
indeed critical and thus ranks high on the authorities’ agenda. Hence, we welcome the
emphasis put on this issue during the policy discussions between the authorities and staff,
which is in line with the call that we made during the last Board discussions on Mali.

10.
It is the authorities’ hope that their accelerated growth strategy will foster high levels
of growth, thereby helping mobilize the enormous resources needed to finance the Poverty
Reduction Strategy. In the meantime, external financing and policy support will be much
needed. And in order to secure donor support the authorities will be organizing a Donor
Roundtable Conference on the 12th and 13th of June 2008 in Bamako. In addition to helping
the authorities strengthen their accelerated growth strategy and ensure faster progress toward
the MDGs, the Conference is expected to provide an opportunity for strengthening
collaboration between the Malian government and its partners; developing appropriate tools
for measuring and monitoring the country’s development policies and strategies; and
securing donor support in the implementation of these policies and strategies. I would
appreciate it if Directors could draw their authorities’ attention about the importance of the
Conference. To Management and staff, I also reiterate the importance of their participation.
POLICY AND REFORM AGENDA UNDER THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT
11.
The overarching objective of the proposed program under the PRGF is to reduce
poverty by supporting the authorities’ efforts to promote a more competitive and fastgrowing economy within an environment of continuous macroeconomic stability. In order to
achieve this objective, the authorities are committed to continuing the comprehensive set of
reforms they have embarked on in the context of previous PRGF-supported arrangements.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
12.
Largely on account of food and oil price increases, the basic fiscal balance is
estimated to deteriorate further in 2008 to reach about 1.8 percent of GDP. Thereafter, it is
expected to improve over the remainder of the program period, thanks to a series of measures
that the authorities envisage to take both on the expenditure and income fronts. Indeed, as
previously noted, the authorities have already taken firm steps to reduce nonpriority
expenditures. On the revenue side, efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax and
customs administrations will continue under the proposed program. It is also the authorities’
stated decision that all non-legally backed customs exemptions will be eliminated.
13.
The authorities continue to attach high value to reforming public administration. With
the assistance of the major development partners, decentralization of public administration is
proceeding steadfastly. The implementation of the government’s action plan for improving
and modernizing public finance management is also on track after being enriched with the
results of last year’s PEFA analysis.
Financial Sector Reforms
14.
In spite of the notable steps taken over recent years to improve the health of the
financial sector, the authorities are aware that continuous vigilance is still warranted,
particularly with regard to the banking system. However, they remain optimistic about the
prospective soundness and performance of this sector given a number of recent and expected
developments. Indeed, since last Board discussions on Mali, the National Assembly has
approved a law strengthening the ability of the housing bank to recover its nonperforming

4
loans. At the same time, the authorities continue to closely monitor the financial situation of
the housing bank, Banque de l’Habitat du Mali (BHM), standing ready to take any actions
that may be deemed necessary. In addition, the planned privatization of the cotton-ginning
company should help reduce sources of vulnerabilities for the banking system. Bank
profitability continues to improve, as highlighted in the FSAP analysis. Finally, successful
implementation of the authorities’ Financial Sector Development Strategy which was
updated in light of the conclusions of the recently completed FSAP is expected to strengthen
private sector’s participation in the activities of the banking sector, lower fiscal risks
stemming from public entities’ involvement in the financial sector, and foster intermediation
and innovation in this sector.
Other Structural Reforms
15.
The authorities will continue to implement necessary reforms to achieve program
objectives. In particular, enhancing the competitiveness of the Malian economy will mainly
require the implementation of appropriate structural reforms, given that the exchange system
continues to serve the country well and the real exchange rate remains adequate. In this
connection, the recent measures taken such as the creation of an investment promotion
agency will be useful; so will be other planned actions aimed at improving doing business
indicators and promoting export development, notably through the setup of a one-stop shop
to reduce the time length and costs of business registration and the ongoing export
development study expected to pave the way for the creation of an export promotion agency.
16.
Keeping up with their previous commitment, the authorities are making progress in
advancing their privatization agenda. The tender for the privatization of the Banque
Internationale du Mali has already been launched. Consistent with the previously approved
timetable for privatization of the cotton ginning company, CMDT, they intend to split by the
end of the year the company into four privately owned subsidiaries. In parallel, the call for
tenders for the sale of government’s shares in the telecommunications company, SOTELMA,
is expected to be launched by September 2008.
CONCLUSION
17.
While the Malian economy is well positioned to continue taking advantage of the
authorities’ sound economic management, a number of challenges it still faces cast a shadow
on its prospects. The authorities are committed to persevering in the implementation of
appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. It is their expectation that in this
process, they will continue to benefit from the Fund’s valuable policy and financial support.
On my part, I am hopeful that Directors will help materialize these expectations by
supporting my authorities’ request for a successor PRGF arrangement.
