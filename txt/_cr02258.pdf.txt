IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Cameroon
On September 18, 2002, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with
Cameroon.1
Background
During the last five years, the Cameroonian economy has benefited from improved
macroeconomic performance and the progress made in implementing structural reforms. Real
GDP growth averaged 5 percent per annum during 1996/97–2000/01, in sharp contrast to the
negative growth rates of the previous decade. While income from the oil sector fluctuated, the
expansion of the non-oil sector contributed importantly to the improved overall growth
performance. To promote macroeconomic stability, the fiscal position was substantially
strengthened through improved revenue mobilization and prudent expenditure policies. Steps
were taken to promote good governance, transparency, and accountability in both public
expenditure management and tax administration. With these policies, the authorities were able
to restore macroeconomic stability, normalize relations with external official and commercial
creditors, and increase spending in the key social sectors of health and education. The process
of implementing important structural reforms in the transportation and forestry sectors was also
started, the banking system was rehabilitated, and some progress was made under the
privatization program.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, expected to be held every other year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic
and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board's discussion are described.
Cameroon is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) and
the CFA franc zone.

-2Looking ahead, however, Cameroon will need to achieve much higher growth rates of real GDP
on a sustained basis, in order to reduce poverty substantially. This will be a particularly
challenging task, in light of a steeper than initially projected decline in oil production over the
medium and long term. With the resulting weaker oil revenue outlook, Cameroon will be faced
with the difficult challenge of allocating more resources for the development of the social sectors
and investment in basic infrastructure while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Building on
the efforts made so far, more needs to be done to expand the health and education services,
invest in basic economic infrastructure, improve governance, and accelerate the structural
reforms that are essential for promoting private investment and growth in non-oil output and
exports.
During the first half of the second annual program (October 2001-March 2002), economic
activity expanded at a somewhat slower pace than projected, reflecting recurrent shortages in
electricity supply, but remained strong (growing at an annual rate of 4.6 percent). There was
notable growth in the services sector because of the ongoing construction of the ChadCameroon oil pipeline. The 12-month national consumer price inflation rate increased to 4.8
percent in March 2002, driven by high foodstuff prices.
The fiscal primary surplus was somewhat smaller than targeted. Noninterest current
expenditure was slightly above target, as moderate overruns in outlays on transfers and
subsidies were not offset by savings derived from holding spending on the wage bill and on
other goods and services below the budget ceiling. Cameroon’s external position strengthened.
All end-March 2002 quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks were observed. Based
on preliminary data for the second quarter of 2002, the fiscal outcome for the fiscal year ended
June 2002 is estimated to have been broadly as budgeted. The growth prospects for 2002
remain good.
On the policy front, the authorities pursued their efforts to improve domestic tax administration
and collection. A new General Tax Code (Code Général des Impôts), including a manual of tax
procedures, was promulgated. In the governance area, new budget classifications were
adopted and an action plan for the establishment of a body to conduct external audits of the
state finances was formulated. The investigation of 48 identified cases of saisie-attribution
(execution of a judiciary order under which a person’s money in possession or under control of
another entity, such as a bank, is applied to the payment of debt owed to a third party, along
with the imposition of excessive penalties and limited recourse to appeal) was completed as
scheduled. However, the reform of the public procurement system slowed. Notwithstanding
some delay, the implementation of the second stage of the action plan to introduce, by
September 2003, an integrated computerized fiscal and information system to manage
government revenue and expenditure—a critical measure for enhancing public expenditure
management—was put in place in late July 2002. Progress in HIPC completion point-related
structural reforms has resumed since May, resulting in an extension of the World Bank’s SAC
III. Work on the preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is proceeding.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors were in broad agreement with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted
that Cameroon had achieved a significant improvement in macroeconomic performance over
the past five years, as a result of strong efforts to strengthen the fiscal position and progress in
implementing structural reforms. Performance continued to be satisfactory in 2001/02, with real
GDP growth, as well as the fiscal and external positions, remaining strong.
Directors indicated that despite these achievements, Cameroon’s medium to long-term outlook
remains fragile, particularly in view of the steeper-than-projected decline in oil output. They
stressed that progress in reducing poverty on a sustained basis would require much higher
growth rates. In that respect, they underscored the need for diversifying the economy and
promoting private investment by speeding up the implementation of key structural reforms, and
consolidating the fiscal position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen revenue administration and budget
management in 2001/02, and their adherence to a cautious fiscal stance, as evidenced by the
transition budget for July-December 2002. Further efforts are needed in the period ahead, in
particular to strengthen non-oil revenue—including through streamlining the valued-added tax
and by a reduction in tax exemptions—and to contain spending on the wage bill, transfers, and
non-priority areas. In this connection, Directors expressed concern about the delays in
implementing HIPC-related programs and projects in the context of their public expenditure
program. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to give priority to the implementation of these
projects—especially in the areas of health, education, and basic infrastructure. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to pursue efforts to strengthen public expenditure management, and
urged them to enhance coordination efforts among key ministries so as to ensure timely
decision making.
Some Directors took note of the pick up in consumer prices in recent months. They considered
that future price developments should be monitored carefully to ensure the preservation of
Cameroon’s competitiveness. In the financial sector, Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts
to implement the recommendations of the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program review,
and saw as the main priorities in this area the strengthening of COBAC’s capacity to conduct
bank supervision consistent with international norms—with the support of the regional central
bank—and the restructuring of the Postal Savings Bank.
Directors encouraged the intensification of efforts to pick up the pace of structural reforms, with
emphasis on the privatization program and the reforms of the forestry, transport, and petroleum
sectors. In addition, they welcomed the authorities’ efforts to address the weaknesses in
governance, improve transparency, and fight corruption, in part, by proceeding with the reform
of the judiciary system in a timely fashion. Directors stressed the importance of implementing
concrete actions to resolve the problems associated with the abuse of the saisie-attribution
procedure, which could potentially undermine the soundness of the commercial banking
system.

-4Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to regional integration and Cameroon’s
macroeconomic policy convergence within the CEMAC. They encouraged the authorities to
support more actively regional initiatives in the areas of trade, customs liberalization, and
banking supervision. Some Directors urged the Cameroonian authorities to take steps to
participate in the United Nations’ anti-money laundering initiative.
Directors urged the authorities to continue to improve the provision of data for surveillance and
program implementation and monitoring. They welcomed the completion of the household
consumption survey, the results of which would help improve the quality of social indicators.
They also took note of the authorities’ intention to continue to improve data quality, coverage,
and timeliness in the context of the General Data Dissemination System.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Cameroon will be held on the 24-month
cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15,
2002.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2002
Article IV Consultation with Cameroon is also available.
