Relations with the Fund. At end-November 2006, Peru’s outstanding Fund credit was
SDR 13.4 million (2 percent of quota). In support of their 2007–08 program, the
authorities have requested a Stand-By arrangement (SBA), which they intend to treat as
precautionary. Access under the 25–month SBA would be equivalent to 27 percent of
quota (SDR 172.37 million). Peru has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement (Appendix 1). Peru has subscribed to
the SDDS, and its statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation, surveillance,
and program monitoring.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
While currently reaping the benefits of sound policies, Peru still faces significant and
pressing challenges. Supported by a favorable external environment, the economy is
enjoying its longest expansion on record, with low inflation, a solid external position, and
declining indebtedness and dollarization ratios. However, half of the population is still below
the poverty line, and lingering vulnerabilities and structural weaknesses need to be addressed
to improve sustainability and boost economic growth further.
The outlook remains favorable. Growth is expected to decelerate from 6½–7 percent in
2006 to 5–5½ percent in 2007–08, with risks balanced and largely dependent on global
conditions. Over the medium term, the economy should expand at around 5 percent a year.
Key Issues
Medium-Term Challenges. Discussions focused on the need for sustained and stronger
growth, to boost employment and lower poverty. A prudent overall policy framework,
including with respect to foreign investment, should help promote nontraditional labor
intensive sectors. This, together with more flexible labor regulations, would help reduce high
informality. In addition, improving access to public services by the poor will enhance the
effectiveness and sustainability of policies.
The 2007–08 Program. The program aims at entrenching macroeconomic stability,
enhancing the anti-poverty strategy, strengthening the resilience and depth of the financial
system, and pressing ahead with growth-enhancing reforms. Specifically:
¾

Consolidating macroeconomic stability. Fiscal targets for 2007–08 are to remain
below the 1 percent deficit ceiling in the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law
(FRTL). Measures to lower distortionary taxes and exemptions and to improve the
quality of public spending will also be adopted (paragraph 14–19). Greater exchange
rate flexibility would help solidify the inflation targeting framework.

¾

Tackling high poverty. An action plan to restructure and enhance the effectiveness of
social assistance programs is a key component of the program (paragraph 21–23).

¾

Financial system. Reducing dollarization, particularly of mortgage loans is a critical
objective, as this will help to fortify the resilience of the banking system
(Paragraph 30). These efforts will be assisted by measures to allow for a better
internalization of risks and to deepen domestic capital markets (paragraph 32–33).

¾

Growth-enhancing reforms. The authorities will continue advancing reforms to
simplify regulatory requirements, enhance labor market flexibility, and further open
the economy (paragraph 34–37).

I. INTRODUCTION

Peru is reaping the benefits of the sound policies implemented over the last decadeand-a-half, in the context of a favorable global environment. The economy is enjoying its

The challenges faced by Peru are, however, still significant and pressing. The

improved significantly in recent years,
intermediation remains low and the economy is still exposed to significant exchange rate
risks. The tax base is narrow, reflecting broad exemptions and weak overall tax compliance,
while the limited technical capabilities of subnational governments have delayed the
execution of infrastructure projects. Informality in the labor market is high, and regulatory
requirements for closing businesses are above the average in Latin America.
3.
The new administration faces the difficult challenge of addressing these
weaknesses while consolidating the foundations for sustained growth. President Garcia has
appointed a politically diversified and technically strong cabinet, and reassured markets that
the sound economic policy framework will remain in place. He has also promised to swiftly
tackle poverty, while advancing structural reforms that would help raise medium-term
growth and achieve investment grade status. President Garcia’s approval ratings are high

6
and, given the complex socio-political scene, the government will need to build a strong
consensus for these policies to sustain progress with reforms.
4.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the policies needed to address
Peru’s key challenges and on how a new Fund-supported program could best help buttress
the authorities’ policy intentions. Discussions with government officials and private sector
representatives highlighted a broad consensus on the need to consolidate macroeconomic
stability and reduce vulnerabilities further—poverty in particular. The authorities considered
that, although the last Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was designed to signal an exit from
Fund-supported programs, a new arrangement would help anchor policies and send
appropriate signals to the markets (Box 1). Accordingly, they have requested a low-access
25–month SBA, which they intend to treat as precautionary, in support of their policies for
2007–08. The authorities’ objectives are presented in the Letter of Intent and Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
BOX 1. PERU: PAST FUND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION
In past Article IV consultations and program reviews, Directors called for reforms to
solidify the macroeconomic policy framework, address social and infrastructure needs,
enhance the resilience of the economy, and boost medium-term growth prospects.
Macroeconomic policy. Directors viewed fiscal consolidation as essential to maintaining
public debt on a downward path, endorsing the authorities’ approach to keep deficits below
the 1 percent limit in the FRTL. Directors have also called for eliminating regional and
sectoral exemptions, bolstering the tax revenue effort, and improving the quality of public
spending. They supported the authorities’ plans to enhance budget flexibility, limit the
growth in public sector wages, and provide scope for increased public investment and for
assisting the poor. Directors supported the inflation targeting framework, underscoring the
need to limit intervention to events of excessive exchange rate volatility.
Growth-enhancing measures. Directors emphasized the need to ensure flexible labor
market conditions and to strengthen the business environment, including through trade
liberalization. With high dollarization, Directors agreed with the importance of
strengthening the prudential framework of the financial system and of developing capital
markets.
Longer-term Fund engagement. An ex-post assessment of Fund longer-term engagement
with Peru was discussed during the 2004 Article IV consultation. A number of Directors
considered that exiting from Fund support would enhance confidence. Others considered
that precautionary arrangements could be helpful to further entrench consensus for sound
policies and reforms, particularly in challenging political conditions. Directors noted that
programs should be with low-access and with measures paving the way for an exit.

II. THE CURRENT SETTING
5.
The economy has continued to expand briskly during 2006, with inflation well
within the 1.5–3.5 percent target range.

2.9 percent in April, 12–month inflation
abated to around 1½ percent in November, reflecting a tightening in monetary policy and the
unwinding of food supply shocks.1 Core inflation remains at the lower end of the inflation
target range.
6.
The conduct of fiscal policy has been prudent, but expenditure growth has been
strong. The deficit of the combined public sector was reduced from 2½ percent of GDP in
2001 to ⅓ percent of GDP in 2005 (Tables 2–5). Performance during the first three quarters
of 2006 was significantly stronger than anticipated, and the combined public sector
registered a surplus equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP. General government revenue was
boosted by higher than anticipated corporate income tax payments, while expenditure of the
consolidated public sector increased by about 11 percent in real terms (year-on-year) during
January-September. Expenditure is estimated to have picked up further in the last quarter of
the year, reflecting in part seasonal patterns in budget execution,2 the adoption of a
supplementary budget focusing on capital spending, and plans to advance some outlays
initially planned for 2007. For 2006 as a whole, the combined public sector would register a
surplus of 1 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of ½ percent of GDP initially
envisaged.

The authorities have lowered excise taxes on petroleum products on several occasions since mid–2004 to
offset the full pass-through of higher international prices. Currently, domestic retail fuel prices are broadly
aligned to international levels.

2

In 2005, the combined public sector balance showed a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP during JanuarySeptember and a deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP for the whole year.

US$16.2 billion, equivalent to over
325 percent of short-term debt and 135 percent of foreign currency deposits with the banking
system. Public sector debt is expected to have declined to 32 percent of GDP by end–2006,
or 14 percentage points below its 2002 level; the structure of the debt has also improved,
with the share of local currency-denominated debt now equivalent to one-fifth of the total.
8.
Financial market sentiment is favorable. In recent months, Fitch and S&P upgraded
Peru’s sovereign rating to BB+ (one notch below investment grade) and Moody’s changed its
outlook from neutral to positive.3 Sovereign bond spreads have hovered close to all-time
lows (around 135 basis points) and equity prices have increased sharply, largely reflecting
higher mineral prices. The central bank has continued to intervene in the foreign exchange
market, with net purchases of US$2¼ billion during the first eleven months of this year. The
Nuevo Sol has been fluctuating within a narrow margin against the U.S. dollar.
9.
Progress has been made in advancing structural reforms. In the financial sector,
bank regulations to better internalize foreign currency risks have been advanced, and
consolidated supervision has continued to be strengthened. New concessions for Peru’s
largest port facility (Callao) and nine regional airports were awarded in recent months, and
two commercial courts are now operating in Lima, greatly expediting the resolution of
disputes.4 In June, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States was ratified by
the Peruvian congress, and is now pending ratification by the U.S. congress.

3
4

Moody’s rates Peru’s sovereign credit three notches below investment grade, with a positive outlook.

Peru ranks 65th in the 2007 World Bank Doing Business Report, up from 78th in 2005, reflecting a reduction in
the burden of starting new businesses and improvements in contract enforcement.

10
III. OUTLOOK
10.
The short-term outlook remains strong, with relatively balanced risks. Growth is
conservatively projected to abate from 6½–7 percent in 2006 to 5–5½ percent in 2007–08,
partly reflecting a slowdown in world demand and declining terms of trade. The external
position would remain robust and inflation is expected to return closer to the middle of the
official target range (2.5 percent), in line with consensus forecasts, driven in part by fiscal
expansion. While commodity prices are expected to ease from recent record-highs, large
ongoing investment projects in extractive industries, together with an expected pickup in
government capital expenditure, suggest some upside risks to growth. A less benign El Niño
phenomenon than currently envisaged could also have a negative impact on output.5 A
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances could exert sharp downward pressures on
commodity prices and heighten global risk aversion, with potentially adverse consequences
for exports and public finances.6
11.
Over the medium term, the economy is expected to expand by around 5 percent a
year. This performance takes into account a gradual decline in commodity prices, which
would bring the external current account balance back into small deficits. With fiscal policy
expected to continue to overperform relative to the 1 percent deficit limit set in the FRTL,
Peru’s public indebtedness would decline steadily, from an estimated 32 percent of GDP in
2006 to around 27½ percent in 2011. The authorities and staff agreed that the debt dynamics
remain fragile, with stress tests indicating that a sharp depreciation of the currency could
potentially reverse most of the envisaged decline (Appendix 4). In the staff’s view, this risk
underscores the importance of further

The El Niño cyclical climatic phenomenon, which recurs periodically, is expected to return in early 2007.
Officials expect a limited impact on economic activity.

A 10 percent decline in mining export prices would reduce central government revenue by around
0.4 percentage points of GDP.

11
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND THE 2007–08 PROGRAM
12.
The discussions focused on the critical challenges that Peru faces over the medium
term. Sustained and strong economic growth, together with a broadening of the export base,
will be needed to boost employment and reduce high informality. Maintaining an
environment favorable to foreign direct investment and trade openness will be critical to
growth prospects in the mining sector and to help diversify the productive structure toward
nontraditional labor-intensive sectors. Enhancing the provision and quality of services to the
poorest areas of the country is needed to tackle poverty decisively, while more flexible labor
regulations would help absorb a growing labor force into the formal sector and strengthen
anti-poverty efforts.

The authorities’ program for 2007–08 focuses on maintaining macroeconomic
stability and reducing poverty, while consolidating medium-term growth prospects. The
program aims at entrenching macroeconomic stability through fiscal consolidation, while
providing scope for addressing pressing social and infrastructure needs. A strategy is being
prepared to strengthen poverty alleviation, including by stepping up the effectiveness of
social assistance programs combined with institutional strengthening. Together with a
prudent macroeconomic stance, efforts to lessen vulnerabilities—particularly dollarization—
and to deepen the domestic capital markets should be conducive to achieving investment
grade status (Figure 2). In turn, these reforms would set the stage for a virtuous cycle of
sound policies with more equitable economic growth.

A. Entrenching Fiscal Consolidation
The fiscal targets for 2007–08
14.
While committed to maintaining fiscal discipline, the authorities consider that
fiscal policy needs to play a more active and effective role in alleviating poverty. They have
reaffirmed their commitment to comply with the 1 percent limit on the overall deficit of the
FRTL. Within that framework, they considered that boosting infrastructure and maintenance
spending was the most appropriate means to help address pressing poverty issues in the short
run. In the authorities’ view, this would reduce the economic isolation of some regions due to
Peru’s difficult geography and help them take advantage of increased trade openness and
market access. At the same time, they agreed with staff on the advisability of sustaining
fiscal overperformance relative to the deficit limit to help public debt decline faster.
•

Overall balance. The overall public sector deficit has been set at 0.8 percent of GDP
in 2007 and 0.7 percent in 2008.7 Moreover, should central government revenues net
of mandatory transfers exceed programmed amounts, the government would save
them to reduce the overall deficit to 0.5 percent of GDP or less.8 The revenue
projections built in the 2007 Budget are relatively conservative, and assume a
moderate drop in commodity prices and the elimination of custom duties associated
with the FTA with the United States.

•

Infrastructure spending. A key priority of the 2007 budget is to increase spending in
infrastructure and maintenance, to stimulate job creation and address social needs,
particularly in poor regions. To this end, the authorities will amend the FRTL so as to
remove capital expenditure and maintenance outlays from the 3 percent limit on
expenditure growth in real terms. Under the 2007 budget, the growth in total
expenditure excluding maintenance and investment will be submitted to the 3 percent
limit in real terms, while capital expenditure would register a sizeable increase.9

•

Civil servant wages. Wage outlays included in the 2007 budget reflect the austerity
policy initiated by the new administration. Under this policy, relatively low ceilings
have also been set on civil servant wages and salaries. Staff expressed concern about

7

Staff estimates that the structural fiscal deficit of the consolidated public sector would increase by about
1½ percentage points of GDP in 2007.
8

Revenue overperformance above 0.3 percent of GDP would likely result in additional savings, in light of the
limit of 3 percent real growth in central government expenditure (excluding maintenance and capital outlays)
and the historical track record on the execution of capital outlays.
9

Increased capital expenditure for 2007 focuses mainly on projects relating to roads, education, basic health,
and rural electrification, reflecting significant infrastructure gaps in these sectors.

14
implementing such low ceilings, because they could lead the most qualified personnel
to leave the civil service.
15.
Staff supported the authorities’ fiscal stance, while emphasizing the need to
improve the quality of spending. In particular, given that the deficit target for 2007 would
entail a significant fiscal easing at a time when the economy was expected to continue
sustaining strong momentum, staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to save part of the
unanticipated additional revenue. It also noted the importance of continuing to save as much
as possible to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy. Indeed, with corporate
profits on the rise, tax revenue could turn out to be quite higher than envisaged in the budget.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to proceed with the increase in infrastructure and social
spending—within the agreed-upon overall deficit limits—but emphasized the need to press
ahead with well-targeted programs and to guard against unproductive spending.
Strengthening the effectiveness of the tax regime
16.
There was agreement that a comprehensive reassessment of tax incentives was
essential to strengthening the effectiveness of the tax system. In view of the complexity of
existing tax exemptions, which already complicates the task of tax administration, staff
expressed concern about the numerous proposals to introduce new regional and sectoral tax
incentives.10 The authorities agreed and indicated that they would submit a draft law to
congress aimed at rationalizing fiscal exemptions by March 2007 (MEFP, paragraph 6). They
expected this new framework to introduce time limits to the granting of exemptions, while
conditioning their renewal to an evaluation of whether the initial goals had been achieved.11
The authorities also intended to continue promoting the replacement of existing regional tax
exemptions with direct central government transfers earmarked for investment and social
spending.
17.
Reform efforts will also focus on lessening the burden from distortionary taxes and
strengthening compliance. Staff recommended transforming the temporary tax on assets
(ITAN) into a minimum corporate income tax when it expires at end–2006, while allowing
the exemption on capital gains in the stock market to lapse; this would ensure comparable
treatment for capital and labor income. Congress recently approved gradually decreasing the
rates of ITAN and reinstating the tax on capital gains in the stock market in 2009. Congress
also approved a gradual decrease in the rate of the financial transactions tax (FTT), in line
10

A law was recently passed granting the government the powers to issue tax reform laws. This delegation will
last 90 days and the government will not be able to use it to create new taxes, raise the rates of existing taxes,
introduce tax exemptions, or tax savings.

11

In November 2006, an FAD technical assistance mission helped the authorities with these reforms. The
mission favored the use of accelerated depreciation, rather than tax exemption, as a means of stimulating
investment.

15
with the authorities’ policy intention (MEFP, paragraph 7).12 Staff emphasized the need to
strengthen tax administration through the intensification of audits, stepping up the collection
of arrears, and introducing performance indicators, particularly for customs and the valueadded tax. To this end, it stressed the importance of providing adequate resources to the tax
administration agency SUNAT.
Improving the quality of public spending
18.
The authorities intend to press ahead with modernizing the budgetary process,
including by introducing performance budgeting (MEFP, paragraphs 8–9). Performance
indicators are expected to pave the way for a gradual move toward performance budgeting by
2010. As a first step, and with assistance from the World Bank, performance budgeting for
public investment will be introduced in the 2008 budget. Critical steps toward improving the
quality of public spending involve strengthening the fiscal framework, the Financial
Management Information System (SIAF), the National System of Public Investment (SNIP),
and the framework for Public-Private Partnerships:
•

Fiscal framework. New legislation approved in mid–2006 has freed the state-oil
company PetroPeru from budgetary oversight and from the annual limits on nonpublicly guaranteed borrowing imposed by the Ministry of Finance. The authorities
shared staff’s concerns that this new legislation could weaken the public finances
framework and make it difficult for the government to comply with the fiscal
objectives of the program. To address this problem, a new law was introduced to
congress, proposing the creation of a Committee for Fiscal Policy Coordination under
the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance. In addition, congress has
approved a law subjecting all non-publicly guaranteed borrowing by PetroPeru under
the requirements and standards set in the General Indebtedness Law. The authorities
also intend to gradually strengthen the commercial orientation of PetroPeru.

•

Public Financial Management. In recent years, the authorities have continued to
strengthen the Financial Management Information System (SIAF) and begun rolling
it out to sub-national governments. They have also initiated an independent audit to
assess whether the SIAF should be further enhanced or replaced by a different
system. The results of this audit, which is financed by the Inter-American
Development Bank, are expected to be available by September 2007. Efforts are
underway to adopt a Treasury Single Account in 2007 and to align the budget
classification with GFSM 2001 (MEFP, paragraph 8). This would bring needed
improvements in fiscal recording and reporting, and facilitate international
comparisons.

12

Revenues from the FTT and ITAN are included in the 2007 budget.

16
•

National System of Public Investment (SNIP). Staff and the authorities agreed that
the SNIP had been critical in strengthening the assessment of projects, although at
times at the cost of delays in project approval. There was also agreement that the
weak capacity of subnational governments in evaluating and executing projects was
the most critical constraint to a full and effective decentralization. To help expedite
project approval, the government has begun to decentralize the SNIP. Regional
offices will be established and be responsible for assessing and approving public
investment projects, in accordance to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance
(MEFP, paragraph 11). To reduce unnecessary delays in the execution of public
projects, particularly for small maintenance projects, staff encouraged the authorities
to reassess the classification of investment under the purview of the SNIP to ensure
that its assessment remained primarily focused on larger-sized projects.

•

Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework. Given the increasing importance of
PPP operations and the need for a framework law that provides guidelines on all
aspects of these operations, the authorities intend to submit to congress a draft of such
a law by June 2007 (MEFP, paragraph 17). At end–2006, government commitments
in terms of future expenditure or minimum revenue guarantees related to PPP projects
were estimated at close to 2 percent of GDP in NPV terms. To introduce more
transparency in reporting, the proposed program includes performance criteria on all
commitments associated with new PPPs signed in 2007 (MEFP, Table 1 and TMU,
paragraph 14). For transparency purposes, the program will also monitor the issuance
of PAO Entitlement Recognition Certificates (CRPAOs) and adjust the overall deficit
and public debt for the consolidated public sector accordingly.13

19.
The authorities and staff agreed that it was critical for the decentralization process
to remain orderly and fiscally-neutral. Political pressure has mounted to rapidly transfer
functions to subnational governments, in line with the 2004 Fiscal Decentralization Law. In
October 2006, an urgency decree brought forward the devolution of 185 functions to regional
governments to end–2007. Staff emphasized the importance of ensuring that the transfer of
the functions and corresponding resources is undertaken only once appropriate capabilities
are in place at the subnational level; developing pilot projects will also help ensure a smooth
process of decentralization. Staff stressed the need to preserve and, if necessary, strengthen
the accreditation system, under which subnational governments are assessed with respect to
their capacity to qualify for the transfers. The Ministry of Finance has also been conducting
workshops to train subnational governments on how to report on their financial performance,
13

CRPAOs can be issued by the government when a concessionaire completes a stage of the PPP project. They
entitle their holder to a stream of future government payments committed under the original PPP contract.
CRPAOs can be transferred to third parties and contain pari-pasu, acceleration, and cross-default clauses with
all other CRPAOs issued in relation to any PPP project. The government expects to issue US$2 billion of such
certificates during 2006–10, including US$0.1 billion in 2006 and US$0.4 billion in 2007.

17
including with respect to compliance under fiscal rules, and a unit will be established at the
Ministry of Finance to monitor financial developments at the sub-national level. Staff also
cautioned that the management of regional public companies should only be transferred to
those subnational governments that have demonstrated their capacity to administer them
soundly.
Further improving the structure of public debt
20.
Debt management remains focused on improving the structure of public debt. The
authorities’ efforts continue to aim at increasing the share of local-currency denominated and
fixed-rate debt in total debt. The

the CRPAO instruments issued to
facilitate the financing of PPP projects
signed in 2005 needed to be treated as debt under the Fund’s definition, despite the fact they
were not given such a treatment under Peruvian law. Accordingly, it was agreed that the
issuance of such papers would be included in the measurement of Peru's debt stock, for the
purpose of the Fund’s debt sustainability analysis and in the performance criteria for the
contracting and guaranteeing of public debt. The authorities plan to explore alternative
financial mechanisms for PPP projects with a view to minimizing the risks to the government
from such operations (MEFP, paragraph 12).
B. Tackling High Poverty
21.
A major challenge is how best to reduce poverty and ensure that all segments of the
population share in the benefits of growth. Lack of significant progress in alleviating
poverty in recent years has brought to the fore the need to improve the quality of public
spending and to enhance the effectiveness of social assistance programs. Serious
shortcomings are evident in a number of areas, including in education, where test scores
place Peru near the bottom of countries in Latin America. Also, social programs are
numerous (122 in total), and a large share of the resources available does not reach the

18
targeted population.14 Discussions with civil
society highlighted the effectiveness of the
program Juntos which, by conditioning cash
transfers on compliance with administrative,
health, and educational requirements, has
helped restore a sense of inclusion among its
beneficiaries. Given the wide dispersion of
access to benefits among the poor, the
authorities plan to establish a registry of
beneficiaries for all programs (MEFP,
paragraph 14).

22.
The authorities and staff agreed that a major effort was needed to better articulate
the fight against poverty. With plans largely focused on increasing public spending and
expanding programs, staff emphasized the need to streamline, consolidate, and better
coordinate existing programs so as to avoid duplications and other inefficiencies. The
authorities agreed and requested the Interministerial Committee for Social Assistance
(CIAS), placed under the auspices of the Prime Minister, to prepare a strategy and
corresponding action plan by March 2007.15 Such an action plan will be a key component of
the economic program, and specific actions based on the recommendations of the CIAS will
be made explicit at the time of the first review. To the extent that the Committee’s
recommendations involve an expansion of social expenditure programs, there may be a need
to rebalance the government’s poverty strategy from capital to current spending.
23.
Staff noted the need to complement the anti-poverty strategy with fiscal reforms in
order to lessen regional disparities. A wide dispersion of poverty rates across regions, along
with the limited capacity of subnational governments to carry out investment projects,
highlight the need for improving the system of transfers in Peru (Box 2). At present, half of
the corporate tax paid by the mining sector accrues to the regions where mining takes place
(canon minero). Staff encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the introduction of
mechanisms under which part of this revenue would be shared with the poorest regions
where there is no mining activity. Although a recent initiative to allocate 20 percent of the
canon minero to such regions was unsuccessful in congress, staff encouraged the authorities
to persevere in this area.

14

For instance, a 2004 report by the Contraloria General de la Nación (CGN) noted that only about half of
resources allocated under the Vaso de Leche (Glass of Milk program) actually reached the targeted population of
young children and expecting and nursing mothers.
15

The work of the CIAS is expected to be supported by 11 governmental agencies involved with social
assistance programs.

Resources for poverty reduction. The canon minero provides the bulk of public resources
available at subnational government levels. They are estimated at US$1 billion (around
1 percent of GDP) in 2006 (up from US$150 million in 2002), and are to be used mainly
for investment in infrastructure. These resources are concentrated in a few regions, with
seven departments accounting for close to 80 percent of the total. Revenue from mining
royalties, introduced in 2004 with a graded scale of rates (1–3 percent, according to gross
sales), mostly benefits subnational governments. Mining royalty collections are expected to
amount to US$0.1 billion in 2006. The effective use of resources has been constrained by
the limited capacity of subnational governments to identify and execute productive
investment projects. At end-September 2006, they had accumulated US$0.5 billion in bank
deposits. The creation of SNIP offices at the regional level should help assist with the
approval procedures and accelerate the pace of implementation of projects.

24.
Mining regions are also set to benefit from part of the windfall gains of extractive
industries. In the context of buoyant mineral prices, private mining companies operating in
Peru have agreed to voluntary contributions to help increase social and infrastructure
spending in the regions in which they operate.16 The agreement with the government, which
was finalized in December, is expected to lead to disbursements of some US$0.8 billion over

16

FAD has provided TA in the area of the taxation of mining resources. Peru’s mining tax regime compares
favorably by international standards, but there is scope for making it more progressive in the future. FAD
recommended avoiding the introduction of ad hoc windfall taxes or an abrogation of stability contracts, as these
would significantly undermine prospects for investment.

20
the next five years. The contributions are a function of commodity prices and are computed
as a proportion of companies’ after-tax profits. They will remain outside of the budget
framework and will be managed by the companies themselves. The selection of projects
would be decided by committees comprised of representatives from contributing
corporations and subnational governments. Staff emphasized that close attention would need
to be paid to the nature of projects and spending to minimize disruption risks in case of a
decline in mineral prices.
C. Strengthening the Inflation Targeting Framework
25.
Despite the strong momentum in the economy, inflationary pressures are
quiescent. Over the past year, the increase in policy rates, together with upward pressure on
the currency, has helped keep underlying pressures in check. The authorities noted that,
although some areas of the country were operating at close to full capacity, wage pressures
had not materialized, reflecting in part the large number of new entrants to the labor force
and the size of the informal sector. However, there was agreement that increased public
spending could put additional pressure on resources, and that the resulting impact on
monetary conditions would require close scrutiny in the coming months.
26.
Staff noted that reforms could help further solidify the credibility of the inflation
targeting framework. There was

suggested increasing exchange rate flexibility. On the institutional front, the authorities
concurred that the de-linking of future appointments of the central bank president and board
members from the political cycle would further enhance the independence of monetary
policy, but noted that such a reform would be difficult, as it would require a constitutional
amendment.
27.
The authorities agreed on the need for greater exchange rate flexibility, but
emphasized that any change in policies would be implemented gradually. The authorities
noted that it was important to lean against temporary appreciation pressures, to avoid large
corrections if the global environment were to turn less favorable. They pointed out that, in a
highly dollarized economy, a significant and sudden depreciation of the currency could lead

21
to sharp changes in banks’ balance sheets. On the other hand, the authorities and staff agreed
that greater flexibility in exchange rate management would help avoid one-way bets in the
economy, promote the use of financial hedges by economic agents, and increase the overall
resilience of the economy. In turn, a higher degree of currency matching would help reduce
vulnerability to exchange rate

aim at limiting excessive volatility in
the exchange rate. The authorities preferred discretionary intervention over a rules-based
one, arguing that the limited size of the foreign exchange market might not be able to absorb
occasional mismatches of a technical nature, causing undue swings in the exchange rate.
28.
The program aims at a further modest buildup of official reserves. In recent years,
net official international reserves have risen to comfortable levels but vulnerabilities remain,
stemming from Peru’s high foreign currency public debt, the dollarization of the financial
system, and the exposure of the external position to commodity price shocks. The program
contemplates a further, although modest, reserves buildup of US$350 million (net of
banks’ deposits at the central bank) in 2007. The authorities noted that the quasi-fiscal costs
of the central bank had remained low. Staff concurred, but noted that these costs were
artificially contained by the low rate of remuneration paid by the central bank on banks’ legal
reserves on foreign currency liabilities. Staff encouraged the authorities to raise this rate to
help reduce distortions in financial intermediation. In early December, the rate was increased
from 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent.17
29.
There was agreement that the level of external competitiveness remained broadly
appropriate. Since 2000, Peruvian exports have more than tripled in U.S. dollar terms,
reflecting both the surge in commodity prices and a sharp increase in volume (10 percent a
year on average). Over the same period, growth in the volume of nontraditional exports has
averaged 12 percent a year, suggesting that competitiveness is adequate, although such
17

Previously, the rate of remuneration had been raised from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent in July 2006, after
having remained unchanged since June 2005. Prior to that date, it floated at the equivalent of Libor minus
0.75 percentage points.

22
growth in exports has also benefited from trade preferences in major markets. The authorities
and staff agreed that recent trends in fundamental determinants, such as commodity prices
and productivity growth, suggested that the currency may be slightly undervalued in real
effective terms, while recognizing that such an assessment was inherently difficult and
subject to considerable uncertainty (Box 3). There was agreement that infrastructure
development and reductions in customs procedures would help further improve the
competitiveness of Peruvian exports.
BOX 3: PERU: EXCHANGE RATE REGIME

•

Exchange rate regime. Peru maintains a unified, managed floating exchange rate.
The exchange system is free of restrictions on purchases of goods and services as
well as capital account transactions.

•

Appreciation pressures. Strong appreciation pressures have emerged since 2002,
driven by a surge in commodity prices, an increasingly stable macroeconomic
framework, continued productivity improvements, and a benign global
environment that has helped attract steady inflows of foreign capital.

•

Intervention. Appreciation pressures have been contained by central bank
intervention, partly out of concern that balance of payments improvements may be
temporary. Net central bank purchases in the foreign exchange market have
amounted to US$5.7 billion since end-2002. Over the past three years, the Nuevo
Sol has fluctuated within a narrow margin (less than 5 percent) against the
U.S. dollar.

Foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is small, with daily
turnover of US$40–100 million. Market participants expressed the view that

23
D. Strengthening the Resilience and Depth of the Financial System
30.
The banking system is generally sound, and the authorities have continued to
address balance sheet vulnerabilities associated with the high degree of dollarization. In a
supportive macroeconomic environment, banks have experienced improved asset quality,
profitability, and capitalization levels. Although financial intermediation remains low, with
net credit to the private sector equivalent to 27 percent of GDP, access to banking services
has increased significantly, with an additional 1½ million of new borrowers over the past five
years. General growth of bank credit to the private sector was around 12.5 percent in the 12–
month period through September 2006, with consumer credit expanding by 28 percent. The
authorities and staff shared the concern that

Reducing dollarization, particularly for mortgage loans, would be critical to
bolstering the resilience of the banking system. The authorities agreed that the banking
system remained highly exposed to foreign currency-related credit risk, as shown in the
stress tests of the 2005 FSAP update. Staff called for strengthening provisioning
requirements for the foreign currency loans that are pending a risk assessment, to increase

32.
The authorities considered that public banks should continue to play a critical role
as second-tier financial institutions. The three major public financial institutions—Banco de
la Nación, COFIDE, and Agrobanco—are boosting their lending operations to small and
medium-sized firms, in part through microfinance institutions. Given that microfinance
institutions have still relatively low capitalization and weak management practices, the
authorities plan to raise their minimum capital requirements while strengthening the selection
process for their management (MEFP, paragraph 26).18 To ensure that public bank lending
through microfinance institutions is extended on the basis of sound risk practices,
coordination among public banks and with the Superintendency of Banks (SBS) will be
enhanced (MEFP, paragraph 25). The authorities noted that the subsidiary role of the General

18

Microfinance institutions account for about 15 percent of total credit, or about 4 percent of GDP. The current
minimum capital requirement is $250,000, and Directors have tended to be appointed on the basis of their
political affiliation, particularly in municipal credit unions.

25
Banking Law for public banks made their supervision by the Superintendency of Banks more
complicated.19 Staff urged the authorities to ensure adequate governance and full-fledged
supervision for these public financial institutions.
33.
As a follow-up to the 2005 FSAP update, the authorities and staff discussed how to
deal with systemic risks during periods of financial stress. There was agreement that the
lender of last resort framework should be strengthened, particularly to establish the seniority
status of the central bank as a creditor, which is currently left to the SBS to decide (MEFP,
paragraph 24). To avoid large shifts in assets, staff suggested narrowing the net open foreign
exchange position of banks and setting limits on the levels of the foreign exchange position
of private pension funds.20 The authorities were of the view that current bank regulations
were appropriate, and that there was no immediate need for minimum hedging requirements
for private pension funds. They noted that these funds adjust profitability for risks, and
thereby limit incentives for large open positions. The authorities also agreed that such an
adjustment may not work well during times of stress, and undertook to explore the merits of
minimum hedging requirements (MEFP, paragraph 27).
34.
Several complementary reforms are being advanced to deepen domestic capital
markets. Peru’s domestic capital markets have expanded markedly in recent years,
particularly with respect to long-term bond

steps to deepen them. These steps included
removing regulatory impediments to
issuing securities, publishing a yield curve for private securities, unifying the tax treatment of
securitized transactions, and clarifying the tax treatment of financial derivatives while
aligning it with that for securitization transactions. In their view, the latter would encourage
bank participation in the markets for these instruments and expand the set of instruments
19

Banco de la Nación, COFIDE, and Agrobanco are governed by their own statutes, which can be amended by
the Ministry of Finance.

20

For banks, the limits of the short and long net open foreign position are equivalent to 10 percent and
100 percent of capital, respectively. Staff suggested that the limit on the long position be reduced to around the
level of dollarization of assets, so that the capital of banks remain protected.

26
used by the central bank for the conduct of monetary policy (MEFP, paragraph 24). These
efforts, along with other reforms to the payments system, would also help promote trading in
the secondary market.21 The authorities planned to request technical assistance from the Fund
in the capital market area. With assets held by private pension funds rapidly rising (US$12.7
billion at end-September), they have recently raised from 10.5 percent to 12 percent the limit
on pension fund investments abroad. To help diversify risks, staff encouraged them to
continue to raise gradually these limits.
E. Other Growth-Enhancing Reforms
35.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the business environment. Progress has
been made in recent years in the areas of investor protection and contract enforcement. The
establishment of two commercial courts has been an important first step to improve dispute
resolution, and the authorities intend to proceed with their extension nationwide. In
November, the authorities introduced a draft law in congress that would aim at simplifying
business licensing and eventually shortening approval processes from an average of close to
100 days to 15 days; a "one-stop window" would also be established for exporters and
importers.

Informal Economy (% of GDP)

36.
The labor market remains characterized by a very high degree of informality.
Official data show that three fourths of active workers are employed in the informal sector,
reflecting in part high severance payments and legal impediments to dismissals in the formal
sector. The authorities noted that political pressure to intensify rigidities had risen, but saw

21

Under the current law, the tax treatment of repurchase agreements entails a transfer of property and is
therefore subject to capital gains tax. This treatment differs for certificates of deposit. The tax treatment of
financial derivatives has yet to be defined by SUNAT.

particularly of high tariff rates, would
help further integrate Peru with the
global economy while boosting competitiveness. In late December, the authorities lowered
average tariff rates from 10.1 percent to 8.3 percent, effective January 1, 2007.
38.
The uncertainty regarding the ratification of the U.S. FTA may pose some risks to
certain sectors of the economy. Nearly 60 percent of Peru’s total textile exports and one
quarter of agricultural exports enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market as a result of
ATPDEA preferences. In the absence of a timely ratification of the FTA by the U.S.
congress, investment in these sectors might be curtailed due to uncertainties over the longterm conditions for access to the U.S. market (Box 4). In late December 2006, trade
preferences under the ATPDEA were extended through end-June 2007, with an option for
another six-month extension. Negotiations for new bilateral trade agreements are expected to
be initiated with Singapore and Mexico in the near future.
V. PROGRAM MODALITIES AND OTHER ISSUES
39.
The proposed low-access SBA covers the period through end-February 2009, and
the risks to the Fund are small. Total access would be equivalent to SDR172.37 million
(27 percent of quota or close to 13 percent on an annual basis). The authorities have
indicated that they plan to treat the arrangement as precautionary. Given the low access, risks
to the Fund are minimal, even if Peru were to draw the full amount available (Tables 14–15).
40.
The program envisages semi-annual reviews, with the first one associated with
performance at end-March 2007. The first review will concentrate on reforms to enhance
the fiscal policy framework, including the effectiveness of the tax system, notably
exemptions, and proposals to strengthen the effectiveness of social assistance programs.
Monitoring is based on quantitative performance criteria, an inflation consultation
mechanism, and structural benchmarks (Table 1 of the MEFP).

28
41.
An off-site safeguards assessment of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is expected
to be completed by end-January 2007. All recommendations of the last safeguards
assessment, completed in October 2004, have been implemented.
BOX 4. PERU: FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (FTA) WITH THE UNITED STATES
•

Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). The ATPDEA,
a unilateral scheme of trade preferences extended by the United States to Peru and
other countries of the region, has been in place since 2002. Peruvian Exports to the
U.S. have increased from less than 26 percent of total exports in 2001 to 31 percent
in 2005.

•

Free Trade Agreement. The FTA would offer a permanent framework and thus
provide a more secure environment for trade and investment decisions. It is broader
in scope than the ATPDEA, with reciprocal commitments on, inter alia, trade in
goods and services, investment, government procurement, labor legislation, and
intellectual property rights. The FTA was ratified by the Peruvian congress in June
2006 and is pending ratification by the U.S. congress.

•

Goods trade. Ratification of the FTA would immediately expand the list of
industrial goods that can be exported duty-free to the United States and establish a
10–year period for the removal of tariffs on 20 additional industrial products. In the
textiles sector, additional products would become eligible for duty-free treatment.
Some flexibility would be introduced in the rules of origin. On its part, Peru would
eliminate tariffs immediately on around 80 percent of its imports from the United
States, with tariffs on more sensitive products eliminated gradually, in stages of 5,
7, and 10 years.

•

Investments. The coverage of types of investment is very comprehensive, ranging
from securities to direct investment. The FTA includes dispute settlement
mechanisms and provides for compensation if the state were to renege from its
commitments under the FTA or from its obligations under existing or future
contracts, including in the area of exploitation of natural resources.

42.
Peru's statistics are adequate for policy formulation, surveillance, and program
monitoring. An updated business register has been established, but efforts should be made to
implement a new base year for the GDP. Also, better labor cost indices and indicators of
household indebtedness need to be developed. The need to improve coordination among
agencies that compile official statistics remains significant. A technical assistance mission to
enhance the reporting of monetary data is scheduled for January 2007.

29
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Supported by a favorable external environment, Peru is reaping the benefits of the
sound policies and reforms implemented over the past 15 years. The economy is enjoying
its longest expansion on record, with strong broad-based growth and rising employment,
while inflation remains well contained. Vulnerabilities have been reduced markedly, as
reflected in a strong foreign reserves position, a declining public debt-to-GDP ratio, and an
improved debt maturity structure. Sovereign bond spreads are close to record lows.
44.
The sustainability of these hard-won gains critically hinges on consolidating
macroeconomic stability and addressing long-standing structural and social weaknesses.
The authorities’ commendable commitment to enhance the conditions for strong and
sustained economic growth and to ensure that its benefits are shared with all segments of the
population is welcome. Toward these objectives, the proposed Fund-supported program aims
at strengthening the macroeconomic framework while effectively addressing social and
infrastructure needs; fostering long-term growth; and strengthening the resilience of the
financial system to adverse shocks.
45.
A stable and predictable policy framework will be key to helping ensure a business
environment conducive to high investment and economic growth. The authorities’ strong
commitment to respect contracts is critical toward ensuring sustained foreign direct
investment inflows and strong economic growth. Recent measures aimed at reducing red tape
and simplifying procedures for businesses, together with plans to extend commercial courts
beyond Lima, are also noteworthy.
46.
The government’s determination to address high poverty rates is being framed in a
comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. The government has appointed an Interministerial
Committee—under the authority of the Prime Minister—in charge of defining a strategy and
drawing up an action plan to combat poverty. The main task of this group will be to identify
how best to reach those who need immediate assistance, rationalize existing programs,
improve targeting, and develop an action plan that will be a critical part of the government’s
program.
47.
Fiscal prudence should remain the backbone of the authorities’ program. In 2007,
the combined public sector is projected to register a modest deficit, reflecting lower projected
revenue and increased spending on infrastructure maintenance and development. Moreover,
the authorities’ intention to lower the deficit in case revenue collections turn out to be higher
than contemplated in the program underscores their prudent fiscal policy. Staff encourages
the authorities to go beyond the program commitment in order to contain the possible
inflationary impact of the fiscal expansion, and to entrench the limits on spending growth
through the approval of the amended FRTL. Moreover, it would be important for the
authorities to redouble their efforts to broaden the tax base and avoid introducing new tax
exemptions, as these would complicate the tax system and lead to an erosion in revenue. It

30
will also be critical for the newly-established Committee for Fiscal Policy Coordination to
ensure that the operations of all public sector entities, including PetroPeru, are in full
compliance with program objectives. These policy efforts, together with active debt
management, are consistent with further declines in the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
48.
To avoid posing risks to the soundness of public finances, the authorities’
ambitious plans for decentralization will need to be implemented with caution. The
political will to advance decentralization should be carefully balanced against weaknesses in
the administrative and fiscal management capacity of subnational governments. Specific
tasks should only be transferred to subnational governments that meet the accreditation
system criteria. It would be important that the plans to decentralize the National System of
Public Investment are closely coordinated and monitored with subnational governments, so
as to ensure that the evaluation of investment projects remains adequate, especially in light of
the envisaged sizeable increase in capital spending. Care should also be taken to ensure that
the management of regional public companies is transferred to subnational governments only
if these governments have demonstrated the capacity to administer them soundly.
49.
Ensuring high quality investment in infrastructure will be best served by
establishing a legal framework for public-private partnerships. The adoption of a legal
framework is essential to provide clear guidelines for project selection and approval, conflict
resolution procedures, as well as to adopt international accounting standards. Staff
encourages the authorities to minimize future fiscal commitments under the PPP program
and, to further enhance transparency, the program includes a ceiling on any new
commitments. It will also be critical that the authorities monitor closely the issuance of
securities associated with PPP projects and explore new instruments aimed at minimizing
potential financial risks to the government.
50.
The favorable external environment provides a formidable opportunity to move to
greater exchange rate flexibility. Efforts are needed to introduce more flexibility in
exchange rate management and limit interventions to avoiding excessive exchange rate
volatility. Greater flexibility would help economic agents better internalize currency risks
and would provide more incentives for hedging, thus helping reduce dollarization.
51.
Further progress toward dedollarization in the financial system will help enhance
the resilience of the economy. Staff welcomes progress made in identifying foreign
exchange-related credit risks in the banking system and encourages the authorities to
continue adopting steps aimed at reducing risks from financial dollarization. The proposed
changes to the MiVivienda mortgage lending program are important steps in this regard, and
the authorities’ program includes important measures to discourage mortgage bank lending
in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers.
52.
Enhancing the resilience and depth of the financial system remains an important
priority. Peru’s financial system has strengthened markedly in recent years and, at present,
banks are profitable, well capitalized, and with low impaired assets. Staff welcomes plans to

31
strengthen the payments system and to reform the frameworks supporting repurchase
operations and derivatives. It will also be important to continue strengthening the bank
resolution and lender-of-last-resort frameworks. The authorities would be well advised to
continue gradually raising the limits on private pension fund investments abroad.
53.
With three fourths of workers employed in the informal sector, reducing
informality in the labor market is imperative. A comprehensive reform of labor market
legislation should aim at lowering high severance payments, better aligning non-wage
benefits with job tenure, and removing legal restrictions that prevent dismissals for
economic, technological, and structural reasons.
54.
The openness of Peru’s economy is still relatively low, and the authorities’
commitment to further trade liberalization is commendable. Staff encourages them to
continue their efforts towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations.
Ratification of the FTA with the United States would help bolster private investment and
employment generation, including by promoting institutional strengthening and reducing
investor uncertainty associated with the temporary nature of existing preferential trade
agreements. There is also scope for Peru to reduce its maximum tariff rates and tariff
dispersion.
55.
The authorities’ program for 2007–08 embodies a coherent set of policies to
consolidate macroeconomic stability, reduce poverty, and boost the conditions for
sustained economic growth. Successful implementation of the program will reinforce
confidence in the continuity of prudent policies and help pave the way for broad-based and
sustainable growth. Risks to the program include adverse terms-of-trade shocks and possible
policy slippages, particularly if the global environment were to turn less favorable. Lower
commodity prices and higher global risk aversion could exert considerable pressure on the
exchange rate and public finances, with potentially disruptive balance-sheet effects.
However, the authorities’ commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing
poverty mitigates concerns. On this basis, the staff supports the authorities’ request for a new
Stand-By Arrangement.
56.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Peru be held on the
24-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the provisions of the July 15, 2002 decision
on consultation cycles for countries with Fund arrangements.

ANNEX 1. PERU: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Peru’s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline significantly under the baseline debt
sustainability scenario. Economic growth would average close to 5 percent a year with the
overall deficit of the combined public sector averaging 0.9 percent of GDP. Public sector
revenue would remain broadly unchanged as a percent of GDP. Under these assumptions,
Peru’s public sector debt stock would decline from 38 percent of GDP at end-2005, to about
27½ percent of GDP by 2011.
Given that 80 percent of total external debt is public, in the baseline scenario the projected
drop in public debt largely determines the path of Peru’s total external debt. Following a
decline during 2004-05, as companies took advantage of favorable conditions to pay down
their external debt, private sector external debt is projected to decline slightly over the
medium term, from already low levels. As a result, total external debt is projected to decline
from 36 percent of GDP at end-2005 to 22 percent by 2011 (public external debt would
decline from 28 percent to 19 percent over the same period).
Peru’s external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative assumptions about
underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical standard
deviations to form alternative medium-term assumptions for real GDP growth and interest
rates show that Peru’s debt dynamics are only moderately vulnerable to such changes.
In contrast, external and public debt ratios are sensitive to changes in exchange rate
changes, given the still high foreign currency share of Peru’s debt. Specifically, under a
one-off 30 percent depreciation of the sol, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would shift by
14 percentage points above the baseline projections in the medium term. This test assumes
that the currency would remain at its depreciated level permanently—a scenario that could
only occur in the case the sol were currently significantly overvalued. Available data,
however, do not point to such an overvaluation. Non-interest current account shocks (such as
in the terms of trade) would have a moderate adverse impact on external indebtedness.
A similar pattern is observed under a 10 percent of GDP shock to the contingent liabilities
of the public sector: The public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise sharply in the short run and,
while declining over the medium term, would remain 10 percentage points above the debt
levels projected under the baseline scenario.

1

The DSA includes standard sensitivity tests around the baseline medium-term scenario. The methodology used
is in line with that endorsed in “Information Note on Modification to the Fund’s Debt Sustainability Assessment
framework for market Access Countries” (www.imf.org).

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru is subject to an
update of the 2004 assessment. The previous assessment concluded that some risks existed in the
bank’s safeguards framework, and recommendations made to address them have since been
implemented.

of restrictions, except for those maintained solely for the preservation of national or international
security, and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51). Those restrictions are maintained pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267
(October 15, 1999) and 1373 (September 28, 2001). The central government maintains external
payments arrears to unguaranteed suppliers, some of whom are in discussions with the government,
while the rest have not been located. Peru has maintained a clearing arrangement with Malaysia since
1991.

APPENDIX 2. PERU: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Bank Group strategy
A new World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is under preparation and will
cover the five year period of the new administration, corresponding to the Bank’s fiscal
years 2007 to 2011. This CPS will provide the Bank’s framework to support the
implementation of the government’s poverty reduction strategy with programs addressing
fiscal, national competitiveness, and social-sector needs. The program supported by the Bank
under the new CPS emphasizes partnerships, flexibility and results orientation. The CPS
under preparation envisages a lending program that will include a combination of two fast
disbursing loans and three investment projects per year. The new CPS will explore
development policy lending possibilities in the fiscal and social sectors, including the first
one to support policy reforms in the environmental sector. The previous Country Assistance
Strategy discussed by the IBRD Board on September 17, 2002 came to an end in July 2006.
To date, in FY06 four operations have been approved, the Regional Transport
Decentralization project for $50 million; the Decentralization and Competitiveness
Development Policy Loan for $150 million; the Real Property Rights Consolidation Project
for 25 million; and the Rural Electrification Project for $50 million. Peru’s current portfolio
amounts to 15 loans for US$431 million and one Guarantee Facility for US$200 million. A
development policy loan supporting fiscal management and competitiveness for
US$200 million will be discussed at the Board on December 19th, 2006. By end-FY06 the
disbursement level should hover around US$200 million.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
•

Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in
the design of tax reform. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB, staff has worked on
drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has also
focused on the design and implementation of decentralization of the social sectors
and pro-poor spending policies.

•

Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed in May 2001. Follow up technical
assistance to implement FSAP recommendations has been given by both institutions.
A joint FSAP update was completed in June 2005.

•

Public expenditure review (PER). In a joint effort with the IDB, and close
collaboration with the IMF, the Bank completed in June 2002 a comprehensive
diagnosis of, and made policy recommendations for, Peru’s public expenditure
management. A social sector expenditure review, with support of the Fund, is being
prepared to assess fiscal trends in the social sector under decentralization, review the
quality of social spending, and fine-tune the on-going budgetary protection policy of
priority social programs.

55
•

Fiscal reforms. In March 2002, the Bank and the Fund supported an international
seminar on proposals for revising the law on fiscal prudence and transparency. A
joint IMF-World Bank-IaDB mission took place in September 2004 for a pilot study
on Public Investment and Fiscal Policy.

•

CAS follow-up and preparation of the Programmatic Loans (Social Reform Loans I,
II, III, and IV, and Decentralization and Competitiveness Loan I, II, and III). The
World Bank and the government have engaged in an interactive and continuous
dialogue on CAS implementation and preparation of the subsequent programmatic
loans. Dialogue has concentrated on the macroeconomic background, setting of
triggers, overall loan conditionality, and risks and estimation of the fiscal
implications of Bank operations.

APPENDIX 3. PERU: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Country Strategy 2002–06
The key objectives for the 2002–06 strategy for Peru are poverty reduction and equity
promotion, within the context of high economic growth, which is needed to make these goals
sustainable. Toward this end, the Bank will support the government’s efforts to: (i) raise the
economy’s productivity and competitiveness, by removing institutional obstacles to increased
productivity and investment and making structural investments in human capital; (ii) improve
the efficiency of social policy while implementing measures to mitigate poverty and protect
vulnerable groups; and (iii) create a modern, decentralized and efficient state.
The Bank and the authorities have started the dialogue for the preparation of the new strategy
for 2007–11.
Lending
As of November 1st, 2006, the country’s portfolio consists of 27 loans for a total amount of
US$1,434.0 million. These resources are distributed among 25 investment loans (US$834.0
million) and two policy-based loans (US$600.0 million). The lending program for 2006 relies on
the approval of four investment loans for US$215.0 million and a programmatic loan for
US$200.0 million.
In addition, the country portfolio with Peru includes 45 non-reimbursable technical cooperation
grants (US$7.5 million) and six small projects (US$3.4 million). The Multilateral Investment
Fund (MIF) has 28 non-reimbursable technical cooperation grants under execution (US$15.2
million).

APPENDIX 4. PERU: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation, surveillance, and
program monitoring. Peru has been in observance of the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since August 1996 and meets the specifications for coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness of the data categories. An advance release calendar and the metadata for Peru
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. A data ROSC was
prepared and published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of
efforts and confusion among users; (ii) implementing a new benchmark and base year for
GDP; (iii) expanding the coverage of the wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas
extraction, electricity and water, public transportation, and communication; (iv) preparing
sectoral breakdowns of depository corporations and financial surveys in accordance with the
MFSM methodology; and (v) expanding the scope of data sources for compiling financial
flows of individual residents.
I.

Real Sector and Prices

In 2000, the authorities published a revised GDP series using the 1994 benchmark estimates,
which includes detailed input-output tables, as the base year. However, due to limited
availability of periodic source data, estimates after 1994 are largely based on extrapolation
techniques. The lack of current detailed tables for supply and use hampers the reconciliation
of discrepancies. As a result, changes in inventories are mainly determined as a residual.
Although the quarterly accounts have benefited from some improvements in the timeliness of
monthly production indices, coverage is still very limited. The National Statistics Office
(INEI) is working on a new national account series using 2001 as the base year.
The weight structure for the CPI is derived from a 1993–94 household expenditure survey.
Except for weights, source data are timely and consistent with the technical requirements for
producing the index. The coverage of owner-occupied housing, however, was eliminated
from the Metropolitan Lima index through the exclusion of imputed rent, a deviation from
international practices. Imputed rent is included in the indices of the other 24 cities in the
CPI. Thus, the national index is a weighted average of indices that have different coverage.
The weights for the WPI are also outdated. INEI derived the weights from the 1994 inputoutput table and other reports and publications of relevant ministries. The statistical
techniques used to compile the WPI follow generally accepted international standards.
The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators: open
unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remunerations. The quality of the
indicators has improved over the last two years. However, wage data comes with a relatively
long delay; the nationwide unemployment and underemployment situation is surveyed only
once a year; and labor productivity data is published only at the time of adjustments to
electricity and telecommunications tariffs.

58
II.

Fiscal Sector

The government finance statistics (GFS) for the general government are compiled using the
analytical framework of the GFS Manual 1986. For the consolidated central government,
revenues are compiled on a cash basis, while expenditures are compiled on an accrual basis.
The authorities have sent to the Fund information on the components of consolidated central
government expenditures by function. The coverage of published national budget data is
narrower than the fiscal statistics prepared for program purposes. The authorities have
recently prepared a plan to migrate to the GFS Manual 2001, but the schedule for migration
has yet to be defined. The authorities report annual GFS data using the GFSM 2001
analytical framework for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY)
and monthly data for the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
III.

Monetary Sector

The BCRP prepares and publishes the analytical accounts of the banking system and of the
central bank broadly in line with the methodology recommended by the Fund’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The main discrepancy is the valuation of some financial
instruments at cost rather than at market prices. Until early-2003, nonbank deposit-taking
institutions were excluded in the depository corporations survey, but following the
recommendations of the 2003 data ROSC mission, the BCRP began incorporating them.
Monetary statistics are disseminated only in a summary form. At the request of the
authorities, in January 2007 a mission will visit the country to assist them in migrating to the
new standardized report forms.
IV.

External Sector

The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and international investment
position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). Data are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Some departures from BPM5 include the lack of
coverage of assets held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; lack of separate
identification of liabilities to affiliated enterprises; and the recording of some external debt
transactions that are not on an accrual basis.
The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 international reserves weekly data in
accordance with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount
of the liquidity requirements in the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as
a contingent net drain (as specified in Section III of the Data Template). In September 2003,
Peru started to disseminate quarterly data on external debt with a one-quarter lag in the
BCRP website with a hyperlink to the Fund’s website. External debt data are not compiled
on an accrual basis, as recommended by BPM5 and the External Debt Statistics: Guide for
Compilers and Users.

Lima, Peru
January 3, 2007

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
Peru’s economy has performed well in recent years: economic growth has been
relatively strong, inflation has remained low, and most financial indicators have improved.
However, large social deficits persist, as half of the population still lives below the poverty
line and one-fourth of all Peruvian children are affected by malnutrition. Access to basic
public services, notably education, health, and security remains largely inadequate.
2.
The Government is determined to implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at
boosting Peru’s economic growth while ensuring that its benefits are shared by all. Our
program seeks to consolidate macroeconomic stability, alleviate poverty decisively, and
address structural weaknesses to enhance medium-term growth prospects. Long-standing
vulnerabilities related to a narrow tax base, poor infrastructure, high dollarization and low
financial intermediation, and high labor informality are being addressed to support growth.
3.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) presents the
plans of the Government of Peru for 2007–08. In support of its program, the government
requests a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) from the Fund totaling SDR 172.37 million
(27 percent of quota), covering the period through February 28, 2009. The requested SBA
would help bolster market confidence and provide an important anchor to policies to
entrench macroeconomic stability, decisively tackle poverty, and enhance medium-term
growth. The government intends to treat the requested arrangement as precautionary.
4.
The Government of Peru believes that the policies described in the attached MEFP
are adequate for meeting the objectives of the program, but stands ready to take any
additional measures that may be needed for this purpose. We will maintain a close and
proactive policy dialogue with the Fund, in accordance with Fund policies on such
consultations. There will be four semi-annual reviews under the program, and the first review

2
will be completed by May 15, 2007. Performance criteria and structural benchmarks under
the program are set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Luis Carranza
Minister of Economy and Finance

President Central Reserve Bank of Peru

3
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007–08
1.
Over the past several years, Peru has made progress in consolidating macroeconomic
stability and in implementing important reforms. Supported by a favorable external
environment, the economy has been experiencing its longest expansion on record, with
growth averaging 4¼ percent a year since 2001. Inflation has remained well contained in the
context of the inflation targeting framework, and the external position has strengthened
significantly. Progress was also made in strengthening the medium-term underpinnings of
fiscal policy, consolidating the prudential and supervisory frameworks for the financial
system, and in taking steps to improve the business environment.
2.
Notwithstanding this strong performance, the Government of Peru is aware of the
critical and pressing challenges facing the nation and is committed to addressing them.
Moreover, it will implement the policies needed to help secure investment grade status while
ensuring a more equal distribution of the benefits associated with growth. Accordingly, the
government intends to consolidate macroeconomic stability and establish the conditions to
reduce poverty decisively, enhance medium-term growth prospects, help promote
employment growth, improve basic public services, and diminish incentives for informality.
Critical to achieving these objectives is the implementation of reforms that strengthen the
effectiveness of public institutions.
3.
Macroeconomic policies for 2007–08 aim at sustaining economic growth, low
inflation, and a strong external position. The economy is expected to grow by 5.5–6 percent,
led increasingly by a strong domestic demand, and twelve-month inflation is projected to
remain at around 2.5 percent. The external current account surplus would narrow to
¼ percent of GDP in 2007-08, and net international reserves are projected to grow by at least
US$400 million in 2007, with some further increase in 2008. To achieve these objectives, we
will maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policies, while implementing growth-enhancing
reforms.
A. Consolidating Macroeconomic Stability
4.
In the public sector, emphasis is being placed on prudent policies, while making room
for needed increases in social and infrastructure spending. The overall balance of the
combined sector is targeted to shift from a surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2006 to a deficit
of 0.8 percent in 2007, and 0.7 percent of GDP in 2008. The program includes an adjustor
under which any central government revenue (net of mandatory transfers) exceeding
programmed amounts will be saved to reduce the overall deficit to no more than 0.5 percent
of GDP in 2007. Public sector debt is expected to fall from 37½ percent of GDP at the end of
2005 to close to 30 percent by end–2008. The fiscal objectives of the program will be
monitored on a quarterly basis through ceilings on the borrowing requirement of the
combined public sector; the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional medium- and
long-term public debt; and the outstanding short-term external debt of the nonfinancial public

4
sector. The program also includes a ceiling on the future stream of government obligations
associated with new concessions and public-private partnerships awarded by the government.
5.
To provide room for needed infrastructure spending while preserving fiscal
discipline, the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) is expected to be
amended. A mechanism of sanctions is to be introduced in case of noncompliance with this
law, and the 3-percent annual limit on the real growth in government spending was redefined,
to exclude maintenance and investment spending. These changes would allow the
government to increase public investment to 4.5 percent of GDP over the next five years.
6.
The government is committed to broadening the tax base by reducing tax exemptions.
To that effect, following the completion of a study on regional and sectoral tax exemptions,
by March 2007 it will submit to congress a draft law that would rationalize fiscal exemptions.
Steps will be taken to limit the adverse impact on tax collections from the creation of the tax
free zone in Puno. With the same objective, tax exemptions for companies effectively
operating in the high altitude regions of the country will only apply to a limited number of
taxes. During 2007, the government will seek to finalize arrangements aimed at replacing
regional tax exemptions with government transfers earmarked for infrastructure for other
regions, similar to the agreement reached in July 2005 with the San Martín region.
7.
The government intends to simplify, broaden, and enhance the effectiveness of the tax
regime. In the area of tax policy, the Financial Transactions Tax rate will be gradually
reduced beginning in January 2008. Prior to end-March 2007, MEF will specify the tax
treatment of financial derivative instruments and financial securitization transactions. It will
harmonize the tax treatment of repurchase agreements and certificates of deposits by end2007. Legislation will be introduced in congress by end-December 2006 to reinstate the
recently-eliminated tax on casinos and slot machines. The fiscal regime will continue to be
consistent with enhancing the relative competitiveness of Peru in attracting investment into
the mining and hydrocarbon sectors. In this regard, the government will not impose any new
measures that would result in the unilateral cancellation of tax stability contracts. In the area
of tax administration, performance indicators will be established at SUNAT to strengthen its
effectiveness, particularly at customs. Administrative measures will be taken to avoid misuse
of the duty drawback for exports, make the process of advanced VAT refunds more efficient,
and simplify the system for small taxpayers (RUS).
8.
Modernizing the budgetary process is critical to strengthening fiscal management and
the effectiveness of public spending. The 2008 budget will be prepared following a budget
classification aligned with international standards and incorporated into the charts of
accounts. A comprehensive reform is under way to move gradually to performance budgeting
in the accounts of the public sector, with the aim of completing this process by 2010. With
assistance from the World Bank, performance indicators will be identified with a view to
introducing performance budgeting for public investment by 2008. To improve transparency
and facilitate supervision over public resources, the government will establish fully

5
functioning Treasury Single Accounts for the central government by end-December 2007 and
for subnational governments by end-December 2008. The independent assessment of the
government’s Financial Management Information System (SIAF) will be completed by
September 2007 and its recommendations will start to be implemented soon thereafter.
9.
A transparent and effective fiscal framework constitutes the backbone of
macroeconomic stability. To that effect, a Committee for Fiscal Policy Coordination will be
created to ensure that all nonfinancial public sector entities continue to abide by the
guidelines and goals established in the FRTL. To take into account the need to undertake
long-delayed investments, the proposed program incorporates adjustors in the ceilings for
contracting and guaranteeing of nonconcessional public debt (US$300 million) and in the
overall deficit of the public sector (up to US$100 million) for additional capital expenditure
undertaken by PetroPeru, in order to comply with environmental requirements.
10.
The decentralization process will proceed in a fiscally sound manner. Efforts to
strengthen the administrative capacity of subnational governments will be deepened during
2007-08, and functions devolved to subnational governments upon their satisfactorily
meeting all the Accreditation System criteria. The government will monitor the quality of
public expenditure for devolved functions and establish a registry of subnational debt at the
Ministry of Finance. To this end, by March 2007 the Ministry of Finance will establish a unit
to monitor the operations of subnational governments and their performance relative to the
fiscal rules. It will also request that all regional governments and large municipalities comply
with reporting rules by end-2007.
11.
To simplify and expedite the approval of public investment projects, the government
will reform the National System of Public Investment (SNIP). In accordance with a recentlyapproved law, its operations will be decentralized, with steps taken in close coordination
between the Ministry of Finance and the regions to ensure that the quality of project
assessments is preserved, and that SNIP procedures are better aligned with existing regional
budget procedures. In this context, the limit on projects not subject to SNIP approval has
been revised upward from S/. 4 million to S/. 10 million. Efforts will be made to develop and
strengthen project assessment capacity of regional and local governments.
12.
The Government of Peru intends to continue pursuing active debt management
operations to deepen the domestic capital market further. It will continue to increase the
share and duration of local currency instruments, to reduce exchange rate risks and extend
the yield curve; it will also lengthen the maturity of new placements abroad in order to
smooth out the amortization profile of external public debt. The Ministry of Finance will
finalize a methodology for valuing the contingent liabilities of the public sector in relation to
PPP projects. The Ministry of Finance also intends to enhance the design of the financing
instruments used in the PPP projects.

6
13.
The authorities are fully committed to preserving price stability and further
strengthening the inflation targeting framework. Toward these objectives, the Central
Reserve Bank of Peru stands ready to adjust interest rates as required to meet the inflation
target. The Central Bank will limit its intervention in the foreign exchange market to avoid
excessive volatility and build international reserves, thus helping economic agents to better
internalize foreign exchange risks.
B. Reducing Poverty
14.
The sustainability of Peru’s economic development critically hinges on a prompt and
significant reduction in poverty levels. To effectively address social problems, including the
critical issue of chronic malnutrition among children less than five years old, the government
has established several new programs and is expanding and reforming existing ones:
•

Child nutrition programs are being consolidated and strengthened to bring
malnutrition down by five percentage points by 2011. Access to health insurance is
being facilitated, particularly for those living in conditions of extreme poverty.

•

The newly-created Fondo para la Igualdad, funded with the savings associated with
recently-introduced austerity measures and transfers authorized by the Ministry of
Finance, will be effectively used to address social needs. A registry of beneficiaries
from all social programs will also be established.

•

The Agua para Todos program is designed to help reduce by half the share of the
population without access to potable water over the next five years. The government
is also stepping up its housing efforts for the poor through the Techo Propio program
and strengthening Cofopri’s efforts to issue property titles. The number of families
benefited under the conditional cash-transfer program Juntos will be raised from
180,000 in 2006 to 300,000 by end-2007.

•

In the area of education, the accreditation system for teachers will be strengthened
and their skills improved though continuous training.

15.
To help design better policies in the fight against poverty and, in general, with respect
to all social expenditures, the government will entrust the Secretary of Social Affairs (CIAS)
to prepare reforms in this area. Social assistance programs have become extensive and are in
need of streamlining and consolidation. By March 2007, the CIAS will have completed a
comprehensive stocktaking of all social programs and prepared an action plan aimed at
optimizing their functioning. Completion of the report by March 2007 will be a structural
benchmark under the program. In implementing the poverty alleviation strategy, efforts will
focus, with the support of multilateral institutions, on strengthening the indicators for
monitoring and assessing key social programs.

7
16.
The government has recently reached agreement with mining sector companies to
make voluntary contributions toward a privately managed fund to support poverty alleviation
and infrastructure needs. A committee, comprising subnational governments and mining
sector companies, has been established to select the specific projects that will be financed
with these contributions.
C. Promoting Long-Term Growth
17.
To help overcome existing deficiencies in public infrastructure, the Government is
promoting the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). To that effect, a framework law will
be submitted to congress by June 2007, which will provide guidelines on all aspects of PPP
operations, including project selection and approval, reporting requirements, conflict
resolution procedures, and adherence to international accounting standards. During 2007, the
government plans to initiate PPP operations for a total amount of US$3 billion, with large
projects in the areas of ports, highways, and sanitation. All PPPs will continue to be
evaluated by the SNIP and, to ensure that the increased reliance on PPPs is consistent with
fiscal sustainability, the program has established a limit on the net present value of future
government payments, firm and contingent, associated with new PPP operations.
18.
The government is firmly committed to ensuring sustained formal employment
generation in the private sector while aiming at a gradual reduction in labor market
informality. Steps will be taken to further improve employment generation while developing
a more comprehensive social protection net and providing progressive access to benefits to
informal sector workers. The Government also plans to renew the current labor regime
governing micro-enterprises before its expiration by end-2008.
19.
Fostering the conditions for the growth of private sector activity is a core government
objective. Steps have been taken to press ahead with administrative simplification and a onestep window is being implemented for new businesses and exporters. The positive results of
the pilot program of commercial courts in Lima have helped expedite the resolution of
business disputes, and the Judiciary intends to establish such courts in several other cities by
end-2008.
20.
The government intends to increase the openness of the economy further. The
ratification of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States will represent an
important step in this area. Upon ratification of this agreement, the government will provide
temporary compensation to affected producers for a limited period of time, without
compromising the fiscal targets. The government will continue reducing tariff protection at
the MFN level but also seek new bilateral FTAs, with a view to increasing further Peru’s
insertion in the world economy and boosting exports.

8
D. Strengthening the Resilience of the Financial Sector
21.
The government will continue to strengthen financial sector regulation and
supervision in order to enhance the resilience of the financial system. In this aspect,
regulations were recently issued, aimed at preventing over-indebtedness by households and
ameliorating foreign-currency-induced credit risks. In the period ahead, efforts will be
focused on sustaining financial de-dollarization, improving the reliability of the payments
system, expanding the role of public banks in promoting access to financial markets, and
enhancing the development of the capital market.
22.
To sustain the de-dollarization process, sound macroeconomic policies are being
complemented by prudential regulations aimed at mitigating foreign-currency induced credit
risks. The Superintendency of Banks (SBS) is ensuring that banks complete their assessment
of unhedged borrowers by end-2006 and that, as required, reclassify their loans and build the
associated provisioning requirements if needed. By December 2007, the SBS will strengthen
the regulations on classification of loans and provisioning to fully take into account foreigncurrency induced credit risks. The SBS will also issue norms to introduce lower loan-to-value
ratios for mortgage loans in foreign currency to unhedged borrowers. In line with the Basel II
Accord, the government will also seek to modify the General Banking Law with a view to
introducing specific capital requirements for exposure to foreign currency credit risks.
23.
The government will continue to promote mortgage lending in domestic currency
under the MiVivienda program. To that effect, steps will be taken to ensure that, by end-June
2007, most new mortgage loans guaranteed by MiVivienda are denominated in nuevo soles.
MiVivienda’s guarantee and provision of the “good payer bond” on mortgages in foreign
currency will be discontinued for any new loan signed after that date. MiVivienda will also
gradually increase its resources through issuance of long-term bonds in soles.
24.
With respect to the payments system, the authorities will complete the DVP for fixedincome and will establish oversight of over-the-counter trading platforms. The legal
framework for empowering the central bank to oversee and regulate the entire payment
system will be defined by June 2007. To further strengthen the payments system, the
authorities will also modify the banking law to ensure the seniority of the central bank as a
lender of last resort among creditors.
25.
Public banks will operate as second tier institutions. Agrobanco was recently
recapitalized and mechanisms are being established to ensure that Banco de la Nación assists
small and medium-size regional businesses more effectively. To that effect, it has started
channeling its new lending operations to micro enterprises primarily through nonbank
financial institutions. A coordinating committee comprised of representatives of the
Corporación Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE), Banco de la Nación, and Agrobanco will
be established by March 2007, to determine, according to strict financial criteria, which
financial institutions should be allowed to enter into infrastructure agreements with Banco de

9
la Nación. Banco de la Nación will also continue to comply with a 25 percent annual growth
limit on its consumer lending operations in 2007 and 2008. Steps will be taken to strengthen
the oversight of the SBS over Banco de la Nación.
26.
The government will implement additional measures aimed at improving the financial
soundness and corporate governance of microfinance institutions. In particular, the minimum
capital requirements for establishing such institutions will be raised. To enhance the
transparency of credit operations and enforce consumer protection, the SBS will ensure that
information on interest rates charged by financial intermediaries are presented in a
transparent manner to the public.
27.
Recognizing the increased importance of private pension funds in the economy, the
government will seek to enhance their operating environment. The limits on private pension
funds abroad will be gradually raised, while other cross-limits will be eased. The authorities
will also assess whether minimum hedging requirements for foreign exchange investments of
AFPs should be introduced. In order to promote the development of capital markets, an
assessment will be undertaken to evaluate existing methods of infrastructure finance and
determine whether the legal and regulatory frameworks should be modified, with a view to
improving investor demand and reducing transaction structuring costs. A calendar for the
issuance of infrastructure bonds in domestic currency will be developed by June 2007. The
government also plans to strengthen the role and administrative capacity of the Comisión
Nacional Supervisora de Empresas y Valores (CONASEV), to better align it with the
development of new instruments and the increase in trading volumes.

TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU)
This technical memorandum sets out the understandings between the Peruvian authorities
and the Fund relating to the monitoring of the program for 2007. It defines the concepts used
to assess compliance with quantitative performance criteria specified in the letter of the
Government of Peru dated January 3, 2007. It also sets the frequency of the data to be
provided to the Fund for monitoring the program. For purposes of the program for 2007,
operations in foreign currency will be converted into Nuevos Soles at the average program
exchange rate of S/. 3.24 per U.S. dollar.
I. DEFINITIONS OF CONCEPTS
1.
The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) includes the central government, the
autonomous agencies, the local and regional governments, and the nonfinancial public
enterprises.
2.
The borrowing requirement of the combined public sector (PSBR) will be
measured as: (a) net domestic financing of the NFPS; plus (b) net external financing of the
NFPS; plus (c) proceeds from the Private Investment Promotion Program (PIPP); and less
(d) the operating balance of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP). The PSBR will be
adjusted to exclude the impact of data revisions that do not represent a change of its flows
during 2007. The components of the PSBR (see Table 1), will be defined and measured as
follows:
(a) The net domestic financing of the NFPS is defined as the sum of: (i) the increase
in net claims of the domestic financial system1 on the nonfinancial public sector, excluding
Peruvian Brady bonds and other government bonds initially sold abroad; (ii) the net increase in
the amount of public sector bonds2 held outside the domestic financial system and the
nonfinancial public sector, excluding Peruvian Brady bonds and other bonds initially sold
abroad; and (iii) the increase in the floating debt of the nonfinancial public sector due to
expenditure operations and tax refund arrears; less (iv) the accumulation of stocks, bonds, or
other domestic financial assets by the nonfinancial public sector and (v) the amortization of
pension related bonds. In the case of enterprises that are divested after December 31, 2006, the
net credit of the financial system to these enterprises will be recorded, for the remainder of the
program period, as unchanged from their level at the time of the PIPP.

1

The financial system comprises the banking system, the Corporación Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE),
MiVivienda and all other nonbank financial intermediaries. The banking system includes the BCRP, the
commercial banks, Banco de la Nación (BN), and AgroBanco.

2

Excluding the new issuances of pension related bonds.

13
(b) The net external financing of the NFPS comprises (i) disbursements of loans;
plus (ii) receipts from the issuance of government bonds abroad; minus (iii) cash payments of
principal (current maturities of both loans and bonds); minus (iv) cash payments of arrears
(principal and interest); plus/minus (v) the net increase/decrease in short-term external debt;
minus (vi) debt buy-backs or other prepayments of debt (at market value) not included in the
following item (including repayments of short-term external debt assumed by the
government at the time of the divestiture of public enterprises, net of the proceeds from the
sale of inventories of such enterprises); minus (vii) debt-equity swaps used in the PIPP
accounted at the market value of these papers as defined by ProInversion; minus/plus
(viii) the net increase/decrease in foreign assets of the nonfinancial public sector (including
those held abroad by the Fondo Consolidado de Reservas (FCR), and any other fund
managed by the Oficina de Normalización Previsional (ONP)) (see Table 2).
(c) PIPP proceeds are defined as (i) the cash payments received by the Treasury
from the sale of state-owned assets (including proceeds transferred to the FCR, and any other
specialized funds) valued at the program exchange rate, plus (ii) debt equity swaps used in
the PIPP, accounted at market values as defined by ProInversion. PIPP proceeds also include
up-front payments received by the Treasury for the granting of concessions for public
services but exclude the annual payments under the concession program, which are part of
nontax revenue.
(d) The operating balance of the BCRP includes: (i) cash interest earnings of the
BCRP minus cash interest payments by the BCRP, in both domestic and foreign currency;
(ii) the administrative expenses of the BCRP; and (iii) any realized cash losses or gains from
activities in currencies, financial instruments, and derivatives.
3.
The quarterly limits on the borrowing requirement of the combined public
sector (PSBR) for 2007 will be reduced by the amount to which revenues of the central
government net of mandatory transfers exceed program estimates of S/.10,489 million at endMarch, up to a ceiling of S/. 250 million; S/. 23,359 million at end-June, up to a ceiling of S/.
500 million; S/. 32,807 million at end-September, up to a ceiling of S/. 750 million; and S/.
44,821 million at end-December, up to a total ceiling of S/. 1,000 million. Mandatory
transfers are earmarked central government expenditures that are linked to revenue. These
include canon and sobrecanon, fondo de Camisea, regalía minera, renta de aduanas, and
Impuesto de Promoción Municipal (IPM).
4.
The consultation bands for inflation are based on the 12-month rate of change in
consumer prices as measured by the Indice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC) at the level of
Metropolitan Lima by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI). Should
inflation fall outside an inner band of 2 percentage points around the central point of
2.5 percent, the authorities will discuss with the Fund staff on an appropriate policy response.
Should inflation fall outside an outer band of 3 percentage points around the central point of
2.5 percent, the authorities will discuss with Fund staff on a policy response and complete a

14
consultation with the Executive Board of the Fund on the proposed policy response before
requesting further purchases under the program.
5.
The net consumer lending of the Banco de la Nación will be defined as
disbursements of all consumer loans, including these under the “Multired Program”
(established in November 2001) and “Prestamos a 60 Quotas” (established in
September 2004) less cash amortizations under the loan programs. Interest payments on these
loans are excluded from the definition of net lending.
6.
The net international reserves of the BCRP, excluding foreign-currency deposits
of financial institutions, are defined for the purpose of the program as: (a) the foreign assets
of the BCRP (excluding subscriptions to the IMF and the Latin American Reserve Fund
(FLAR), Pesos Andinos, credit lines to other central banks, Corporación Andina de Fomento
(CAF) bonds, and foreign assets temporarily held by the BCRP as part of swap operations);
less (b) reserve liabilities, defined as the sum of: (i) the BCRP’s external liabilities with an
original maturity of less than one year, and (ii) its liabilities to the IMF, to the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) and to the FLAR; less (c) deposits in foreign currency by the
banking system, other financial intermediaries and the private sector, net of repos of Treasury
bonds with the financial system.
7.
BCRP’s silver holdings will be included as net domestic assets and excluded from
the net international reserves.
8.
BCRP’s gold holdings will be accounted at US$516.53 per troy ounce (the average
book value as of June 30, 2006), SDRs at US$1.429 per SDR, and foreign currency assets
and liabilities of the BCRP in other currencies than US$ at the exchange rate of June 30,
2006. Net international reserves will be adjusted to exclude any valuation gains or losses
resulting from net sales or deliveries of gold by the BCRP. The end-September 2006 level of
net international reserves is shown in Table 3.
9.
The flows of the short-term external debt of the NFPS are defined as the net
change in the NFPS’s outstanding external indebtedness with a maturity of less than one year
(including instruments with put options that would be triggered within one year of the
contracting date), measured, in part, on the basis of the operations of a selected sample of
public enterprises comprising Petroperú, and Electroperú. These limits exclude normal
import financing but include forward commodity sales. In the case of companies sold to the
private sector under the PIPP, the short-term debt of these entities will be recorded, for the
remainder of the program period, as unchanged from their level at the time of the PIPP. The
[end-September 2006] stock of short-term external debt of the NFPS is shown in Table 4.
10.
The contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional public debt with a maturity
of at least one year refers to all domestic and external obligations of the NFPS contracted or
guaranteed by the government, COFIDE, the BCRP, the BN, and any other public financial
entity, except for loans classified as reserve liabilities of the BCRP. The program limits on

15
nonconcessional debt will exclude: (i) any new loans extended in the context of a debt
rescheduling or debt reduction operation; (ii) any lending at concessional terms; and (iii)
certificates (BCRPCD) issued by the BCRP for conducting monetary policy. The program
limits will be adjusted upward by up to US$300 million for debt contracted by Petroperu
during 2007 that is not guaranteed by the central government.
11.
For the purpose of the performance criterion on the contracting or guaranteeing
of public debt, external public debt applies also to commitments contracted or guaranteed
for which value has not been received. In this regard, the term “debt” has the meaning set
forth in point No.9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with respect to Foreign Debt
adopted on August 24, 2000 (Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85)). Thus, the term "debt" will
be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time: these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the
obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property; (iv) PAO Entitlement Recognition Certificates (CRPAOs) used to
facilitate the financing of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects by concessionaires.3 For
the purpose of the performance criterion, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt
are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt. Foreign currency public debt
to be contracted or guaranteed will be converted based on the program exchange rate, with
cross rates for non-dollar foreign currencies set based upon the rate on the day of the
transaction, published by REUTERS.

Under Peruvian law, the CRPAOs are not treated as sovereign debt.

For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt (i.e., grant element) is equal to nominal value minus NPV divided
by nominal value. The NPV of debt at the time of its disbursement is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the OECD. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year average
CIRR will be used to calculate the NPV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a
maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be used. For the purposes of
the program through end-June 2007, the CIRRs published by the OECD in October 2006 will
be used (see Table 5).
13.
The concessionality of loans in currency baskets will be assessed on the basis of
U.S. dollar interest rate tables. For loans with interest rates based on the internal policy of the
creditors, the relevant interest rate to define concessionality will be the interest rate for each
creditor at the time of the commitment. Loans or portions of loans extended in the context of
a debt rescheduling or a debt reduction operation will be excluded from the ceiling.
14.
The NPV of the future government payments associated with PPP operations
will include all payments, firm and contingent, committed by the government in relation to
new PPP projects signed during the program period. Specifically, such payments will
include, inter alia, annual payments for the coverage of the investment made by the
concessionaire (Pagos anuales por Obra, or PAOs); annual payments for the maintenance
and operation of the project (Pagos Anuales por Mantenimiento y Operación or PAMOs);
and the minimum annual revenues guaranteed to a concessionaire by the government
(Ingresos Minimos Anuales Garantizados, or IMAGs). For those projects where the
government’s payment commitments have yet to be defined in terms of PAOs and PAMOs,
the target also includes the estimated aggregate annual payments for the project (Pagos
Anuales por Servicio, or PAS). The discount factor used in the calculation of the NPV of the
payments will be the 10-year commercial interest reference rate (CIRR). For purposes of the
program through end-June 2007, the CIRRs published by the OECD in October 2006 will be
used (Table 5).
15.
The external payments arrears of the public sector include arrears to multilateral
financial institutions, to Paris Club creditors, and to other foreign creditors with whom debt
restructuring agreements have been concluded. They exclude arrears outstanding at end-2005
that were not covered under restructuring agreements. The public sector will be defined to
include the NFPS, COFIDE, the BCRP, the BN, and any other state development bank.
16.
Definitions used in Table 1 of the letter of intent dated January 3, 2007 for the
calculation of adjusters, limits and targets for net international reserves:

17
a.
Net foreign borrowing (Table 2) is defined as the sum of disbursements of loans
(I.2.b.i); plus receipts from the issuance of government bonds abroad (I.2.b.ii); minus cash
payments of principal (I.2.b.iii); minus cash payments of arrears (principal and interest)
(I..b.iv); plus/minus the net increase/decrease in short-term external debt (I.2.b.v).
b.
The withdrawals for portfolio management purposes of deposits held at the BCRP
by the FCR and any other fund managed by the ONP, mentioned in footnote 4 of Table 1
attached to the letter of intent dated January 3, 2007 refer to placements of funds that are in
accord with an investment plan approved by the Board of the FCR, excluding deposits in
public financial institutions and government securities.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 26, 2007

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Macroeconomic developments
2.

Recent economic indicators suggest that economic performance remains strong.

•

Real GDP is estimated to have grown by about 7½ percent (year-on-year) during
January-November 2006, underpinned by strong private consumption and investment.
In December, 12-month inflation fell to 1.1 percent, below the 1.5–3.5 percent target
range, largely reflecting lower gasoline prices and a one-off decline in telephone
rates. Core inflation remained stable, at 1.4 percent.

•

The external current account surplus is estimated to reach close to 2 percent of GDP
in 2006, about ¾ percentage point of GDP above staff projections. This development
primarily reflects higher prices of metals and lower-than-projected imports during the
fourth quarter.

•

Net international reserves stood at US$17.4 billion at end-2006. The exchange rate
has continued to appreciate moderately against the U.S. dollar, by 1½ percent since
November.

Policy developments
3.
Preliminary data suggest that the consolidated public sector balance would
record a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP in 2006. This outcome would exceed projections in
the staff report by about ½ percentage points of GDP, largely as a result of lower
expenditures, most notably related to investment, at all government levels.
4.
The authorities have adopted several measures, in line with their Letter of intent
and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. Specifically:
•

The draft law amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law was
presented to congress and approved on first reading (MEFP, ¶5). The draft law will
have to go through a second reading before final approval by congress.

•

Legislation to reinstate the tax on casinos and slot machines was passed on December
21, 2006 (MEFP, ¶7).

2
•

The regulations governing the agreement with mining sector companies for a
voluntary contribution to support poverty alleviation and infrastructure needs were
issued on December 21, 2006 and are broadly in line with what has been described in
the staff report (¶ 24).

•

The regulatory framework designed to help establish a one-step window for exporters
and importers was approved by Congress in early January (MEFP, ¶19).

•

Banks have completed the assessment of their portfolios to identify unhedged
borrowers (MEFP, ¶22). Preliminary information confirms that about 18 percent of
banks’ foreign currency denominated loans have been extended to unhedged
borrowers. It is expected that banks will continue to reclassify these loans and build
additional provisioning requirements.

•

The Superintendency of Banks has further liberalized the regulations affecting private
pension funds’ investments abroad (MEFP, ¶27). In particular, private pension funds
would now be allowed to invest in non-investment grade instruments, as well as in
mutual funds that invest in private equity, venture capital, real estate, and hedge
funds. The new regulations also ease the limit for investing in a single mutual fund
(from 1 percent to 2 percent), and eliminate the maximum limit (3 percent) on
investments in a mutual fund management company.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On January 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2006 Article IV consultation with Peru.1
Background
The Peruvian economy has been reaping the benefits of sound policies, in the context of a
favorable external environment. The economy is enjoying its longest expansion on record, with
low inflation, a solid external position, and declining indebtedness ratios. During the first 11
months of 2006, real GDP grew by about 7½ percent year-on-year, propelled by strong exports
and domestic demand—supported by growing investment as well as higher incomes and rising
employment (Table 1). After peaking at 2.9 percent in April, 12-month inflation abated to
1.1 percent in December, reflecting tightening monetary conditions, a favorable food supply
shock, and a decline in domestic fuel prices. Core inflation has remained at the lower end of the
inflation target range and inflation expectations are well anchored.
The external position has strengthened, vulnerabilities have declined, and financial market
conditions have been favorable. The current account surplus is estimated to have risen to
2 percent of GDP in 2006, while foreign direct investment remained strong. At end-2006, net
international reserves stood at US$17.3 billion, equivalent to 390 percent of short-term debt and
150 percent of foreign currency deposits with the banking system. Public sector debt is
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

estimated to have declined to 31½ percent of GDP by end-2006, or 15 percentage points below
its end–2002 level. The structure of this debt has also improved, with the share of local
currency-denominated debt now equivalent to one-fifth of total. In recent months, two credit
ratings agencies upgraded Peru’s sovereign rating to BB+ (one notch below investment grade)
and Moody’s changed its outlook from neutral to positive. Sovereign bonds have hovered close
to all-time low levels and stock market prices have increased sharply. The Nuevo Sol has been
fluctuating within a narrow margin against the U.S. dollar and the real effective exchange rate
has remained broadly stable, close to the average of the past five years.
This favorable performance reflects to a large extent the prudent conduct of fiscal policy in
recent years. The deficit of the combined public sector was gradually reduced, from 2½ percent
of GDP in 2001 to ⅓ percent of GDP in 2005. During the first three quarters of 2006, the
combined public sector balance achieved a surplus equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP, partly
reflecting rising central government revenue, which was boosted by higher than anticipated
corporate income tax payments. However, expenditure grew by 11 percent in real terms during
this period, compared with the same period in 2005. Expenditure is expected to pick up in the
last quarter of the year, reflecting the adoption of a supplementary budget focusing on capital
outlays and government plans to advance outlays initially planned for 2007. For 2006 as a
whole, the combined public sector is expected to register a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP
compared with a deficit of ½ percent of GDP initially envisaged under the 2004-06 program.
The new government remains committed to sustaining fiscal consolidation to entrench
macroeconomic stability, while boosting infrastructure and social spending to decisively reduce
poverty, as well as advancing other reforms to enhance medium-term growth prospects. To
support their policies for 2007–08, the authorities have requested a new 25-month Stand-by
arrangement, which they intend to treat as precautionary.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Peruvian authorities’ commitment to sound economic
policies and structural reforms, which has contributed to high rates of economic growth, low
inflation, and declining external vulnerabilities. The favorable external environment, particularly
high commodity prices, has also helped drive exports and Peru’s longest economic expansion
on record.
At the same time, Directors noted that major challenges remain, including the high rate of
poverty, regional income disparities, and the still-high dollarization of the economy. These call
for further efforts to strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework, address social and
infrastructure needs, and promote structural reforms.
Directors underscored the critical importance of decisively tackling high poverty levels, to
strengthen social cohesion and ensure the sustainability of economic policies. They welcomed

3
the creation of a high-level committee to develop a strategy to combat poverty, and called for
more effective targeting of social assistance programs.
Directors underscored the crucial role of fiscal policy, and supported the authorities’ intention to
continue saving part of central government revenue that exceeds the budgeted amount, as part
of the strategy to contain demand pressures, accelerate the pace of public debt reduction, and
achieve investment grade status for Peru. Directors supported the steps being taken to improve
tax policy and administration, including reducing tax exemptions and simplifying the tax regime
to broaden the tax base. They welcomed plans to introduce performance-based budgeting and
improve public financial management, and the emphasis on increased spending on
infrastructure and social assistance programs without compromising the fiscal consolidation
goals.
Directors stressed that fiscal decentralization should be implemented cautiously to minimize
risks to public finances. In this regard, the administrative and technical capacity of subnational
governments needs to be strengthened, and shared expenditure responsibilities clearly
specified. In decentralizing the National System of Public Investment, close coordination with
subnational governments would help ensure selection of high-quality investment projects,
especially in light of the envisaged sizable increase in capital spending.
Directors underscored the importance of establishing a legal framework for public-private
partnerships (PPPs), to provide clear guidelines for project selection and conflict resolution.
They stressed that the issuance of new securities associated with PPP projects should be
monitored closely to minimize future fiscal commitments and risks, and that all public sector
obligations associated with PPPs should be clearly recorded.
While Directors felt that the current exchange rate system has served Peru well, a number of
Directors encouraged the authorities to manage the exchange rate more flexibly. They
considered that this would help economic agents better internalize currency risks and provide
more incentives for hedging, thus assisting to reduce dollarization and develop domestic capital
markets. Other Directors stressed that any increased flexibility should be introduced gradually,
given the risks that depreciation poses for sectoral balance sheets and the external debt in a
highly dollarized economy like Peru.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of Peru’s financial system in recent years. They
commended the progress made in identifying foreign exchange-related credit risks in the
banking system, and encouraged the authorities to implement their reform agenda aimed at
reducing the risks from dollarization. The proposed changes to the MiVivienda mortgage lending
program would aim at discouraging mortgage lending in foreign currency to unhedged
borrowers. These efforts, along with plans to strengthen the payments system and the
regulatory framework would help lessen vulnerabilities. Directors welcomed reforms being
implemented to deepen the domestic capital market.

4
Directors were encouraged by the progress made in improving Peru’s business environment,
but stressed that much more needs to be done. In particular, they urged the authorities to take
steps to reduce the high level of informality in the labor market, including the reduction of high
severance payments, the better alignment of non-wage benefits with job tenure, and the
removal of other legal restrictions that prevent dismissals. Directors also commended Peru’s
growing integration into the global economy.
The proposed stand-by arrangement is expected to provide a welcome policy anchor for the
new authorities. Several Directors also noted that continued strong implementation of policies
and improvement in economic performance should lay the basis for Peru’s eventual exit from
the use of Fund resources.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$258 Million Stand-By Arrangement for Peru
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 25-month
SDR 172.4 million (about US$257.7 million) Stand-By Arrangement for Peru to support the
country's economic program. The Peruvian authorities have indicated their intention to treat the
arrangement as precautionary.
The main objectives of the Fund-supported program are to consolidate macroeconomic stability,
tackle high poverty levels, strengthen the resilience and depth of the financial system, and press
ahead with growth-enhancing reforms.
Following the Executive Board discussion, Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:
“Over the past several years, Peru has implemented sound economic policies which, in the
context of a favorable external environment, have resulted in the longest economic expansion on
record, low inflation, a robust external position, and declining vulnerabilities. The new
authorities are taking measures to further improve this excellent performance during 2007-08.
“At the same time, Peru still faces important challenges. Half of the population lives in poverty,
and structural weaknesses continue to constrain growth. To address these challenges, the
authorities’ program for 2007-08 aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability and
implementing reforms to boost growth prospects, while tackling high poverty. To support the
program, the authorities have requested a successor 25-month Stand-By Arrangement.
“Fiscal prudence remains the backbone of the authorities’ program. Following a strong surplus in
2006, the public sector result in 2007-08 is expected to remain below the deficit ceiling set out in
the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law. This will help ensure that pressing social and
infrastructure needs are addressed while the public-debt-to-GDP ratio remains on a downward
path.
“Monetary policy continues to be guided by the inflation targeting framework, aimed at keeping
inflation within the 1½-3½ percent official range. The authorities intend to gradually introduce
more flexibility in exchange rate management in order to further enhance the credibility of the
inflation targeting framework, help economic agents better internalize currency risks, and

provide more incentives for hedging. This will reduce dollarization and help develop the
domestic capital market.
“Structural reforms remain an important building block of the authorities’ program. Reforms will
aim, inter alia, at strengthening the effectiveness of the tax system, improving the quality of
public spending, and providing a legal framework for public-private partnerships. The
effectiveness of social assistance programs is to be enhanced in the context of a comprehensive
anti-poverty strategy. Decentralization would proceed in a manner consistent with the
implementation of high-quality investment projects under the auspices of the National System of
Public Investment and with sound public finances. Other reforms will aim at reducing risks
associated with financial dollarization, strengthening the financial regulatory framework,
improving the business environment, reducing the size of the informal labor market, and
sustaining trade liberalization,” Mr. Portugal said.

ANNEX
Recent Developments
Supported by a favorable external environment, the Peruvian economy has continued to expand
at a rapid pace during 2006, with inflation well contained and an improved external position.
During January-November 2006, real GDP grew by 7½ percent year-on-year, propelled by a
sharp increase in the terms of trade and strong domestic demand, which has been underpinned by
growing investment as well as higher incomes and rising employment. After peaking at 2.9
percent in April, 12–month inflation abated to around 1.1 percent in December 2006. Strong
export performance, including for nontraditional exports, has boosted the current account
surplus, while net international reserves have reached US$17.3 billion at end-2006, about 150
percent of foreign currency deposits at commercial banks.
Fiscal policy has continued to strengthen, and the combined public sector is estimated to have
recorded a surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP in 2006. On the back of buoyant revenues,
expenditure growth has been strong, estimated to have risen by 9 percent in real terms. Public
sector debt is estimated to have declined to 31½ percent of GDP by end-2006, about
15 percentage points below its 2002 levels.
Notwithstanding this strong economic performance, the challenges faced by Peru are significant
and pressing. Half the population lives in poverty and structural weaknesses need to be addressed
to lower underemployment and continue to boost employment creation in the formal sector, as
well as economic growth, while reducing poverty decisively. To achieve these objectives,
maintaining an environment favorable to foreign direct investment and trade openness will be
critical to growth prospects in the mining sector and to help diversify the productive structure
toward nontraditional labor-intensive sectors. Enhancing the provision and quality of services to
the poorest areas of the country would be fundamental to tackle poverty decisively, while more
flexible labor regulations would help absorb a growing labor force into the formal sector and
strengthen anti-poverty efforts.
Program Summary
The 2007–08 program is based on the policies needed to address Peru’s key challenges and aims
at consolidating macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty swiftly, strengthening the resilience
and depth of the financial system, and advancing other reforms to enhance the business
environment.
The most important objectives of the authorities’ new program are:
Consolidation of macroeconomic stability. Fiscal targets for 2007–08 are well within the
1 percent of GDP deficit ceiling in the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law, helping
entrench macroeconomic stability and keep the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path.
The government intends to adopt measures to lower distortionary taxes and exemptions and to

-4-

improve the quality of public spending. Greater exchange rate flexibility will solidify the
credibility of the inflation targeting framework.
Tackling high poverty. An action plan to strengthen current efforts at poverty alleviation will be
elaborated, mainly to enhance the effectiveness and scope of social assistance programs, as these
programs are numerous and to ensure that the resources reach the targeted population.
Strengthening and deepening the financial system. Reducing dollarization, particularly of
mortgage loans is a critical objective, as this will help to fortify the resilience of the banking
system. These efforts will be assisted by measures to allow for a better internalization of risks
and to further develop domestic capital markets.
Growth-enhancing reforms. Reforms will focus on continuing to improve the business
environment, including by simplifying regulatory requirements and extending commercial courts
nationwide. Efforts will also be made to enhance labor market flexibility and to further liberalize
external trade, critical for boosting competitiveness. In late December, the authorities lowered
average import tariff rates from 10.1 percent to 8.3 percent, effective January 1, 2007.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Executive Director for Peru
January 26, 2007

1.
Over the last years Peru has posted solid growth, responsible fiscal and monetary
policies have been implemented, external and financial vulnerabilities have diminished
considerably, and progress has been made in structural reform. Nevertheless, the authorities
that took office in July 2006 are not complacent and recognize the need to lay firmer
foundations for sustained medium-term growth and, crucially, reduce the still high poverty
level by ensuring a more equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. They intend to
make a decisive contribution to meeting these challenges by putting in place a set of
wide-ranging policies aimed at locking-in macroeconomic stability and deepening the reform
process —mainly enhancing the country’s physical and human capital, promoting
employment, improving the business climate, and further limiting financial vulnerabilities.
2.
From past experience with Fund-supported arrangements, the authorities
acknowledge the value of close collaboration with the Fund in resolving the problems facing
the nation. In particular, they attach great importance to the sound advice provided by the
staff, to whom they explicitly express their recognition, and believe that the greater
credibility associated with Fund endorsement will facilitate their goal of achieving
investment grade status. In view of these considerations, they request a Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA), covering the period through end-February 2009, in support of their
policy agenda. The government intends to treat the requested arrangement as precautionary,
keeping the Fund’s financial exposure in Peru at a minimum —currently only 2.1 percent of
quota.
Macroeconomic Policies
3.
The Peruvian economy continues to show robust growth supported by a sound
macroeconomic framework and a favorable international environment. Preliminary estimates
suggest that GDP growth in 2006 was 7.5 percent, well above initial expectations. The
economy experiences persistent growth —its longest expansion on record. This growth was
achieved despite electoral uncertainties and after four years of annual expansion of more than
5 percent. In 2006, private investment and consumption were the main engines of growth,
reflecting high market confidence. Export growth —roughly 35 percent in dollar terms—
was underpinned by favorable commodity prices and by a continuous expansion in the
volume of industrial exports, mainly textiles and agricultural goods. The external position has
improved as well: at end-2006 the level of reserves reached 3.8 times short-term debt
(residual basis) and around 100 percent of foreign currency-denominated deposits in the
banking system. Meanwhile, sovereign spreads hit historic lows. Although the outlook for
2007 is one of soft deceleration, in line with expectations of a cooling-down of the global

2
economy, macroeconomic policies and structural reforms will aim at sustaining growth and
stability.
4.

On the fiscal front:
•

The authorities will further strengthen debt sustainability, with public debt falling to
almost 30 percent of GDP by end-2008 —from around 32 percent at end-2006 and
37½ percent at end-2005. They will continue to increase the share of local currency
instruments to reduce exchange rate risks and extend the maturity of new placements
abroad.

•

The overall public sector balance is foreseen to shift from a surplus of 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2006, the highest in decades, to deficits not to exceed 0.8 percent in 2007 and
0.7 percent in 2008, due significantly to urgent increases in social and infrastructure
spending. In particular, public investment would rise from around 3 percent of GDP
currently to 4.5 percent over the next five years. To reinforce this strategy, the
National System of Public Investment (SNIP), which has been instrumental in
ensuring the quality of public investment, will be decentralized.

•

To remain consistent with fiscal discipline, the authorities will strive to create fiscal
space by further improving tax collections and enhancing expenditure restraint,
quality, and focus. In this regard, recently the authorities were granted temporary
fiscal powers, which will facilitate their plans to enhance the efficiency and
transparency of the tax structure and end several tax exemptions. Also, performance
budgeting will be phased in; at least half of any excess central government revenue
over programmed amounts will be saved; sanctions for noncompliance will be
enforced under the Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL); and the
operations of subnational governments will be closely monitored.

5.
The inflation targeting scheme adopted in 2002 aims at a 2.5 percent medium-term
inflation target within a ±1 percent range, in the context of a floating exchange rate regime.
Interventions in the foreign exchange market are limited to those needed to confront
excessive exchange rate volatility or abrupt fluctuations, without an explicit or implicit
commitment to any given exchange rate level (the domestic currency has appreciated around
1.5 percent in the last three months). In 2006, to improve its accountability, the central bank
moved from a year-end basis to a rolling twelve-month inflation target, which was met until
November. Towards the end of the year, supply shocks with a one-off effect brought
twelve-month inflation below the target range, to 1.14 percent. Given the temporary nature of
these shocks, inflation would start to converge towards the target range by mid-2007, and
there is no reason so far to loosen the monetary stance. It should also be noted that core
inflation, which provides a better picture of the true inflation trend, was heading towards the
lower limit of the target range as of year-end, although it has been gradually increasing since
December 2005.

3

Poverty Reduction and Structural Reform
6.
The authorities aim at promoting rapid poverty alleviation and structural
transformation to achieve high, sustainable, and balanced growth. To better target social
expenditure, the Interministerial Committee for Social Affairs (CIAS) will present in March
2007 a plan for consolidating the existing social programs and optimizing their functioning.
Also, the significant resources generated through austerity measures and voluntary private
sector contributions will be applied to programs aimed at resolving the most pressing social
needs —mainly child malnutrition, access to clean water, and housing— and the cash
transfer program launched in 2005 will be expanded. Critically, social recognition of the role
of improved education standards in empowering the population is reflected in the strong
support given by the National Accord —a multiparty assembly for the discussion of matters
of national interest— to the government’s initiative to evaluate teachers and improve their
skills through continuous training.
7.
Peru’s infrastructure deficit continues to be an important bottleneck for industrial
growth and the development of the rural economy. To help resolve it, the authorities plan to
engage more actively in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). During 2007, the government
envisages to initiate PPPs for a total of US$3 billion, especially in the areas of ports,
highways, and sanitation. To keep these operations in line with transparency and
international best practice, a framework law —to be submitted to Congress by June 2007—
will propose guidelines for project selection and approval, reporting requirements, conflict
resolution, and adherence to accounting standards. Importantly, to ensure fiscal
sustainability, a limit has been established on the net present value of future payments, firm
and contingent, associated with PPPs.
8.
The authorities are placing heavy emphasis on private sector growth to ensure
sustained formal employment generation. In order to improve the business environment, they
will press ahead with administrative simplification for new businesses and exporters and,
after a successful pilot program in the capital, will establish commercial courts in several
other cities to expedite the resolution of business disputes. The fiscal regime will continue to
be consistent with attracting investment, notably into the important mining and hydrocarbon
sectors. In this regard, the authorities will not introduce measures that would result in the
unilateral cancellation or modification of tax stability contracts. At the same time, they will
aim at gradually reducing the persistently high number of informal jobs and developing a
more comprehensive social protection net.
9.
The authorities are engaged in pursuing regional and bilateral free-trade agreements
(FTAs). In particular, an FTA with the U.S. —currently pending ratification by the U.S.
Congress— would make permanent the special access to the U.S. market currently enjoyed
under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). The FTA with the

4
U.S. is expected to further encourage export growth and diversification, as well as accelerate
critical reforms that will attract investment into the country.
10.
Financial system indicators remain sound as a result of a consistent strengthening of
financial supervision and regulation. Going forward:
•

Measures to accelerate de-dollarization —including mortgage lending in domestic
currency under the state-sponsored housing program— will be complemented by
strengthened norms on loan classification, provisioning, and capital requirements to
face foreign currency credit risks.

•

Regarding the payments system, modified legislation will be introduced to entrust its
surveillance and regulation to the central bank, and to ensure the latter’s seniority as a
lender of last resort among creditors.

•

As part of the government’s strategy to promote small and medium-size enterprises,
public banks will operate as second tier institutions. To facilitate access to the
financial system in remote areas, Banco de la Nación —the government’s financial
agent— will enter into infrastructure agreements with selected financial institutions.
Also, it will continue to comply with a 25 percent annual growth limit on its
consumer lending operations.

•

The authorities will implement additional measures aimed at improving the financial
soundness and corporate governance of microfinance institutions and, recognizing the
importance of private pension funds in the economy, they will seek to enhance their
operating environment, including by gradually raising the limits on their investments
abroad.

11.
Finally, the authorities believe that the policies described in their Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are adequate for meeting the objectives of the
program, but stand ready to take any additional measures that may be needed for this
purpose. They commit to maintaining the usual close and proactive dialogue with the Fund.
