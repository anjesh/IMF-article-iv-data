EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mozambique’s macroeconomic performance during 2008 was strong. Real GDP growth
was 6.8 percent, 12-month inflation fell to 6.2 percent, U.S. dollar reserves rose, although
slipping to 4.4 months of imports, and private sector credit expanded 46 percent. The currency
appreciated 24 percent in real effective terms.
Mozambique met all the program quantitative ACs through end-December 2008. Net
credit to government fell by 2 percent of GDP, largely because of an advance disbursement
of 2009 World Bank budget support, but also because of strong domestic revenues. The BM
also comfortably met its targets for reserve money and net international reserves.
Implementation of the two end-March 2009 structural benchmarks has been modestly delayed.
The impact of the global turmoil on Mozambique has so far been contained, but there are
significant uncertainties. Mozambique is vulnerable because of its heavy reliance on
commodity exports and capital inflows. Although the banking sector is largely insulated, it is
vulnerable to credit risk from the economic slowdown and from high credit concentration.
Amid considerable uncertainties about the impact of the global turmoil, Mozambique’s
macroeconomic prospects for 2009 have weakened. Projected real GDP growth has been
reduced to 4.3 percent because of fewer exports and capital inflows. Inflation will remain
around 6 percent. Fiscal policy has been eased to maintain priority spending in the face of
lower domestic revenues. The program also incorporates a larger monetary expansion to limit
the crowding out of credit to the private sector. The external overall balance is expected to
deteriorate significantly and external reserves are expected to fall by more than
US$200 million to below 4 months of imports. The authorities are accordingly proposing
modifications to the end-June 2009 ACs.
Mozambique is making steady progress on implementing structural reforms. Measures
under the program are focused on strengthening macroeconomic policy implementation and
improving the business environment.
The policy discussions focused on ways to mitigate the adverse impact of the global
economic slowdown on Mozambique’s medium-term prospects. Growth over the past
decade has been supported by capital inflows and export growth that will be difficult to
sustain. The authorities and staff agreed that, if Mozambique’s growth momentum is to be
maintained, growth will need to be diversified and the government will need to accelerate its
reform agenda to improve the business environment, with particular attention to financial
sector reform and boosting competitiveness.
The authorities generally agreed with the staff’s assessment that the currency is
overvalued in real effective terms. Their commitment to pay closer attention to a broader
basket of currencies will help redress the overvaluation.
Staff recommend completion of the fourth PSI review and approval of the authorities’
request for a 12-month arrangement under the High-Access Component of the ESF with
access of 100 percent of quota (SDR 113.6 million).

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Background
1.
Mozambique has had a continuous record of strong macroeconomic performance
since the mid-1990s, and its performance compares well with other countries in the
region. Output growth over the past decade averaged almost 8 percent. Growth has been
sustained by investment financed by large aid and private capital inflows, mainly into the
natural resource sector, that together averaged about 24 percent of GDP. In recent years, these
flows contributed to an appreciation of the currency in real effective terms. Growth has also
been sustained by a strong trade sector—the share of merchandise exports in GDP more than
tripled, to nearly 30 percent of GDP, eliminating a trade deficit of about 30 percent of GDP.
However, even before the current global crisis, growth had been weakening, with growth
projections about 1 percentage point lower than in the past decade. Growth, however, has also
been unevenly distributed and, although the national poverty headcount fell from 69 percent
in 1997 to 54 percent in 2003, the 2007 assessment suggests that poverty may have increased
in recent years, particularly in rural areas—though this may have reflected the impact of
the 2005 drought and the surge in fuel and food prices in 2007–08.

2.
The previous Article IV consultation in 2007 focused on consolidating
macroeconomic stability and accelerating second-wave reforms to sustain broad-based
growth and further reduce poverty. Discussions included strengthening policy
implementation, the business environment, and management of the country’s natural
resources. The government has made significant strides in these areas: it has further
consolidated macroeconomic stability despite large external and natural domestic shocks; it
has implemented a wide range of measures to improve governance and to reduce the cost of
doing business, and has initiated steps to improve natural resource management (including a
request for adherence to the EITI and new fiscal laws for the sector).
B. Recent Developments
3.
Macroeconomic performance in 2008 was satisfactory. Real GDP rose 6.8 percent,
somewhat exceeding expectations and driven by investment spending supported by high
public and private capital inflows, which were equivalent in gross terms to about 23 percent of
GDP. Twelve-month inflation fell faster than expected, from a peak of 13 percent in
February 2008 to 3 percent in May 2009, mainly because of the sharp drop in international
import prices at the end of the year. This permitted the BM to reduce its policy interest rates in
February, pushing T-bill rates sharply down.
4.
Macroeconomic policy was generally implemented as envisaged (see MEFP
Tables 1 and 2).1 Mozambique met the three year-end quantitative ACs as well as the revised
framework projections established during the 3rd PSI review. The two structural benchmarks
for end-March 2009 are expected to be met in July (see MEFP ¶9 and ¶19).

1

The end-2008 framework projections for net credit to government and net international reserves were revised
during the 3rd PSI review, but the ACs remained unchanged from the 2nd review. The end-2008 AC for reserve
money was revised during the 3rd review.

5.
Fiscal policy implementation in 2008 exceeded expectations.2 The AC and the
revised projection for net credit to government were met comfortably. As expected, the budget
benefited from a large advance disbursement of World Bank 2009 budget support. In addition,
domestic revenues were higher and recurrent spending on goods and services were lower than
envisaged. Spending execution was strong and priority expenditures were 64 percent of total
expenditures. However, as in 2007, there was a significant shortfall in project aid
disbursements.
6.
The BM met its year-end AC for reserve money. This had been increased during the
rd
3 PSI review to accommodate the surge in international import prices. However, in the
outturn, lower inflation, good management of the seasonal year-end surge in currency demand,
and strong fiscal performance enabled the BM to contain reserve money growth in 2008 to
below 8 percent. The monetary program was successful in supporting expansion of credit to
the private sector, that increased 46 percent during 2008 to almost 19 percent of GDP and
64 percent of deposits. This partly reflected a large increase in foreign currency borrowing as
local businesses found it more difficult to access financing overseas (a ban on bank foreign
currency lending to unhedged borrowers mitigates exchange rate related credit risk).
7.
The external overall balance was in line with revised projections, and the yearend AC on net international reserves was met comfortably. The current account balance
was adversely affected by higher import expenditures because of higher international prices.
However, this was more than offset by high capital inflows, including higher aid
disbursements, so that gross external reserves increased about US$140 million (but fell to
4.4 months of imports) and the currency appreciated 24 percent in real effective terms.3
However, a significant portion of this was reversed in the first four months of 2009.

2

The fiscal framework was revised in mid-2008 to incorporate the advanced disbursement of World bank 2009
budget support and temporary measures to mitigate the social impact of higher fuel and food prices. The
government introduced an urban transportation subsidy in February 2008 and suspended fuel-related taxes until
2009 in July. It also launched its Food Production Action Plan. These measures were largely financed by
nonpriority spending cuts and additional World Bank budget support.

3

The BM estimates, using different weights, that the real effective exchange rate in 2008 increased 11 percent.

II. FACING THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE
A. The Impact of Global Turmoil
8.
The impact of the global financial crisis and economic slowdown on Mozambique
has so far been contained and limited to real sector channels, but there are significant
uncertainties. Mozambique’s economic prospects for 2009 have deteriorated: both its growth
and its external balance are likely to be adversely affected by lower exports and private capital
inflows than in 2008, and by a less optimistic outlook for project aid.
•

Export receipts are projected to decline about 30 percent from their 2008 level due to falling
global demand and commodity prices. World prices for aluminum, which accounts for nearly
half of total export receipts, have fallen by about 50 percent. Traditional exports are also
vulnerable to the weak global environment as well as to the appreciation of the currency in
real effective terms.

•

Private capital inflows, which have become increasingly important in Mozambique, are
contracting as some investors scale back or postpone investment projects because of weaker
global demand, depressed commodity prices, and tighter global credit constraints. Private
capital inflows are cautiously projected to fall about 40 percent from their 2008 level.

•

Donors have indicated that they will meet their aid commitments for 2009, especially for
program aid, but receipts are sensitive to the increased exchange rate volatility. Moreover,
project aid disbursements are already being delayed and may fall further short of
commitments as fiscal pressures mount in donor countries. Consequently, while aid flows are
expected to be higher in 2009 than in 2008, the magnitude of the scaling-up of aid has been
pulled back from what was previously projected.

•

Mozambique’s macroeconomic prospects are also likely to be adversely affected by the
spill-over effects of the projected economic contraction in South Africa.
Box 1. Mozambique: Impact of Lower Prices for Aluminum Exports
The aluminum smelter Mozal provides about half of Mozambique’s export receipts and 70 percent
of the manufacturing sector’s output. In 2008, despite all-time high aluminum prices, production fell
by 10 percent due to constraints on power supplied via the South Africa energy supplier ESKOM.
Mozal’s production and sales volumes in the first quarter of 2009 remained comparable with levels
in 2008, despite the plunge in global demand and prices for aluminum. The market for Mozal’s high
quality aluminum has suffered less from the global downturn than the rest of the aluminum market.
Moreover, the high fixed costs typical of the industry are conducive to smoothing output in response
to short-term fluctuations in market conditions, and the parent company, BHP Billiton, has opted to
maintain Mozal’s production levels. Nevertheless, as sales receipts have plunged, Mozal has cut
operating costs substantially, especially spending on local expenditures and employment.

10
9.
A recent FSAP Update mission found that the exposure of Mozambique’s banking
sector to the turmoil in global financial system is limited (see Box 3). However, the sector is
vulnerable to credit risk arising from the economic slowdown and from high credit
concentration. In this context, reinforcing the loan classification rules is particularly important.
Staff and the authorities agreed that it would be important for the BM to more closely monitor
key financial indicators and improve cooperation with foreign supervisors.
10.
Against a backdrop of a highly uncertain global economic environment,
Mozambique’s macroeconomic prospects remain positive, but have weakened. Its growth
in 2009 could fall several percentage points below trend. In view of WEO projections for a slow
global recovery, growth is projected to strengthen in 2010, but will probably remain below
6 percent until 2011. Similarly, the external overall balance is projected to turn negative in
both 2009 and 2010; turning positive again in 2011 and stabilizing external reserves at about
3.4 months of imports. The authorities acknowledged the weakened growth prospects. They
noted that the growth projections are cautious and emphasized their intention to make every
effort to sustain growth. Staff agreed that Mozambique’s prudent macroeconomic policies in
recent years will help the country weather the global turmoil.
B. Rebalancing Policies
11.
The government is committed to its medium-term development strategy.4 Under the
strategy and the PSI-supported program, fiscal policy has avoided domestic financing to make
room for private sector credit and monetary policy has been geared to reducing inflation to
5-6 percent in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime and an external reserve target of
4-5 months of imports.5
12.
The authorities and staff agreed that the overall macroeconomic strategy remains
appropriate, but that the global turmoil warrants some rebalancing. In the near term, the
economic slowdown warrants a temporary easing of fiscal policy and the use of domestic budget
financing to maintain spending in the face of lower domestic revenues. Despite spending
pressures in the run-up to national elections in October, the authorities stated their intention to
adhere strictly to budgeted expenditures and to protect priority spending. The low public
domestic debt (8 percent of GDP) and interest costs (about 0.3 percent of GDP) provide the
fiscal space for additional domestic financing. Under the medium-term strategy, this would be
subsequently repaid. The authorities and staff also acknowledged the scope for easing monetary
policy to accommodate higher domestic budget financing and to limit the crowding out of private
sector credit.

4

As outlined in the Action Plan for Reducing Absolute Poverty (PARPA), the Mozambican Poverty Reduction
Strategy for 2005–09.

5

The Fund’s 2008 Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) classified the
exchange arrangement in Mozambique as “managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate,”
while the revised classification methodology (effective February 1, 2009) characterizes it as floating.

11
13.
The weaker prospects for the global economy may also require a rebalancing in the
medium term to sustain Mozambique’s growth momentum. Mozambique’s weakened growth
prospects will exert pressure on the authorities to maintain eased macroeconomic policies
in 2010, including domestic budget financing, before restoring their medium-term
macroeconomic strategy in 2011 and beyond. However, in view of the WEO projections for a
slow global recovery, the time frame for restoring Mozambique’s high levels of private capital
inflows and export growth and the risks to the projected scaling-up of aid will pose challenges
for the authorities’ ambitious growth objectives.

C. Sustaining Momentum for Growth
14.
To sustain momentum for growth, the authorities and staff agreed on the need to
further consolidate macroeconomic stability and to continue attracting capital inflows.
However, it was also recognized that the sources of growth need to be diversified and that
traditional exports and domestic sectors, especially agriculture, need to play a larger part. To this
end, the authorities are committed to sustaining and, to the extent possible, accelerating the
reform agenda to improve the business environment, with particular attention to Mozambique’s
competitiveness, encouraging domestic as well as foreign investment, and strengthening
financial intermediation. They also intend to enhance the reforms introduced in 2008 to boost
agriculture in response to the rise in world food prices. They are therefore revising the current
development strategy that expires this year. The revised strategy will place greater emphasis on
rural development (especially agriculture), the tourism sector, and building a skilled labor force.
Boosting competitiveness
15.
Boosting Mozambique’s competitiveness is a major priority. The currency
appreciated by 24 percent in real effective terms in 2008. That appreciation reflected heightened
volatility in exchange rates for the major currencies and sales by the BM, which had the effect of
stabilizing the exchange rate versus the US dollar, thus leading to a marked appreciation against
South Africa, Mozambique’s principal regional trading partner. Staff estimates (see Box 2),
while subject to considerable uncertainty, indicate a significant overvaluation. However, the
currency depreciated about 6 percent against the US dollar during the first four months of 2009,
reversing about a third of the real appreciation in 2008. The authorities generally agreed with the
staff’s assessment.

Most of Mozambique’s exports (aluminum, electricity, and gas) are relatively
insensitive to the exchange rate. However, traditional export products, which account for
30 percent of merchandise export receipts, are more susceptible, and their export volumes have
fallen 20 percent over the past two years. As a result, the improvement in the merchandise trade
balance in the first half of the decade has been reversed since 2005. The authorities agreed with
staff on the need to pay closer attention to a broader basket of currencies that is more reflective
of Mozambique’s trading patterns. This is expected to help reduce the currency’s overvaluation.
Box 2. Mozambique: Exchange Rate Assessment
An exchange rate assessment indicates that the
Metical is significantly overvalued in real
effective terms. These estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty because of data
limitations and deep structural changes in the
Mozambican economy.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach
indicates an overvaluation of 26 percent.
Under this approach, the current account
deficit norm (4 percent of GDP) is
substantially below its underlying level
(8 percent of GDP).
The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER)
approach indicates an overvaluation of
41 percent. During 2008, the Metical
appreciated 24 percent in real effective terms
while the terms of trade deteriorated
substantially and are projected to improve
only modestly over the medium run. This
contributes to a large gap between the
projected real effective exchange rate and its
estimated medium-term equilibrium value.

13
Encouraging investment
17.
Reducing the costs of doing business in Mozambique is essential to encourage
domestic and foreign investment and improve competitiveness. Recent surveys continue to
identify limited access to credit, poor infrastructure, burdensome regulations, and a shortage of
skilled labor as impediments to business activity. Staff stressed growing private sector concerns
over labor market restrictions. The government has a reform strategy in place, but progress in
relation to Mozambique’s main trading partners has been slow. The authorities recognize that
this area requires continued emphasis.
18.
Mozambique’s natural resources have attracted significant foreign private capital.
The country will need to accelerate its agenda to improve public management of these resources
to encourage further capital inflows and ensure that the benefits pass to the rest of the economy.
The authorities and staff agreed that it would be important to implement rigorously the recently
approved fiscal regime for megaprojects and for Mozambique to adhere to and implement the
principles of the EITI as quickly as possible. Moreover, the global turmoil has highlighted the
need to reinforce the authorities’ capacity to monitor and assess the budgetary and
macroeconomic implications of megaprojects.
Strengthening financial intermediation
19.
Weak financial intermediation and access to credit are a major impediment to
private sector development (see Box 3). The vast majority of Mozambicans are still not served
by registered financial institutions and deposit and credit ratios relative to GDP are low. The key
ratios improved in 2008 and at the end of 2008, broad money reached 34 percent of GDP, credit
to the private sector reached about 19 percent of GDP and about 56 percent of broad money.
These ratios are well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.6
20.
The country’s poor performance on access and outreach indicators can be
attributed to economy-wide structural impediments and the lack of competition in the banking
sector. Improving financial intermediation is a long, slow and incremental process. In addition to
their commitment to further macroeconomic consolidation, the authorities have a structural
reform agenda in place to support financial deepening. However, improving financial
intermediation is a long, slow and incremental process. In this context, the authorities agreed that
moving quickly on the findings of the FSAP Update would help strengthen Mozambique’s
financial sector.

6

The ratios are more broadly aligned to the regional averages, excluding South Africa and Nigeria.

14

Box 3. Mozambique: FSAP Update
The recent FSAP Update mission in February 2009 found that Mozambique has
made significant progress toward developing and strengthening the financial sector
and improving central bank operations since the 2003 FSAP. Most of the 2003
recommendations have been implemented. The authorities strengthened bank supervisory
powers; introduced International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for banks; and laid
the foundations for risk-based supervision. Bank soundness was improved by restructuring
of problem banks and cleaning up of balance sheets. Enhanced communication and
increasing use of market instruments have improved monetary and exchange rate policy
implementation, and the level and volatility of real interest rates have declined.
However, the FSAP Update also found limited progress in financial deepening. The
vast majority of Mozambicans are still not served by registered financial institutions and
deposit and credit ratios relative to GDP are low in both absolute terms and in comparison
to similar countries. The poor performance on access and outreach indicators can be
attributed to two sets of factors. First, there are economy-wide, structural impediments to
financial intermediation that limit the number of credit-worthy clients or increase the costs
and risks of offering financial services. Second, lack of competition in the banking sector,
high bank overhead costs and interest spreads, and high bank commissions and fees push
up borrowing costs. Improving financial intermediation is a long, slow and incremental
process
The FSAP Update also found that the banking sector’s exposure to global financial
turmoil is limited because the sector is not highly integrated into global financial markets,
which means direct contagion risks are few. The only possible exception is the risk arising
from the high concentration of subsidiaries’ foreign assets in correspondent accounts with
their parent banks: in case of major difficulties for the parents, these assets could be
impaired. Given the strength of parent banks, however, this risk is very limited. The major
source of risk in the system is credit risk arising from the economic slowdown and the
relatively high concentration of loan portfolios in a few sectors.
The FSAP Update made recommendations concerning access to finance; banking
supervision; money, debt markets and liquidity management; the non-bank financial sector
(pension and insurance); and the payments system. It also made recommendations for
responses to the global financial crisis to strengthen risk monitoring, home-host
cooperation on banking supervision, and crisis management arrangements.
The BM is committed to moving ahead on the findings of the FSAP Update. It will
assess and finalize an action plan to implement the FSAP recommendations and, by endDecember 2009, form a task force to monitor implementation. Meanwhile, in line with
these recommendations, the BM will issue new regulations to redefine the loan
classification rules (end-September 2009 structural benchmark). It is preparing
improvements in its remedial action framework for banks in difficulty and is strengthening
its crisis preparedness and contingency planning.

15
III. PROGRAM FOR 2009
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
21.
Mozambique’s macroeconomic prospects for 2009 remain positive, but have
weakened because of the global economic slowdown. Projected real GDP growth has been
cautiously reduced to 4.3 percent, down from 6.8 percent in 2008 and more than 3 percentage
points below the average for the past decade. Inflation at the end of 2009 is expected to
remain around 6 percent because of modest increases in international fuel and food prices
and the recent currency depreciation.
Easing fiscal policy
22.
The fiscal program for 2009 has been revised: the government now expects to
incur domestic financing of about 1.8 percent of GDP, about 1.1 percent of GDP higher
than previously envisaged. Most of the increase arises from the adverse impact of the global
economic crisis on domestic revenues, which are expected to be about 0.8 percent of GDP
lower than envisaged. As a result, despite the reinstatement of fuel-related taxes suspended in
the second half of 2008 and the continued increase in the domestic revenue effort of about
0.5 percent of GDP, the domestic revenue share of GDP is expected to be lower in 2009 than
in 2008. In other respects, the fiscal program for 2009 is largely as previously envisaged.
Domestically-financed spending will remain within budget allocations, though spending
relative to a lower GDP will now be higher than intended. In line with shortfalls in 2007
and 2008 and with delays already observed in early 2009, the outlook for project aid is now
less optimistic than envisaged.
Monetary policy accommodates
23.
Monetary policy will remain geared towards keeping inflation low, with reserve
money as the operational target. The BM is committed to a floating exchange rate, while
monitoring a broad currency basket that reflects Mozambique’s trading patterns to guide
reserve sales to the market. Reserve money growth for 2009 has been increased to
12.5 percent to partially accommodate the expansion in domestic budget financing and to
limit the crowding out of private sector credit. Any resulting inflationary pressures are likely
to be manageable as inflation is already low and external inflationary pressures appear weak.
The monetary program makes room for private sector credit to expand nearly 30 percent.
The external balance deteriorates
24.
The external shock will cause the balance of payments to deteriorate. The overall
balance of payments in 2009 is projected to deteriorate by US$382 million compared to 2008
as the trade deficit widens, foreign direct investment contracts, and foreign borrowing by the
private sector is curtailed. As a result, gross international reserves are expected to fall by
US$221 million in 2009 to 3.9 months of imports—well below the average of the past decade

16
and below the BM’s medium-term objective of 4 to 5 months import cover. Mitigating
factors include much lower projected fuel imports and dividend payments by megaprojects.
A projected decline in exports of US$777 million primarily reflects a 53 percent fall in the
price of aluminum. It also reflects a reduction in trading partner demand for traditional
exports and service receipts from tourism and remittances. Foreign direct investment is
projected to fall US$67 million, and foreign borrowing by the private sector to fall
US$37 million.
B. Structural Policies
25.
The government is making steady progress on the structural reform agenda
detailed in the MEFP. In improving macroeconomic policy operations, the government is
bolstering its domestic revenue effort and public financial management. It is also reforming
the civil service salary and pension policy and the social security system. The BM is
strengthening its monetary policy framework and adapting monetary policy to better reflect
the determinants of price stability. As noted, it is also committed to moving ahead on the
findings of the FSAP Update.
26.
Improving the business environment is a priority. With the help of development
partners, the government is implementing reforms to support private sector development,
natural resource management, and public sector governance. The EITI Board approved
Mozambique as a candidate for adherence to the EITI on May 18, 2009. Initiatives are
underway to improve public sector governance, and the government is working on a public
enterprise law, a public-private partnership law, and a decentralization strategy.
27.
The recently approved new foreign exchange law liberalizes current account
transactions. In the course of 2009, the government expects to officially inform the Fund of
its acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement.
IV. REQUEST FOR ESF ACCESS
28.
The scope for supportive macroeconomic policies to offset the impact of the
global economic slowdown is curtailed by the large projected decline in external
reserves. Staff estimate that most of the deterioration in the external overall balance is the
direct result of the external shock; the fiscal expansion is estimated to account for only about
US$42 million of the reserve loss in 2009 through higher import demand.7 The authorities
view maintaining reserves at 4-5 months of imports to be desirable given Mozambique’s high
exposure to potentially volatile private capital and income flows, and its high degree of
dollarization. Maintaining reserve coverage in 2009 at 4.5 months of imports would imply a
7

This estimate assumes a fiscal multiplier of 0.5 for tax measures and a unit income elasticity of
nonmegaproject import demand.

17
balance of payments need of about US$210 million. As the risks surrounding the balance of
payments projection are skewed downwards, bolstering reserves will provide the necessary
room for maneuver should the downside materialize.

29.
Staff believe that Mozambique is eligible for a one-year ESF arrangement with
access of 100 percent of quota (SDR 113.6 million) to be made available in three drawings
following completion of the fourth, fifth and sixth PSI reviews. In staff’s assessment,
Mozambique faces balance of payments difficulties caused primarily by a sudden and
exogenous shock. Moreover, the shock is expected to be temporary, as the overall balance is
projected to revert to a surplus in 2011. Access to the ESF would provide timely coverage of
about two-thirds of the direct balance of payments impact of the external shock or a
somewhat larger portion of the balance of payments need. Moreover, the use of Fund
resources should catalyze support from donors that are considering stepping up their
assistance, notably the World Bank. In staff’s view, the relatively high access is also justified
by Mozambique’s strong track record under the PSI arrangement and by the authorities’
continued commitment to sound policies. The government is committed to a safeguards
assessment to be completed by the time of the first review under the ESF arrangement.
V. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND
30.
Mozambique’s risk of debt distress remains low, though its public debt
sustainability ratios will deteriorate (see Appendix II). The larger part of Mozambique’s
public debt is external debt. External debt and debt service are projected to rise relative to
GDP, exports and revenues during 2009 and beyond mostly because of lower nominal GDP,
export receipts, and revenues measured in US dollars. The use of Fund resources will have

18
only a modest impact on the ratios and the debt indicators will continue to remain well below
their thresholds. In staff’s view, Mozambique has adequate capacity to repay the Fund.
VI. PROGRAM RISKS AND MONITORING
31.
The major program risks arise from the considerable uncertainties surrounding
the impact of the global financial turmoil and economic slowdown. There are large risks
surrounding the impact on exports and foreign capital inflows, and domestic fiscal pressures
may oblige donors to revisit their aid commitments. The BM will need to be vigilant for risks
in the financial sector, though these currently appear to be contained. On the domestic front,
the government will need to resist unrealistic spending pressures during an election year.
32.
The revised program modifies the three quantitative assessment criteria for endJune 2009. ACs for end-December 2009 are proposed in Table 1 of the MEFP. Structural
benchmarks are shown in Table 2 of the MEFP. The end-June and end-December 2009 ACs,
as well as the continuous ACs, will also be performance criteria under the ESF arrangement.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Mozambique’s macroeconomic performance during 2008 has continued to be
strong. Real GDP growth was resilient to challenges from the external environment and
inflation has fallen faster than expected. All the quantitative assessment criteria through endDecember 2008 were met. Staff support the authorities’ proposed modifications of the endJune 2009 assessment criteria.
34.
The government has demonstrated its ability to mitigate the impact of internal
and external shocks with flexible policy responses. The government reacted in an effective
and timely manner to higher fuel and food import prices in 2008 with an appropriate mix of
fiscal and monetary responses.
35.
Macroeconomic prospects have now been weakened by the global economic
slowdown and there remain many uncertainties and risks. Growth is expected to slow
markedly and there is expected to be a significant adverse impact on the balance of payments
and on reserves. The authorities will need to monitor international and domestic
developments closely and stand ready to respond if necessary. Their readiness to consult
closely with Fund staff on possible measures is welcome. Staff believe that the authorities’
request for access to the ESF is justified and appropriate.
36.
Staff agree with the authorities’ strategy of easing fiscal and monetary policy in
the near term. Staff also agree that the easing should be seen in the context of
Mozambique’s prudent medium-term macroeconomic strategy that remains broadly
appropriate. The authorities’ commitment to expenditure restraint during an election year is
particularly welcome.

19
37.
Mozambique’s medium-term macroeconomic prospects have been clouded by
the gloomy prospects for the global economy, especially in view of its heavy reliance on
exports and capital inflows. To the extent possible, it will be important to diversify the
sources of growth and to accelerate structural reforms to boost Mozambique’s
competitiveness, encourage investment, and improve financial intermediation. The
authorities’ commitment to moving ahead on the findings of the FSAP Update is welcome.
38.
The authorities recognize that the currency is significantly overvalued in real
effective terms. Their commitment to pay closer attention to a broader basket of currencies
will help redress the overvaluation.
39.
The authorities have continued to make noticeable progress in strengthening
macroeconomic policy implementation. Staff encourage their efforts to mobilize more
domestic revenue and improve public financial management. The steps being taken to
strengthen monetary policy formulation and implementation are also welcome. In the current
global financial crisis, effective banking supervision is particularly important.
40.
The authorities are making progress on other structural reforms to support
private sector development, better manage Mozambique’s natural resources, and improve
public sector governance. Rapid and tangible improvements in the business environment will
be essential for sustained high economic growth. The intention to adhere to the EITI is
encouraging, but it will be important to continue moving forward in this critical area.
41.
The staff welcome the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations under
Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
42.
Based on performance to date and Mozambique’s continued commitment to
program implementation, staff recommend the completion of the fourth PSI review,
and approval for Mozambique’s request for a one-year arrangement under the High
Access Component of the ESF.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

APPENDIX I.
REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE: LETTER OF INTENT
May 13, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The Government of Mozambique is implementing an economic and financial program
consistent with its medium-term Plano de Acção para a Redução da Pobreza Absoluta II
(PARPA II) and supported by the Fund under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). Program
implementation has progressed well, contributing to high and sustainable economic growth.
The Government seeks to consolidate these achievements and explore initiatives to further
promote growth and reduce poverty.
2.
Implementation of the PSI-supported program in the second half of 2008 has been
satisfactory. All quantitative assessment criteria (ACs) to end-December 2008 were met.
Implementation of the two structural benchmarks for end-March 2009—the approval of a PFM
vision paper and the issuance of a decree streamlining the business inspection process—was
delayed and both are now expected to be implemented by end-July 2009. On this basis, the
Government requests completion of the fourth review under the PSI-supported program.
3.
Macroeconomic performance during 2008 was good despite pressures from high fuel
and food prices in mid-2008 and the onset of the global economic crisis in late 2008. As in its
response to the surge in international prices, the Government intends to respond to the current
global economic crisis in a timely and appropriate manner, in consultation with Fund staff.
4.
To mitigate the adverse impact of the global economic crisis, the Government will ease
fiscal and monetary policies during 2009. However, the scope for supportive policies is
constrained by a large projected drop in external reserves resulting directly from the sudden
deterioration in the external environment. Indeed, export receipts had started to decline by
late 2008 and both public and private capital inflows are now projected to fall in 2009.
5.
Against this background, the Government of Mozambique requests access to the
Fund’s Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF). The Government requests access of 100 percent of
quota, or SDR 113.6 million, to be disbursed in thee tranches following completion of the
fourth, fifth and sixth reviews under the PSI. In accordance with Fund's policies, the
Government is committed to a safeguards assessment to be completed by the time of the first
review under the ESF arrangement.

35
6.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies reviews program
implementation during the second half of 2008 and outlines the Government’s policies for the
remainder of 2009.
7.
The Government of Mozambique is confident that the policies set forth in the attached
MEFP are adequate to consolidate macroeconomic stability and sustain strong broad-based
growth through a second wave of reforms towards the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. The Government will regularly update the Fund on developments in its
economic and financial policies, and provide the data needed for the monitoring of the
program. In addition, the Government will consult regularly with the Fund on any relevant
developments at the initiative of the Government or the Fund, including for the adoption of
new measures, and revisions to the policies described in the MEFP, and provide the Fund with
the information it requests for monitoring progress during program implementation.
8.
Under the program, the Government has agreed with IMF staff on quantitative ACs
and benchmarks for 2009. The Government anticipates that the fifth review, on the basis of
program performance to end-June 2009, will be conducted by end-December 2009 and that the
sixth review, on the basis of program performance to end-December 2009, will be conducted
by end-June 2010. The Government’s policies under the program for 2009 are summarized in
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The technical
memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the terms and conditions of the policies. The
end-June and end-December 2009 ACs, as well as the continuous ACs, will also be
performance criteria under the ESF arrangement. Reviews under the ESF arrangement will
take place at semi-annual intervals on the occasion of the fifth and sixth PSI reviews.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Manuel Chang
Minister of Finance

ATTACHMENT I
REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES OF
THE GOVERNMENT OF MOZAMBIQUE FOR THE FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE PSI, AND THE
REQUEST FOR ACCESS UNDER THE EXOGENOUS SHOCK FACILITY
May 13, 2009
1.
This MEFP reviews performance under the PSI-supported program through end-2008
and outlines the Government’s policies for 2009. The Government of Mozambique is
committed to its medium-term macroeconomic strategy of prudent macroeconomic policies
and second-generation structural reforms to sustain economic growth and poverty reduction. In
the near term, the Government is ready to ease macroeconomic policies to help mitigate the
impact of the global economic crisis.
I. Program Implementation In 2008
A. Background
2.
Mozambique’s macroeconomic performance through 2008 remained strong, despite
challenges from the mid-year surge in international fuel and food prices, disruptions to
electricity transmission, and the onset of the global economic crisis at the end of the year. The
economy expanded by 6.8 percent in 2008, somewhat more than anticipated because of
stronger output in transport and communication, mining, and agriculture. Inflation fell faster
than expected, from 13 percent in February 2008 to 6.2 percent in December 2008 and
4.4 percent in April 2009, mainly because of the sharp drop in international import prices at
the end of the year. As expected, the current account balance in 2008 was adversely affected
by higher import expenditures on account of higher international prices. However, this was
more than offset by high private capital inflows so that gross external reserves increased about
US$140 million during the year and the real effective exchange rate increased 11 percent.
B. Fiscal Sector and Public Financial Management
3.
The Government’s fiscal strategy in 2008 was in line with its medium-term strategy to
limit domestic financing to make room for private sector credit. Budget implementation during
the year encountered challenges arising from the sharp increase in fuel and food prices.
4.
The Government’s fiscal plans were revised in July 2008 to incorporate measures to
mitigate the social impact of higher fuel and food prices. The Government had already
introduced an urban transportation subsidy earlier in the year. In the second half of the year,
the Government also suspended fuel-related taxes until 2009 and launched its Food Production
Action Plan, together costing 1.3 percent of GDP. These additional measures were largely
financed by reductions in nonpriority spending and additional World Bank budget support.
5.
Budget implementation in 2008 was strong. Domestic budget financing for the whole
year was 0.8 percent of GDP lower than envisaged under the revised fiscal framework. This

37
was because of higher domestic revenues (0.2 percent of GDP), mainly personal income tax
collections; lower recurrent spending mostly (0.3 percent of GDP), on goods and services; and
other tax revenues (0.3 percent). Spending execution was also strong and priority expenditures
were 64 percent of total expenditures. However, there was a substantial shortfall in reported
project aid of 4.0 percent of GDP.
6.
The Revenue Authority (Autoridade Tributária-AT) continued to improve tax
administration. It identified strategic reform areas for the year and approved the 2009-2010
Strategic Plan and the 2009 Tactical Plan. To facilitate planning, execution and control of its
operations, the AT also started to implement a performance indicator framework. Preparations
are under way to allow taxes to be paid through commercial banks by the end of 2009. The AT
registered more than 190,000 new tax payers in 2008, some 90 percent more than targeted and
contributing substantially to the strong revenue performance.
7.
The audit of the stock of post-2003 commercial VAT arrears, completed in July 2008
and covering 80 percent of total invoices, had identified MT 1.3 billion in arrears. The
Government is committed to clearing these arrears and the remaining unidentified arrears by
end of 2012, starting with a repayment of MT200 million in 2009. The process of reimbursing
VAT arrears has improved significantly for current claims and over 90 percent of these claims
are now addressed within the time-frame established by regulations.
8.
In the area of tax policy, Parliament approved the new Simplified Tax for the Small
Tax Payers (ISPC) and the revised Tax Benefits Code in December 2008. Regulations to
implement the ISPC were approved in March 2009. Parliament also approved the review of the
excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco (Imposto de Consumo Específico) in
January 2009, and these will become effective in January 2010.
9.
By March 2009, the e-Sistafe system had been rolled out to 320 state institutions,
including 26 autonomous institutions and 50 of the 128 districts. Preparations for the pilot of
the electronic revenue collection (e-Tax) were delayed to March 2009, because of financial
constraints, and will be completed by the end of 2010. The multi-currency treasury account
(CUT) became operational in mid-April for disbursing donor funds in US dollars, euros and
the South African rand. Salary payments are carried out through direct budget execution of eSistafe in 21 ministries and other 12 entities at the central level, amounting to 4 percent of all
salaries. The 2008 program budgeting pilot, covering five programs in five ministries, was
expanded to the entire 2009 budget and covers all ministries and government institutions. Due
to the breadth of the consultation process, the approval of the PFM vision paper by the
Ministry of Finance was delayed until July (structural benchmark for March 2009). The
Government will disseminate the 2007 annual report on public debt on the internet by June.
The 2008 public debt report is expected to be finalized and published by July 2009.
10.
In May 2009, the Government started implementing the first phase of the medium-term
civil service pay policy that was approved by the Council of Ministers in September 2008. The
cost is included in the budget and focus on decompressing salary bands. In October 2008, the

38
Government published the first statistical yearbook on civil servants, based on the census
taken in early 2008.
C. Monetary and Financial Sector
11.
Monetary policy in 2008 was geared towards price stability in the context of a floating
exchange rate regime. The BM met its end-year targets for reserve money and net international
reserves. The target for reserve money had been revised to accommodate the projected
increase in inflation because of the higher import prices. In the outturn, the BM was able to
contain reserve money growth in 2008 below 8 percent, partly because of the strong fiscal
performance on domestic financing. In addition, money demand conditions were weaker than
expected as import prices and inflation at the end of the year were lower than expected. Money
demand conditions were also weaker than anticipated because the BM and banks improved
their management of the seasonal surge in currency demand over the festive season.
12.
Net international reserves were in line with revised projections, meeting the program
target by an ample margin. As anticipated, the World Bank disbursed its budget support
for 2009 in late 2008. The BM increased its reserves sales in the second half of 2008 to meet
strong import demand pressures, especially for fuel imports. However, import pressures in
late 2008 exceeded expectations, putting pressure on banks’ own external reserves and also on
the exchange rate. After an extended period of stability during much of the year, the exchange
rate depreciated 4 percent versus the US dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008 and a further
6 percent in the first quarter of 2009.
13.
The monetary program in 2008 was successful in supporting the Government’s
objective of deepening financial intermediation. Broad money expanded by 20 percent in line
with expectations, thereby raising the share of broad money to GDP by one percentage point to
about 34 percent of GDP. The stronger-than expected fiscal performance as well as the largerthan-expected decline in the banking sector’s net foreign assets made room for a substantial
expansion in credit to the economy. This increased 46 percent during 2008 to
almost 19 percent of GDP.
14.
Lower inflation allowed the BM in February 2009 to reduce the interest rates on its
standing lending and deposit facilities. This subsequently led to a decline in the 3-month T-bill
rate by about 2 percentage points. The BM in February also reduced the commercial banks’
legal reserve requirement from 9 to 8.5 percent.
15.
The BM has continued to strengthen its monetary and exchange rate policy and
operations. To strengthen policy formulation, the BM has developed its core inflation
indicators (structural benchmark for December 2009) and is stepping up its monitoring,
analyzing and forecasting of macroeconomic and monetary indicators. To strengthen
operations, the BM introduced repos and reverse repos in 2007 and has increasingly used them
for market operations. Meticalnet, the money market interbank system, now accommodates
outright and repo operations among commercial banks. Strengthening liquidity forecasting and

39
management is central to improving monetary operations. It will become particularly
important with the passage of donor project aid through the Government’s multi-currency
treasury account (CUT) at the BM. To support liquidity management, the MF is now providing
cash flow projections to the BM on weekly basis and has also started providing projections
with a one-year horizon as these are updated. In other areas, the BM has revised the
regulations for commercial bank participation in the interbank money market and the
guidelines for conduct in the market.
16.
An IMF/WB Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission assessed the
financial sector in February 2009 and found that Mozambique has made significant
improvements following the 2003 FSAP. Mozambique had implemented a comprehensive
financial sector reform program that has resulted in notable improvements in regulation and
supervision. There has been a marked improvement in financial stability and soundness,
particularly capital adequacy and asset quality. Nonetheless, due to economy-wide structural
impediments to financial intermediation (poor physical access and infrastructure, weaknesses
in the legal framework, weak financial reporting, and problems with the credit and property
information infrastructure, etc), progress in deepening intermediation has been limited. The
global financial crisis has not affected the financial sector directly, but real sector linkages
increase credit risk going forward. The system as a whole, however, appears resilient due to
strong capital base, high liquidity, constraints on exposure to foreign currency risk by
unhedged borrowers, and capital controls. Mozambique has also made commendable progress
in improving its national payments system.
D. Other Structural Policies
17.
To strengthen the management and transparency of mineral resources and to maximize
their benefits for Mozambique, all new agreements in mining and petroleum and gas
concessions are following the fiscal regulations and agreements that were approved in 2007.
Furthermore, the Government submitted its request for Mozambique to become a candidate for
adherence to the EITI (structural benchmark for June 2009). The EITI Board approved
Mozambique’s candidacy on May 18, 2009.
18.
Mozambique continues its trade liberalization efforts. The SADC free trade area came
into effect in January 2008. In November 2008, Mozambique, together with other SADC
members, reached an interim Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU to retain
quota-and duty-free access to the EU on a reciprocal basis. Agreement on a final EPA is
expected by end-2009. Consistent with both this agreement and with the SADC free trade
agreement, Parliament approved a reduction of customs tariffs on imports from the EU and
SADC countries in December 2008.
19.
After extensive consultation, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted in
March 2009 a decree to streamline business inspections to the Economic Council. This is
expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers by July 2009 (end-March 2009 structural
benchmark). In April 2009, the Council of Ministers revoked the bank-deposit and minimum

40
capital requirements to start a business. To facilitate the start-up and operations of small and
medium enterprises, the Council of Ministers approved the creation of the SME Institute in
February 2009. Draft competition and insolvency laws were submitted to Parliament for its
approval.
20.
The Government has improved its capacity to produce and disseminate macroeconomic
statistics, especially at the INE and the MF. The INE has prepared a Statistical Strategic Plan
(2008-12). The MF is using e-SISTAFE to generate public finance statistics. However, the
public finance statistics are not yet in compliance with the 2001 GFS manual. In order to
monitor the impact of the global economic crisis, the Government is compiling
macroeconomic data and will start updating its macroeconomic framework on a higher
frequency basis. To improve the MF’s analytical and forecasting capacity, the MF has started
to compile and consolidate data on mega-projects, which will feed into the budget execution
reporting.
II. Program for 2009
A. Adapting Policies
21.
The Government recognizes that Mozambique’s macroeconomic prospects in 2009
have weakened because of the global economic crisis. The Government is nevertheless
committed to mitigate the adverse impact of the global crisis, without jeopardizing its
medium-term macroeconomic strategy.
22.
Against the backdrop of a highly uncertain global economic outlook, economic
prospects for 2009 have deteriorated, and GDP growth is now cautiously estimated to
4.3 percent from preliminary 6.8 percent for 2008. However, the Government intends to make
every possible effort to achieve a higher rate of growth. Aluminum and traditional exports
receipts are declining due to falling global demand and commodity prices. Project aid
disbursements are already being delayed and are expected to fall increasingly short of
commitments as fiscal pressures mount in donor countries. Private capital inflows—foreign
direct investment and foreign borrowing—which have played an increasingly important role in
supporting growth in Mozambique, are contracting as some investors scale back or postpone
investment projects in the face of weaker global demand conditions and tighter global credit
constraints.
23.
The external shock will deteriorate the balance of payments. Net international reserves
are projected to fall by over US$200 million in 2009 as the trade deficit widens, foreign direct
investment contracts, and foreign borrowing by the private sector is curtailed. As a result, the
overall balance of payments is projected to deteriorate by nearly US$400 million
between 2008 and 2009. Mitigating factors include a modest projected rise in aid inflows and
lower projected dividend payments by megaprojects. Export receipts are expected to fall about
US$800 million, primarily reflecting a halving in the price of aluminum, which accounted for
more than half of export receipts in 2008, and lower traditional exports such as cotton and

41
cashews. Private capital inflows—foreign direct investment and foreign borrowing—are
projected to fall by more than US$100 million.
24.
Notwithstanding this, the impact is expected to be mitigated for Mozambique on
account of its sustained period of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.
Moreover, Mozambique will continue to benefit from foreign capital inflows into natural
resource areas, especially energy, that remain profitable. In addition, Mozambique’s financial
sector is largely insulated from and well-positioned to withstand the global financial turmoil.
Furthermore, for 2010 the World Cup in South Africa will have favorable impact on the
energy and tourism sectors. The more vulnerable segments of the population are expected to
benefit from infrastructure investment in agriculture as well from the recent reduction in
international fuel and food prices.
25.
To mitigate the impact of the global economic slowdown, the Government will ease
macroeconomic fiscal and monetary policies during 2009. It will also maintain the momentum
of its structural reform agenda for growth, with a particular focus on strengthening the
business environment, especially to encourage new investments. Mindful of the risks from the
current crisis, the Government will closely monitor international developments and its impact
on the Mozambican economy.
26.
The Government’s scope for supportive macroeconomic policies is curtailed by the
large projected decline in external reserves in 2009. The Government estimates that most of
these declines are the direct and sudden result of the external shock. On this basis, the
Government is seeking access to Fund resources under the Exogenous Shock Facility that will
cover a portion of the direct balance of payments impact of the external shock.
B. Fiscal Sector
27.
The Government intends to ease fiscal policy to help the economy weather the global
economic slowdown. Mozambique’s weaker economic prospects will also deteriorate the
fiscal outlook, as revenues are expected to fall well short of previous program targets. The
Government will nevertheless maintain domestic spending levels as budgeted. As a result, the
Government’s domestic financing needs may increase. This is a temporary deviation from the
medium-term fiscal strategy as the Government remains committed to avoiding recourse to
domestic financing to provide room for private sector credit.
28.
Revenues in 2009 are projected to decline by 1.1 percent of GDP compared with the
previous program, down to 15.7 percent of GDP. This mainly results from lower corporate
income tax receipts from megaprojects and the traditional export sector (0.9 percent of GDP),
lower fuel taxes (0.1 percent of GDP) as global oil prices have declined more sharply than
expected, and the delay in increasing excise taxes on tobacco and alcoholic beverages
(0.1 percent of GDP). The Government will maintain the domestic expenditure envelope in
nominal terms broadly as previously envisaged and in line with budgeted levels. Relative to
GDP, total domestic spending will rise about 0.32 percent of GDP. As a result, the

42
Government may increase domestic financing to about 1.8 percent of GDP, or about
1.1 percent of GDP higher than previously envisaged. Though large, the increase in domestic
borrowing does not jeopardize Mozambique’s public debt sustainability as the level of public
debt is low and increase in domestic financing is expected to be temporary.
29.
The Government will be vigilant that the wage bill remains fiscally sustainable, while
making room for necessary adjustments to safeguard the social sectors. The wage bill in 2009
will reach 8.9 percent of GDP, the same as previously budgeted and 0.8 percentage points
higher than in 2008. Most of the increase (0.4 percent of GDP) will arise as the first pillar of
the wage policy reform (the decompression of the salary bands) is implemented. The wage bill
also includes additional hiring of 17,500, mostly in the social sectors. Additional reform of the
wage policy will be phased in gradually in following years. The MF, in coordination with the
Ministry of Civil Service, will prepare an estimate of the new pay policy for the fiscal
years 2010 to 2012 by end-August 2009 (structural benchmark).
30.
The Government is committed to underpinning sound fiscal policies by strengthening
tax administration and public financial management. To modernize the tax administration the
AT will further improve its strategic management framework. It will monitor key performance
indicators and identify efficiency gains. It will also strengthen the audit and collection
enforcement focusing on the mega-projects and strengthening the operational capacity of the
Large Tax Payer Units. With the support of IMF and World Bank, the Government intends to
make an assessment of its overall tax policy.
31.
The Ministry of Finance intends to approve the PFM vision paper for the coming ten
years by July (delayed structural benchmark). By September, the Government also intends to
approve the Action Plan and Budget for phase III of the PFM reform program which is to be
co-funded by donors and Government. The Government will finalize by end-2009 the
customization of the e-Tax (e-Tributação) software and complete its pilot implementation by
end-2010 (delayed structural benchmark). The Government will issue a decree requiring
sectors to receive prior authorization from the MF for any procurement of new accounting
systems to ensure that they are complementary and compatible to e-SISTAFE. Finally, the
Government will revise its ‘Guidelines for External Financing’ by end June with the aim of
encouraging donors to use the single and multi-currency treasury accounts (CUT) at the BM
for disbursing project aid.
32.
To strengthen monitoring of net lending to public enterprises, a draft public enterprises
law will be submitted to the Council of Ministers by end-September 2009 (structural
benchmark). It will include the requirement for quarterly financial reporting to the MF and the
ring–fencing of commercial activities.
C. Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector
33.
The BM is committed to pursuing a prudent monetary policy within the context of a
flexible exchange rate regime. Monetary policy will remain geared towards price stability.

43
In 2009, the BM will ease monetary policy modestly to accommodate the expansion in
domestic budget financing to limit the adverse impact on credit to the economy. The 12-month
inflation at the end of 2009 is expected to remain broadly the same as at the end of 2008 on
account of a modest increase in international fuel and food prices and because of the recent
depreciation of the exchange rate. Consistent with these objectives, the BM aims to increase
reserve money, its operational target, by 12.5 percent during 2009. The weak external
environment will have a large adverse impact on Mozambique’s external balances. As a result,
the BM’s gross external reserves are projected to fall US$221 million during 2009 to US$1440
at the end of 2009 and equivalent to 3.9 months of imports. The monetary framework makes
room for broad money to expand by about 15 percent, allowing for continued financial
deepening, including private sector credit growth of 28 percent.
34.
The BM will continue reinforcing its monitoring, analysis and forecasting of
macroeconomic and monetary indicators. In particular, the BM will continue to focus on
strengthening liquidity management, paying particular attention to improving coordination
with the MF on its cash flow projections and with banks on their liquidity requirements.
Accurate liquidity forecasting will become more challenging as donors shift their project
disbursements through the Government’s single treasury account (CUT) at the BM. To help
strengthen the interbank market and liquidity management, the BM will broaden its use of
repos, and build a flexible and more realistic intervention corridor that reflects market
conditions. To further strengthen the interbank market, the BM will also stimulate the market’s
use of repos by improving confidence between the market players as result of the increase of
volume and frequency of transactions.
35.
The recent FSAP Update found considerable overall progress in the financial sector
since the 2003 FSAP. The Update made recommendations in the areas of access to finance,
banking supervision, money and debt markets and liquidity management, the nonbank
financial sector (pension and insurance), and the payments system. The authorities will finalize
an action plan to implement the recommendations by December 2009 and will also form a task
force to monitor implementation by the same date. Meanwhile, the BM has already decided to
issue new regulations to redefine the loan classification rules to make them consistent with
international best practices by September 2009 (structural benchmark). In addition, the BM is
preparing improvements in its remedial action framework for banks in difficulty and is
strengthening its crisis preparedness and contingency planning with technical assistance from
the World Bank and the IMF.
36.
The BM will implement measures to further buttress its internal audit. In accordance
with the audit charter, the internal audit office will report periodically to the BM’s Board on
the implementation of audit recommendations and on financial developments at the BM. A
new central bank law for Mozambique will be drafted once the SADC central bank model law
has been approved (expected in 2010). It will also publish its audited financial statements
for 2008 in compliance with IFRS by end-June 2009.

44
37.
Under the strategic plan (2008-2010), the BM continues to strengthen its banking
supervision framework by adopting a risk-based approach to supervise financial institutions.
The Risk-Based Supervision (RBS) Framework is expected to be finalized by end-2009. A
consultant has been appointed under FSTAP to assist BM on the designing of the road map for
the implementation of Basel II in Mozambique. The consultant will assess the impact of Basel
II on financial sector and prepare a transition strategy, procedure manuals, and circulars on
procedures.
38.
The new foreign exchange law which fully liberalizes current account transactions was
approved by Parliament in October 2008 and became effective in March 2009. The
Government has notified the IMF of the approval of the law and the drafting of its regulations
is underway. In the course of 2009, the Government expects to officially inform the Fund of its
acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement.
D. Other Structural Policies
39.
Following the recent adoption of a new law on social protection, the Government
intends to strengthen the social security and supplementary pension system. Pending the
commissioning of a new actuarial study with the World Bank’s support, the National Social
Security Institute is strengthening the information technology system for its data collection and
management systems and will draft and approve by September 2009 an explicit investment
strategy. After the census of the civil servants the Government has also finalized the census of
pensioners of the civil service pension system and has commissioned an actuarial study with
the World Bank’s support. Efforts are also underway to strengthen the insurance sector’s
regulatory and supervisory framework and the institutional capacity of the Inspecção Geral de
Seguros.
40.
To manage the budgetary and macroeconomic implications of megaprojects, the
Government will improve the coordination between MF, MPD, BM, the Institute for National
Statistics (INE), and line ministries with the aim to collect and compile data on megaprojects.
The Government will strengthen the analytical and forecasting capabilities at the MF,
including by strengthening coordination with other Ministries and the BM. The Government
will strictly implement the mining and petroleum fiscal regime, related regulations, and model
contracts for all new projects. It will also continue to adopt nonrecourse financing clauses in
future megaprojects.
41.
Following the Government’s formal request to become a member of the EITI
(structural benchmark for June 2009), the Government, the private sector and civil society will
undertake a sequence of actions required for the validation of Mozambique’s adherence to the
EITI. This process is expected to take at least three years.
42.
The Government is intensifying its reforms to improve the business environment. This
will help stimulate new investment and mitigate the impact of the global economic slowdown.

45
The Government has identified five priority areas. It will: (i) consolidate licensing at the OneStop Shops; (ii) improve the legal framework by implementing the bankruptcy legislation once
approved by Parliament, establishing a system for micro-enterprise registration, creating a
unified inspection process, and by amending legislation on property registration; (iii) facilitate
tax and trade administration by further reducing VAT refund delays, simplifying trade
procedures through a Single Window by end-2010, and implementing the e-Tax pilot;
(iv) strengthen support for small and medium-sized businesses, by establishing the SME
institute and implementing its mandated strategy; and (v) reduce labor market rigidities by
disseminating the new labor law and further defining its regulations.
43.
The Government places particular emphasis on implementing the second phase of the
public sector reform program (2006–11). This consists of four pillars: improving service
delivery; strengthening the capacity of local government; creating a more professional public
sector; and strengthening good governance systems and the fight against corruption. By the
end of 2009, the Government will draft a Public-Private Partnership Law, aimed primarily to
prevent and manage fiscal and quasi-fiscal risks, which could also be applicable to
megaprojects.
44.
The Government took further measures to fight corruption and to improve the
efficiency of the public sector. To improve the monitoring, the health sector revised its anticorruption action plan. The ministries of interior, education and culture, finance and justice
will finalize theirs by July 2009. The Government has initiated the harmonization and
modernization of the national anti-corruption legislation. In 2008, 27 cases were sentenced by
the courts for corruption.
45.
The Government will prepare a national decentralization strategy by end-December
2009 with the Ministry of State Administration as the coordinator of the process involving
other key ministries with the help of the World Bank and other partners. The strategy will
include a legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for revenue collection and spending for
sub-national units. The strategy will take into account their administrative capacity and need to
maintain fiscal control of planning, finance and execution. In the process of reforming the
OIIL district revolving funds, the Government has issued in April 2009 instructions to unify
the criteria for project selection, lending, and reimbursement rules in the districts.
III. Program Monitoring

ATTACHMENT II
REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON SELECTED
CONCEPTS, DEFINITIONS, AND DATA REPORTING UNDER MOZAMBIQUE’S POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT PROGRAM
May 13, 2009
1.
The purpose of this technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) is to describe the
concepts and definitions that will be used in monitoring the Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
program, including the following:
•

net credit to the central government by the banking system;

•

government revenue;

•

net international reserves, and reserve money of the Bank of Mozambique (BM);

•

new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government
or the BM with a maturity of more than one year;

•

short-term external public debt outstanding;

•

external payments arrears; and

•

foreign program assistance and external debt service.

This memorandum also describes the adjusters that will be applied to certain quantitative
assessment criteria of the program.
I. Definitions
Net credit to the central government
2.
Net credit to the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as the
difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and the
central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project accounts
with the banking system, recapitalization bonds issued to the BM, and proceeds from the
signing fee for coal exploration. Credits comprise bank loans and advances to the government
and holdings of government securities and promissory notes. NCG will be calculated based on
data from balance sheets of the monetary authority and commercial banks as per the monetary
survey. The limits on the change in net credit to the central government by the banking system
will be cumulative from end-December of the previous year.
3.
The government encompasses all institutions whose revenue and expenditure are
included in the state budget (Orçamento do Estado): central government ministries, agencies,
and the administration of 11 provinces. Although local governments (33 municipalities or
autarquias) are not included because they are independent, the bulk of their revenue is
registered in the state budget as transfers to local governments.

49

Government revenue and financing
4.
Revenue is defined to include all receipts of General Directorate of Tax (Direcção Geral
dos Impostos or DGI), the General Directorate of Customs (Direcção Geral das Alfândegas,
DGA), and nontax revenue, including certain own-generated revenues of districts and some line
ministries as defined in the budget. Net receipts from privatization received by the National
Directorate of State Assets (Direcção Nacional do Património do Estado) and unrealized profits
transferred by the central bank to the treasury will not be considered as revenue (above the line)
and will be accounted for as other domestic financing (below the line).
5.
For the purpose of program monitoring, revenue is considered as collected at the time
when it is received by the DGI from private agents or other government collecting agencies, in
cash or checks, or through transfers into a DGI bank account.
Reserve money
6.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency issued by BM and the commercial
banks’ holding at the BM. The reserve money stock will be monitored by the monetary
authority and provided to the IMF by the BM.
Net international reserves
7.
Net international reserves of the BM are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities. The BM’s reserve assets include (a) monetary gold; (b) holdings of SDRs;
(c) reserve position at the IMF; (d) holdings of foreign exchange; and (e) claims on
nonresidents, such as deposits abroad (excluding the government’s savings account related to
the Moatize coal mine concession). Reserve assets exclude assets pledged or otherwise
encumbered, including but not limited to assets used as collateral or guarantee for a third–party
external liability (assets not readily available.) The BM’s reserve liabilities include (a) all shortterm foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents with original maturity of up to and including
one year; and (b) all liabilities to the IMF.
8.
For the purposes of program monitoring and in order to exclude valuation changes, net
international reserves will be measured at the official exchange rates prevailing at end-2007
and used by the BM.
9.
The BM will publish the exchange rates quoted by commercial banks on average as the
market rates.
New nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government
or the BM with maturity of more than one year
10.
The term ’debt’ will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000. Government
debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the central government or the BM (but does not

50
include debt of any political subdivision or government-owned entity with a separate legal
personality that is not otherwise owed or guaranteed by the central government).
11.
The central government will limit contracting or guaranteeing external debt up to
US$5 million each year with original maturity of one year or more with a grant element of less
than 35 percent, calculated using currency-specific discount rates based on the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) commercial interest reference rates in
accordance with the annual Budget Law. This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as
defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
adopted on August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value
has not been received. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
Stock of short-term external public debt outstanding
12.
The central government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original
maturity of less than one year. This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as defined in
point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. Excluded from this assessment criterion are short-term, import-related trade
credits. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
External payments arrears
13.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt owed or
guaranteed by the central government, with the exception of external payments arrears arising
from government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club creditors.
This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
Foreign program assistance
14.
Foreign program assistance is defined as grants and loans received by the Ministry of
Finance through BM accounts excluding those related to projects (Table 1).
Actual external debt-service payments
15.
Actual external debt-service payments are defined as cash payments on external debtservice obligations of the government and central bank, including obligations to Paris Club and
other bilateral creditors rescheduled under enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point terms,
multilateral creditors, and private creditors, but excluding obligations to the IMF (Table 1).

51

II. Adjusters
Net international reserves
16.
The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will not
be adjusted for any excess in disbursements of foreign program assistance (and any shortfall in
external debt service), compared to the program baseline. These targets will be adjusted
downward by 100 percent of any shortfall in external program aid (up to a maximum of
US$100 million) and any excess in external debt service payments, compared to the program
baseline (Table 1).
17.
The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will be
adjusted downward/upward for any revision made to the end-year figures corresponding to the
previous year.
18.
The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will be
adjusted upward for the full amount of any external privatization proceeds in excess of those
envisaged in the program, unless these proceeds are deposited in the government’s savings
account abroad. If they are deposited abroad, the indicative targets on the balance in this
account will be adjusted upward for the full amount of the higher than envisaged proceeds, net
of any costs related to the privatizations, including severance payments.
19.
The quantitative targets (floors) for the central bank’s net international reserves will be
adjusted downward up to a maximum of US$50 million per annum by the amount that the
actual fuel import bill is higher due to a rise in the average fuel import price. This adjustment
will be equal to the difference between the realized and the programmed average fuel import
price, multiplied by the volume of total fuel imports programmed for each quarter (Table 1).
20.
The quantitative target (floor) on net international reserves will be adjusted downward
to accommodate the possible need for higher external outlays to deal with natural disasters, up
to a total limit of US$20 million.
In case that Mozambique participates in any SDR allocation(s) between June 30, 2009
and the test date, and provided that SDR allocation(s) are not included as part of reserve
liabilities for the purpose of calculating NIR, then the quantitative target (floor) for NIR will be
adjusted upwards by the full equivalent of the amount of the cumulative additional SDR
allocation(s) up to the test date, measured at program exchange rates.
21.

Net credit to government
22.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit on the central government (NCG) will
not be adjusted for any excess in disbursements of foreign program assistance (and any
shortfall in external debt service), compared to the program baseline. These targets will be
adjusted upward by 100 percent of any shortfall in external program aid (up to a maximum of
US$100 million) and any excess in external debt service payments, compared to the program
baseline (Table 1).

52
23.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit on the central government (NCG) will
be adjusted downward for the full amount of any privatization proceeds in excess of those
envisaged in the program, unless these proceeds are deposited in the government’s savings
account abroad.
24.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit on the central government (NCG) will
be adjusted downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in domestic financing from the
nonfinancial private sector. The government expenditures contingent on higher disbursements
of foreign program assistance (and lower external debt service) will be used to finance greater
‘priority’ spending identified in the budget.
25.
The quantitative target (ceiling) for net credit to the central government (NCG) will be
adjusted upward to accommodate the possible need for higher locally financed government
outlays to deal with natural disasters, up to a total limit of MT 500 million.
Reserve money
26.
The quantitative target (ceiling) for reserve money will be adjusted upward up to a
maximum of MT 750 million to the extent that the sum of the outstanding stock of currency
issued by the BM exceed those projected in Table 1. The maximum at end-December will be
raised to MT 1000 million because of the seasonal increase in the demand for currency during
the end-year festive season.
III. Data Reporting
27.
In addition to providing the monthly and quarterly data needed to monitor program
implementation in relation to the programs’ quantitative targets and broader economic
developments, the authorities will provide weekly updates of the daily data set out in Table 1 as
well as the weekly data set out in Table 4 of the TMU dated May 26, 2005. Monthly updates
will also be provided of the foreign exchange cash flow of the BM.
28.
The government will continue to provide Fund staff with the data corresponding to
monthly government revenues (in detail according to the fiscal table), with a lag not exceeding
one month. In addition, the government will continue to publish and provide Fund staff with
the quarterly budget execution reports with a time lag not exceeding 45 days.
29.
In addition, the government will provide monthly information on the balance of its
savings account abroad and will start developing and providing information on domestic arrears
on a quarterly basis.
30.
From December 2005 onwards, the monetary survey made available by the BM will
clearly identify donor-financed project deposits (with a breakdown between foreign and
domestic currency) included in net credit to the government in both the central bank’s and
commercial banks’ balance sheets.

APPENDIX II
REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY—UPDATE
1.
In view of Mozambique’s request for access to Fund resources under the Exogenous
Shocks Facility, Fund staff have updated the assessment of Mozambique’s debt sustainability.
The previous assessment found that Mozambique’s debt indicators were expected to remain well
below their thresholds and that the risk of debt distress was low. This assessment builds on the joint
Fund/World Bank assessment presented to the respective Executive Boards at the time of the 3rd PSI
review. It incorporates the previous projections of debt service on the stock of outstanding external
debt and incorporates debt service projections on new domestic and external debt obligations,
including the proposed use of Fund resources. The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the
assessment have also been revised.
2.
In staff’s view, Mozambique continues to face a low of risk of debt distress, though its
public debt sustainability ratios have somewhat deteriorated. This is largely because of the
deterioration in the sustainability ratios for external debt, that constitute the bulk of Mozambique’s
public debt. Mozambique’s external debt and debt service are projected to rise relative to GDP,
exports and revenues during 2009 and beyond, mostly because of lower nominal GDP, export
receipts, and revenues measured in US dollars. The use of Fund resources will have only a modest
impact on the ratios. With the proposed use of Fund resource, the debt indicators continue to remain
below their thresholds.

Safeguards assessment
At the request of the Bank of Mozambique, FIN conducted a voluntary safeguards assessment
which was concluded in June 2008. This assessment updated the findings of an earlier assessment
completed in August 2004. The 2008 assessment noted progress in implementing the
recommendations of the earlier assessment. However weaknesses remain in the external and
internal audit functions, financial reporting, and control systems.
Exchange arrangements
Mozambique has a floating exchange system. Commercial banks may buy and sell foreign
exchange to individual customers on a fully negotiable basis. The Bank of Mozambique introduced
a foreign exchange auction system in January 2005. Foreign exchange transactions are conducted
mainly bilaterally and there is no pre-established frequency for auctions.
Mozambique still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV of the Fund
Articles of Agreement, but has eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. It maintains, however,
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII, as evidenced by (i) the discretionary prior approval for
remittances of family living expenses; (ii) the authorization for the purchase of foreign exchange in
excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (iii) the prohibition for the conversion of balances of
nonresidents’ domestic currency accounts into foreign currency or transfer abroad; (iv) the
prohibition on advance payments for a service; and (v) the prohibition on advance payments for the
import of goods. On June 18, 2007, the Fund granted approval for the retention of these five
exchange restrictions until May 31, 2008. At the authorities’ request, an Article VIII mission was
conducted by LEG and PDR in March 2004. A new foreign exchange law was submitted to the
Assembly in May 2007. Following enactment of the new law and issuance of related regulations,
the authorities intend to accept their obligations under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement.
Article IV consultation
In accordance with Decision No 12794–(02/76), as amended by Decision No 12854–(02/96),
Mozambique is on a 24-month Article IV cycle due to the approval of a PSI in June 2007. The 2007
Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June 18, 2007 (Country Report
No. 07/262).
In concluding the 2007 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the Mozambican
authorities on the impressive macroeconomic performance and overall satisfactory program
performance since the last Article IV consultation. At the same time, they noted there are policy
challenges related to sustaining Mozambique's growth takeoff and to achieving the MDGs. In this
regard, they agreed that the strategy to consolidate macroeconomic stability in the context of a
continued scaling-up of foreign aid and the acceleration of a second wave of reforms outlined in the
authorities' poverty reduction plan for 2006–09 (PARPA II) would be essential to overcome such
challenges. In particular, they looked forward to the timely implementation of reforms to

61
(i) increasing tax revenues; (ii) strengthening public sector operations; (iii) reducing the costs of
doing business; and (iv) improving the management of natural resources.
Ex–post assessment of performance under Fund-supported programs
An ex post assessment (EPA) of Mozambique’s performance under Fund-Supported Programs since
1987 was undertaken in December 2003 under the guidelines on assessments of countries with a
longer-term program engagement. The EPA was circulated to the Executive Board on November
21, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/53).
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and wide
ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years which contributed to strong growth of the
economy, and a steady decline in poverty rates. Noting that despite considerable progress
Mozambique remains a very poor and vulnerable country, Directors urged the authorities to
persevere in their efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability and accelerate and deepen
structural reforms with a view to sustaining economic growth, encouraging employment creation,
and further reducing poverty.
FSAP participation and ROSCs
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the first
quarter of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the Executive
Board on November 19, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). An update to the FSAP took place in
February 2009, and the follow-up mission to discuss a timetable for implementing the FSAP
recommendations took place in May 2009. A ROSC on fiscal transparency was issued on
February 22, 2001. This ROSC was updated in the context of the 2002 Article IV consultation
(Country Report No. 02/140) and the 2003 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 04/50). The
ROSC on fiscal transparency was updated in May 2008. A Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) data module was prepared in June 2002 and issued on March 5, 2003. This data
module was updated in August 2005.
Management’s visit
At the invitation of the authorities, Mr. Kato, Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo,
Mozambique in July 2005.The Managing Director visited Mozambique on August 2007 for a
meeting with the African Consultative Group on Quotas, Voice, and Representation.

ANNEX III: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Despite the increase in budget resources allocated to the compilation of official statistics,
continued high reliance on external funding raises concerns about the sustainability of the
programs of the National Institute of Statistics (INE). The authorities are making efforts to
improve the quality and timeliness of economic and financial data through participation in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and in the external sector module of
the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries (funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID)). GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since November 2003.
2.
In May 2005, a STA mission updated the data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) prepared in June 2002. The mission noted that
significant effort has been made to address previously identified shortcomings. The
improvements in the institutional environment and the increased allocation of resources for
the compilation of national accounts, balance of payments, and more recently, government
finance statistics should help to address weaknesses in the prerequisites for the quality of the
statistics. The methodological soundness, accuracy, and reliability of macroeconomic
statistics are starting to show improvements as a result of these actions.
National accounts
3.
The national accounts are prepared by the INE in accordance with the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). In August 2007, the INE released for the first time quarterly
GDP estimates at constant prices covering 2000–07, along with a revised annual GDP series
for the period 1991–2006, having 2003 as the new base year. A (March–April 2008) STA
mission advised the authorities on further improvements needed to advance the quarterly
national accounts compilation at current prices, that could be released starting in mid-2009.
The INE has launched a new household income and expenditure survey and new economic
censuses leading to a new business registry. Furthermore, it is compiling more
comprehensive and timely foreign trade data based on improved classification systems.
Prices and labor market
4.
A revamped consumer price index for Maputo based on weights derived from
the 2002–03 household survey was released in February 2006. A national index obtained by
integrating the indices for Maputo, Beira, and Nampula was released in April 2006. A STA
mission in June 2006 found important advances regarding the use of the COICOP
classification and the strengthening of human resources in the compilation of the CPI.
Several issues remain outstanding, however, such as price collection procedures not fully
consolidated at the provincial level, imputation methods, and possible inconsistencies in the
overlapping period between the new and old series.

66
5.
There are insufficient sectoral labor market and employment data, and where
available, they have limited coverage. A one-year labor market survey of the entire country,
undertaken by INE in collaboration with the Labor Ministry, was launched in October 2004.
Monetary statistics
6.
A STA mission in September 2004 prepared a work plan for the implementation of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and the development of an integrated
monetary database (IMD) to meet the needs of the Bank of Mozambique (BM), AFR, and
STA. The mission recommended improving the classification and valuation of some financial
instruments, estimating the full instrument and sectoral breakdown based on available
information, and expanding the coverage of the survey on other depository corporations to
include credit cooperatives.
7.
A follow-up monetary and financial statistics mission in November 2007 assisted the
authorities in finalizing the IMD, which allow the derivation of accurate and timely monthly
monetary statistics, while reducing BM’s reporting burden. Mozambique now reports
monthly monetary data to STA using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). As a result,
five-year historical enhanced data are being published in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) Supplement.
External sector statistics
8.
With assistance from STA, provided in the context of the GDDS regional project, the
BM has made significant progress toward compiling and disseminating balance of payments
(BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics that are fully aligned with the
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5).
9.
The BM has an adequate institutional framework for the compilation of BOP and IIP
statistics, and has implemented many of the recommendations made by the four technical
assistance missions conducted since mid-2003. However, in order for the work on
institutional capacity building to be consolidated, the Foreign Exchange Law has to be
approved (incorporating the definition of residency in line with the BPM5 methodology),
training on BOP statistics has to be sustained, and the project to computerize the balance of
payments compilation system has to be completed. Although, major improvements were
achieved in the basic data sources since the beginning of the project, remaining concerns
include (i) the coverage and quality of the data obtained in the enterprise surveys; (ii) the
quality of external trade data, especially with regard to price and volume indices; (iii) the
coverage, time of recording, and classification of the data on foreign investment and private
loans; (iv) completeness of data for the International Reserves Template and their
reconciliation with the reserve component of the balance of payments; and (v) compiling the
IIP using the sources that are used for the balance of payments compilation. To improve the
collection, timeliness, and quality of merchandise trade data, a panel on foreign trade

67
statistics was established, comprising representatives from the Directorate General of
Customs, National Statistics Institute, and BM.
10.
In 2007, the BM started to compile and report to the STA comprehensive IIP data.
Previously, only partial IIP data had been reported and published in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.
Government finance statistics
11.
A July 2005 STA mission found serious weaknesses in fiscal statistics. The budget
accounting system, broadly aligned to the GFSM 1986 analytical framework, had
shortcomings relating to: definitions and coverage of institutional units included in the
general government sector; budgetary classifications not fully meeting GFS needs; and the
omission of certain revenues and expenditures. Mozambique does not report fiscal data for
publication in the IFS or the Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFSY).

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/85
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 16, 2009

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Mozambique
On June 30, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mozambique.1
Background
Mozambique has continued its record of strong macroeconomic performance since the mid1990s and its performance compares well with other countries in the region. Output growth
in Mozambique over the past decade averaged almost 8 percent. Growth has been
sustained by investment financed by large aid and private capital inflows, mainly into the
natural resource sector. It has also been sustained by a strong trade sector—merchandise
exports’ share of GDP more than tripled to nearly 30 percent of GDP, eliminating a trade
deficit of about 30 percent of GDP.
However, even before the current global crisis, growth had been weakening, with growth
projections about 1 percentage point lower than in the past decade. In recent years, these
flows contributed to an appreciation of currency in real effective terms. Growth has also
been unevenly distributed and a recent survey suggests that poverty may have increased in
recent years, particularly in rural areas.
Against a backdrop of a highly uncertain global economic environment, Mozambique’s
macroeconomic prospects remain positive, but have weakened. Mozambique’s growth
in 2009 could fall several percentage points below trend. In view of WEO projections for a
slow global recovery, growth is projected to strengthen in 2010, but will probably remain
below 6 percent until 2011. Similarly, the external overall balance is projected to turn
negative in both 2009; turning positive again in 2011 and stabilizing external reserves
around 3.4 months of imports.
The scope for supportive macroeconomic policies to offset the impact of the global economic
slowdown is curtailed by the large projected decline in external reserves. Most of the
deterioration in the external overall balance is the direct result of the external shock; the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
fiscal expansion is estimated to account for only US$42 million of the reserve loss in 2009
through higher import demand.
Mozambique is eligible for a one-year arrangement under the ESF with access of
100 percent of quota (SDR 113.6 million) to be made available in three drawings following
completion of the fourth, fifth and sixth reviews under the PSI. Mozambique faces balance of
payments difficulties caused primarily by a sudden and exogenous shock. Moreover, the
shock is expected to be temporary, as the overall balance is projected to revert to a surplus
in 2011. Access to the ESF, would provide timely coverage of about two thirds of the direct
balance of payments impact of the external shock. Moreover, the use of Fund resources
should catalyze support from donors which are considering stepping up their assistance,
most notably the World Bank.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Mozambique’s continued strong macroeconomic
performance in 2008, despite a challenging external environment. Directors commended the
authorities’ flexible policy response to higher fuel and food import prices, which helped to
mitigate the impact of these shocks. Looking forward, they noted that Mozambique remains
vulnerable to the global economic slowdown and encouraged the authorities to monitor
international and domestic developments closely.
Directors agreed that Mozambique’s strong track record of prudent macroeconomic
policy implementation has provided room to ease fiscal and monetary policy in the nearterm, while remaining within its prudent medium-term strategy. In this context, they
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to expenditure restraint in the approach to elections,
and encouraged them to protect the most vulnerable from the consequences of the
economic crisis.
In the medium-term, Directors underscored the importance of further strengthening
macroeconomic stability, and supported efforts to enhance domestic revenue mobilization
and to improve public financial management. Recourse to domestic budget financing should
be avoided so as to provide room for credit to the private sector. Monetary policy should aim
to keep inflation low. Directors welcomed steps to strengthen monetary policy formulation
and implementation. They encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to diversify the
sources of growth and to accelerate structural reforms to boost Mozambique’s
competitiveness, promote investment, and improve financial intermediation.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that Mozambique’s currency is
overvalued in real effective terms, while recognizing the methodological constraints affecting
this evaluation, particularly in the context of an economy undergoing significant structural
changes, and emphasized the potentially adverse impact this could have on competitiveness
and economic diversification. They encouraged the authorities to fulfill their commitment to
exchange rate flexibility.
Directors commended the authorities on Mozambique’s continued advances on its
structural reform agenda. They welcomed the progress in strengthening fiscal and monetary
operations and called for urgent and rigorous reforms to strengthen the private sector and
reduce the costs of doing business. Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to

3
improve governance including the development of anti-corruption policies and by
Mozambique’s formal acceptance by the Extractive Industries’ Transparency Initiative Board.
Directors welcomed the FSAP Update’s finding that Mozambique has made
significant progress towards developing and strengthening the financial sector and improving
banking operations. They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to move ahead quickly
to assess and finalize an action plan to implement the FSAP Update’s recommendations,
including strengthening risk monitoring, home-host cooperation on banking supervision, and
crisis management arrangements.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to accept the obligations under Article VIII.

Press Release No.09/247
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 30, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$176 Million Exogenous Shocks Facility for
Mozambique and Completes Fourth Review Under the Policy Support Instrument
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 12-month,
SDR 113.6 million (about US$176 million) for Mozambique under the IMF’s Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF) to cushion the country from the effects of the global economic downturn. The
approval enables Mozambique to draw immediately an amount equivalent to SDR 85.2 million
(about US$132 million). The IMF financing will help Mozambique offset the deterioration of its
balance of payments, which has been undermined by the global economic downturn. The ESF is
designed to provide policy support and financial assistance on concessional terms to eligible lowincome countries facing temporary exogenous shocks.
The IMF Executive Board also completed the fourth review of Mozambique’s economic
performance under the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The PSI for Mozambique was
approved on June 18, 2007 (See Press Release No 07/135) to support the nation's economic
reform efforts. It is aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability and at achieving sustained
economic growth and poverty reduction through the pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies
as well as promoting structural reforms. The strategy to achieve this goal remains set in the
Mozambican authorities' national poverty reduction strategy, Plano de Acção para Redução da
Pobreza Absoluta (PARPA II).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Mozambique, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Mozambique continued with a strong macroeconomic performance in 2008. A flexible policy
response to higher fuel and food import prices helped to mitigate the impact of internal and
external shocks in a challenging external environment. As Mozambique remains vulnerable to the
global economic slowdown, international and domestic developments will need to be closely
monitored.
“Mozambique’s strong track record of prudent macroeconomic policy implementation has
provided room for an easing of fiscal and monetary policy in the near-term while remaining
within its prudent medium-term strategy. In this context, the authorities’ commitment to
expenditure restraint in the approach to elections is welcome.

2

“In the medium-term, steps to enhance domestic revenue mobilization and to improve public
financial management will contribute importantly to further strengthening macroeconomic
stability. Avoiding recourse to domestic financing of the budget will provide room for credit to
the private sector. Strengthened monetary policy formulation and implementation will help to
maintain low inflation. Intensified efforts to diversify the sources of growth and to accelerate
structural reforms will boost Mozambique’s competitiveness, promote investment, and improve
financial intermediation.
“Closer attention to a broader basket of currencies that is more reflective of Mozambique’s
trading patterns, could help to redress the overvaluation of the currency in real effective terms,
which could have adverse impact on Mozambique’s competitiveness and economic
diversification.
“Mozambique has continued to advance on its structural reform agenda. Fiscal and monetary
operations have been strengthened and an enhanced business environment for both domestic and
foreign investment is targeted. Mozambique candidacy for adherence to the Extractive Industries’
Transparency Initiative is welcome.
“Mozambique has made significant progress towards developing and strengthening the financial
sector and improving banking operations. The authorities have committed to move ahead quickly
to assess and finalize an action plan to further strengthen the financial sector, including risk
monitoring, home-host cooperation on banking supervision, and crisis management
arrangements,” added Mr. Kato.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Republic of Mozambique
June 30, 2009
Introduction
1.
My Mozambican authorities appreciate the continued support by the Fund and the
constructive policy dialogue and advice by staff. They are committed to implementing
reforms and to macroeconomic stability, as is evidenced by the satisfactory performance
under the PSI arrangement since its inception. However, Mozambique is vulnerable to the
global economic and financial crisis, and mitigating measures are necessary to meet the
challenges and ensure that economic growth and macroeconomic stability are sustained. In
this context, my Mozambican authorities are requesting a twelve-month arrangement under
the high access component of the ESF.
2.
The overall implementation of the PSI arrangement in the second half of 2008 was
satisfactory. All quantitative assessment criteria (ACs) to end-December 2008 were met.
Implementation of the two structural benchmarks for end-March 2009—the approval of a
PFM vision paper and the issuance of a decree streamlining the business inspection
process—were delayed and both are now expected to be implemented by end-July 2009. In
this regard, the authorities request Directors’ support for the completion of the fourth review
of the PSI.
Recent economic developments
3.
Macroeconomic performance during 2008 was good, despite pressures from the high
fuel and food prices in mid-2008 together with the onset of the global economic crisis in late
2008. The economy is estimated to have expanded by 6.8 percent in 2008, with a particularly
good performance in agriculture, construction, transport and communications and financial
services. Inflation fell faster, from a peak of 13 percent in February 2008 to 6.2 percent in
December 2008 and 3 percent in May 2009, mainly because of the sharp drop in import
prices. The current account balance in 2008 was adversely affected by higher imports
because of increases in international prices. However, because of high private capital
inflows, an increase in gross international reserves was recorded for the year. The real
effective exchange rate appreciated, but part of this appreciation has been reversed in the first
months of 2009.
4.
The Government’s fiscal policy was revised in July 2008 to incorporate measures to
mitigate the social impact of higher fuel and food prices. Domestic financing of the budget
for the year was 0.8 percent of GDP lower than envisaged because of better than envisaged
domestic revenues, from personal income tax, and lower than budgeted recurrent spending on
goods and services. However, the late disbursements of funds for externally financed
investment projects accounted for the overall low expenditure execution rate that was only 88
percent of the program. The multiplicity of accounting procedures, as well as the integration
of projects into the budget, also influenced the rate of budget execution. In this regard, it

2
should be noted that expenditure in PARPA’s priority sectors accounts for almost two thirds
of the total approved budget.
5.
Monetary policy in 2008 aimed at price stability. The target for reserve money was
revised to accommodate the projected increase in inflation due to higher import prices. The
Bank of Mozambique (BM) was able to contain reserve money growth in part due to strong
fiscal performance. The BM and commercial banks have improved their management of the
seasonal surge in currency demand over the festive season. Net international reserves were in
line with revised projections and the program target was met.
6.
Structural reforms to strengthen the management and transparency of mineral
resources, hence maximizing the benefits to Mozambique, are on track. The authorities’
request to become a candidate for adherence to the EITI was approved last May.
7.
The strategy for the improvement of the business environment was approved by
Cabinet, after which the following reforms were implemented: (i) elimination of the
minimum capital and bank deposit requirement for the creation of companies;
(ii) introduction of the simplified licensing regime; and (iii) approval of the new Code of Tax
Benefits. In the meantime, the authorities are committed to persevere with the improvement
of the business environment, with a view to attract investments for the productive sectors,
along with the associated creation of employment. These structural reforms are focused on:
(i) the streamlining of business inspections, particularly in the areas of labor and finance,
(ii) the contracting of foreign workers, taking into account the relevant regulation; and
(iii) the costs of doing international business.
Outlook and policy response for 2009/10
8.
My authorities’ policy thrust in 2009/10 is to carefully monitor the impact of the
global economic crisis on Mozambique’s macroeconomic prospects and to implement
appropriate policies to mitigate its effects. Against the backdrop of a highly uncertain global
outlook, economic prospects for 2009 have deteriorated, and GDP growth is now projected to
be far below the trend of the last few years. The external shocks will have adverse impacts on
the balance of payments, with the overall position projected to deteriorate by nearly
US$400 million in 2009, as the trade deficit widens, foreign direct investment contracts, and
foreign borrowing by the private sector is curtailed. To this end, the authorities have
intensified their efforts to mobilize external financing.
9.
On the fiscal side, revenues in 2009 are projected to be lower by 1.2 percent points of
GDP compared with what was envisaged in the program (though by only -0.3 percent of
GDP compared with the outturn for 2008). The authorities will maintain the domestic
expenditure envelope in nominal terms broadly as previously envisaged and in line with
budgeted levels. Therefore, relative to GDP, total spending will rise by about 5.2 percent of
GDP compared with the outturn for 2008 (but will decline by -1.3 percent of GDP with
respect to the envisaged program for 2009). To fill the financing gap, the authorities intend to
increase net domestic financing to about 1.8 percent of GDP, higher than previously

3
envisaged. The authorities’ perseverance with macroeconomic stability and the relatively low
public debt over the last years provide ample fiscal space. In any event, the increase in net
domestic financing is expected to be temporary.
10.
The BM will ease monetary policy modestly to accommodate the expansion in
domestic financing of the budget. The 12-month inflation at the end of 2009 is expected to
remain broadly the same as at the end of 2008 on account of a modest increase in
international fuel and food prices and because of the recent depreciation of the exchange rate.
The monetary framework makes room for broad money to expand for continued financial
deepening, including private sector credit growth. The weak external environment will have a
large adverse impact on Mozambique’s external balances. As a result, the BM’s gross
external reserves are projected to fall by more than US$200 million during 2009, reducing
the NIR from 4.4 to 3.9 months of imports cover.
11.
The recent FSAP update found considerable progress in the financial sector since
2003, though much work is needed in the areas of financial deepening. The FSAP makes
recommendations in the areas of access to finance, banking supervision, and liquidity
management, the non-bank financial sector (pension and insurance), and the payments
system. The authorities will finalize an action plan to implement these recommendations and
will form a task force to monitor implementation. BM will seek TA from the World Bank
and the IMF to strengthen crisis preparedness and contingency planning, as well as improve
its remedial action framework for banks in difficulty.
12.
Mozambique has made considerable progress in several areas of its reform agenda.
The authorities will now concentrate on activities related to the public sector reform program,
in particular the wage policy, strengthening social security and the pension system, and the
anti-corruption strategy. They also intend to intensify reforms to improve the business
environment for the private sector, particularly the SMEs. A third strand relates to the
decentralization process. In this area, the current challenge is the existing capacity at the
districts for implementing financial decentralization. The authorities plan to expand the gains
of PFM reforms so far at the central level to the district level and improve transparency in the
allocation of resources.
13.
At the end of April 2009, the authorities and the Program Aid Partners (PAPs)—the
G-19—completed the annual joint review of the general budget support mechanism. The
joint review concluded that there was satisfactory performance in various areas, but both the
authorities and the PAPs agreed on areas that require more attention and improvement.
Thirty days later, the PAPs made their commitments for the next budget cycle 2010—
US$472 million for general budget support. The authorities are grateful and encouraged by
this support, particularly with the current financial crisis.
Conclusion
14.
My Mozambican authorities remain committed to implementing prudent policies and
persevering with the structural reforms. Mozambique is being affected by the weak economic

4
performance in its major trading partners and by fluctuations in international commodity
prices which is affecting the country’s main exports. Considering their domestic capacity
constraints, the authorities have responded to the crisis with a comprehensive set of policies
and are ready to take more measures, if necessary, to sustain growth and macroeconomic
stability. In this context, the authorities are mindful of both the short- and medium-term
horizons when tackling the challenges arising from the current global crisis. Facing these
challenges will require additional capacity. In this regard, the authorities would like to count
on the support of both the Fund and other development partners to provide TA and enhanced
policy discussions in the implementation of the PARPA, which would transform the
economy and improve the well-being of the population.
