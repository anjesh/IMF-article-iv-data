STAFF REPORT FOR THE ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 29, 2014

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Outlook. The economic rebound experienced since 2009 has ended, with economic
growth decelerating in 2013. The external position is vulnerable, with a wide current
account deficit, an overvalued exchange rate, and low international reserves. The
baseline scenario is marked by sluggish growth in 2014 and over the medium term, with
risks clearly to the downside in the near term. Key risks to the outlook include lower
than programmed tax collections, policy slippages, financial sector stress, and global
commodity prices. Zimbabwe faces these risks with very thin buffers.
Performance under the staff-monitored program (SMP). The SMP provided a useful
anchor for Zimbabwe in an election year. However, progress in implementing the
program was complicated by a long electoral process and a protracted post-election
transition, as well as an adverse external environment. Thus, a number of quantitative
targets and structural benchmarks were not met. Discussions on the first and second
reviews are at an advanced stage.
Macroeconomic policies in the near term. The economic environment remains
difficult, posing significant risks to the budget and to financial stability. Policy efforts
should continue to aim to restore fiscal and external sustainability and reduce financial
vulnerabilities.
Medium-term challenges. Zimbabwe faces serious medium-term challenges, and a
vigorous reform program is needed to put the country on a sustainable, inclusive
growth path. In particular, a fiscal strategy aimed at rebalancing the expenditure mix
should be a priority—including to prevent the accumulation of domestic arrears.
Significant financing is needed to address the infrastructure deficit and widespread
poverty, as targeted under the government’s own development plans. To attract muchneeded FDI and access affordable financing, the authorities need to improve the
business environment.
Resolving external payment arrears. Zimbabwe’s debt situation remains a serious
impediment to external sustainability and economic development. Addressing this issue
will require a comprehensive arrears clearance framework underpinned by strong macro
policies, in what will likely be a protracted process.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The year 2013 was characterized by a protracted political season which reshaped the
political landscape. After long negotiations, in January 2013 the main political parties reached
agreement on a new constitution, leading to a constitutional referendum in March and to national
elections in July. The elections gave President Mugabe a new term and his ZANU-PF party a supermajority in Parliament. This change prompted a major reshuffle of key policy-makers, with a new
cabinet announced only in September 2013. The new government has expressed a commitment to
the policies and reforms in the staff-monitored program (SMP), which had been initiated under the
previous government. The new government has also unveiled a development blueprint for the next
five years, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZIM ASSET, see ¶
46 for further details).
2.
With the post-2009 rebound over, sustained growth and poverty reduction will require
determined and comprehensive reforms. Economic stabilization under the multicurrency system
and efforts at policy reform during the coalition government spurred vigorous growth, mainly in
mining and services (see Figure 1). GDP growth averaged 10.5 percent during 2009-2012. The
economy that emerged from the ashes of hyperinflation is quite different structurally from the one
that preceded it (Figure 2). Over the past decade, little progress has been made towards the
Millennium Development Goals, particularly in improving gender equality (Figure 10). At 72 percent
in 2011, the poverty rate remains unacceptably high (Figure 11). Formal employment has been
shrinking, with an increasing fraction of the labor force in the informal economy. There has been
little reduction in inequality, with the Gini coefficient at 0.42 in 2011.
3.
Adverse weather conditions, weak demand for key exports, and election-year
uncertainty impacted economic activity during 2013. Real GDP growth is estimated to have
decelerated to 3.3 percent (from 10.6 percent in 2012). Erratic rainfalls affected agriculture while
manufacturing faced liquidity shortages and a weaker South African rand that undercut
competitiveness. Although buoyant, mining activity has been affected by easing global commodity
prices and domestic infrastructure challenges. Election-year uncertainty affected private investment
and, at critical moments during the year, led to the tightening of liquidity conditions, which affected
economic activity.
4.
Inflation has recently dipped into negative territory (-0.3 percent year-on-year in April
2014). Amid weak domestic demand, the appreciation of the US dollar against the South African
rand (the currency of Zimbabwe’s main trading partner) contributed to an easing of the price level
during 2013.
5.
The current account deficit deteriorated in 2013 (Figure 3), while reserves remain
woefully inadequate. The deterioration reflects lower mining exports, as gold prices and diamond
production both declined. Manufacturing exports have continued to shrink reflecting the sector’s
declining competitiveness. The current account deficit was mostly financed by private capital inflows.
Errors and omissions remain large, although they are on a declining path. The authorities and Fund

staff agree that those reflect under-recorded exports, remittances, and FDI inflows. Usable reserves
remained below two weeks of imports at end-December (Table 1).

6.
On the spending side of the 2013 budget, the government had to accommodate large
election-related spending (1.4 percent of GDP, mostly unbudgeted) and employment cost
overruns (0.8 percent of GDP). The political process was funded by one-off revenue measures,
cuts in other spending, and accumulation of new arrears to service providers. The government
granted only one salary increase during the year. Nevertheless, promotion drift in the civil service
and overspending on certain allowances resulted in employment costs exceeding budget levels
(Figure 5). The silver lining was the higher-than-budgeted clearance of pre-2013 domestic arrears
(Text Table 1).
7.
Revenues underperformed, and collections deteriorated markedly toward the end of
2013. Despite some measures taken to cover the costs of the political process, revenue came in
lower than budgeted, with an exceptionally low Q4 performance (Figure 4). This was driven by
general weakness in the economy and by a liquidity crunch in December, which probably hurt tax
compliance. Corporate income tax, VAT, and customs performed particularly badly. Personal income
tax and excises held up better, with the latter getting a boost from increases to fuel excises
implemented in March 2013. Non-tax revenues were boosted by telecom license fees mobilized to
finance the referendum and elections. The government was able to collect only US$18 million in
diamond dividends in 2013, compared to a budget estimate of US$70 million. The fiscal year 2013
ended with an overall budget deficit (on a cash basis) of 2.2 percent of GDP. The government’s net
issuance of domestic debt securities was equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP in 2013. To close the
financing gap, particularly toward the end of the year, the government drew down its deposits in the
banking sector, which fell by US$157 million (1.2 percent of GDP) in 2013.
8.
The 2014 budget is facing headwinds due to sluggish growth and large salary
increases for the civil service. Weak revenue performance carried over into 2014, with the
preliminary fiscal outturn for Q1 of 2014 showing total revenues 8 percent below budget
projections. The agreement on salary increases reached between the government and its partners in
the National Joint Negotiating Council in January 2014 is estimated to result in a 14 percent increase
in the overall wage bill this year (assuming broadly unchanged numbers of civil servants), exceeding
both budget projections and inflation. Excluding grant-aided institutions and pensions, the civil
service wage bill is now projected to claim 53 percent of government expenditures in 2014, placing
Zimbabwe at the top in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 6).

Growth in bank deposits and credit slowed down in 2013, with liquidity conditions
tightening around the middle and the end of the year (Figure 7). Banks experienced a liquidity
crunch in June-August 2013, amid political and policy uncertainty related to the election and its
immediate aftermath. There was also a sharp post-election drop in the stock exchange. A second
liquidity crunch in November and December, related in part to withdrawals of year-end bonuses,
was most pronounced in a few troubled banks.1 In early 2014, deposits are slowly returning to the
banking system, but liquidity conditions remain tight. In March 2014 Afreximbank launched a
US$100 million interbank facility (AFTRADES) to help the authorities address some of the liquidity
challenges among solvent banks.2

The financial sector is marked by poor asset quality and low capitalization, with wide
differentiation across banks (Text Table 2; Figure 8). Average non-performing loans (NPLs) rose
from 13.8 percent at end-2012 to 15.9 percent at end-2013 (and to 16.6 percent in March 2014). The
economic downturn and the impact of temporary measures introduced in March 2013 to reduce the
cost of banking services3 further stressed average bank profitability. Capital adequacy ratios
averaged 12.4 percent in March 2014, just over the 12 percent minimum requirement. However,
there is large variation among banks in all these dimensions (Text Table 2). At end–December 2013,
only 14 out of 21 operating financial institutions were compliant with the minimum capital

In early 2013, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) and the Bankers Association of Zimbabwe (BAZ) signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on a package of measures aimed at promoting savings and strengthening
consumer protection, including caps on the fees for various services and floors on the rates paid on time deposits.
Following a review of the operating environment and consultation with representatives of the BAZ, the RBZ decided
not to renew the MOU, which expired at end-2013.

requirements prescribed in December 2012.4 In January 2014, the authorities reaffirmed the current
minimum capital requirement (US$25 million) and extended the deadline for meeting the US$100
million minimum from June 2014 to December 2020. With most banks unable to meet the June
2014 deadline, there was a risk of a gap in the regulatory framework, unless a more extended
timeframe was adopted. By end-June 2014, all banks are required to submit recapitalization plans,
including interim milestones toward meeting the new deadline.
11.
The authorities have reiterated their commitment to the multicurrency system, which
is dominated by the US dollar in practice, and have recently added four new currencies as legal
tender.5 They stressed that the regime will remain in place over the medium term (until at least
2018) to ensure macroeconomic stability. The authorities agreed that the full restoration of fiscal,
financial, and external sustainability is a pre-requisite before any substantive changes to the
exchange rate regime are considered.
12.
The record of implementing recommendations from the previous Article IV
consultation is mixed. In concluding the 2012 consultation, Executive Directors urged
strengthening fiscal management, improving the expenditure mix, increasing diamond sector
transparency, containing financial sector vulnerabilities, and resuming payments to external
creditors. The authorities’ 2013 budget was based on prudent revenue projections, including
diamond dividends. However, revenue under-performed as growth decelerated at year’s end. Old
domestic arrears were aggressively resolved in 2013, even as higher-than-budgeted expenditures
contributed to the accumulation of new arrears. The wage bill continues to claim a disproportionate
share of total spending, crowding out capital and social expenditures. Progress on structural
reforms, including measures to increase diamond sector transparency, has been slow. The Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has intensified monitoring of troubled banks, but vulnerabilities persist.
Since 2013, Zimbabwe has been making regular payments to the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Trust (PRGT) and to other IFIs.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE SMP
13.
Discussions on the first and second reviews are at an advanced stage. Program
performance has been mixed, and the SMP period, originally scheduled to expire at end-2013, was
extended by Fund Management through end-June 2014 to allow time to strengthen policies.6 Of the
six quantitative targets for the first review, three were met and three were missed for the end-June
2013 test date (Table 9), although most deviations were moderate. The floor on the primary fiscal
balance was missed by 1.3 percent of GDP. The continuous zero ceiling on new domestic arrears was

As of end-December 2012, minimum capital requirements are US$25 million for commercial and merchant banks,
and US$20 million for building societies. There is no minimum capital requirement for People’s Own Saving Bank
(POSB).

missed, in part because the authorities prioritized the clearance of old verified arrears over payment
of unverified new bills. Reflecting fiscal constraints, the floor on usable international reserves was
missed by a small margin, as reserves stayed unchanged rather than show the small increase
targeted. Non-concessional external debt met the continuous ceiling at end-June, but exceeded it
by a relatively small amount at end-November 2013, following the signing of a US$319 million nonconcessional loan with China Eximbank to finance an essential infrastructure project (the overhaul of
the Kariba hydroelectric plant).
14.
For the end-December 2013 test date, the authorities met three of the six revised
quantitative targets. They met the floors on the stock of usable international reserves and on PRGT
payments, and the continuous ceiling on the stock of new non-concessional external debt. They
missed the target for the primary fiscal balance on a cash basis by about 1.6 percent of GDP, due to
significant weakness in tax revenues in the last quarter of 2013 (Figure 4). Given the very tight fiscal
space in Q4 of 2013, the authorities missed the floor on protected social spending by about 0.3
percent of GDP and the stock of domestic arrears overshot its ceiling by a similar margin.
15.
The electoral process and the post-election transition delayed the implementation of
structural reforms. Eventually, three of the five structural benchmarks for the first review were met,
as was one of the five structural benchmarks for the second review (Table 10):


The new Income Tax Bill was submitted to Parliament in May 2013 and passed in June 2013;



the new framework for contingency planning and systemic risk management was submitted to
the RBZ Board and approved in October 2013;



the time-bound action plan by the Public Service Commission7 on measures to modernize
human resource management and payroll systems was submitted to the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development (MoFED) in mid-December 2013; and



the RBZ Debt Assumption Bill (formerly the RBZ Debt Relief Bill) was approved by Cabinet in
November 2013 and submitted to Parliament in April 2014.

16.
The report on the stock of verified pre-2013 domestic arrears was finalized in midDecember 2013. While the report itself was not published on MoFED’s website, the total stock of
domestic arrears and the strategy to clear it were both made public in the 2014 National Budget
Statement submitted to Parliament in December 2013.
17.
Regarding a new Mines and Minerals Act, the new government decided to accomplish
its objectives through amendments to the Act. After extensive consultations with stakeholders,
the amendments will be submitted to Cabinet in June 2014. The authorities also decided to prioritize
these amendments over amendments to the Precious Stones Trade Act, which are now expected to
be completed in the second half of 2014.

18.
The new government is reviewing the amendments to the Banking Act, for which a
draft was at an advanced state. The principles for the amendments will be submitted to Cabinet in
June 2014 and to Parliament in July 2014.
19.
The statutory instrument establishing a formula for diamond dividends was not issued
due to the lack of enabling legislation, but broadly equivalent measures have been introduced
in 2014 to increase diamond revenues and boost transparency in the industry. First, the 2014
Finance Act, signed into law in April 2014, introduced the withholding of a special dividend equal to
15 percent of the gross proceeds from diamond sales.8 Second, the authorities constituted a joint
task force composed of technical staff from MoFED, the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development
(MoMMD), and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority to forecast and monitor diamond-related revenue
flows. Third, the authorities submitted to Parliament the 2012 audited financial accounts of the
Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and published them online in May 2014.
Finally, following the lifting of EU sanctions against the ZMDC, the Minerals Marketing Corporation
of Zimbabwe successfully conducted two diamond auctions in Antwerp (in December 2013 and
February 2014) and one in Dubai (March 2014). Going forward, the authorities intend to ensure that
all diamonds are sold through auctions at international trading centers. More fundamentally, the
authorities are analyzing the structure of the diamond sector to streamline the number of
companies in it. They also intend to undertake a thorough reassessment of the fiscal regime for
mining, including diamond mining.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
20.
Growth is projected to be sluggish over the short to medium term (Figure 9). A
comprehensive and determined reform program would be necessary to foster investment, especially
foreign, and boost productivity beyond the baseline. Given the weak momentum coming out of
2013, it is hard to see a vigorous economic recovery in 2014. Agricultural and mining exports are
projected to accelerate in 2014, due to another strong tobacco season and increased output of gold
and platinum. This will offset the continued shrinking of the industrial sector, under pressure from
competing imports from South Africa. (A key fact is that, despite the status of the South African rand
as legal tender under the multi-currency regime, labor contracts in Zimbabwe are universally
denominated in U.S. dollars.) The current account balance should improve over the medium term as
export capacity increases, but the current account deficit is expected to remain high, averaging
around 15 percent of GDP in the medium term. Fiscal consolidation should permit a modest rebuilding of international reserves. Inflation is projected to remain very low during 2014 (0.2 percent),
picking up to 1.2 percent in 2015.

The withholding has been suspended until further consultations with mining companies are completed.

Box 1. Zimbabwe: Deflation Risks
Zimbabwe’s 12-month inflation rate decelerated from 2.9 percent at end-2012 to -0.3 percent in April 2014. The
deceleration is partly driven by weak aggregate demand. A closer inspection of CPI components indicates that
deflationary pressures have been stronger in traded sectors (Box Figure 1), suggesting that pass-through from a
depreciating rand also plays an important role. There are benefits and costs from deflation for Zimbabwe.
On the upside, temporarily falling prices benefit consumers with job security. By delivering a boost to aggregate
demand, falling prices may contribute to eroding the country’s negative output gap. Deflation could also correct
the existing overvaluation in the real exchange rate, although that would require prices of non-traded inputs
(notably labor) and final goods to fall faster than the prices of traded goods, which has not been the case so far.
Finally, falling prices boost the real money supply and could alleviate somewhat the persistent liquidity shortages.
On the downside, persistent deflation may increase the real burden of existing debt in a country that is already
under financial stress. However, Zimbabwe’s financial underdevelopment (low stocks of loans and deposits, with
short maturities) may mitigate this effect. Deflation

In the medium term, structural reforms that improve
the business environment and stimulate domestic
and foreign investment could offset the deflationary
impulse. In the near term, in the absence of monetary
policy tools, the authorities must avoid exacerbating
the distortions and imbalances, for example, by
resisting the impulse to restrict imports and by
avoiding further public sector wage increases, which
put pressure on salary negotiations elsewhere in the
economy.

Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside (see Risk Assessment Matrix,
Table 7). The most immediate risk is failure to set government finances on a sustainable path.
Absent measures to re-prioritize government spending, vital government functions could suffer and
stability may be jeopardized. Significant uncertainty still surrounds the implementation of the
indigenization policy, which has a chilling effect on foreign investment. While the rhetoric on this
issue has been toned down somewhat and a new approach has been mooted, it is still not clear
what this will imply outside the extractive sectors, as a case-by-case approach seems to be the
government’s preferred choice. Financial sector vulnerabilities and adverse weather conditions
present other significant domestic risks. A protracted period of lower growth in advanced and
emerging economies (particularly Europe and China) could lower global demand for key mineral
exports (gold, platinum, diamonds) and dampen growth. Real spillovers from South Africa are
unlikely to be significant, although persistent weakness in the rand would hurt Zimbabwean light
manufacturing, already under stress. There are also risks of sustained deflation in Zimbabwe (Box 1).

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s medium-term outlook and risk assessment.
However, the authorities remained confident that the timely and full implementation of ZIM ASSET,
their development blueprint for the next five years, could result in better growth prospects over the
medium term. The authorities expressed their commitment to set government finances on a
sustainable footing, implement financial sector reforms, and clarify their indigenization and
empowerment policy. They reaffirmed their commitment to continued engagement with the IFIs and
their interest in a successor SMP.

RESTORING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
ADVANCING THE FISCAL REFORM AGENDA
23.
The 2014 budget targets are in doubt in the context of the weaker economic forecast
and wage pressures. The target for total revenue in the 2014 budget statement (US$4,120 million
or 30.6 percent of GDP, including US$96 million in diamond dividends) is at risk following weak
revenue performance in Q1 and the downward revision in growth projections for 2014. The agreed
14 percent increase to the overall wage bill is another source of stress to the budget. Finally, the
need to rebuild depleted government deposits, amortize domestic and selected external debt, and
modestly increase international reserves all raise the government’s gross financing requirements in
2014.
24.
To offset these pressures, the government has identified revenue and expenditure
measures, and plans on a modest amount of net domestic financing. The Minister of Finance
and Economic Development is expected to present the fiscal adjustment package to Cabinet in
early-June 2014. The revenue measures are worth about 2.8 percent of GDP and include selective
increases in customs duties, targeted tax compliance operations, non-tax revenues (surplus
resources generated by several extra-budgetary funds), as well as additional customs revenues from
a determined effort to address identified leakages. Expenditure measures are worth 1.8 percent of
GDP and include re-prioritizing non-personnel, non-interest current expenditure, while ring-fencing
high-value social spending. As a result of these measures, the authorities now project total revenues
to reach a conservative US$4,014 million (29.8 percent of GDP) in 2014, while total cash
expenditures are projected at US$4,092 (30.4 percent of GDP). If fully implemented, these measures
could result in a small budget deficit of US$78 million (around 0.6 percent of GDP) in 2014, on a
cash basis.
25.
The main degree of freedom left relates to diamond dividends. Unlocking this revenue
source will require full and prompt implementation of the measures announced in the 2014 budget.
These measures include disallowing royalty as a deductible expense against taxable income,
withholding a 2.5 percent depletion fee, withholding royalties on diamond sales (15 percent of gross
sales), and withholding 15 percent of gross proceeds from diamond sales as interim (“special”)
dividends for direct payment to the Treasury. All these measures were included in the 2014 Finance
Act signed by the President in April. The implementation of the 15 percent special dividend

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

withholding has been suspended for now, pending further consultations with mining companies,
which are resisting it on grounds that it would reduce their ability to invest in new production. The
consultations are scheduled for June, and the authorities are keen to start collecting these dividends
soon. As a result, the authorities still project diamond dividends of US$82 million in 2014 (versus the
original US$96 million in the 2014 budget), but there are risks of further delays.
Staff recommendations
26.
Staff sees the revised fiscal target for 2014 (a cash deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP) as
broadly appropriate. It represents a significant fiscal adjustment relative to 2013 (which closed with
a deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP). Staff welcomes recent steps to increase diamond revenue
transparency and urges the authorities to speedily implement the announced measures to mobilize
diamond dividends, including by defining a clear date to lift the current suspension on them. Staff
encourages the authorities to also consider tax reforms in line with previous Fund TA
recommendations (for example, by increasing excises on some alcoholic beverages and by changing
the VAT status of some goods from zero-rated to exempt). Staff further encourages the authorities
to identify additional potential revenue and financing sources which may need to be mobilized if
risks to current revenue projections materialize.
27.
Rebalancing the expenditure mix and advancing public financial management (PFM)
reforms remain critical for medium-term fiscal sustainability. With employment costs (including
grant-aided institutions and pensions) accounting for 79 percent of projected total revenue and a
similar fraction of proposed spending in 2014, the expenditure mix is clearly unsustainable. A large
public sector wage bill and unclear remuneration policies going forward put at risk the
government’s ability to achieve its objectives under ZIM ASSET. Staff urges the adoption of a
medium-term fiscal strategy aimed at rebalancing expenditure away from employment costs in
order to increase capital investment and spending on social programs. Going forward, staff supports
the authorities’ commitment to hold nominal wage increases in line with inflation and to maintain
the hiring freeze, except in critical areas and only if these vacancies cannot be filled through internal
mobility. To minimize the risk of additional fiscal stress in 2014, it is also essential that the
authorities refrain from further wage increases this year. If these recommendations are
implemented, total employment costs (including pensions and grant-aided institutions) could
decline under 20 percent of GDP by 2019. The authorities should also continue to protect highvalue, high-impact social spending, and they should aim to gradually raise capital spending and net
lending to around 4-5 percent of GDP in the medium term.
28.
Staff encourages targeting a gradual strengthening of the fiscal balances over the
medium term. Targeting a medium-term primary cash balance between 1.5 and 2 percent of GDP
will help the government rebuild fiscal and external buffers and generate debt servicing capacity,
which will be needed to move ahead with debt restructuring. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans
to strengthen financial monitoring and oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and local
authorities.

29.
Tackling the stock of domestic payments arrears should remain a priority, but
significant progress in 2014 is unlikely. Given the very tight resource constraints in 2014, the
authorities plan to prioritize the clearance of pre-2013 domestic arrears (some $23 million) by yearend. On the other hand, given the inadequate provisions for service providers in the 2014 budget
(US$56 million versus projected bills of US$126 million), 2014 is likely to see a net accumulation of
domestic arrears of about 0.8 percent of GDP. There is a risk that arrears will grow further if tax and
nontax collections fall short of projections and the authorities are unable to take offsetting revenue
and financing measures. The authorities are committed to eliminating the total stock of end-2014
domestic arrears by end-2016. Going forward, progress on this issue will require more realistic
budgeting, combined with improved expenditure controls and measures to curb consumption.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities acknowledged that 2013 was a difficult year, agreed that their fiscal
plans face significant short-term risks, and concurred that strengthening fiscal balances in the
medium term is an important objective. They are determined to unlock diamond revenues and
make the sector more transparent. They emphasized that they have considered advice from previous
TA on tax policy and have implemented many of the recommendations. Making further progress in
this area is conditioned on a stronger economic outlook. The authorities welcome further Fund TA
on reforming the fiscal regime for extractive industries and on medium-term expenditure
frameworks. Although agreeing that the wage bill represents a large fraction of overall spending, the
authorities indicated that the new government had campaigned on the promise of higher pay for
civil servants, which needed to be fulfilled this year. They have expressed their intention to reduce
the weight of the public sector wage bill in total spending over time, noting that the speed with
which they can achieve this objective will be affected in part by the growth rate of the economy. The
authorities are prepared to implement further expenditure reprioritization measures, in case
revenues underperform, relative to revised 2014 projections. Finally, they have expressed their
determination to improve the oversight of SOEs and local authorities, which are a significant source
of fiscal risk.

REDUCING FINANCIAL SECTOR VULNERABILITIES
31.
Despite efforts to enhance the legal and regulatory framework, financial sector
vulnerabilities persist. The RBZ has intensified monitoring of troubled banks, with a particular
focus on loan provisioning practices and risk management. Most of these banks are insolvent, but
continue to intermediate. While the troubled banks are not systemically important, there is a risk of
disorderly resolution of these banks, which could further affect already weak confidence in the
system. The new framework for contingency planning and systemic crisis management, which was
approved by the RBZ Board in October 2013, will provide a set of policies and processes necessary
for prevention and management of banking crises. The framework is to be shared with the
Multidisciplinary Financial Stability Committee. Furthermore, the planned amendments to the
Banking Act, which are aimed at improving corporate governance and strengthening the Troubled
and Insolvent Bank Resolution Framework, will help to enhance stability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ZIMBABWE

32.
To address deteriorating asset quality and restore confidence, serious consideration
should be given to closing troubled banks (if non-systemic), or at least ring-fencing them, for
example, by restricting their ability to take new deposits from the public. With the help of
outside consultants, the RBZ is developing a framework for NPL resolution. Any strategy to deal with
this issue should avoid rewarding poor past lending decisions and should be accompanied by a
strong focus on the risk that current economic conditions and poor lending practices could result in
further growth in NPLs. In January 2014, the RBZ announced an immediate end to new insider and
related-party loans: banks’ boards are required to review the levels of insider loans, ensure adequate
provisioning, and report regularly to the RBZ.9 The RBZ’s decision to allow more time to meet the
increase in the minimum capital requirements is justified, as the June 2014 deadline for reaching a
minimum capital of US$100 million was looming with most banks being far below that level. In the
period ahead, the RBZ will need to closely monitor observance of the interim milestones for
progress towards the December 2020 minimum capital requirements. The AFTRADES interbank
liquidity facility is a worthwhile policy experiment and offers potential for improving the operations
of the interbank market without significant fiscal risks.
33.
Steps are being taken to recapitalize the RBZ, to allow it to resume some of its core
functions. The authorities announced plans for the central government to assume all of RBZ’s noncore debt (some 10 percent of GDP, largely non-performing). In addition, they announced plans for
the RBZ to resume its function as banker to the government, and to establish a fully-funded lenderof-last resort (LOLR) facility to accommodate solvent banks. As an initial step, in March and April
2014 the authorities issued $146 million in debt instruments to settle RBZ legacy debts related to
old foreign currency accounts. The authorities believe that these measures will strengthen financial
stability. Staff recommends that the timing of the implementation of these steps take into account
fiscal pressures. In particular, the LOLR facility should be implemented only after the present period
of high fiscal stress is over, and liquidity support should only be provided to solvent banks.
34.
Staff supports a cautious and gradual approach to the transfer of the treasury account
from the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) to the RBZ. The transfer carries implementation
risk, as the RBZ has not performed this function for several years, is not able to provide an overdraft
facility, and its information systems are still not fully linked to the Treasury systems. Thus, it should
take place only after the RBZ balance sheet has been sufficiently strengthened and its IT systems
have been linked to the government’s own public financial management information system. There
should be a sufficiently long transition period during which clear arrangements are maintained with
CBZ to back-stop and cover any cash-flow gaps. Furthermore, this change will require of MoFED and
RBZ close coordination and stronger cash management.
35.
In designing and implementing the indigenization policy for the financial sector,
priority must be given to financial sector stability. Staff urges the authorities to ensure that the
application of the indigenization policy is consistent with existing financial sector laws and
prudential regulations, in order not to endanger bank access to external sources of financing.
9

Out of a total of US$175.3 million in insider loans at end-December 2013, US$117.4 million (67 percent) are NPLs.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities concurred that financial sector vulnerabilities remain but emphasized
that recently announced initiatives should enhance stability. The RBZ considers the financial
sector to be generally stable, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and institutionspecific deficiencies. The RBZ plans to request Fund TA on its NPL resolution strategy. Work is under
way to finalize the framework for a credit reference bureau which is expected to reduce asymmetric
information and improve credit risk management. The authorities emphasized that the troubled
banks are not systemic, but agreed that disorderly unwinding of any of these banks would further
undermine confidence. The authorities indicated that the efficient resolution of troubled banks is
hampered by the RBZ’s lack of direct administrative authority to take necessary actions. For both
curatorships and liquidations, the RBZ must consult with MoFED, and banks have the right to appeal
to the finance minister, all of which tend to cause delays. (The Fund is providing TA in these areas.)
The authorities expect financial institutions facing challenges to raise capital, consolidate their
operations, merge with healthier banks, or convert their banking licenses to become deposit-taking
microfinance institutions.
37.
The authorities remain committed to restoring the role of the central bank in their
efforts to enhance financial intermediation. They emphasized that the recapitalization of the RBZ
is a precondition for the safe transfer of the treasury account to the RBZ. These steps in turn will
enable the RBZ to support the reactivation of the interbank market, thereby enhancing stability and
increasing confidence. On indigenization of the banking system, the authorities remain committed
to implementing this policy in a flexible way that safeguards financial stability.

RESOLVING EXTERNAL PAYMENTS ARREARS, RESTORING
EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS
38.
Zimbabwe’s external arrears are large and increasing. Estimated external debt
obligations at end-2013 amount to US$10.6 billion (over 80 percent of GDP, of which more than half
represents arrears). The authorities have concluded a second round of debt data assessment as of
end-2012. Following their first reconciliation exercise in 2011, all official creditors were contacted,
but only one creditor responded and agreed with the results. Greater effort is needed to seek
agreements with all official creditors, including multilaterals. At the authorities’ request, the African
Development Bank (AfDB) is providing technical assistance to explore the path to re-engagement
with international creditors.
39.
The authorities have continued to make regular payments to the IFIs. The authorities
have been making monthly payments of US$150,000 to the PRGT. The authorities are also making
quarterly payments to the World Bank (US$900,000) and to the AfDB (US$500,000). The authorities
have continued the discussion with the IFIs on the appropriate size of payments going forward. They
remain committed to gradually increasing the size of IFI payments as the country’s capacity to pay
improves. While the authorities are committed to avoid selective debt servicing, they will continue to
make payments to those creditors providing positive net financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ZIMBABWE

40.
Since the approval of the SMP in June 2013, two new external loans for infrastructure
development have been signed. The new loans are with China Eximbank (US$319 million) and with
India Eximbank (US$28.6 million). The weighted average concessionality of the loans is 26.5 percent,
falling short of the minimum 35 percent requirement.10 Although the authorities needed to urgently
address energy and water supply constraints, a more proactive collaboration with Fund staff could
have prevented the marginal breach of the SMP continuous ceiling on non-concessional external
debt of $330 million in November 2013. Moreover, new non-concessional borrowing poses risks for
debt relief discussions with creditors down the road.
41.
Given the large outstanding external arrears, Zimbabwe will remain in debt distress in
the absence of debt relief. The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA, EBS 14/139,
Supplement 2) confirmed that debt indicators exceed the relevant indicative thresholds. Zimbabwe’s
debt situation remains vulnerable to shocks, particularly to lower export and GDP growth. The
country’s debt outlook is also sensitive to negative shocks to financial terms and to non-debt
creating flows.
42.
The authorities have expressed their commitment to re-engaging with all creditors
and to minimizing new non-concessional external debt. With regard to possible external
financing options, they will primarily seek grants and concessional borrowing to finance critical
development projects with high economic returns. If grants and concessional borrowing are not
available or insufficient, limited new non-concessional external debt could be considered for
growth-enhancing projects, subject to a continuous ceiling of 3 percent of GDP in 2014 (unchanged
from 2013). Currently, the authorities are discussing with China Eximbank another loan of about
US$220 million to expand telecommunication coverage. The authorities have re-affirmed their
commitment to seek independent assessment of the economic and social impact of projects funded
with non-concessional loans. They will also consult with Fund staff if and when new feasible projects
and borrowing opportunities emerge.
43.
Continued strengthening of debt management legislation is critical. The first step is
Cabinet approval of the principles for a Public Debt Management Bill. When enacted, the new bill
will provide MoFED with a stronger and more effective mandate to plan, negotiate, and monitor
external borrowing operations. It will also bolster the institutional role of the Debt Management
Office at MoFED.
44.
Zimbabwe’s external position remains precarious (Appendix I). In the last few years, the
current account deficit has been very large, but it is projected to moderate in the medium term as
mining production accelerates. Long-term external borrowing is likely to remain the key source of
financing for the current account. IMF staff estimates an overvaluation of Zimbabwe’s real exchange
rate of between 21 and 23 percent. In a fully dollarized economy, macroeconomic adjustment could
come from relative price adjustments or from productivity growth. At less than one month of import

10

The China Eximbank has a 20-year maturity, with a grace period of 5-7 years, and a 2-percent interest rate, which is
equivalent to a grant element of 28.3 percent. The India Eximbank loan has a grant elements of 4.1 percent.

cover, usable international reserves are currently well below the standard 3-month threshold and the
Low-Income Country (LIC) metric which indicates that Zimbabwe’s foreign reserves should cover 6
to 16 months of imports. A more ambitious pace of reserve accumulation is urgently needed to
rebuild external buffers. Zimbabwe’s external competitiveness remains weak. Protracted policy
uncertainty and poor governance present serious obstacles to foreign investors interested in doing
business in Zimbabwe. Obsolete infrastructure and cumbersome administrative barriers undermine
the business environment and overburden the private sector. Zimbabwe ranks very low in the World
Bank’s Doing Business indicators (170th) and below average for Sub-Saharan African countries in the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index.
Authorities’ views
45.
The authorities reaffirmed their strategy to continue to seek non-concessional external
financing for critical development projects only, while pointing out how challenging it is to
obtain grants and concessional loans for their development agenda in the context of their
large external arrears. They reaffirmed their objective to reach agreements with creditors on
reconciled external debt data, ideally before September 2014. The authorities also shared staff’s
views about the need to speed up the implementation of structural reforms, particularly those which
do not incur significant budgetary costs, in order to regain external competitiveness.

UNLOCKING POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINED
INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
46.
The new government has formulated an ambitious agenda for development (ZIM
ASSET). The plan is built around four main clusters: food security and nutrition, social services and
poverty eradication, infrastructure and utilities, and value addition and beneficiation. ZIM ASSET
targets a medium-term growth rate of around 6 percent, driven by large infrastructure investments.
However, large levels of financing would be needed to implement ZIM ASSET. Implementation is
also likely to run into domestic capacity constraints. The authorities’ financing plan is premised on
joint ventures, diaspora resources, external financing, and, most importantly, an abundance of
domestic mineral resources, some of which would be channeled via a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF).
However, access to external financing is very limited and recourse to new non-concessional external
debt to fund these projects would exacerbate debt distress and complicate the process of arrears
clearance and debt restructuring. In addition, while the beneficiation objectives of ZIM ASSET
contain positive elements, sufficient consideration should be given to domestic capacity
constraints.11
47.
Staff recommends delaying the introduction of the SWF. The authorities propose a SWF
funded with 25 percent of mining royalties and dedicated to financing selective investment projects
11

For example, domestic smelting of minerals in Zimbabwe could backfire because smelting is energy-intensive
whereas Zimbabwe suffers from limited generation capacity, resulting already in frequent power shortages.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and accumulating financial assets. Although such a mechanism might be helpful over the medium
term, the present fiscal stress makes it imperative that the government avoid tying its hands by
earmarking revenues. Staff encourages the authorities to re-examine the fiscal regime for extractive
industries before launching the SWF.
48.
Addressing infrastructure deficits, enhancing the business climate, and improving
governance and policy consistency are critical for boosting productivity and competitiveness.
Uncertainty about the implementation of the indigenization and empowerment policy, together with
weak enforcement of property rights remain powerful deterrents to private investment, both foreign
and domestic. More clarity about land property rights could enhance agricultural productivity by
facilitating access to credit. Staff welcomes the authorities’ increased emphasis on the
empowerment component of the indigenization and empowerment policy, and encourages them to
enhance the predictability and transparency of the indigenization component. Staff welcomes recent
announcements about the authorities’ intention to reform labor laws in order to make them more
flexible and to link compensation to productivity. In pursuing these reforms, care should be taking
not to undermine basic labor protections.
Authorities’ views
49.
The authorities agree that the business climate continues to be constrained by policy
inconsistency and uncertainty, as well as by slow progress in implementing key policies, while
adding that external sanctions also affect Zimbabwean businesses. To ensure the effective
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of ZIM ASSET, overall leadership and guidance is
provided by the Office of the President and Cabinet. The authorities plan to implement reforms to
improve procedures for starting a business, registering property, paying taxes, resolving insolvency,
and trading across borders. They are determined to improve contract enforcement and reform the
labor market to make it more flexible. They have decided to postpone further steps on creating a
SWF until the macroeconomic outlook improves. The authorities are also concerned that power
shortages might thwart the beneficiation objectives of ZIM ASSET, and plan to require that future
beneficiation projects include new power-generating capacity for their own use. They also point out
that external sanctions have a chilling effect that, in practice, reaches well beyond the individuals
and firms specifically designated as their targets.

18

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Sustaining growth will require a renewed commitment to reform. As the rebound effect
wanes, achieving fast and inclusive growth over the medium term will require a determined push to
strengthen macroeconomic and financial policies, create an enabling business environment, and
normalize relations with creditors. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to preserve the
multicurrency system until at least 2018, which will help reduce uncertainty. On the indigenization
and empowerment policy, the more differentiated approach (by sector) and the de-emphasizing of
equity-holding targets mooted by the authorities seem positive steps, but the current case-by-case
negotiated approach is still problematic. More predictability and clarity on sector-specific policies
are needed to attract foreign investment.
51.
External imbalances and vulnerabilities remain high. The persistent large current account
deficit, continued unresolved arrears, and insufficient international reserves are all clear signs of a
precarious and fragile external position. It is further complicated by an overvalued real exchange
rate. Staff supports the authorities’ strategy to primarily seek grants and highly concessional
resources while limiting non-concessional financing to a few critical development projects. Staff
continues to recommend early consultation on proposals for new non-concessional external debt.
52.
The SMP provided a useful macroeconomic anchor for Zimbabwe in a difficult election
year, and the new authorities’ commitment to the program is welcome. In the context of a
lengthy electoral process and post-election transition, progress in implementing the policies under
the SMP was limited, as many policy decisions were postponed. Nevertheless, budgetary stability,
although tested, was broadly preserved, usable external reserves were maintained, important
structural reforms took place, and others have been restarted in early 2014. A successor SMP should
build on past achievements, be anchored on significant progress in the implementation of key
structural reforms, and support a stronger policy framework.
53.
The immediate challenge for the authorities is to execute their revised fiscal plan for
2014. The authorities must implement their adjustment program fully, and be ready to take
additional actions should revenue fall short of revised projections, while protecting priority
infrastructure and social spending. Good progress was made in 2013 in reducing the stock of
domestic arrears. Unfortunately, 2014 is likely to bring new domestic arrears. To prevent the
accumulation of future domestic arrears, the authorities need to further strengthen expenditure
controls, implement measures to curb consumption, and ensure adequate budgetary provisions for
domestic service providers.
54.
Addressing the unsustainable expenditure mix is the key medium-term challenge in
the fiscal sector, with implications that go beyond the public finances. Large employment costs
are crowding out social and investment spending—in fact, competing for resources with ZIM ASSET.
High salary increases in the public sector influence wage negotiations elsewhere, exacerbating
imbalances in the real exchange rate. While this situation cannot be resolved overnight, it is essential
to begin addressing it as soon as possible and to maintain the focus over the medium term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ZIMBABWE

55.
Increasing transparency in the diamond sector remains critical for improving fiscal
management and good governance. Recent measures to increase diamond sector transparency
are steps in the right direction. The authorities should follow through on their commitments to
modernize mining legislation and implement the withholding of interim diamond dividends.
56.
Enhancing financial sector stability and restoring confidence in the banking system
must remain a priority. Staff urges continued vigilance in monitoring weak banks and a proactive
approach to avoid the disorderly resolution of insolvent, non-systemic banks. Advancing the
restructuring of the financially distressed RBZ will help mitigate financial sector vulnerabilities and
bolster the medium-term viability of the multicurrency system. Staff strongly urges the authorities to
give priority to financial stability in designing and implementing the indigenization policy for the
financial sector.
57.
While Zimbabwe remains in debt distress, staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment
to continue making regular payments to the PRGT, to rebuild external buffers, and to refrain
from drawing down their remaining SDR holdings. Strong macroeconomic policies and a
comprehensive arrears clearance framework, supported by development partners, will be essential
to addressing Zimbabwe’s debt problems. Staff urges the authorities to engage in coordinated
discussions with the World Bank Group and the other IFIs on future payments, to increase the size of
payments as capacity to repay improves, and to respect the preferred creditor status of the IFIs.
Selective debt service to bilateral creditors should be avoided, as this will complicate reaching an
agreement with creditors on a debt resolution strategy. Staff encourages the authorities to continue
to minimize new non-concessional external debt and to seek external financing on terms as
favorable as possible for critical development projects with high economic returns.
58.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the regular 12month cycle.

Impact if Realized

Policy Advice/Response

High
Further weakening of revenue, whether from
lower tax collections or further postponement of
the special diamond dividend, or any further
increases in civil servants’ pay in 2014 could
increase fiscal stress, crowd out social spending
and capital investment, and cause the
unplanned accumulation of new domestic
arrears.

Implement the announced measures to
mobilize diamond dividends and
increase diamond revenue
transparency. Refrain from further
wage increases in 2014 and maintain
the hiring freeze, except in critical
areas. Be prepared to take necessary
actions should revenue fall short of
revised projections, while protecting
priority infrastructure and social
spending.
Clarify the indigenization and
empowerment policy and enhance
predictability and transparency. Give
priority to financial sector stability and
ensure application of the policy is
consistent with existing financial sector
laws and prudential regulations.
Take a proactive approach to avoid
disorderly resolution of troubled banks.
Give serious consideration to closing
insolvent, non-systemic banks.
Advance the restructuring of the RBZ
and other financial sector reforms.
Implement the authorities’
development agenda which includes
plans to build or rehabilitate irrigation
schemes, to increase the availability of
affordable energy for irrigation, and to
create a self-sufficient agricultural
sector.
Make progress towards fiscal
consolidation to build fiscal and
external buffers to cushion shocks.
Create an enabling business
environment, and normalize relations
with creditors. Diversify the economy
by boosting agriculture, manufacturing,
and services.

Destabilizing effects from
the indigenization and
empowerment policy
(short to medium term)

Medium

Medium
Continued uncertainties over implementation
would limit FDI inflows. Indigenization in the
banking sector could exacerbate existing risks to
financial stability.

Risks to financial stability
from incomplete
regulatory reforms
(medium term)

Medium

Adverse weather
conditions
(short term)

Medium

Medium to High
Delays could aggravate vulnerabilities. Further
deterioration in corporate governance, asset
quality, and bank capitalization would lead to
loss of confidence, worsening liquidity
conditions, and possible bank runs.
Medium
Erratic rainfall and drought have impacted
agricultural production in the past. With
agriculture accounting for 11 percent of GDP,
adverse weather conditions could severely affect
growth and food security.

Protracted period of slow
growth in advanced and
emerging economies

High

Medium to High
A protracted slowdown, particularly in Europe
and China, could lower commodity prices and
hurt Zimbabwe’s key exports. This would
undermine the country’s external and fiscal
positions and reduce near- and long-term
growth prospects, as mining capacity might
shrink in response. Such a shock could also
reduce financial inflows which would exacerbate
liquidity shortages and cause BOP difficulties.

1

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix I. Zimbabwe: Assessment of External Stability and
Competitiveness
1.
An assessment of Zimbabwe’s competitiveness and external stability is complicated by
insufficient data availability and large structural changes. Dollarization rules out the nominal
exchange rate as a tool of macroeconomic adjustment, and exchange rate misalignment can only be
addressed through relative prices changes and productivity gains. In the last few years, the current
account deficit has been very large, but it is projected to moderate in the medium term as mining
production accelerates (Figure 1). Long-term external borrowing is likely to remain the key source of
financing for the current account (Figure 2).

2.
Boosting competitiveness requires a strong push to address structural bottlenecks.
Substantial efforts are needed to improve the business environment, which plays a crucial role in
catalyzing domestic and foreign investment. Improving basic infrastructure and removing legal and
regulatory obstacles are essential to creating favorable investment conditions and boosting external
competitiveness.
3.
Limited progress has been made in boosting competitiveness. Zimbabwe’s rank in
qualitative competitiveness indicators has remained near the bottom of the list. While Zimbabwe is
above the Sub-Saharan Africa average, only marginal gains have been made in The World Bank’s
Ease of Doing Business rankings (Figure 3).1 In the case of the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Index (Figure 4), Zimbabwe’s ranking deteriorated in 2013-14. Limited progress has
been made in improving government effectiveness and perceptions of corruption remain high, with
some deterioration in the area of voice and accountability. Governance indicators show limited

These indicators should be interpreted with caution, due to the limited number of respondents, limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

progress in crucial areas, including the judiciary, property rights, and government effectiveness
(Figure 5).
4.
The exchange rate assessment confirms substantial risks for competitiveness in the
medium term, despite the projected decline in the current account deficit. A more sustainable
external position could only be achieved with a strong and timely implementation of structural
reforms aimed at expanding productive capacity and diversifying the economy.

Standard methodologies2 indicate that the real effective exchange rate is overvalued.
The macroeconomic balance approach points to an overvaluation of between 21 and 23 percent
depending on estimated parameters, while the external sustainability assessment indicates an
overvaluation of 23 percent. However, these imbalances are expected to decline in the medium-term,

6.
At less than one month of import cover, Zimbabwe’s usable reserves are well below all
standard thresholds. The standard minimum is 3 months of import coverage, while the Low-Income
Country (LIC) metric3 indicates that reserves should cover 6 to 16 months of imports in Zimbabwe’s
case, assuming an opportunity cost to holding reserves in the range of 2-6 percent (Figures 6 and 7).
Currently, remaining SDR holdings are the main component of usable international reserves. A more
ambitious pace of reserve accumulation is urgently needed to rebuild external buffers.
7.
The LIC metric might underestimate Zimbabwe’s need for external buffers. In a
dollarized economy, international reserves play an important role not only in mitigating the impact
of external shocks, but also in providing adequate resources to ensure a stable financial system.
However, the LIC metric does not take into account this second factor. On the other hand, the
opportunity cost to holding reserves in a country like Zimbabwe could be higher than 6 percent,
given large infrastructure needs.

Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI):
Not Applicable
Application of Remedial Measures under the Arrears Strategy:
Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001. On September 24, 2001,
the Executive Board declared Zimbabwe ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund and
removed it from the list of PRGT-eligible countries. On June 13, 2002, the Board issued a declaration
of non-cooperation with respect to Zimbabwe and suspended all technical assistance (TA) to the
country. On June 6, 2003, the Board suspended Zimbabwe’s voting and related rights at the Fund.
The Managing Director issued a complaint regarding compulsory withdrawal on February 6, 2004.
The Executive Board considered the complaint on July 7, 2004, on February 15, 2005, and again on
September 9, 2005, and decided to postpone the recommendation on Zimbabwe’s compulsory
withdrawal from the Fund to the Board of Governors so as to give more time for Zimbabwe to
improve cooperation with the Fund. On February 15, 2006, Zimbabwe fully settled its arrears to the
General Resources Account. As a consequence, the complaint for compulsory withdrawal was
withdrawn. However, the Executive Board decided not to restore Zimbabwe’s voting and related
rights, nor did it terminate Zimbabwe’s ineligibility to use the general resources of the Fund. The
Executive Board also kept in place the decisions taken to address Zimbabwe’s arrears to the PRGT
Trust—the declaration of noncooperation, the suspension of TA, and the removal of Zimbabwe from
the list of PRGT-eligible countries.
On May 4, 2009, the Executive Board lifted the suspension of TA to Zimbabwe in the following areas:
(i) tax policy and administration; (ii) payments system; (iii) lender-of-last-resort and banking
supervision; and (iv) central banking governance and accounting (EBS/09/55). On February 19, 2010,
the Executive Board restored Zimbabwe’s voting rights and its eligibility for general resources. On
May 17, 2010, the Executive Board added macroeconomic statistics to the targeted areas for Fund
TA. On January 4, 2011, it added public financial management and anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism. On October 23, 2012, the Executive Board further relaxed the
restrictions on Fund TA to Zimbabwe to include any other area that would support the formulation
and implementation of a comprehensive adjustment and structural reform program that can be
monitored by the staff. Zimbabwe’s arrears to the PRGT Trust amounted to SDR 81.1 million
(US$125.6 million) as of April 30, 2014.

Nonfinancial Relations

Exchange Arrangement
Zimbabwe’s exchange system has been significantly liberalized and exchange rates have been
unified. Apart from one remaining exchange restriction subject to IMF jurisdiction arising from
unsettled balances under an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with Malaysia, payments and
transfers for current international transactions can now be effected without restriction.

ZIMBABWE

Since 2009, Zimbabwe has adopted a multi-currency regime, including the U.S. dollar, the South
African rand, the British pound, the euro and the Botswana pula—with the U.S. dollar as principal
currency. The Australian dollar, the Chinese yuan, the Indian rupee and the Japanese yen were
added to the list in February 2014. The use of the Zimbabwean dollar as domestic currency has been
discontinued. The de facto exchange regime is classified as exchange arrangement with no separate
legal tender.
Article IV Consultations
Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed the staff

WORLD BANK—IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Fund Zimbabwe team led by Mr. A. Cuevas (mission chief) met with the World Bank
Zimbabwe team, led by Mr. N. Lenneiye (country manager) on March 17, 2014.
2.
The teams were encouraged by the policy dialogue with the new government, and
agreed that strong policies and reforms are needed to unlock Zimbabwe‘s growth potential
and place the country on a sustainable, inclusive growth path. Over the near to medium term,
reforms need to be focused on strengthening public financial management, improving payroll and
human resource management, raising the productivity of government expenditure, reducing
financial sector vulnerabilities, tackling infrastructure bottlenecks, and improving the business
environment. In addition, addressing Zimbabwe’s debt overhang and enhancing governance will be
essential if the country is to attract much-needed investment and access affordable long-term
capital.
3.
Based on this assessment, the teams agreed to support the authorities’ efforts with the
following division of labor:


PFM reform: The Fund will continue its engagement with the Zimbabwean authorities in their
effort to advance the fiscal reform agenda and restore fiscal sustainability. The Fund will offer TA
in: (i) macro-fiscal forecasting and budgeting to develop and implement a strategy for an
improved medium-term expenditure framework; (ii) cash management, accounting, and fiscal
reporting; (iii) improving fiscal oversight at the general government and public sector levels,
including SOEs; and (iv) revising the legal and regulatory framework for PFM. The Bank will
continue supporting the government in implementing the findings of the Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment and the Country Procurement Assessment Report. Specifically, the Bank
will: (i) expand (to phase II) its TA to strengthen the computerized PFM system and enhance its
functionality; (ii) support strengthening of the legal framework for PFM to increase compliance;
and (iii) provide TA to strengthen and decentralize public procurement.



Tax reform: The authorities have made progress on tax reform. The Fund will continue to offer
TA in tax policy and tax administration reform, including in the areas of risk management and
post control audit.



Diamond sector reform: The lack of transparency in the diamond sector is a major concern,
reinforced by the significant underperformance of diamond revenue in the last two years. Based
on the 2012 diagnostic Fund TA mission on AML/CFT standards in the diamond and precious
metal sectors, the Fund developed detailed recommendations to increase transparency and
revenue collection. The Bank is providing initial technical support for improved management of
the mineral sector. In March 2014 the Bank launched a project on fiscal modeling and capacity
building for mining with the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development (MoMMD) and the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED). The Bank will provide TA aimed at
optimizing diamond development, and a better understanding of different fiscal and ownership
systems, including production-sharing agreements.



Delivery of basic services and social safety nets: The Bank delivered TA to support
preparation of the 2014 budget, and prepared a series of short policy notes in support of the
socio-economic recovery. The Bank is implementing the second phase of a results-based
financing program for maternal and child health, and a public works rapid social response
program. Analytical support is being provided for a safety nets tracking survey, a health
financing issues note, and the design of a social transfer framework. A safety-net pilot program
will be launched in late-2014, in the context of a new programmatic trust fund, currently under
preparation. The IMF will continue to provide policy advice and TA support to the budget
preparation.



Business environment reform: The Bank has completed a micro-small-medium enterprise
survey, a trade and integration diagnostic study, and has launched the second phase of a trade
facilitation assessment. The Bank/IFC provided the government with an updated Doing Business
Reform Memorandum, and has responded to the government’s request for knowledge sharing
on Special Economic Zones.



Financial sector reform: Financial sector vulnerabilities persist, despite ongoing efforts to
enhance the financial regulatory framework. There is a need to further strengthen banking
supervision and make it more proactive. Fund staff will continue to provide TA to: further
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework, enhance risk-based supervision and solvency
stress testing, and help to develop a strategy for addressing the high levels of nonperforming
loans in the financial sector. The Bank has finalized the FINSCOPE survey to assess access to
finance. The IFC is launching advisory services on a credit reference bureau.



Central bank reform: The authorities are implementing plans to recapitalize the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe (RBZ), thereby paving the way for resumption of such core functions as banker to
the government and establishment of a lender-of-last-resort facility. The Fund will offer
additional TA in governance and central bank accounting and financial controls.



Reform of the statistical system: The Bank assisted ZIMSTAT in developing a poverty report
and starting poverty mapping. The Fund will continue to offer TA in national accounts, monetary
statistics, and government finance statistics.



Debt and arrears strategy: In the context of the 2014 Article IV Consultation, Bank and Fund
staffs produced a joint DSA, and are carrying out a joint loan-by-loan debt reconciliation
exercise.



Poverty Analysis and Poverty Reduction Strategy: The Bank provided technical guidance to
analyze the 2011 household survey data and produce a poverty report. The Bank will deliver TA
to support the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy as part of the implementation of
Zimbabwe’s development agenda (ZIM ASSET).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 29, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings but data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite
recent improvements in timeliness and coverage, there are some shortcomings stemming from weak
data sources, insufficient coverage, and capacity constraints. In May 2010, the Executive Board
approved a list of targeted TA, including macro statistics. The authorities are committed to improving
statistics to facilitate policymaking and monitoring. They have adopted a National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics (NSDS) for 2011–15, laying out a comprehensive framework for improving
statistical capacity and coordination across institutions over this period.
During April-May 2013, a STA multisector statistics mission was undertaken to: (i) assess Zimbabwe’s
external sector statistics (ESS), monetary and financial statistics (MFS), national accounts (NA) statistics,
and price statistics; (ii) identify key issues and priorities to address over the next two to three years,
develop a strategy for delivery of future TA and training, and provide recommendations for improving
statistical compilation in line with international standards; (iii) examine cross-sector data consistency;
and (iv) update Zimbabwe’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) metadata to reflect the current
statistical practices in the country. There were a number of follow-up missions to further the work. TA
on government financial statistics (GFS) has been covered in the context of PFM TA. Good progress has
been made in implementing the recommendations, particularly in the areas of MFS, ESS, and GFS.
Capacity constraints have limited the implementation of recommendations on improving NA and price
statistics.
Zimbabwe has several regular statistical publications. Since April 2012, ZIMSTAT resumed publishing
the Quarterly Digest of Statistics, a comprehensive source of economic and social data. In addition, the
consumer and producer price indices are disseminated monthly and quarterly, respectively. The report
for the 2012 census was published in December 2012. Some labor market statistics, such as
employment and earnings by sector, are published quarterly. The RBZ produces monthly MFS which
are published in the Monthly Review on their website. MoFED publishes a Monthly State of the Economy
and a Quarterly Treasury Bulletin on its website. With TA from STA, the GDDS metadata have been
updated and posted on the IMF website.
National Accounts: Zimbabwe’s National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) revised NA data based on the
Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey (PICES) conducted from June 2011 to May 2012.
This resulted in an upward revision of GDP data for 2009–12, published in September 2013. ZIMSTAT
also conducts surveys of agriculture, livestock, industrial production, and manufacturing, as well as a
quarterly employment survey and a survey of non-profit institutions. The NA compilation system and
the statistical infrastructure are being upgraded, in line with the latest international standards (e.g.,
2008 SNA). The scope of NA statistics is being expanded, including the compilation of quarterly
national accounts. However, staff resources are inadequate to keep up.
Price statistics: ZIMSTAT compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price index (CPI), with
weights based on data from the 2011/12 Household Budget Survey (HBS) with a December 2012 base.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

In the new CPI compiled since January 2013, ZIMSTAT also expanded the geographical coverage to
include price developments in both urban and rural areas, and increased the number of items in the
basket. ZIMSTAT also compiles and disseminates a quarterly producer price index (PPI), based on
December 2009 with December 2008 weights. The 2013 STA TA mission recommendations to further
improve the index included updating the CPI basket to replace outdated products, increasing the
frequency of data collection for perishable items from monthly to weekly, and expanding PPI coverage
to include exports.
Government finance statistics: Reporting of GFS for the central government has improved
significantly since 2009. The MoFED collects data on revenue and expenditure, which are published on
its website on a monthly basis, along with the annual budget statements. Data on government
financing are limited. The MoFED does not yet compile GFS in line with the Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, but is in the process of moving to GFSM 2001, with IMF TA. Budget
data are compiled only for the budgetary central government.
Monetary statistics: Data on MFS are timely but are based on the 1984 IMF guidelines for MFS
compilation. The 2013 STA TA mission assisted the RBZ in starting the compilation of data covering the
operations of the central bank and commercial banks using the new standardized reporting forms
(SRFs), consistent with current international standards. The mission made several recommendations for
improving the compilation and dissemination of MFS, including improving the classification and
valuation of financial instruments, and expanding coverage beyond commercial banks to other
financial corporations—including merchant banks, building societies, and the People’s Own Savings
Bank. There was a follow-up mission in March/April 2014 to further advance this work. [In May 2014,
the RBZ published the annual reports and audited financial statements for 2009-2012. Prior to this, the
last annual report or audited financial statement was published in 2008.] The audited 2010 financial
statement carried a qualified audit opinion and presented a negative equity position of [US$1,235.9]
million. The basis of the qualification relates to disputed liabilities totaling US$20.5 million, which have
been reduced to US$8 million at end-December 2013. MCM and STA TA and the Article IV missions
have made recommendations on central bank accounting and reporting.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and external debt statistics are subject to a number of
data issues. There is a structural break in trade data in 2010. For years prior to 2010, the source is the
Exchange Control Department of the RBZ, and for 2010 and onwards, the source is customs data. For
2010 and 2011, there are very large unidentified credits in the BOP which are financing imports,
probably due to under-recorded export receipts and FDI. Labor income and workers’ remittances do
not include estimates of cash and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad. Interest
payments are not yet reconciled with creditors’ records and do not contain accrued interest on overdue
financial obligations. The 2013 STA TA mission identified gaps with respect to international trade in
services, direct investment and portfolio investment income, transactions involving assets and liabilities
of direct investment, portfolio investment, trade credit and advances, currency and deposit assets and
liabilities of banks, and other sector deposit assets. Gaps in services arose due to the fact that a number
of service items are not covered, since the RBZ follows BPM4 methodology. The mission provided
training in BPM6 methodology and assisted in mapping tables from BPM4 to BPM6. Recommendations
for improving the compilation and quality of the data included: migrating from BPM4 to BPM6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ZIMBABWE

compilation methodology; expanding coverage of exports to include estimates for unrecorded mineral
exports, informal exports of artisanal products and other items by pedestrians and small cars crossing
borders; improving coverage of service exports and imports; and separating capital account from
financial account transactions.
The authorities have finalized their first debt reconciliation exercise and a joint Fund/Bank mission
visited Harare in May/June for a loan-by-loan assessment. Current and capital transfers to
nongovernmental organizations and to the government are not fully reconciled with donors’ data. The
financial account is incomplete, as it does not record substantial transactions in assets that are reported
by central banks that are members of the Bank for International Settlements. The RBZ’s initial
submission of stocks and flows of gross international reserves and its NFA position often require some
adjustments. Exceptional financing does not fully capture the flow of overdue financial obligations.
International Investment Position (IIP): The compilation of the IIP is not possible due to the lack of
reliable information on private sector stocks of foreign assets and liabilities and due to the lack of
appropriate categorization of the available stock data into the required instruments. However, the
authorities have committed to preparing a preliminary IIP once results of the first foreign private capital
stocks and flows survey are made available.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System since November 1, 2002.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report NA, price, BOP, government finance statistics or its IIP to STA for
dissemination in the International Financial Statistics, the BOP Statistics Yearbook, or the GFS Yearbook.
NA data have not been reported since 2005 and no data are being reported for the new CPI. Since May
2014, the RBZ resumed monthly reporting of monetary and financial statistics to STA.

ZIMBABWE

BACKGROUND
1.

Following the recent debt reconciliation exercise by the authorities for end-2011 and

end-2012, Zimbabwe’s total external debt has been estimated at about 70 percent of GDP
(Text Tables 1 and 2). The Public and Publicly Guaranteed (PPG) external debt is broadly divided
between bilateral creditors (60 percent) and multilateral creditors (40 percent). External private sector
debt represents roughly 18 percent of total external debt. Compared to the 2012 DSA, there is a sharp
downward revision of the total external debt stock ($2.5 billion), mainly driven by short-term private
debt and supplier credits. The sharp revision to short-term private debt is caused by a change in
assumptions: the BoP financing gap is no longer assumed to be covered with new short-term debt
financing at the end of each year.
2.

This change in assumptions for the financing gap follows a recent IMF technical

assistance mission on multi-sector statistics. This mission recommended that any unidentified
financing or financing gap left at the end of each year be consolidated in the errors and omissions line.
Errors and omissions are driven by large under-recorded exports (mainly minerals, owing to efforts to
avoid international restrictive measures), remittances through non-banking channels, and certain FDIrelated imports (mining companies recapitalized in kind by parents who send in equipment but do not
report the related financing).
3.

Zimbabwe has improved its debt management capacity and the Debt Management

Office (DMO) established at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) is now
fully staffed. The unit has developed a database for external debt that should facilitate debt
management and promote information sharing between all government entities involved. However,
decisions on new external borrowing continue to be taken with limited involvement of technical staff,
with substantial risks of making sub-optimal choices with implications for medium-term sustainability.

Box 1. Zimbabwe: Key Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions


The baseline scenario assumes average annual real GDP growth of about 4 percent for
the projection period (2014–33), with somewhat lower growth at the beginning of the
projection period (3 percent in 2014-15). In the medium term, uncertainty around the
potential of diamond resources, constrained public finances, and the severe bottlenecks
facing Zimbabwe would result in lower growth than in the recent past. Mining investment
projects (especially in gold and platinum) should contribute to a change in the
composition of growth and make up for sluggish growth in agriculture and
manufacturing. The baseline assumes macroeconomic stabilization, but does not assume
normalized access to finance or scaled-up public or private investment.



Inflation is expected to be 2.5 percent over the medium term, accelerating from
0.2 percent in 2014.



Exports are projected to grow at 7 percent over the medium term, in nominal terms.



Import growth is projected to average 4 percent annually for the period 2014–19, and
then increase to 5.5 percent until 2033.



The non-interest current account deficit is expected to remain above 25 percent of
GDP in 2014. Thereafter, it would decline to 15 percent in 2019 and stabilize to an average
of 13 percent throughout the remaining projection period.



Tax revenues are projected to remain broadly stable at around 27-28 percent of GDP.
Gradual decline in customs revenues is expected to be offset by increases in other
revenue sources.



External grants are assumed to remain confined to humanitarian assistance, estimated in
the range of 0.5 percent of GDP per annum. Under the baseline scenario, policies are
unchanged and there is no debt relief.



New non-concessional borrowing is assumed to average 1 percent of GDP annually
during 2013-2016 and 2 percent of GDP from 2017 onwards,1 with a grant element of
about 27 percent. The assumption here is that Zimbabwe will continue to receive limited
financing from non-traditional creditors in exchange for regular payments to them.



While outstanding external arrears continue to be rolled over, the DSA assumes no
accumulation of new external arrears.

1/ This assumption is based on loan disbursements, while the SMP ceiling monitors new non-concessional external
borrowing contracted or guaranteed by the general government.

ASSUMPTIONS
4.

The macroeconomic framework underpinning medium to long-term debt sustainability

takes into account recent economic developments and progress in structural reforms pursued
under the 2013-2014 Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). The medium-term projections are broadly
consistent with the 2012 DSA, but some updates have been made to better reflect the consequences of
the recent slowdown in emerging market economies (such as South Africa) and its impact on exports
and FDI. The baseline scenario assumes no debt relief given limited progress in re-engaging with the
main traditional creditors to date and the complexities inherent in making any other assumption.
Therefore, in the baseline new external borrowing is expected to remain limited to resources provided
by non-traditional creditors, mainly Brazil, China, and India (Box 1). Zimbabwe’s CPIA rating has
marginally improved since the 2012 DSA from 1.7 to 2.1.
5.

Significant revisions have been made to the total external debt stock. The new estimates

of external debt are based on the first results of the debt reconciliation exercise undertaken by the
authorities. At end-2011, PPG external debt amounted to US$ 5.7 billion while private external debt
reached US$ 1.7 billion after the change in the treatment of unidentified financing explained above.
Compared to the 2012 DSA, total debt thus declined substantially, from 113 to 74 percent of GDP,
largely due to this methodological change and to the recent substantial revision to the nominal GDP
series.2

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
Even starting from a lower base than in the 2012 DSA, the PPG external debt overhang
remains large (Table 1). Under the baseline, external debt is expected to continue to grow from 82
percent of GDP in 2013 to 122 percent in 2023, before declining to 108 percent in 2033. The present
value (PV) of the PPG external debt will remain well above the 30 percent of GDP threshold during the
entire projection period.3 The PV of the PPG external debt-to-exports ratio will reach 171 percent in
2013 and decline to 119 percent 2023, and to 98 percent by the end of the projection period. The PV of
the external debt-to-revenue ratio shows a downward trend, declining steadily from almost 176 percent
in 2013 to about 138 percent in 2023 and to 114 in 2033. This is driven by the assumption of moderate
debt accumulation on non-concessional terms (2 percent of GDP) mentioned above.
7.
Debt service as a share of exports and revenues will remain below the respective
thresholds throughout the entire projection period. The overall debt service-to-exports ratio will
2

Zimbabwe’s statistical agency (ZIMSTAT) recently revised the GDP series since 2009. The new GDP series are
25–30 percent higher than the old ones.
3

The large residual is explained by the new assumption that any remaining financing gap in the balance of
payments is treated as part of errors and omissions for both past and future years, rather than as generating new
borrowing (as in the 2012 DSA).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ZIMBABWE

remain close to 5 percent throughout the projection period, while the PPG debt service-to-exports ratio
will remain around 2 percent until 2018, before slowly increasing to 3 percent in 2033.
8.
These results remain broadly unchanged under alternative scenarios. The PV of the PPG
external debt-to-GDP ratio is sensitive to lower GDP growth, reaching 69 percent in 2015 under the
related bound test (Table 2a). In the case of a combined shock, the ratio will reach 88 percent in 2015,
before declining to 44 percent in 2033. Under the lower exports scenario, the PV of the PPG external
debt-to-exports ratio will reach almost 400 percent in 2015, before declining to just below 190 percent
in 2033. Assuming lower FDI, the same ratio will reach 217 percent in 2015 and decline to around 102
percent by the end of the projection period. Similar results are obtained for all indicators under the
lower GDP growth scenario and the less favorable borrowing terms scenario.

While public debt remains at high levels, the outlook is expected to improve (Table 3).
The PPG debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline modestly from 62 percent in 2013 to 51 percent in
2023, and then to 41 percent in 2033. The PV of the PPG debt-to-revenue ratio shows a similar profile,
declining from 206 percent in 2013 to 123 percent in 2033. The debt service-to-revenue ratio will
remain around 3 percent until 2023 and then gradually increase to 5 percent by the end of the
projection period.
Box 2. Domestic Public Debt in Zimbabwe
Overall domestic public debt in Zimbabwe is low and stable, at around 8-9 percent of GDP.
However, this masks the diverging paths of its components. While the domestic debt of the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has been gradually shrinking, the stock of outstanding government
securities has expanded, following the end of hyperinflation. Short-term domestic public debt has
shrunk from 100 percent of the total in 2011 to 78 percent in 2013, as the government has
managed to place securities with maturities of one year or more in the market. Finally, all of
Zimbabwe’s domestic public debt is denominated in U.S. dollars.

10.
Alternative and shock scenarios show a similar gradually rising trend of debt indicators
(Table 4). Under the alternative scenario of lower GDP growth and primary balance at historical
averages, the PV of the PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from 59 percent in 2013 to 106 percent in
2023, and reach 175 percent by the end of the projection period. The PV of the PPG debt-to-revenue
ratio will also deteriorate substantially under a low growth scenario. It goes from 206 percent in 2013 to
above 500 percent by the end of the projection period. Finally, the debt service-to-revenue ratio will
follow a similar path: a steady increase from 3 percent in 2013 to 32 percent in 2033. This reflects the
fact that the scenario is based on historical averages for growth, which in Zimbabwe include a period of
steep contraction in economic activity.

CONCLUSIONS
11.
Zimbabwe remains in debt distress in the baseline scenario of no debt relief. In the
baseline scenario, which includes new non-concessional borrowing of 2 percent of GDP a year on
average from 2017 onwards, Zimbabwe’s debt indicators remain above the relevant indicative
thresholds. Zimbabwe’s debt situation is vulnerable to shocks, particularly to exports and GDP growth.
Zimbabwe’s debt outlook also appears sensitive to FDI flows and to less favorable financial terms.
12.
The Zimbabwean authorities share the staff assessment and therefore remain committed to
re-engaging with all creditors, multilateral and bilateral. Staff encourages the authorities to continue to
primarily seek grants and financing on terms as favorable as possible, ideally at highly concessional
terms, to finance critical development projects with high economic returns. Limited non-concessional
borrowing could be considered only if grants and concessional resources are unavailable or insufficient
to implement critical growth-enhancing projects.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is higher than in the baseline by 2 percentage points, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios, except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Press Release No. 14/297
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 23, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe
On June 18, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Zimbabwe.
Background
In July 2013, Zimbabwe held its first general elections under the new constitution approved by
referendum in March 2013, and ended the four-year coalition government. The new government has
expressed its commitment to continue implementing the policies and reforms agreed with the Fund
under the staff-monitored program (SMP), and to stay engaged with the international financial
institutions. To achieve sustainable development and social equity, the government has launched a
new five-year development plan, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic
Transformation (ZIM ASSET).
The economic rebound experienced since the end of hyperinflation in 2009 has now ended. After
averaging 10 percent over 2009-2012, growth fell to an estimated 3.3 percent in 2013, reflecting
tight liquidity conditions, election-year uncertainty, weak demand for key exports, competitiveness
pressures, and the impact of adverse weather conditions. Inflation continued its downward trend
from 2.9 percent (year-on-year) at end-2012 to -0.3 percent in April 2014, mainly reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar against the South African rand and weak domestic demand.
Zimbabwe’s external position remains precarious, with usable international reserves covering less
than two weeks of imports. The current account deficit widened to 28.7 percent of GDP in 2013, as
the trade deficit deteriorated, reflecting lower mineral exports. The main financing item in the capital
account was private loans.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Financial sector vulnerabilities persist, stemming from the high levels of nonperforming loans (16.6
percent on average for banks in March 2014), low capitalization and low liquidity, with wide
differentiation across banks. The banking sector experienced liquidity crunches in 2013, amid
political and policy uncertainty. Deposits have been slowly returning to the banking system, but
liquidity conditions remain generally tight. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has taken steps to
enhance the legal and regulatory framework. In January 2014 banks were instructed to immediately
end new insider lending, and their boards are now required to ensure adequate provisioning and
submit regular reports. In addition, the deadline for meeting the minimum capital requirement of
$100 million was extended to December 2020. Banks are required to submit their recapitalization
plans by end-June 2014, with interim milestones to ensure compliance with the $100 million
requirement by December 2020. The authorities, with assistance from the Afreximbank, are taking
steps to revitalize the interbank market. They have also started to recapitalize the RBZ to allow it to
resume some of its core functions.
Election-related spending and the public sector wage bill were the main factors behind expenditure
overruns in 2013. Despite taking several tax and nontax revenue measures to fund election expenses,
total revenue fell short of budgeted amounts, with an exceptionally low performance in the fourth
quarter, reflecting weak economic activity and tight liquidity conditions. As a result, the budget
deficit reached 2.2 percent of GDP in 2013. Fiscal pressures continued into 2014, with the budget
targets in doubt in the context of sluggish growth and a 14 percent increase in the wage bill relative
to 2013. To offset these pressures, the government has identified various revenue and expenditure
measures valued at some 4.6 percent of GDP in 2014. If fully implemented, these measures could
result in a reduction in the 2014 budget deficit to 0.6 percent of GDP, consistent with the available
financing.
The SMP provided a useful anchor for Zimbabwe in a difficult election year. Progress in
implementing the SMP approved by Fund management in June 2013 and extended through June
2014 has been mixed, however, reflecting in part a long electoral process and a protracted postelection transition. Discussions of the first and second reviews under the SMP are nearing conclusion.
The Zimbabwean authorities have indicated interest in a successor SMP to build on their
achievements and to support a stronger policy framework.
The medium-term outlook, under the baseline scenario, is for growth to average some 4 percent, as
large mining sector investments reach full capacity. The current account deficit is expected to
improve but will remain high, averaging 15 percent of GDP. In addition, planned fiscal consolidation
should facilitate a modest rebuilding of fiscal and external buffers, including international reserves.
Zimbabwe faces serious medium-term challenges and achieving sustainable, inclusive growth will
require strong macroeconomic and financial policies, an enabling business environment, and
normalized relations with creditors.
The main near-term risks relate to further fiscal underperformance and uncertainty in the external
environment which could see lower commodity prices, particularly for key mineral exports. Other

3

risks relate to policy inconsistencies which could affect investment and financial sector
vulnerabilities—specifically, liquidity shortages and disorderly unwinding of troubled banks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted Zimbabwe’s fragile
economic situation characterized by a growth slowdown, a large external deficit, and low
international reserves. With risks on the downside, they highlighted the need to restore fiscal and
external sustainability and reduce financial vulnerabilities. They emphasized that achieving
sustainable and inclusive growth requires determined and comprehensive reforms. In this regard,
they welcomed the authorities’ renewed commitment to implementing the staff-monitored program,
which has provided a useful anchor for policies during the past year notwithstanding policy delays.
Directors encouraged the authorities to fully implement their revised fiscal plan for 2014 and be
ready to take additional actions if needed, while protecting priority infrastructure and social
spending. They highlighted the need to mobilize revenue, including from the diamond sector.
Directors also stressed the importance of rebalancing the expenditure mix away from employment
costs in order to free up resources for development. Strengthening public financial management is
also crucial to prevent accumulation of new arrears.
Directors expressed concern that Zimbabwe’s external position remains precarious. They welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to rebuild external buffers. They underscored the need to improve debt
management and supported the strategy to seek mainly grants and highly concessional resources,
while limiting non-concessional financing to critical development projects with high economic
returns. They noted that strong macroeconomic policies and a comprehensive arrears clearance
framework supported by development partners are essential to addressing Zimbabwe’s debt
problems. They encouraged the authorities to engage in coordinated discussions with the World
Bank and other international financial institutions (IFIs), and called on them to respect the preferred
creditor status of IFIs, avoid selective debt service, and increase payments to the Fund’s Poverty
Reduction and Growth Trust as capacity to repay improves.
Directors stressed that enhancing financial sector stability remains a priority. They recommended
continued vigilance in monitoring weak banks and a proactive approach to ensure an orderly
resolution of insolvent non-systemic banks. They noted that restructuring and recapitalizing the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe would help mitigate vulnerabilities. Directors supported the authorities’
plans to preserve the multicurrency system for the time being.

Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is overvalued. They
underscored the importance of addressing structural bottlenecks to boost competitiveness and
promote a sustainable external position, and highlighted the need to improve the business
environment and basic infrastructure. Directors also saw a need to reduce uncertainty regarding the
indigenization policy, including in the financial sector, to avoid deterring investment. Directors urged
the authorities to fully implement the recent measures to boost transparency in the diamond sector
and to modernize mining legislation.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for Zimbabwe, June 18, 2014
My authorities are appreciative of the Fund's support on the ongoing reform process and technical
assistance in addressing their policy challenges and strengthening their implementation capacity.
They remain committed to the on-going macroeconomic policy reforms, under the staff-monitored
program (SMP).
In this regard, they fully re-dedicated to strengthening the economy’s growth momentum and
achieving inclusive growth. Specifically, the Government of Zimbabwe has instituted a program of
reforms aimed at improving the quality of public expenditures; increasing revenue; raising overall
productivity; reducing financial sector vulnerabilities; and improving competitiveness and the
business environment. This reform agenda is anchored on a more cohesive cabinet, appointed in
September 2013, which is in a better position to formulate and implement strong policies.
Against this background, the SMP continues to play a pivotal role in assisting the Zimbabwean
authorities in their reform efforts. However, the authorities are fully aware of the challenges facing
their reform agenda.
Recent economic developments and prospects
Economic developments remain positive, but much weaker than desirable. Output growth
decelerated from 10.6 percent in 2012 to 3.3 percent in 2013 and is projected to slow further to 3.1
percent in 2014. Real GDP growth is underpinned by developments in key sectors, such as mining
and agriculture. Growth in the agriculture sector has been dampened by poor agricultural harvest
particularly, in the production of maize, groundnuts and cotton. Meanwhile, the mining sector has
become the leading export sector, driven by strong external demand for primary commodities,
mainly, platinum and gold. However, the sector faces challenges mainly from low exploration, lack of
capital and weakening commodity prices in the international markets.
Inflationary pressures remain subdued largely on account of domestic liquidity conditions and
external factors, such as international prices of oil and food, and exchange rate developments
between the South African rand (the currency of Zimbabwe’s main trading partner) and the US dollar.
Despite a modest increase, the annual rate of inflation, measured by percentage change in the
consumer price index, remained negative in April 2014.
In their endeavors to advance Zimbabwe’s growth and development agenda, the authorities have
formulated a new five-year blueprint, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic
Transformation (ZIM ASSET). This is a results-based development agenda built around four strategic
clusters: food security and nutrition; social services and poverty eradication; infrastructure and
utilities; and value addition and beneficiation. To finance the implementation of ZIM ASSET, the
authorities have approved the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) from the country’s

2

mineral resources3. However, given the current macroeconomic outlook, the authorities have decided
to postpone further steps in creating the SWF until the outlook becomes favorable.
FISCAL POLICY
Zimbabwe’s fiscal space remains severely constrained by revenue under-performance, the multicurrency regime and the country’s public debt overhang. The situation has been exacerbated by
increased recurrent spending driven by employment costs and spending related to the general
elections held in July 2013.
The authorities share staff’s view that the wage bill is unsustainable and crowds out spending
required for infrastructure development. However, they note that remuneration levels in the public
sector are generally inadequate, which affects morale and performance. It is expected that the share
of the wage bill in the budget will decline as economic activity improves and the tax base broadens.
Similarly, the Zimbabwean authorities continue to implement reforms aimed at improving revenue
performance, including measures to boost diamond-related revenues. As part of these reforms, a
joint task force has been constituted, comprising technical staff from the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development, Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, and the Zimbabwe Revenue
Authority. The task force is expected to forecast and monitor diamond-related revenues.
Furthermore, all diamonds will be sold through auctions at international trading venues to maximize
sales revenue.
MONETARY POLICY AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS
Since the introduction of the multi-currency regime, which has constrained the use of monetary
policy instruments, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has continued to focus on promoting a
strong and stable financial system; and ensuring that the multi-currency system is maintained to
restore and enhance confidence and credibility. However, the authorities share staff’s assessment
that vulnerabilities still exist in the financial sector. Nonetheless they believe that the recently
announced initiatives, such as finalization of the framework for a credit reference bureau, would
improve the sector’s performance and stability.
Furthermore, the Zimbabwean authorities have initiated steps to restore the role of the RBZ in the
economy, which should enhance financial intermediation. These include the Government’s decision
to recapitalize RBZ, transfer the treasury account from the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, and
thereby capacitate RBZ to play its functions as lender of last resort and banker to the government.
With a robust lender of last resort facility, RBZ will be in a position to participate more significantly in
the development of the inter-bank market and accommodate solvent institutions that experience

temporary liquidity shortages. These measures are expected to stimulate economic activity, in line
with the objectives outlined in ZIM ASSET.
In March 2014, a US$100 million interbank facility by Afreximbank was launched to address the
liquidity crunch in the system, in accordance with the authorities’ announcement during the 2014
National Budget statement. Through this facility, illiquid but solvent financial institutions will be able
to access temporary funding. The authorities hope that this will help restore confidence in the market
and encourage interbank activity.
On measures intended to further anchor the multi-currency system, the RBZ in January 2014 added
the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen to the list of currencies accepted
as legal tender alongside the US dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula and British pound. This
was prompted by an increase in trade and investment between Zimbabwe and Asia, and is expected
to reduce transaction costs and boost trade between Zimbabwe and its partners.
EXTERNAL SECTOR AND DEBT ISSUES
Despite a difficult external environment, the Zimbabwean authorities are determined to address their
external debt situation. In this context, they have adopted the Zimbabwe Accelerated Arrears
Clearance, Debt and Development Strategy (ZAADDS), which is aimed at accelerating re-engagement
with creditors, including International Financial Institutions (IFIs). ZAADDS is defined as a “hybrid
debt resolution strategy, which includes the adoption of traditional debt resolution initiatives
combined with leveraging the country’s natural resources to achieve sustainable economic
development”. Under ZAADDS, the Zimbabwean Government, through the Ministry of Finance, has
begun a process of re-engaging with its creditors. This process is aimed at finding ways to clear the
country’s outstanding arrears by mobilizing capital from internal resources. The authorities consider
the current SMP as a crucial element of ZAADDS and the Zimbabwe Accelerated Re-engagement
Economic Program.
RELATIONS WITH THE IMF AND OTHER IFIS
Given the importance of renormalizing relations with the Fund and other IFS, my authorities have
continued to make regular repayments to the PRGT in line with previous commitments. They have
also committed to gradually increase the size of these repayments as the country’s capacity to repay
improves. In addition, going forward, they remain committed to addressing policy challenges
identified under the SMP.
Finally, I would like to reiterate that my Zimbabwean authorities regard the SMP as critical to their
reform agenda, to revitalize Zimbabwe’s economy and address its external debt arrears.
