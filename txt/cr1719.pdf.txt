IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On December 12, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Lebanon.
The protracted conflict in Syria continues to dominate Lebanon’s outlook, with registered refugees
now comprising over one-quarter of the population. The refugee presence is straining local
communities, adding to poverty and unemployment, and placing further pressure on the economy’s
already-weak public finances and infrastructure.
Domestically, following a two-and-a-half-year impasse, Lebanon elected a president on
October 31, 2016, and appointed a new prime minister soon thereafter. Consultations to form a
new government are ongoing.
Growth remains subdued. Following a sharp drop in 2011, growth edged upward briefly to 2–3 percent,
but has now slowed once again. IMF staff estimate that GDP increased by 1 percent in 2015 and project
a similar growth rate in 2016. Lebanon’s traditional growth drivers—tourism, real estate, and
construction—have received a significant blow and a strong rebound is unlikely based on current
trends. In the absence of a turnaround in confidence, or a resolution of the Syrian conflict, growth is
unlikely to return to potential (4 percent) soon. Inflation also declined sharply in 2016 on the back of
lower oil prices, but should return to trend (about 2 percent) by early-2017.
On the fiscal side, low oil prices have helped secure a primary surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP
in 2015, and staff project a similar surplus (1.1 percent) in 2016. But public debt is high
(138 percent of GDP in 2015) and without decisive corrective action, Lebanon’s debt burden will
increase further.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
In the context of Lebanon’s fixed exchange rate regime, foreign exchange inflows slowed in
the first half of 2016, resulting in a drop in official international reserves. In response, during
May–October the Banque du Liban (BdL) engaged in an unconventional financial operation
which, among other objectives, helped boost reserves to above 2015 levels. At the same time, the
operation also created sizable excess Lebanese pound liquidity and increased commercial banks’
exposure to the sovereign.
Downside risks dominate the outlook, but there are also significant upside risks. If remaining
political milestones are met quickly, the recent election of a president and appointment of a
prime minister could pave the way for much needed reform and adjustment, boost the economy,
and help correct macroeconomic imbalances. A resolution of the Syria conflict would also
significantly boost Lebanon’s economy. On the downside, however, foreign exchange inflows
could decelerate, excess Lebanese pound liquidity and reduced banks’ foreign exchange liquidity
could put pressure on the foreign exchange reserves, growth might remain subdued, and fiscal
imbalances could widen.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for preserving macroeconomic stability and
market confidence in very difficult circumstances, especially the significant spillovers from the
conflict in Syria, including refugee inflows. These spillovers have affected growth and
overwhelmed the country’s already-strained public infrastructure and services. Directors
recognized that, by hosting Syrian refugees, Lebanon is providing a global public good, and that
the international community needs to be more supportive of Lebanon’s efforts.
Directors observed that the recent election of a president and appointment of a new prime
minister could set the stage for a revitalization of Lebanon’s policymaking framework. In this
context, they noted Lebanon’s rising vulnerabilities and underscored the need for a change in
policy direction, to anchor confidence and help secure improved economic performance.
Directors stressed that a sustained and balanced fiscal adjustment is essential. They welcomed
Lebanon’s primary surpluses, but observed that that, without further adjustment, Lebanon’s
public debt burden will continue to rise, adding to existing vulnerabilities and ultimately
crowding out essential public investment and social spending.
In this regard, Directors urged passage of a budget for 2017. They also stressed the immediate
need for reform in the electricity sector, which remains a large drain on the budget and a key
bottleneck to improved competitiveness and equity.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

More broadly, Directors stated that it was critical to place public debt on a sustainable downward
path. They observed that there is significant scope to increase revenue equitably, including by
improving compliance and broadening the tax base, starting with fuel taxation.
Directors noted the challenges faced by monetary policy in the current environment of tighter
international financial conditions and slowing inflows. They agreed that monetary policy should
remain geared to supporting the peg, and commended the BdL for maintaining adequate
international reserves. In this context, Directors underscored that, although the BdL’s recent
financial operation has successfully bolstered BdL’s gross international reserves and banks’
capital, it was not a sustainable solution to Lebanon’s funding needs. They also called for a
medium-term strategy to improve the BdL’s balance sheet.
Directors stressed the critical role of Lebanon’s banking system in securing sustained,
broad-based economic growth. Taking note of the findings of the recent FSAP, they
appreciated the authorities’ close oversight of the financial system, but highlighted the need for
continued vigilance. In particular, they stressed the benefits of measures that would introduce
forward-looking capital planning; strengthen regulation and supervision by, among others,
aligning loan classification rules and sovereign risk weights with international good practice;
and support liquidity risk management. Directors noted that progress had been made since the
last full assessment of Lebanon’s AML/CFT framework, but observed that some gaps remain
and that the framework needs to be enhanced further.
Directors urged the authorities to advance structural reforms. In addition to electricity reform,
they stressed the need for legislation to reinvigorate private investment, including in the oil and
gas sector; and for better service provision and stronger safety nets. In this context, Directors
pointed out that increased growth was also important in supporting Lebanon’s ability to cope
with the recent refugee inflows.
Directors also urged the authorities to move decisively to improve Lebanon’s statistical system,
building on ongoing progress.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Following an extended impasse, Lebanon has a new president and a new
prime minister, paving the way for a number of political changes. When formed, the
new government will face a challenging policy environment. The Syrian crisis continues
to dominate Lebanon’s economic outlook, and the associated influx of refugees (about
a quarter of the population) has few, if any, international parallels. GDP growth is still
subdued and Lebanon’s debt burden is rising, despite modest primary surpluses.
Moreover, the economy remains vulnerable to shifts in deposit inflows, which have
slowed notably since last year’s Article IV consultation. Most recently, the Banque du
Liban (BdL) engaged in a sizable financial operation that has (among other objectives)
helped restore international reserves.
Policy Priorities. Policies need to aim at restoring fiscal sustainability, while preserving
confidence in Lebanon’s financial sector and laying the groundwork for lasting and
inclusive growth. In addition, there is a pressing short-term need for investment and
growth to help offset the impact of the regional conflicts. Lebanon cannot shoulder
such a burden alone—sustained international support is both needed and warranted.
Key Recommendations. The new political landscape provides a unique opportunity to
reestablish the credibility of Lebanon’s policymaking framework. Three areas stand out
for both relevance and urgency:


The authorities need to articulate a plausible policy mix that halts the growth of
public debt and places the economy on a more sustainable path. Front-loaded fiscal
adjustment needs to be based on fair and broad-based revenue measures—starting
from fuel taxation—and rebalanced spending, in particular a reduction of costly
electricity transfers. Passage of a credible budget is a priority.



Lebanon’s exchange-rate peg remains the prime focus of monetary policy. The
recent BdL financial operation has boosted official reserves; going forward the BdL
needs to stand ready to increase interest rates if deposit inflows were to decelerate
(while fiscal consolidation will help in ushering interest rate flexibility). More
broadly, the banking system remains a critical pillar of Lebanese resilience, and the
authorities need to continue to mitigate risks and anchor confidence, in line with
the recommendations in the Financial Sector Stability Assessment report.



Finally, the authorities need to promote sustainable growth by addressing the
economy’s most pressing bottlenecks, starting with electricity. The reform agenda is
well known, but is now more urgent given Lebanon’s difficult circumstances. In this
context, significant and sustained support from the international community is vital.

CONTEXT
1.
This Article IV consultation took place at a time of major change. Following a 2½ year
impasse, parliament elected a president on October 31; a few days later, a new prime minister was
appointed, with a mandate to form a new cabinet. Consultations are still ongoing, but agreement is
expected relatively swiftly, as solutions are needed quickly to address Lebanon’s macroeconomic
challenges.
2.
Spillovers from the Syrian crisis have
profoundly affected Lebanon. Now in its sixth year,
the Syrian crisis continues to dominate Lebanon’s
outlook. The most immediate impact has been
decelerating economic growth, coupled with an
unparalleled inflow of refugees, now estimated at
around one third of local population—the highest per
capita count in the world.
3.
The economy’s funding needs continue to
grow. Historically, the economy has managed to sustain large imbalances and weather significant
shocks, owing to its macro-financial structure—where banks channel deposit inflows from foreign
investors and Lebanon’s diaspora to cover Lebanon’s sizable budget- and current-account deficits.
But starting in mid-2015, inflows started to decelerate, prompting the Banque du Liban (BdL) to
undertake a complex and sizable financial operation over the summer of 2016.
4.
In the current uncertain environment, the priority is to reestablish the credibility of the
policymaking framework, with particular focus on three key areas:


Restoring fiscal sustainability. The growth of public debt (above 140 percent of GDP) needs to
stop immediately. Fiscal discipline will underpin confidence and support financial stability
(including by reducing Lebanon’s reliance on inflows).



Anchoring financial stability. The exchange rate peg is the appropriate nominal anchor and
the BdL needs to stand ready to increase interest rates if necessary. There is also a need to
continue to monitor and mitigate risks in the banking sector.



Promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. Addressing Lebanon’s infrastructure deficit—a
result of protracted under-investment and exacerbated by the refugee presence—requires
implementing reforms to address the economy’s bottlenecks, such as electricity provision.

5.
The international community must play a key role. Lebanon’s response to the refugee
crisis is a testament to both its generosity and resilience. Recent initiatives to match identified needs
with donor funding need to proceed swiftly, as Lebanon requires and deserves significant support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

AN INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT
6.
Despite regional tensions and the conflict in Syria, security conditions in Lebanon have
held up well. Such an achievement is all the more remarkable in light of the number of Syrian
refugees within the country—estimates place them at around 1–1½ million (Box 1 and Selected
Issues Paper on Refugee Issues).
7.
There has been growing international recognition that the refugee crisis is a global
problem, requiring a global response. At the London Conference on “Supporting Syria and the
Region” in February 2016, the authorities presented a new plan to address the costs of the crisis
(see also Box 7 below). The plan calls for $11 billion over 2016–20, comprised of both grants
($5 billion) and loans ($6 billion). Its proposals are ambitious, and seek not only to offset the
increasing toll of the refugee presence, but also to help restart job-rich growth that can benefit both
host communities and refugees. To date, however, funding has remained short of estimated needs.
8.
Growth remains low. Lebanon is in a protracted period of low growth of 1–2 percent, well
short of potential. We estimate that growth was about 1 percent in 2015, and project a similar
outcome in 2016 (below the authorities’ estimate of 2 percent, though in line with most market
forecasts).1 Lebanon’s traditional growth drivers—tourism, real estate, and construction—have all
taken a blow, and a strong rebound is unlikely absent an improvement in political and security
conditions. While lower oil prices have supported domestic demand and lowered fiscal costs, their
overall impact is more mixed (Box 2 and Selected Issues Paper on Remittances). Inflation declined
sharply in 2015, to an average of -3.7 percent, reflecting lower oil prices and a stronger U.S. dollar.
9.
The fiscal situation is increasingly challenging. Tax revenues as a share of GDP continue
to decline (see below), while interest payments have moved upward in line with public debt. A small
primary surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015 was not sufficient to offset the impact of slowing
nominal output growth and higher interest payments. As a result, public debt increased by
5 percentage points in 2015, to 138 percent of GDP.
10.
Banks remain the economy’s chief source of
funding. With assets over 350 percent of GDP, banks
hold over half of Lebanon’s T-bills and Eurobonds (total
sovereign exposures make up 61 percent of total bank
assets). Banks, in turn, are funded primarily by deposits
(including from non-residents), with generally a
short-term maturity and high degree of concentration
(Box 3). To further strengthen banking-sector resilience,
the authorities requested a Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) in the spring of 2016.

Box 1. Dealing with the Impact of the Refugees
The Syrian crisis, now entering its sixth year, has been very costly. According to the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is now more than 1.4 million.
Accommodating such an outsize presence has come at a substantial cost. The authorities estimate direct budget
costs at around $400 million per year. And estimates of indirect costs exceed $2½ billion in terms of the erosion of
public services (World Bank, 2013).
The impact of refugees: From theory…
The discussion on how to address an inflow of refugees has parallels in a number of other host countries.
According to standard economic theory, in the short run, new migrants with access to the labor market will tend to
lower incumbents’ wages, reflecting a lower capital labor ratio. The influx will also reduce the number of employed
incumbents—some will be induced to exit the labor market. But there are also winners. Returns to capital actually
increase, as the extra labor makes capital more productive (along with other complementary factors, such as skilled
labor or land). Over the long run, however, these effects are unwound, as higher returns prompt higher investment
and higher capital stock. Indeed, with constant returns to scale, the capital labor ratio will ultimately revert to the
initial steady state, bringing back wages to their original level.
The key message from standard theory is that a modern economy is not a zero-sum game, as the number of
jobs is not fixed. Instead, the economy will eventually respond to immigration by scaling up production in line
with the new labor force. Market rigidities may shape the pace of adjustment, and flexible, investment-friendly
economies will adjust more rapidly than economies with less flexible markets. But ultimately, economies are
generally able to accommodate an addition of new workers.
…to the Lebanese reality
Key features of the Lebanese economy may confound the (benign) predictions of standard models.



Firstly, the length of adjustment will depend on the investment climate—the easier it is to scale up the
capital stock, the more quickly the economy will move to the new steady state. In advanced economies this
scaling up generally takes place in a few years (Dadush, 2014). But Lebanon’s investment climate has
significant shortcomings, given poor infrastructure and low public investment.



Secondly, the nature of Lebanon’s labor market may exacerbate the impact of Syrian refugees.
Studies from advanced economies tend to downplay the impact of unskilled immigration, noting that
native wages generally remain unchanged, and finding that many incumbents often move to occupations
where local knowledge and linguistic ability offer a comparative advantage (IMF, 2016). The Lebanese market
is perhaps less accommodating. Data are scarce, but estimates suggest that almost half of the workforce is
employed in the informal sector, and so is likely to compete directly with new refugees. Moreover, these
workers are not covered by any social safety net, making them particularly vulnerable. Early estimates suggest
that unskilled wages in some areas have fallen by as much as 50 percent (ILO, 2014), potentially tipping as
many as 170,000 residents below the poverty line (World Bank, 2013)—although it is unclear how many of
these represent existing Syrian migrants.



Thirdly, current studies may not be applicable to Lebanon given the scale of immigration in Lebanon
over a short period. Most empirical studies investigate relatively moderate increases in the labor force (and
available jobs). Given the scale of the refugee presence, the size of Lebanon’s labor shock may have
outstripped some of its potentially beneficial impacts had the shock been smaller.



Finally, standard models are silent on the role of unpriced factors, such as public goods and
infrastructure. Implicitly, these are scaled up in line with the capital stock by the local authorities. But given
Lebanon’s political situation, and its limited fiscal space, this cannot be taken for granted. Furthermore, there
may be negative externalities owing to an overburdening of existing public goods.

While a sharp decline in oil prices is seemingly a
positive shock for an oil importer country like
Lebanon, on balance its net effects are more mixed.
The magnitude of positive and negative impacts is
uncertain and critically depends on the pass-through
of global prices into domestic retail prices. In
that respect, Lebanon has one of the
highest pass-through in the region—gasoline pump
prices have declined by 49 percent since their peak in
April 2012. Yet, Lebanon’s strong ties with (now weaker)
regional oil exporters—a key source of external demand
and funding—make the assessment more nuanced and
may offset some of the positive direct impacts of lower
oil prices.1

Source: IMF Middle East and Central Asia REO

The oil price shock has affected the Lebanese economy through various channels.



Higher consumption: Consumers react to the effective income boost of lower oil prices. However, absence
of micro-data at the household level makes it difficult to estimate such impact.



Lower import costs: Oil imports become cheaper,
though according to staff estimates the price
elasticity of oil demand is relatively low. Thus the
import decline owing to lower oil prices is very
modestly offset by increased consumption of oil
volumes.



Better fiscal position: The primary impact on the
-25
budget is on the spending side, as the sensitivity of
public revenue to changes in oil prices is small
-50
(excises and VAT on gasoline—gasoil is fully not
-75
taxed—are the only taxes directly related to oil).
However, the electricity company EdL has been
producing electricity from fuel oil at a loss,
requiring larger government transfers. These used to average about 4 percent of GDP (around $2 billion)
prior to the oil shock in mid-2014. EdL transfers declined to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015 (and projected at
1.5 percent of GDP in 2016).



Lower deposits/remittances and FDI to Lebanon: A sizable share of the Lebanese diaspora lives in
GCC countries and other oil producers in West Africa; remittance inflows from these countries have declined.
More generally, less money is expected to come from these countries given their tighter liquidity conditions,
either through property buying (FDI) or deposits from both Lebanese and foreign investors. There could thus
be repercussions for the Lebanese real estate market as well as banks’ liquidity—with possible spillover into
the fiscal sector given the government’s large funding needs.



Lower exports: The GCC countries are Lebanon’s key export market for goods (along with Iraq and Syria),
accounting for over 40 percent of Lebanon’s share of goods exports. Lower exports will partially offset lower
oil imports. However, if the marginal propensity to consume out of savings from lower oil prices is high,
higher non-oil imports may also offset some of the benefits from lower oil imports.



Lower tourism: A large amount of (high-end) tourists have typically come from GCC countries, though their
numbers have started to decline significantly with the onset of the Syria crisis. The oil price decline will likely
not help their numbers to recover to pre-crisis levels.

Deposit inflows have slowed. In the past,
foreign-deposit inflows (between $8–12 billion per year)
have been a key sign of confidence. Deposit growth has
eased over the past couple of years, particularly since
mid-2015. And notwithstanding a recovery over the
summer (in part triggered by the BdL’s actions, see
below), by early-November 2016, year-to-date growth
was $6 billion—or 4.7 percent growth on an annualized
basis. The slowdown is likely explained by various
factors including tighter liquidity conditions in GCC
countries (a key source of deposits for Lebanon) and
increased risk premia on Lebanese financial assets.
12.
Lebanon’s external position remains
challenging. The current account deficit is estimated to
have narrowed by 7 percentage points to 18.2 percent
of GDP in 2015 (though data are subject to frequent
revisions). This decline is largely explained by lower oil
prices, rather than by a contraction in non-oil imports.
But goods-and-services exports continue to decline,
owing to the impact of regional conflict on key trading
partners and routes. Despite the improved current
account, slowing financial inflows has prompted a
contraction in Lebanon’s Net Foreign Assets (NFA)
position, at least through mid-2016.

As a result, the BdL has taken steps to shore up its reserves. With easing deposit inflows,
gross reserves fell over 2015–16 to reach $35.1 billion in May 2016, a decline of 10.1 percent from a
peak in May 2015. In response, in mid-2016 the BdL engaged in a sizable financial operation with a
number of components and counterparts (Box 4).
14.
The operation has had a number of
implications. It has: (i) strengthened BdL’s gross foreign
exchange buffers, to $40.6 billion by end-October;
(ii) reversed the cumulative decline in Lebanon’s NFA
position (to a cumulative $555 million by
end-September, from -$1.4 billion through end-July);
(iii) improved the capital buffers of banks; and
(iv) reduced local-currency funding costs for the
government and private sector. At the same time, the
operation also created significant Lebanese pound
liquidity (equivalent to one third of GDP); sizably
reduced banks’ FX liquidity held abroad; narrowed the
spread between LL and USD deposit rates, adding to

dollarization risk; and increased the FX liabilities of the BdL (and related carry costs), thus affecting
the BdL’s balance sheet.

Appetite for Lebanese external debt has
softened. Eurobond yields have increased by almost
70 bps over the past 12 months, compared to an
average drop of around 70 bps for other emerging
markets. Spreads have thus increased, to over 500 bps
and 250 bps vis-à-vis U.S. Treasuries and
emerging-market instruments, respectively.

The country’s credit ratings reflect
Lebanon’s challenges. Moody’s downgraded Lebanon
from B1 to B2 in December 2014; and Fitch
downgraded Lebanon to B- in July 2016. S&P, on the
other hand, has kept its B- rating since November 2013,
though it upgraded the outlook from negative to stable
in 2016. Rating agencies’ assessments continue to focus
on the bank-sovereign nexus, slowing deposit growth
and reserves, domestic political uncertainties, and
rising fiscal difficulties.

Deposits in Lebanese banks are highly concentrated.
For the domestic banking system at end-2015, it is
estimated that 16,000 accounts (less than 1 percent of
all deposit accounts) held 50 percent of total deposits,
while 1,600 accounts (less than 0.1 percent of all
accounts) held 20 percent of total deposits. Classified
by bucket sizes, 84.6 percent of total deposits are in
accounts with balances greater than $100,000,
50.2 percent in accounts with balances greater than
$1 million, and 3.7 percent of deposits in accounts with
balances greater than $100 million. The concentration is
higher in foreign currency than LL accounts.

Large accounts have been a key driver of deposit growth.


Between end-2008 and end-2015, deposits in “smaller accounts” (< $1 million) have grown by
55 percent, whereas deposits in “large accounts” (> $1 million) have grown by 185 percent.



Much of the slowdown in deposit growth in 2015 can be attributed to large depositors. While, in recent
years, accounts with balances greater than $1 million had grown by about 12–14 percent per year, in
2015, their growth rate declined to about 5.8 percent, driving much of the decline in deposit growth
observed in 2015.

Given the size of the large deposits, the share of nonresident deposits may be larger than commonly
believed.

Box 4. The BdL’s Financial Operation
In June 2016, the BdL engaged in a financial operation to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves, among other
objectives. As of May 2016, the BdL gross reserves had declined y/y by 10.1 percent or $3.9 billion and stood at
$35.1 billion, reflecting lower foreign exchange (FX) inflows and the economy’s large FX funding needs. The operation
consisted of various steps and targeted various objectives:

 BdL’s purchase of newly-issued Eurobonds from the Ministry of Finance ($2 billion). In the last week of

May 2016, the BdL swapped Lebanese pound (LL) government debt for the new Eurobonds with the MoF. This helped
reduce public debt service costs and lengthen the public debt maturity structure.

 BdL’s sale of Eurobonds and other FX securities to the banks ($13 billion according to staff estimates). Starting
in June, the BdL invited banks to buy the newly-acquired Eurobonds and FX-denominated long-term CDs. The BdL
gross FX reserves increased to $40.6 billion by end-October; and the consolidated NFA position turned positive in
September, to a cumulative $555 million.

 Banks’ sales of LL instruments to the BdL and strengthening of banks’ capital position. Banks were offered

sizable incentives to participate in the operation. For each purchase of FX securities, banks were eligible to discount
an equivalent amount of LL T-Bills or CDs to the BdL at a zero percent, and split equally the income with the BdL.1
The BdL instructed banks to retain all the income from the transaction as provisions in LL for a prospective
implementation of IFRS 9 accounting rules in 2018 (by creating a 2 percent general provision against the loan book
and a graduated increase in the Capital Adequacy Ratio from 12 percent to 15 percent by 2018). The discount of
T-bills and CDs at zero percent is akin to a money-financed capital injection (without any equity stake in return;
according to staff estimates, equivalent to 10 percent of GDP), which helped strengthen banks’ capital buffers.

Banks used various approaches to attract foreign currency. They sold Eurobonds to foreign clients at prevailing rates
and drew down their own FX liquidity—in part by repatriating funds from correspondent banks. A few banks also passed
on part of their income to high net-worth depositors, by offering very attractive rates on sizable deposits. As a result,
annualized deposit growth rate increased from 3.5 percent at end-May to 4.7 percent by early-November.
Banks are now facing sizable excess LL liquidity. As of mid-October, the operation had resulted in sizable liquidity
(equivalent to a third of GDP, some of which is being mopped up and already been invested in newly-issued LL T-Bills).
The BdL has taken various steps to reduce this liquidity further, and thus mitigate possible dollarization risks: (i) it is
issuing long-maturity term deposits (of 5 years or more) at rates slightly below the prevailing LL rates, provided that
participating banks subscribe 14 percent of any placement with the BdL in 5-year, 5-percent government bonds; and (ii)
it has asked banks to extend additional LL lending (though in the current economic climate, asset quality may be
affected in the future).
At the same time, the banks’ internal FX liquidity position has weakened. Before the operation, banks’ FX liquidity
held abroad had declined from a peak of $18 billion in June 2011 to $10.4 billion by May 2016; by end-August, it was
below $8.5 billion, increasing banks’ reliance on the BdL for FX liquidity. Lower FX liquidity has led to increased FX
deposit rates, narrowing the spread between LL and FX deposit rates and reducing the attractiveness of LL deposits.
Moreover, since the incentives offered by banks to depositors focused on giving them one-off upfront income (instead
of higher interest rates), prospects for keeping the new inflows in the system remain uncertain.
Finally, the operation also had an impact on BdL’s balance sheet. It added to the foreign exchange liabilities of the
BdL and the associated carry costs.
1
For example, a bank discounting a security with face value of LL 100 with 8 percent coupon and remaining maturity of 10 years
received upfront LL 140 (that is, LL 100 principal plus an immediate income of 40, equal to half of the LL 80 it would have
ultimately received (over time) if the security had been held to maturity.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
18.
Under the baseline, growth will likely remain subdued—too low to address Lebanon’s
macroeconomic imbalances and social challenges. We assume that the impact of the Syrian
conflict will remain broadly unchanged over the forecast horizon, depressing domestic confidence
and leaving a (modest) global recovery as Lebanon’s chief growth driver over the medium term.4
Thus, Lebanon’s output gap will remain open even toward the end of the projection period. As oil
prices normalize, inflation is expected to return to trend (around 2 percent) by early 2017.
19.
And without a change in sentiment, the economy’s funding base will remain soft.
Taking into account the BdL’s financial operation, deposit inflows will likely total about $8 billion in
2016, up from about $7 billion in 2015. But with the operation now closed, and under an
(unchanged-policy) baseline assumption no adjustment and reform, inflows are projected to return
to the levels seen in the early half of the year—short of the levels needed to fund the economy over
the medium term.5
20.
Upside potential is significant. With the election of a president, Lebanon now has the
opportunity to move beyond its recent political impasse. It is too early to project the likely impact of
a new political settlement, as key milestones will likely require time to be met. But the prospect of a
government able to tackle the country’s long-pending reform agenda could have a material impact
on confidence and growth, boosting inflows, supporting financial stability, and helping Lebanon’s
debt dynamics. Similarly, Lebanon’s outlook is linked closely to developments in Syria. In the event
of an early resolution, Lebanon would be uniquely placed to benefit from the reconstruction effort,
as well as from the reestablishment of trade and an improvement in regional investor confidence.
21.

But sizable vulnerabilities and risks remain (see Risk Assessment Matrix):



Deposit inflows could decelerate further. The willingness and ability of depositors to fund
Lebanon cannot be taken for granted, especially with the prospect of tighter regional and global
financial conditions, and in light of shifting geopolitical tensions. The concentration of deposits,
short-term maturity structure, and share of nonresident depositors in the Lebanese banking
system all add to Lebanon’s vulnerability (Box 3).



Growth could weaken further. Lower growth would compound Lebanon’s adverse debt dynamics
and imbalances, and ultimately impair banks’ asset quality.



Fiscal imbalances could widen. Increased spending pressure, or continued inertia, would increase
public debt, possibly leading to financing pressures and lower investor confidence. This could, in
turn, spread into the macro-financial sphere—triggering lower deposits, higher financing costs,
deteriorating bank finances, and falling reserves.

4 This is a departure from previous Article IV consultations, where staff had assumed that resolution of the Syria crisis
would start one year into the forecast horizon.
5 According to staff estimates, an average deposit growth of about 6–7 percent is sufficient to maintain the
economy’s foreign currency buffers.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to
indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and
50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of risks. They noted the
significance of regional political developments in shaping Lebanon’s outlook, highlighting in
particular the impact of the Syrian conflict. They also shared staff’s assessment regarding the
importance of continued deposit inflows, underscoring that regional competition for funds had
become more intense. But they noted that much of the recent slowdown in activity had resulted
from the prolonged political impasse in Lebanon, and that the formation of a new government
would likely result in a substantial turnaround in confidence, investment, and growth.

POLICY: ACTION NEEDED TO ANCHOR CONFIDENCE
23.
With limited policy change, domestic
and external vulnerabilities have deepened.
Lower growth and a larger debt burden have
increased the adjustment needed to stabilize
Lebanon’s debt dynamics; and if slow deposit
inflows persist, Lebanon’s external position might
weaken. On this basis, our estimates and
projections paint a less sanguine picture compared
to just one year ago.

24.
As Lebanon’s outlook is growing less
benign, only coordinated policy actions can anchor confidence. Lebanon’s macrofinancial
structure rests on the banking sector’s ability to attract continued inflows, while maintaining
confidence in the peg. As fiscal sustainability, depositor confidence, financial stability, and exchange
rate credibility are all tightly interconnected, the policy response to address Lebanon’s challenges
must include various policy areas.
25.

In this context, corrective measures are urgently needed.



Over the short term, the key challenge will be to preserve the confidence of foreign investors, by
articulating a credible policy mix that starts to address fiscal imbalances as a matter of urgency,
while also strengthening the resilience of Lebanon’s banking sector.



Over the longer term, social stability and shared prosperity require job-rich, sustainable growth.

26.
The 2016 consultation thus focused on three key themes: (i) starting the process of fiscal
adjustment immediately; (ii) standing ready to increase interest rates to support financial inflows, if
needed; while safeguarding financial stability; and (iii) laying the ground for higher-quality and more
inclusive growth.

Under current policies, debt dynamics will
deteriorate further. In the baseline scenario, low oil
prices will help secure sustained primary surpluses of
about 1½ percent of GDP. Nonetheless, higher
interest rates and subdued nominal growth will push
public debt to 160 percent of GDP by 2021—almost
20 percentage points higher than today (Annex II).7 At the
same time, spending rigidities will increase, with the
interest bill projected to exceed 11 percent of GDP by
2021, or about 60 percent of total revenue. Fiscal risks
may add further pressure, including sizable pension

28.
Low growth is a primary driver of Lebanon’s
adverse debt dynamics, but not the only one. The
drop in tax revenue of 4 percentage points of GDP in
just four years suggests that other factors are at play,
including tax policy changes (such as reductions in
fuel taxation in 2011–12) and deteriorating compliance
(see Selected Issues Paper on Revenue Mobilization).
Meanwhile, wages, interest payments and transfers
to Electricité du Liban (EdL) accounted for close to
70 percent of total expenditure in 2015. Capital spending
has narrowed to about 1 percent of GDP, significantly
below levels in comparator countries;6 and social
spending remains inadequate to address Lebanon’s
needs.

(In percent of GDP)

27.
Lebanon needs to make major progress in
lowering the public debt burden. Over 2005–10,
public debt dropped by 5 percentage points of GDP
per year on average, owing to high growth and
sustained primary surpluses. But as real growth
decelerated in 2011, this impetus weakened; and by
2015, the debt ratio started to increase again.

Given the lower growth profile in this year’s baseline, the end-of-projection (2021) level is significantly higher than

liabilities,8 demands to adjust public wages,9 a potential increase in oil prices, and a possible
softening in investor appetite for Lebanese debt.
30.
Fiscal adjustment is essential. And while adjustment at a time of low growth makes policy
trade-offs particularly acute, protracted inaction will prohibitively increase the size and cost of
adjustment needed in the future (Box 5).
Box 5. Fiscal Adjustment and Growth Trade-Offs
Fiscal policy affects growth via many channels, mainly by
tax and expenditure policies. However, there is only limited
consensus in the literature on the size and durability of fiscal
impact on growth. The empirical evidence suggests that the
size of the impact may depend on the type of fiscal
instrument used, the state of the business cycle, degree of
trade openness, and type of the exchange rate regime,
among other factors. While the empirical evidence is
extensive for advanced economies, much less is known
about the impact of fiscal policies in MENAP countries.
Assuming the composition and size of the proposed
upfront adjustment, growth is expected to be
temporarily reduced by 0.8 and 0.4 percentage points in
2017 and 2018. Based on the framework to quantify the size
and persistence of fiscal multipliers by Cerisola and others
(2015),1 elimination of a transfer to EdL has only a temporary
effect on growth, while the impact of the proposed tax
measures is expected to last for two years.
While the impact of lower growth on debt dynamics is
negligible, postponing the adjustment by two years
increases debt-to-GDP ratio by about 10 percentage
points of GDP. These estimates are subject to large
uncertainty. Nevertheless, assuming more lasting and
negative impact of the proposed tax measures on growth, is
unlikely to affect debt dynamics as negatively as its
postponed implementation.

The amount of adjustment needs to be sufficient to immediately halt further debt
increases. A primary balance of 4 percent of GDP would be sufficient to stabilize debt, requiring an
upfront adjustment of about 3 percent of GDP—if sustained, such an adjustment would place debt
on a downward path within 5–6 years. Debt would then slowly decline to 133 percent of GDP by

2030. While such a surplus might seem large compared to the experience of other countries, in the
case of Lebanon it needs to be viewed against high budget deficits and mounting funding needs
and interest bills.
32.
There is no substitute for upfront adjustment. Neither donor assistance, resolution of the
Syrian conflict, nor any prospective revenue from oil and gas would, in itself, sustainably resolve
Lebanon’s debt dynamics.


Donor assistance. Assuming grants increase over
2017–21, each year by between $400 million and
$1 billion (about 0.5 to 1.9 percent of GDP, in line
with the authorities’ grant requests at the London

trajectory would be small.

effort when the conflict ends. But even under a
favorable scenario—with the Syrian conflict ending
by end-2017, Lebanon’s output gap closing
immediately, and economic output rising by the
equivalent of 10 percent of Syrian GDP—the
positive impact on growth will not be sufficient for
debt sustainability.

Oil and gas resources. The size and income from
Lebanon’s off-shore resources are uncertain. And
given that exploration has not yet started, it could
take several years before the government would
start receiving revenue.

Key recommendations
33.
Our proposed adjustment package combines revenue and spending measures (see
Table below). The package needs to be adopted in its entirety to achieve the targeted primary
adjustment:


Passing a credible budget—the first in a more than decade—remains a critical priority. In
this context, the Minister of Finance’s recent efforts to submit a 2017 budget to cabinet are
praiseworthy, and passing a budget would provide a tangible sign of reform commitment.

Ongoing work to close accounts since 1993 needs to continue in parallel with the passing of a
budget.10


Long-standing revenue measures need to be implemented. 11 These include: (i) an increase
in the corporate income tax rate (from 15 to 17 percent); (ii) the introduction of a capital gains
tax on real estate; (iii) an increase in the rate on interest income tax (from 5 to 7 percent,
though timing may depend on deposit behavior); (iv) an increase in the VAT rate from 10 to at
least 11 percent; (v) an increase in tobacco excises; and (vi) new stamp duties and fees.



Increasing fuel taxation is overdue. Low retail prices provide a unique opportunity. The VAT
on diesel (suspended in 2011) needs to be restored and gasoline excises (significantly lowered in
2012) need to be increased to earlier levels, also to start containing negative externalities of high
fuel consumption. The impact of such measures needs to be compensated by strengthening the
social safety net (see below).



There is scope to increase tax compliance. Tax collection is only 50 percent of estimated
capacity (Box 6 and Selected Issues Paper on Revenue Mobilization). Ongoing efforts in this area
to further promote electronic tax declaration, among others, need to be strengthened. Although
the capacity of tax administration has increased by 120 staff in 2016, the needs are estimated to
be five times higher.

Average electricity tariffs need to be increased to reduce (and eventually eliminate)
transfers to Electricité du Liban. Current proposals to link tariffs to new additional capacity,
while protecting lower-end consumers, are welcome, as they should allow for an improvement
in service without worsening the fiscal situation. But these are a first step only. Improved service
from EdL will help reduce the average household energy bill, and so provide scope for further
tariff increases in the future, with the goal of eliminating the EdL subsidy altogether.

10

The ministry of finance has been preparing budgets, but the parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee has
refrained from considering them as accounts since 1993 have not yet been closed, despite significant progress made
on closing past accounts.

These measures had been considered in the context of plans to adopt a salary scale adjustment for the public
sector.

Box 6. VAT—A Good Candidate for Revenue Mobilization in Lebanon
There is need and scope to mobilize tax revenues in
Lebanon, especially given the country’s fiscal position. Tax
revenue performance in Lebanon is weak and has been driving
the drop in public revenues since 2010; and remains below the
regional average.

Lebanon’s tax effort (the ratio of actual tax revenue to
capacity—the maximum tax revenue a country can ideally achieve) is
lower than in similar MCD countries. Based on Fenochietto and Pessino
(2013),1 Lebanon’s tax effort is only 50 percent, indicating, tax revenues
might be doubled to around 30 percent of GDP at maximum effort. This
compares to an average of 60 percent for similar MCD countries and a
world average of about 70 percent.

VAT is typically a good candidate for revenue mobilization. It is one of the
least distortive taxes with generally the highest share in total tax revenue. As
the structure of the Lebanese economy is oriented towards private
consumption and a high share of imports, the potential gains from mobilizing
VAT revenues are significant.

A VAT gap analysis points to significant VAT erosion over time.2 This
analysis measures the overall gap between actual VAT receipts and receipts under a perfectly enforced VAT levied
on all consumption.3 In turn, this gap can be disentangled into two components: (i) the compliance gap, which
estimates the impact of imperfect compliance within the current tax system; and (ii) the policy gap, which
calculates the deviation of current tax rules from the
VAT Tax Gap (percent of GDP)
benchmark tax levied on all consumption. For Lebanon, the
2009 2010 2011 2012 2013
overall VAT gap was estimated at around 7.4 percent of GDP
in 2013; up from 6.1 percent in 2009. The compliance gap of

Public Debt - VAT Gap Reduced (Percent of GDP)

Policy simulation suggest there is room to improve fiscal
performance and debt dynamics over the medium term
assuming only incomplete and gradual elimination of the
VAT gap. Assuming a gradually elimination of a 50 percent of
the compliance gap and a partial elimination of the policy
gap—representing tax expenditure—that would happen over
the next five years, the primary balance would increase from
1.1 percent to 5.2 percent of GDP, the overall balance would
improve from -8.1 to -5.6 percent of GDP and the public debt
would stabilize at about 150 percent of GDP in 2021. Therefore,
this analysis suggests that even a partial elimination of the VAT
gap can lead to a significant improvement in fiscal performance.



A long-standing salary scale adjustment for the public sector poses challenges. If passed,
its budgetary costs need to be fully offset to preserve the targeted fiscal adjustment (for
example by considering broadening the VAT tax base and increasing VAT rates); at a minimum,
salary increases should be phased in without retroactive payments; and should ideally be linked
to measures to strengthen productivity and rationalize public sector employment growth.



The National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP) needs to be strengthened. The NPTP is an
essential part of Lebanon’s (nascent) social safety net, and provides support to households living
in extreme poverty. The program is funded in part by grants from the World Bank and UNDP,
but a proposal for additional government funding is currently waiting for the ministry of
finance’s approval, which should be granted as a matter of priority.

34.
Over time, as adjustment takes hold and as growth recovers, public investment and
social spending need to be increased. Rebalancing spending was a key focus of last year’s
consultation, and bears repeating.
35.
An appropriate oil and gas framework is needed. Legislation on an exploration and fiscal
regime for the oil and gas sector needs to be passed. A formal engagement with the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) would signal a commitment to transparency and
accountability.

Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities are aware of the importance of front-loaded fiscal adjustment and the
costs of delay. They acknowledged that debt-service costs pose a problem for sustainability, while
also crowding out needed spending. Although a number of measures—including stricter
implementation of spending ceilings as well as tax proposals―were presented in the draft 2016
budget, a number of additional measures are expected to be approved and implemented once a
new government is formed. At the same time, the authorities noted that, in the post-electoral
environment, spending pressures might intensify, especially if additional hiring in the public sector
continues.
37.
The proposed salary scale adjustment remains a sensitive issue. The authorities are
aware of the need to combine salary increases with reforms in the public sector employment,
especially to eliminate distortions in the wage structure across different public administration
sectors. They noted that public sector employees are entitled to the (long-delayed) salary increases,
also to secure a more decent living for public servants and to mitigate corruption in the public
sector.
38.
There was broad agreement on the design and implementation of the adjustment
proposed by staff. While agreeing on the tax measures, the authorities were of the view that
improvements in tax compliance and collections should precede increases in tax rates. They also
agreed that EdL transfers should be reduced and eventually eliminated, though they noted some
disappointment at the lack of progress on proposals to change the tariff structure.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

39.
The authorities reiterated that the international community needs to provide
additional assistance, especially direct budget support. They stressed the global public good
afforded by Lebanon’s hosting such a large refugee presence. And they requested that the
international community provide additional funding, not only as humanitarian aid, but also in the
form of budget support. They also noted that, while funding in some areas had increased, the lack of
longer-term commitments makes the provision and scaling up of critical services particularly
challenging, as effective interventions will span over a number of years—in the case of education,
for example, the authorities noted that they cannot educate children for one year and suspend their
education the next for lack of funding.

B. Preserving Confidence in Lebanon’s Financial System
Using Interest Rates to Secure Buffers
40.
The BdL is bearing much of the burden of economic policy. It has effectively operated as
a policy maker of last resort—playing a critical role in preserving stability and supporting Lebanon’s
exchange rate peg (Lebanon’s key nominal anchor). In this context, while the BdL’s recent financial
operation has helped offset a decline in reserves, it cannot offer a sustainable solution to Lebanon’s
funding needs. Absent an improvement in depositor sentiment, the BdL will need to attract fresh
inflows, which may require higher interest rates. To date, the BdL has not yet raised rates owing to
concerns about public debt dynamics and growth. But a policy change will be unavoidable if deposit
growth does not improve.
41.
The timing and extent of any potential change in interest rates will depend on
Lebanon’s fiscal stance.


Fiscal adjustment would help reduce the government’s financing requirements, especially in
foreign exchange. The BdL has been providing foreign exchange to the government through an
overdraft facility12—allowing the government to draw foreign exchange resources beyond the
ceiling set by law on its (non BdL) foreign currency borrowing. In the context of softening
deposit inflows, funding the government’s foreign currency needs might place added strain on
reserves.



Fiscal adjustment would also pave the way for more market-determined interest rates. The BdL
has sometimes helped finance the government by offering long-term instruments to banks and
channeling the proceeds to cover shortfalls in both the T-bill market and the Eurobonds market.
As a result, T-Bill yields have remained largely unchanged since 2012, muting their role as a key
market signal. Finally, the BdL also has adopted a range of quasi-fiscal initiatives to channel
subsidized credit to support the economy, particularly to the real estate sector ($4.4 billion over
2013–16).

12

At the same time, the government maintains positive net balances with the BdL in domestic currency (equivalent
to $4.3 billion at end-September 2016).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

LEBANON

Key recommendations
Monetary policy needs to remain geared to supporting the exchange rate peg.





If deposit growth were to soften, rather than relying on a repeat of its recent operation, the
BdL would instead need to use interest rates as a more direct and easily communicated
policy tool to secure foreign exchange inflows. In this regard, the BdL also needs to
communicate the size and scope of its recent operation to reduce market uncertainty.13



While an interest rate increase would have an impact on debt service for both the private
and public sector and increase banks’ cost of funding, such costs should be cast against the
implications of the recent BdL operation.



Given the size of their reserve buffers (which remain adequate, Annex III), the authorities
have some freedom to choose the pace and timing of any interest rate move.



Steps to absorb excess liquidity need to be accompanied by efforts to encourage banks to
improve their net foreign asset position. The BdL needs to continue to sterilize the excess
Lebanese pound liquidity created by the financial operation, while remaining vigilant to ensure
that new lending does not undermine asset quality. Going forward, as financing needs are
reduced, banks need to be encouraged to rebuild their foreign exchange liquidity buffers
abroad—taking into account rollover and dollarization risks.



As fiscal adjustment takes hold over time, the BdL would need to withdraw from T-Bill
and Eurobond auctions and encourage banks to participate directly. As an incentive, it
would gradually reduce the attractiveness of placements with the BdL, paving the way for more
flexible and market-based yields on government instruments. Overall, this will encourage greater
fiscal discipline.



As conditions normalize, the BdL also needs to withdraw from quasi-fiscal schemes. It
would need to allow old subsidized credit schemes to expire, while refraining from adding new
ones. Looking forward, there is a need to strengthen the BdL’s balance sheet, as its income
position has been impacted by repeated policy interventions.

Authorities’ views
42.
In the authorities’ view, the financial operation has met several objectives and has
helped preserve financial stability. The BdL emphasized the following seven objectives:
strengthening BdL’s foreign currency assets, enhancing the capital base of banks, increasing liquidity
in local currency, improving the government debt profile by reducing the cost of borrowing,
improving the balance of payments, targeting positive inflation rate, and improving the country’s
rating and outlook. They pointed to steps being taken to sterilize the excess (local-currency)
liquidity created by the operation, and underscored that the operation had boosted confidence. In

22

their view, staff’s assessment of the operation was rather negative, and the market needed time to
absorb the operation’s implications. The authorities continued to view interest rate tools as
excessively costly to the economy, and felt that the financial operation was the best option at hand
given the various constraints and pressures faced at the time it was undertaken.

Preserving Confidence in the Banking System
43.
Lebanon’s resilience hinges on the continued health of its macro-financial structure.
The FSAP findings (see Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report) suggest that the
country’s challenging economic environment and the government’s growing funding needs are
having an impact on banks. Moreover, while regulatory capital requirements exceed the minimum
levels set under the Third Basel Accord, banks’ capital buffers are modest in light of their significant
exposure to local-currency sovereign debt and foreign-currency BdL instruments.


Sovereign exposure. Risk weights are not in line with international standards.14 In the event of a
sovereign downgrade to a rating below “B-“ and a corresponding increase in risk-weights for all
FX-denominated instruments to 150 percent—as per Basel’s standardized approach—the impact
would be a reduction of regulatory capital by an estimated 6 percentage points.



Interest rate risk. Banks are primarily funded via short-term deposits and have a large portion of
their investments in long-term sovereign instruments, pointing to interest rate risk.



Asset quality. Despite a slowdown in the real economy, reported nonperforming loans (NPLs)
have remained relatively stable over past five years, at 10.4 percent by end-June 2016.15 Banks
are also significantly exposed to Lebanon’s softening real estate sector—either directly in the
form of housing loans and loans to developers, or indirectly in the form of loans to corporates,
in turn collateralized by real estate.



Foreign currency liquidity needs. A large
share of banks’ foreign currency assets
(e.g., long-term deposits with the BdL) cannot
be immediately pledged in the interbank
market to raise liquidity, suggesting that large
liquidity shocks might quickly involve the BdL
as lender of last resort. And net foreign assets
of banks have declined. At present, 1 percent of
deposits (or $1.6 billion) represents 4 percent of
BdL’s gross reserves, highlighting the systemic
importance of sufficient liquidity buffers.

Currently, banks are allowed to apply a risk-weight of 50 percent for FX-denominated BdL exposure (instead of

B- equivalent).

44.
Assessment of compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCP) found that the
supervisor is well respected, though continued progress is needed in a number of areas. The
Banking Control Commission’s (BCC) deserves credit for raising supervisory standards; at the same
time, the supervisory approach does not yet support a clear view on the risk profile and systemic
relevance of individual banks. In addition, the ongoing BCC supervisory review of capital needs to
reflect banks’ risk profile. The FSAP also found that the loan classification rules currently are not
aligned with international best practice.
Key recommendations
45.
The authorities have put in place a number of actions in line with the FSSA’s main
recommendations. The recent announcement by BCC to implement a graduated increase of the
capital adequacy ratio to 15 percent (from 12 percent) by 2018 is welcome. In addition:


There is a need for forward-looking capital planning. Over the longer run, banks will need
to engage in forward-looking capital planning reflecting their risk profile and linked to a
multi-factor stress testing. In this context, the supervisory review of capital planning is welcome.
In addition, the risk weight on BdL foreign-currency exposure needs to be aligned with the Basel
Accord, allowing for a reduction in sovereign exposure over the medium term, and incentivizing
banks to diversify their liquidity holdings as they strengthen their net foreign asset position.



Continued efforts to strengthen banking regulation and supervision are needed. As per
the BCP assessment, there is a need to align the regulatory treatment of restructured loans with
international good practice and to stay vigilant on asset quality, including by monitoring
loan-loss migrations at the bank level. The authorities also need to put in place a systematic
reporting system on the funding structure and liquidity risk profile.



The Anti Money Laundering (AML)/Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) framework
needs to be strengthened further. While progress has been made since the last full
assessment of Lebanon’s AML/CFT framework in 2009—including through legislative steps taken
in November 2015—some gaps remain. In line with the FSSA recommendations, the authorities
need to better align AML/CFT supervision with current ML/TF risks; and need to continue to
keep a close focus on the risk of withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships.

Authorities’ views
46.
The authorities provided several clarifications on capital adequacy. First, they noted that
the BdL places banks’ foreign currency deposits with foreign central banks and prime banks whose
credit assessment is BBB and above. Hence, the risk weight of banks’ exposure to the BdL with
regard to placements in foreign currency (50 percent) should be considered in the context of their
exposure to foreign central banks and prime banks. Second, the BCC regularly conducts scenario
analyses, including to analyze the potential impact of a downgrade of Lebanon’s sovereign rating to
a level below B-. Such analyses indicate that a downgrade to CCC+ would not cause all banks to
breach minimum required capital ratios. Lastly, the new regime of a graduated increase in the capital
adequacy ratio to 15 percent from 12 percent will protect against risks mentioned above.
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

47.
The authorities disagreed with the BCP assessment of problem assets and the
provisioning and quality of banks’ loan portfolios, and the assessment of the AML/CFT
framework. They stated that the applicable regulatory framework prescribes the criteria for
supervisory loan classification and sets the framework for following up on all loans, with special care
taken for loans classified as Class 3 or worse, noting that the BCC reviews a large sample of credit
portfolios, covering at least 50 percent of the total banks’ loan portfolios, through its missions.
Finally, they underscored that they are fully compliant with AML/CFT rules according to Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) and MENA FATF.

C. Lebanon’s Only Enduring Solution: Investment, Jobs, and Growth
48.
There cannot be enduring and inclusive growth without structural reform. The
traditional drivers of growth have not provided the high-quality, job-rich growth needed. Indeed,
Lebanon’s employment growth elasticity is one of the lowest in the region (at least for Lebanese
nationals), and job creation has not kept up with the economy’s growing labor force–now expanded
by the refugee influx.16
49.
Lebanon’s current account deficit suggests
an underlying competitiveness problem,
even factoring in the Syria crisis. The sharp increase
in the deficit is attributable, in part, to the disruption
of trade relationships and elevated regional
uncertainty. Nonetheless, even abstracting from the
impact of Syria, the external balance is weaker than
suggested by fundamentals, pointing to an
underlying problem with productivity and
competitiveness (see Annex III).17 If Lebanon is to
transition to a stronger, more sustainable growth
path, action is needed to boost productivity, fight
corruption, and address the cost of doing business.18

According to ILO estimates, the national unemployment rate is estimated at around 9 percent, but rises to
12 percent including refugees.

17

The EBA methodology results suggest that Lebanon’s real exchange rate may be overvalued by anywhere between
0–23 percent. However, in light of concerns regarding the quality of Lebanon’s current account data, and given the
particular nature of the Syrian conflict, such results should be treated with caution.

50.
The need for electricity reform is a long-standing priority. The electricity sector has not
only been widely identified as Lebanon’s most pressing bottleneck, but it also remains a major drain
on the budget. Indeed, over 2006–14 the government transferred an average of 4½ percent of GDP
each year to EdL, representing over 40 percent of the current debt stock. The World Bank has long
been active in promoting electricity reform. But progress has been hindered by, political
disagreements within the government.
51.
Lebanon’s stock of human capital remains a key untapped resource. Lebanon enjoys a
steady stream of well-educated labor market entrants (see Selected Issues Paper on Human Capital
and the Knowledge Economy), but has typically had difficulty matching these entrants with suitable
job opportunities. The net result has been an ongoing “brain drain”—adding to the strength of
Lebanon’s diaspora, but limiting the scope for domestic development. The BdL has launched a new
financing program (under BdL Circular 331) to help boost startup investment in the knowledge
economy, aimed at stemming the drain of Lebanon’s talented youth, and jumpstarting the
development of a local high-tech sector.
52.
The knowledge economy is a promising source of growth, but challenges remain.
Access to cheaper financing has helped kick-start the sector, though there are limits to what the BdL
can do on its own. For Lebanon to realize the full potential of its human capital, various stakeholders
need to work together to create a conducive institutional and business climate, starting from
strengthening infrastructure—frequent electricity outages and slow internet speeds are a major
hindrance for firms.
53.
Lebanon’s capital markets have the potential for development. The Capital Markets
Authority (CMA) is now operational and a new trading platform is paving the way for market
initiatives. But successful development will require a further strengthening of Lebanon’s
regulatory and institutional framework. And as markets grow, the CMA needs to strike a balance
between innovation and investor protection, shifting the nature of its oversight towards monitoring,
risk-based supervision of intermediaries, and market surveillance.
54.
But investment and growth are not just long-term needs. Lebanon’s refugee presence
has added to Lebanon’s infrastructure gap and has intensified the need for reform. As a matter of
policy, Lebanon has long affirmed that it is not a country of asylum or resettlement, and that the
Syrian refugees cannot expect to stay in Lebanon permanently. Nonetheless, as a large number of
refugees is likely to remain in Lebanon over the medium term, there is a need to shift them away
from a protracted cycle of short-term humanitarian aid. In this context, there is an immediate need
for increased investment (especially in infrastructure) and job-rich growth.19 But this requires
sustained and forward-looking support from the international community, starting with the authorities’
proposal at the 2016 London conference (Box 7).
19

Regulatory requirements, including a substantial residency fee and additional documentary requirements
have restricted refugees’ access to the labor market, and have come at a substantial humanitarian cost. At the
London Conference, the authorities committed to review these regulations. See
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/498026/Supporting_Syria__the_Regi
on_London_2016_-_Lebanon_Statement.pdf. Most recently, the authorities have replaced the pledge not to work
with a pledge to abide by Lebanese Law, which allows for legal employment in a number of specified sectors.
26

Box 7. The 2016 London Conference
At the London Conference in February 2016, the authorities presented a new plan to address the costs
of the refugee crisis. Noting that Lebanon is, by necessity, providing a critical universal public good, the plan
calls for substantial international assistance—$11 billion over 2016–20, including both grants ($5 billion) and
loans ($6 billion). The plan’s proposals are wide-ranging and ambitious, covering budget support, concessional
financing, and direct assistance to local municipalities and the school system.

The key thrust of the proposal is an effort to stimulate growth
and employment through a targeted series of investment
initiatives. It focuses not only on high-priority infrastructure needs,
but also on the maintenance of key public services (education,
municipal services, etc.). In essence, it targets some of Lebanon’s
investment bottlenecks directly, helping the economy scale up to
meet its new employment needs. The authorities project that these
interventions could create 300,000–350,000 jobs, of which
60 percent would accrue to Syrian refugees. Also, the authorities
would encourage job creation in labor-intensive sectors through the
Subsidized Temporary Employment Programme (STEP), which
provides incentives for small- and medium-sized enterprises to
invest and expand their workforce. It is estimated that this would
generate a further 100,000 jobs, again shared between local
residents and Syrian refugees.

But despite the potential benefits of the authorities’ plan, incorporating Syrian refugees into the
labor market is potentially controversial. As a matter of policy, Lebanon has long maintained that it is not a
country of asylum, a final destination for refugees, or a country of resettlement. The permanent integration of
Syrian refugees, therefore, is not viewed as a viable solution; and any measure that discourages the ultimate
repatriation of the refugees is arguably problematic. In this context, according to Decree 197 (December 2014)
Syrians can only work legally in the agricultural, construction, and domestic service sectors. And even for these
sectors, the financial and administrative requirements for establishing legal residency are often prohibitive for
a large portion of vulnerable Syrian households. Many refugees enter the labor market illegally, but the
insecurity and inefficiencies associated with the informal sector represent a significant burden—not only in
humanitarian terms, but also in terms of the labor market’s ability to adjust quickly and flexibly. Expanding
refugee access to stable sources of livelihood has clear humanitarian and security benefits; but it also allows
the refugee community to contribute to local growth and development. Moreover, the impact on repatriation
incentives is unclear. International experience suggests that self-reliant refugees, who have been able to
enhance their skills while in exile, are often able to return to their origin country more rapidly (World Bank,
2015).1

Key recommendations
55.
While the adoption of a far-reaching reform agenda will depend on political
consensus, small steps in a few select areas could have a significant impact on confidence. In
staff’s view, the following measures are perhaps the most pressing:


Electricity reforms. Lower oil prices are not a reliable source of sustained budget savings, and,
ultimately, electricity transfers need to be reduced to zero. In this context, low oil prices present
an opportunity to start the process of bringing tariffs up to cost-recovery levels—though in a
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

way that protects more vulnerable consumers. Recent proposals to link the tariff structure to the
expansion of capacity are promising and need to be adopted quickly, as they allow for increased
production (and lower production costs) without increasing transfers from the budget.


Fostering the knowledge economy. In terms of funding, revisiting the scale of incentives to
avoid too much money chasing too few ideas could be beneficial. Finalizing and implementing
capital market regulation, and the preparation and adoption of a capital market development
plan could also help. But more fundamentally, there is a need to put in place a supporting
ecosystem for the knowledge economy, starting from reliable and robust internet connectivity
and electricity.



Facilitating donor support. The framework for channeling funds through the government
needs to be improved. As short-term measures:





There is need to expedite the disbursement of donor money from budgetary transit
accounts, as currently procedures remain slow.20



The coordination framework launched after the London Conference, to better coordinate
with the international community, needs to be elevated to a high-level forum to discuss
strategic issues.

Pending legislation. The framework law for Public Private Partnerships—awaiting parliamentary
approval for three years—could help mobilize private sector resources for infrastructure
investment, though with due attention to possible fiscal risks. Similarly, an agreement with the
European Union regarding simplified rules-of-origin for Lebanese exports has been negotiated
but is yet to be ratified.

Authorities’ Views
56.
The authorities agreed broadly with staff’s diagnosis and priorities, but stressed that
the slow pace of reform in the past had been a symptom of Lebanon’s protracted political
impasse. The election of a president was an encouraging first step, and following the formation of a
new government, action on the reform agenda could potentially proceed very swiftly. The
authorities agreed in particular with the pressing need for electricity reform, and noted that a tariff
structure that allowed an expansion of generating capacity would be key in bringing down overall
production costs.
57.
The authorities also underscored that Lebanon’s reform agenda was closely linked to
the refugee presence, and that additional donor funding would be critical. Lebanon’s
infrastructure deficit has widened sharply owing to the added demands of the refugee community.
So far, most donor support had come in the form of short-term humanitarian assistance but even
this was short of actual needs. Longer-term funding—either in the form of budget support to

20

delivery from the transit account to the education sector cannot be guaranteed.

reduce the government’s cost of borrowing, or concessional finance for infrastructure spending—
has not yet materialized. While grateful for the support received so far, they urged the international
community to step up their support as a matter of urgency.

D. Data Issues
58.
Data quality remains weak. There has been a general deterioration in the provision of data.
Fiscal data are reported with long and increasing lags; national accounts compilation suffers from
serious shortcomings; and balance of payments statistics are subject to frequent and sizable
revisions. The Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) and the External Sector Section of the BdL
are aware of existing problems and are working to improve data quality. But progress has been slow
and uneven.
Key recommendation


The authorities need to address data gaps. At a minimum, the timeliness of fiscal data need to
be improved; IIP data need to be finalized and published; and collaboration between CAS and
other institutions needs to be strengthened.

STAFF APPRAISAL
59.
Lebanon finds itself at a critical juncture. The recent presidential election and the
appointment of a new prime minister with a mandate to form a new government bode well for a
revamping of Lebanon’s policymaking framework. Lack of adjustment and reform in the past has
reflected internal and regional political fissures, rather than a lack of capacity.
60.
The Syria shock has been both profound and long-lasting. The costs of regional conflicts
have been significant; growth has stalled; and Lebanon’s already-strained infrastructure and services
have struggled to cope with refugee inflows. Despite all this, Lebanon has endured and its response
to the crisis is a testament to both its generosity and resilience.
61.
Yet, the need for adjustment and reform pre-dates the Syrian crisis. Lebanon entered it
with a long-standing need for reform and with large infrastructure gaps—chief among all, in the
electricity sector. The budget was also burdened with significant spending rigidities, mainly related
to salaries, debt service and transfers to EdL. High growth rates masked all these factors prior to the
crisis, but once growth dissipated, they have come to weigh heavily on fiscal performance.
62.
The economy faces rising vulnerabilities. Staff estimates and projections are less benign
compared to last year’s Article IV consultation, especially on public debt dynamics. And a new
development—the slowdown in financial inflows—has come at a time when the economy’s funding
needs remain sizeable, and when liquidity conditions have tightened in many of Lebanon’s
traditional sources of funding, namely regional oil exporters. As a result, Lebanon’s foreign exchange
reserves dropped for the first time in eleven years in 2015, and the decline continued into mid-2016,
prompting the BdL to take action.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

LEBANON

63.
The BdL’s recent financial operation has been a stop-gap measure, but cannot
sustainably resolve Lebanon’s funding needs. The BdL has continued its efforts to support
financial stability and the exchange rate peg, which remains the appropriate nominal anchor. As in
previous episodes, the BdL has deployed unconventional measures. While the operation bolstered
BdL’s gross international reserves and banks’ capital, it has also resulted in a large injection of local
currency liquidity and erosion of banks’ foreign currency buffers, which now need to be addressed;
and has affected the BdL’s balance sheet. In addition, as in other countries, it is important for the
BdL to communicate the size and scope of its unconventional measures in a timely manner.
64.
Going forward, the policy agenda needs to decisively address Lebanon’s pressure
points. Fiscal adjustment is essential—large enough to halt Lebanon’s adverse debt dynamics, and
with a composition that broadens the tax burden (starting from fuel taxation) while seeking to
rebalance the spending mix toward more efficient programs and better social safety nets. Neither
large donor funding, temporarily higher growth, nor prospective gas revenue can permanently
substitute for fiscal adjustment. Passing a credible budget remains a critical priority and would signal
a strong commitment to discipline. Fiscal adjustment would also reduce the government’s reliance
on bank funding and would, in turn, reduce the need for ongoing financial inflows—ultimately
relieving pressure on the BdL and allowing it to use interest rate policy more flexibly going forward.
65.
Financial stability has been a pillar of sustained confidence. The banking system is
renowned for its resilience—though the system now faces a more challenging macroeconomic
environment, growing exposure to the sovereign, lower foreign currency liquidity buffers abroad,
significant interest-rate risk, and greater international scrutiny. The Banking Control Commission is
proactively vigilant. Its efforts need to be complemented by measures to introduce forward-looking
capital planning; strengthen regulation and supervision by, among others, aligning loan
classification rules and sovereign risk weights with international good practice; and support liquidity
risk management. Finally, the AML/CFT frameworks need to be strengthened further.
66.
Higher, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth can provide a lasting solution.
Current growth rates are insufficient to address Lebanon’s employment or social needs, and even in
the past, higher growth rates have often failed to generate sufficient job opportunities. But Lebanon
has a wide range of resources at its disposal, including an innovative and resilient business sector,
and an enviable pool of high-quality human talent. Unlocking this potential will require
reinvigorating Lebanon’s structural reform agenda to address key infrastructure bottlenecks, also to
improve competitiveness. But beyond the longer-term need for a more balanced growth path,
job-rich investment is urgently needed now, particularly in light of large-scale refugee presence. The
authorities’ ambitious proposal at the London Conference to boost employment and growth
deserves attention and international support.
67.
In this context, the international community needs to play a stronger role. Lebanon has
received significant assistance, but largely for humanitarian purposes and below estimated needs.
Funding volatility also undermines the effectiveness of spending programs. Larger and more stable
support to help Lebanon address the costs of the Syrian crisis is both needed and warranted.

68.
Data gaps need to be addressed. Progress continues to be made in many areas; stronger
cooperation among agencies and high-level support for the Central Administration of Statistics
would help strengthen data compilation and dissemination. The Fund stands ready to assist,
including through our Middle East Technical Assistance Center.
69.
Staff propose that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Status of the Article IV 2015 Recommendations
Recommendations
The 2015 consultation called for fiscal discipline. Concretely, the consultation called for a
restored primary surplus to place debt on a more sustainable path, including through: increased
fuel taxation, increasing the VAT from 10 to 11 percent; increasing the tax rate on interest income
from 5 to 7 percent; introducing a capital gains tax on real estate transactions; introducing new stamp
duties and fees; and regularizing telecom transfers. The consultation also urged the authorities to
pass a budget.
The 2015 consultation also stressed the importance of preserving financial stability. In this
context, it was suggested that the authorities needed to: strengthen bank supervision; increase capital
buffers; improve loan classification and restructuring rules; and enhance the AML/CFT framework. To
promote capital market development, the consultation also recommended that the authorities
privatize the Beirut Stock Exchange.
The 2015 consultation highlighted the need for structural reform to help secure more inclusive
growth and greater resilience. It was recommended that the authorities renew their efforts to
reform the electricity sector, including through a gradual increase in tariffs toward cost recovery
levels. The consultation also suggested that the authorities needed to: reform the pension system;
encourage employment opportunities for high-skill workers; and pass long-delayed legislation
(e.g., on Public Private Partnerships, or on the use of gas resources) to provide a signal to potential
investors. It also underscored the need for the authorities to improve the provision and quality of
statistical information.
Progress
In the fiscal sector, the authorities managed a small primary surplus in 2015, which is likely to be
repeated in 2016. Telecom transfers over 2015–16 were also substantially more regular than in 2014.
The minister of finance presented the 2017 budget to cabinet within the deadlines established under
the constitution, but no action has been taken so far by cabinet or parliament. In the monetary
sector, parliament passed legislation related to the AML/CFT framework. And on structural reform,
parliament convened two emergency sessions to pass a series of long delayed legislation, including
measures to comply with international tax transparency norms, and to help unlock funding from the
World Bank. Delays in the dissemination of statistical information have increased.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
With public debt already above 140 percent of GDP and gross financing needs close to 30 percent of
GDP, risks to public debt sustainability are increasingly significant. Under the baseline scenario, debt
and financing needs will continue to rise as a share of GDP, reaching 160 percent and 33 percent,
respectively, by 2021. In addition, debt dynamics and financing needs are subject to significant
macro-economic shocks, especially to growth and contingent liability shocks. The level of foreign
exchange reserves and a captive investor base remain important mitigating factors.
1.

The baseline scenario does not assume any improvement in the conflict in Syria within

the projection horizon. This is also underpinned by the following assumptions:
Real GDP growth is projected to pick up slowly. From 2 percent in 2017, itis projected to increase



gradually, to 3 percent in 2019 and for the rest of the projection horizon.
Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) is estimated to remain at 1 percent in 2016 and 2017.



Between 2018 and 2021 it is projected to increase marginally and settle slightly below 2 percent.
The primary balance is projected to stay in a surplus of about 1–1½ percent of GDP from 2016



onwards. Low oil prices are the main exogenous factor driving surpluses. The projections also
assume that no corrective measure will be introduced on the revenue and expenditure side.
2.

The baseline assumptions are broadly plausible. Lebanon’s forecast track record is not

systematically biased, as reflected in projection errors generally not being consistently on one side
or the other. The median forecast errors for growth, inflation and primary balance during 2010–15
are broadly in line with those observed in other countries.
3.

The deteriorating debt outlook is mainly shaped by the projected path of the positive

interest rate-growth differential. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase from
138 percent in 2015 to 160 percent in 2021. Economic growth is not expected to reach levels large
enough to offset adverse dynamics from real interest rates. Although the gross financing needs are
projected to increase by only 3 percentage points of GDP, to 33 percent of GDP in 2021, they would
reach levels of about 40 percent of GDP beyond 2021. Their trajectory is primarily driven by large
fiscal deficits and the debt maturity profile—an average of around 5 and 7 years, for domestic and
foreign debt, respectively.

4.

The debt and financing needs projections are particularly sensitive to growth and

contingent liability shocks:


Growth shock. Slower growth remains the principal risk to debt sustainability. Assuming a decline
in growth by one standard deviation in 2017 and 2018, the debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
reach above 180 percent of GDP in 2021. Financing needs are projected to reach 37 percent of
GDP in 2021 and remain at high levels until the end of the projection horizon.



Interest rate shock. Higher interest rates also pose a significant risk to debt sustainability. A shock
to the interest rate results in the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching above 165 percent at the end of
the projection horizon. Financing needs are projected to reach 35 percent of GDP in 2021.



Macro-fiscal shock. If shocks to growth, interest rate, and primary balance occurred
simultaneously, the debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed 190 percent at the end of the projection
horizon. Financing needs would reach 40 percent of GDP and continue growing.



Contingent liability shock. In the absence of contingent liabilities estimates, a standardized shock
of 10 percent of financial sector assets is used to represent a hypothetical realization of such
contingent liabilities. In such a scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 200 percent at the
end of the projection horizon. Financing needs would reach 40 percent of GDP in 2021. The
large effect reflects the significant size of Lebanon’s banking sector. This scenario does not
assume any feedback on GDP growth and interest rates due to the contingent liability shock.

5.

The fan charts show significant uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the

symmetric fan chart, estimated at around 60 percent of GDP, illustrates the degree of uncertainty for
equal-probability upside and downside shocks. But in light of the downside risks associated with the
Syria crisis, an upside shock to growth is constrained to zero in the asymmetric fan chart, resulting in
a more upward-sloping debt path. This reflects a balance of risks skewed to the downside.
6.

Lebanon’s debt profile reveals weaknesses. External financing needs are well above

the upper risk-assessment benchmark and public debt in foreign currency above the lower
risk-assessment benchmark. While bond spreads are above the lower risk assessment benchmark,
they have been relatively stable in past episodes of stress. Public debt held by nonresidents is
estimated to be only slightly above the lower risk assessment benchmark, while the level of, and the
change in, short-term debt are below the lower risk assessment benchmarks.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

7.

Risks to debt sustainability need to be weighed against a number of mitigating

factors.


Investor base. Debt is held largely by domestic financial institutions that are tightly regulated in
terms of their net open positions and investment strategies. This factor, coupled with relatively
low demand for private sector credit and limited regional investment opportunities, has resulted
in a captive investor base (although to participate in the recent financial operation domestic
banks sold part of their Eurobond holdings to foreign clients). In turn, domestic financial
institutions fund their positions from deposits largely held by nonresidents, though recently
these have started to decelerate. In addition, a significant share of domestic debt is held by the
BdL.



Debt financing profile. The large external financing needs—amounting to almost 170 percent
of GDP—reflect payments related to debt but also, to a significant extent, large nonresident
short-term deposits. Although debt denominated in foreign currency accounts for about
40 percent of total public debt, it is held mostly by domestic financial institutions.



Buffers. The high level of gross international reserves remains an anchor for investors’
confidence. In addition, ample LL liquidity in the economy would point to an excess demand for
government papers denominated in LL.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
1.

In a continuation of last year’s trend, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has

appreciated while the real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated marginally and
returned to its end-2014 level. The appreciation of the NEER reflects largely the appreciation of
the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the euro. In contrast, the CPI inflation differential has declined as the drop in
oil price has passed through to domestic prices, leading to a more muted behavior of the REER.

The current account deficit has decreased but remains large, while data quality

remains problematic. Lebanon has sustained large current account deficits by international
standards for almost a decade; the deficit widened notably in the wake of the Syrian crisis (by an
average of 10 percent of GDP). However, errors and omissions also increased substantially during
the same period (by an average of 9 percent of GDP) pointing to the presence of the large
unrecorded inflows (overstated outflows). Moreover, data revisions in the last few years have been
frequent and large in magnitude. As presented in the 2015 Article IV report, the current account
deficit for 2012 was revised from 11.7 percent to 24.6 percent within a year. At the moment,
revisions from 2014 onwards are likely, though their magnitude and sign remain uncertain.
Preliminary data has led to sharp revision of some series, such as errors and omission, but has not
been confirmed yet. We estimate current account deficit to be 17.5 percent of GDP in 2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3.

The improvement in the goods trade balance reflects the substantial decline in oil

prices. Oil imports account for approximately 20 percent of Lebanon total imports. In 2015, the
import bill decreased by about $1.9bn or about 4 percent of GDP. As a result, the current account
balance deficit also narrowed, and is expected to continue to do so in the medium term, as external
demand increases at a faster pace than the gradual increase in oil prices. This forecast assumes that
Lebanon would be able to finance its large external deficit, have a gradual adjustment, and avoid a
drastic current account reversal through import compression.
The EBA-lite methodology1 shows mixed results. According to the current account (CA)

4.

approach, the exchange rate is overvalued by 23 percent, reflecting a CA norm2 of 13.2 percent of
GDP. On the other hand, the REER is at equilibrium according to the REER approach. Given the large
uncertainty about the actual size of the CA deficit, it is possible that the actual misalignment is lower
than the one reflected by the CA approach. The EBA-lite methodology suggests some overvaluation
of the exchange rate. Yet, the ability of this methodology to capture deviations from equilibrium
could be compromised in an environment facing a temporary but protracted shock as the Syrian
crisis.

Annex IV. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.

Lebanon’s external debt remained elevated at 175 percent of GDP as of end-2015, and

is projected to keep increasing before declining in 2021. The high debt level reflects the sizable
current account deficit and the large stock of non-resident deposits (largely with short-term
maturity). Under the baseline, external debt is projected to pick at 180 percent of GDP in 2017 and
decline slightly to 175 percent of GDP in 2021. The slight decline is explained by the reduction in the
current account deficit and in the growth rate of non-resident deposits, while GDP growth is forecast
to increase.
2.

The scenarios reflect Lebanon’s sensitivity to exchange rate movements. Out of all the

scenarios, a real depreciation of 30 percent represents the most severe one, leading to an increase
of external debt to 253 percent of GDP. The sensitivity of the debt dynamics to this shock highlights
the importance of the exchange rate peg to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability in
Lebanon. Debt dynamics are also sensitive to other shocks, though depending on their size, the
impact would be less severe.1 For instance, by 2021 debt would increase to 180 percent of GDP
under a permanent shock to the interest rate, to 190 percent of GDP under a growth shock, and to
198 percent of GDP under a shock to the non-interest current account balance.

The bound tests are based on ½ standard deviation shocks calculated on 10-year historical data (see charts).

Safeguards Assessment:
Pursuant to Fund policy, the Banque du Liban (BdL) was subject to a full safeguards assessment in
conjunction with the first Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) in April 2007. The 2008
safeguards assessment report proposed several specific measures for enhancing the BdL financial
reporting, audit and control procedures, and recommended an update of the central bank law. An
update safeguards assessment was completed in August 2009 in the context of the second EPCA.
The update noted progress achieved in enhancing procedures for reserve management and external
audit, but recommended further actions to strengthen internal audit, financial reporting
transparency, oversight, and central bank legislation.

Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Lebanon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The exchange arrangement, which maintains a de-facto peg to the
U.S. dollar, is classified as stabilized. Since October 1999, the BdL has been intervening to keep the
pound around a mid-point parity of LL 1,507.5 per $1, with a bid-ask spread of LL+/-6.5.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2015 Article IV Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 26, 2015. At the
time, Directors commended the authorities for preserving macroeconomic stability and market
confidence despite the unprecedented humanitarian and economic spillovers from the conflict in
Syria, including a daunting inflow of refugees which has taken a toll on public finances,
infrastructures, and the social fabric. They called on the international community to provide greater
humanitarian and development assistance to Lebanon and encouraged the authorities to further
strengthen confidence and secure more inclusive growth by implementing priority fiscal and
structural reforms promptly. Directors stressed that a sustained fiscal adjustment is essential without
which the public debt ratio will continue to rise and add to existing vulnerabilities. They also stressed
the urgent need to reform the electricity sector to remove a large drain on the public finances. They
commended the central bank for supporting macroeconomic stability and maintaining adequate
international reserves and agreed that monetary policy should remain geared to supporting the
U.S. dollar peg. They commended the authorities’ close oversight of the financial system, and
stressed the need for continued vigilance and efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent request for an update assessment under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program. They underscored the need to advance structural reforms to promote
job creation and improve competitiveness and encouraged the authorities to improve Lebanon’s
statistical system, building on ongoing progress.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
Lebanon participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2016, and the related report
was presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 2016 Article IV consultation (to be issued).
Resident Representative Office
The IMF Resident Representative Office in Lebanon was opened in January 2008 and closed in
August 2011. The Fund maintains a local office.

Technical Assistance (TA)
Fiscal area—In recent years, the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) has provided assistance on the tax
regime and revenue administration of oil and gas resources, tax gap analysis for the Value Added
Tax (VAT), strengthening the performance of the Large Taxpayers’ Office (LTO) and VAT Directorate,
PFM reform, the budget system law, public accounting; while METAC continued to provide TA on
capacity building for the macro fiscal unit, public accounting, tax and PFM reform. In 2016, METAC
carried out a TA mission on major fiscal risks and their potential impact on the budget.
Financial area—The Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) has provided TA mainly on
the techniques of stress testing in a forward-looking perspective, the implementation of a risk-based
supervision (RBS) manual and enhancement of on-site examination procedures.
Statistical area—The Statistics Department has provided TA in national accounts, price statistics
compilation and balance of payments. Several missions on the consumer price index (CPI)
were undertaken, and workshops on price compilation issues and a national accounts statistics mission
were conducted in 2016. METAC has been providing assistance on national accounts.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Lebanon teams of the Fund and the World Bank met to discuss macrocritical
structural reforms and coordinate their work in 2017.1 The teams agreed that Lebanon is in the
midst of a protracted period of low growth. There is no substitute to fiscal consolidation as only
decisive fiscal action can put the debt on a sustained downward path and reduce Lebanon’s reliance
on external funding—particularly in light of easing deposit growth in the past couple of years. Given
the constrained and uncertain environment, Lebanon should adopt a number of immediate
measures to anchor confidence. These include restoring fiscal sustainability, anchoring financial
stability and promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. Finally, pending fiscal laws need to be
swiftly passed.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural reform
areas as macrocritical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation in the short run
and job-rich and sustained growth over the medium term:


Implementation of long-standing revenue measures. These include: (i) an increase in the
corporate income tax rate (from 15 to 17 percent); (ii) introduction of a capital gains tax on real
estate; (iii) an increase in the rate on interest income tax (from 5 to 7 percent, though timing
may depend on deposit behavior); (iv) an increase in the VAT rate from 10 to at least 11 percent,
while broadening its base and strengthening compliance; (v) an increase in tobacco excises; and
(vi) new stamp duties and fees.



Increase of fuel taxation. Low retail prices provide a unique opportunity to do so. At a
minimum, the VAT on diesel should be restored and gasoline excises should be increased to
earlier levels and shifted to ad valorem rates to preserve collections over time, also to start
containing negative externalities of high fuel consumption.



Recalibrating of electricity tariffs. Current proposals to link higher tariffs to the addition of
new capacity are welcome, as they should allow for an improvement in service without
worsening the fiscal situation even further. But these should be considered as a first step only.
Improved service from EdL should help reduce the average household energy bill, and so
provide scope for further increases in the future, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the EdL
subsidy altogether. At the same time, lower-end consumers should be protected.



Strengthening of the National Poverty Targeting Program. This is an essential part of
Lebanon’s nascent social safety net, and provides support to households living in extreme
poverty. The program is funded in part by grants from the World Bank and UNDP, but a
proposal for additional funding is currently waiting for ministry of finance’s approval. This
funding should be approved as a matter of priority.

Tapping into the knowledge economy as a promising source of growth. All stakeholders
need to work together to create a conducive institutional and business climate and strengthen
the country’s infrastructure. On the financing side, more focus is needed on the seed financing
stage. In this context, finalizing and implementing capital market regulation, and preparation
and adoption of a capital market development plan will also help.
The teams agreed to the following division of labor:



Fiscal reform. The Fund is providing capacity building on fiscal regimes and revenue
administration for the oil and gas sector. It is also providing analytical advice and TA on
(i) capacity building for the macro-fiscal department, in collaboration with the World Bank;
(ii) improving the transparency and accountability of public accounts; (iii) modeling compliance
in income tax; and (iv) promoting the use of indirect audit techniques.



Electricity sector reform. There has been little progress in implementing electricity sector plans
over the past 5 years, owing to ongoing political disagreements. Consequently, the Bank has
suspended its engagement in this area, pending a renewed consensus to move forward. Indeed,
the Bank’s current Country Partnership Framework (2017-20) has no has no significant financing
plans in the electricity sector.



The National Poverty Targeting Program: The Bank will continue to strengthen the National
Poverty Targeting Program. The Bank and donors scaled-up the successful e-card food voucher
program after the Syrian crisis. In addition, a pilot graduation program will be introduced for
selected beneficiaries to improve their employability.



The knowledge economy: The Fund met various stakeholders in the knowledge economy
ecosystem and prepared analytical work with cross country comparisons on the topic. The Bank
is moving forward with its TA on the development of the capital market.



Reform of the statistical system: The Fund will continue to provide TA on the consumer price
index, producer price index and national accounts.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The teams request to be kept informed of progress on the other institution’s agenda. Timing:
when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Lebanon—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of November 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, particularly in
national accounts and external sector statistics. Lack of timely, comprehensive and reliable national
accounts data and social and labor market indicators undermine accountability and economic analysis.
Fiscal reporting is lagging and irregular treasury inflows and outflows undermine data compilation.
National accounts: National accounts data are weak. Only annual data are compiled and disseminated
at this time. Data are available through 2013, with significant delays in the publication of 2014 national
accounts. There are plans to start publishing quarterly data; however, the priority should be to improve
the annual estimates before developing quarterly ones. The responsibility of producing national
accounts statistics was transferred to the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) in 2012 for the
publication of 2011 accounts. Data sources are limited, mainly administrative data. Access to
comprehensive business financial records maintained by the Ministry of Finance would greatly improve
annual national accounts estimates and support the release of quarterly data. This is expected to
improve with the ongoing efforts at the ministry to promote electronic tax declarations and e-service
portals.
Price statistics: A new Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released in March 2014 by the CAS with Fund
assistance. Notable improvements introduced with the new CPI include the dissemination of more
detailed national level index data on the CAS website; the publication of regional indexes; monthly
collection of rent prices; and improved index calculation methods. The CPI covers all areas in Lebanon
and is disseminated within three weeks after the end of the reference month. The January 2016 CPI was
adversely impacted after the prime minister’s office refused to approve the contractual data collectors
and the CAS was required to rely only on the permanent data collection staff for the collection of prices.
While data collection activities have returned to normal, the use of the permanent data collection staff
has increased costs significantly. There is an immediate need to develop regular and timely statistics on
producer prices, while medium- to long-term needs include data on labor markets, wages and real
estate prices.
Government finance statistics: Significant delays are still ongoing in the release of fiscal data. While
the dissemination of central government finance statistics (GFS) has improved in recent years, the
coverage of government finance statistics is not comprehensive. Published monthly data on the central
government budgetary accounts do not cover items such as certain transfers, financing data,
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and arrears; they include dues that should eventually be
transferred to third parties (Telecom revenue due to municipalities). Some (treasury) spending is only
identified ex post, and presented in an economic classification with a lag. These items are nonetheless
provided to the Lebanon team in the context of surveillance activities. Government finance statistics are
on a modified cash basis for revenue (transfers from the Telecom) and budgetary expenditure data
(issuance of payment orders). GFS data for budgetary central government based on 2001 Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Manual are published on a yearly basis in the IMF publication the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook; however, these data cover only transactions and no balance sheet data are
reported. In 2016, data was reported based on GFS 2014.

LEBANON

Lebanon—Statistical Issues Appendix (concluded)
Monetary and financial statistics: The sectorization of institutional units and classification of financial
instruments in the data reported to STA fall short of what is needed for the compilation of Standardized
Report Forms. Reflecting in part restrictions imposed by domestic legislation, the Banque du Liban (BdL)
does not publish externally-audited financial statements, and its reporting practices are not fully
compliant with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The lack of a reliable classification
of deposits by residency (also due to bank secrecy) complicates the balance of payments analysis.
Financial sector surveillance: Lebanon is a regular reporter of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs). All
core and eight encouraged FSIs are reported on regular quarterly basis, except for the two indicators on
capital adequacy that are reported on semi-annual basis. Compilation of FSIs for other sectors (other
financial corporations, non-financial corporations, households, real estate markets) is needed to expand
the list of FSIs compiled by Lebanon for macro prudential analysis.
Balance of payments: There have been efforts to improve Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics,
including the quality of surveys through better compliance. However, there remain significant
challenges to compiling reliable BoP data. In particular, there are data issues in the current account
(unrecorded exports and imports, uncertainty with respect to the estimates of private sector services,
workers’ remittances, and investment income), the capital account (grants), and the financial account
(foreign direct investment, equity investment in the nonbank private sector, and corporate borrowing
abroad). Data is subject to frequent and very large revisions that hamper accurate assessment of the
external sector position of Lebanon. A Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) survey is currently in progress.
An IIP statement was compiled with technical assistance though not yet ready for publication. The forms
and the reporting requirements for banks and non-banks were amended in January 2010 and May 2013
to include more comprehensive and detailed breakdown of BoP components. The lack of effective
inter-agency cooperation and data sharing between the BdL, CAS, customs and the ministry of finance
are among the main factors impeding progress and there is a noted increase in the lack of cooperation
and coordination among various agencies on data sharing.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Lebanon joined the General Data Dissemination System in January 2003. Metadata and plans for
improvement need to be updated. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for
data dissemination is available for Lebanon.
III. Reporting to STA
Lebanon currently reports annual data based on GFSM 2001 to be published in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), but the data suffer from weaknesses, mainly limited coverage. CAS does not
currently report any data to STA. Lebanon reports monetary statistics on a regular monthly basis,
covering the Central Bank and commercial banks only. The monetary data are reported with a
timeliness of approximately three months. In September 2011, the BdL started regular submission of
core Financial Soundness Indicators data and metadata, and data for 2015 were posted on the IMF
website.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director for Lebanon and
Sami Geadah, Alternate Executive Director
December 12, 2016

Lebanon has been facing a number of major challenges associated with the crisis in
neighboring Syria. There has been a massive influx of refugees which are now estimated at
about one third of the population, trade routes have been disrupted, and the crisis has
exacerbated domestic political frictions and left Lebanon without a president for 2½ years.
These developments have undermined consumer and business confidence and led to a
significant decline in trade, tourism, and construction.
The economy has performed remarkably well in view of these challenges. Macroeconomic
stability has been maintained, which was underpinned by responsible economic and financial
policies and by keeping security conditions from deteriorating. While growth has been
adversely affected by the Syrian crisis (the World Bank estimated that it lowered Lebanon’s
annual GDP growth by an average of 2.9 percentage points), growth remained positive and is
estimated in the range of 1-2 percent in 2016. The World Bank’s latest estimate for growth is
1.5-2 percent in 2016.
There are a few additional indicators that have come available since the publication of the
staff report: inflation was 1.1 percent in the year ending in October 2016; and deposit inflows
increased by 6 percent in the year ending in September 2016, and remain more than sufficient
to fund the economy. Real estate prices have been resilient, and the stock market rose sharply
with the renewed sense of optimism immediately following the presidential election. This
rise came after S&P revised Lebanon’s outlook from negative to stable in September 2016
despite the political deadlock at the time.
The authorities agree with the need for fiscal consolidation, the importance of maintaining
financial stability, and with the necessity of structural reforms. While the central bank has
deftly implemented policies that preserved financial stability and supported growth, and the
government has been successful in keeping the fiscal position from deteriorating further, the
recent election of a president and the forthcoming formation of a government bode well for
an economic recovery and for the implementation of fiscal and structural reforms.
As the authorities are in broad agreement with the findings and conclusions of the Article IV
staff report and the FSSA, we will provide some additional perspective on a few issues.
The Syrian crisis
The Syrian crisis has had a profound impact on Lebanon. The massive number of refugees—
both in number and relative to Lebanon’s population—has few, if any, international parallels
as noted in the Selected Issues Paper on the Syrian refugee crisis. As also noted, Lebanon’s

2
response so far is a testament to its generosity and resilience, but the country cannot be
expected to bear this burden on its own. The influx of refugees has drained public resources,
strained infrastructure, lowered the quality of public services, worsened poverty and
unemployment, and led to political and social tensions.
The international community has recognized that Lebanon is providing a global public good
in hosting the Syrian refugees. Several conferences have pledged to help Lebanon support
refugees and host communities. The conference that was held in London in February 2016
raised over US$11 billion in pledges for the region, in addition to announcements of up to
US$41 billion in new loans from multilateral development banks and donors.
Notwithstanding public announcements of support from the international community, few of
these pledges have materialized and the donor response has so far been described as
uncertain.
The Fund has also recognized the need to support countries facing large refugee inflows. The
IMFC Communiqué of October 2016 calls on the Fund to “strengthen analysis and support
for countries managing spillovers from non-economic sources, such as large refugee flows
and global epidemics.” We look forward to initiatives in this regard, which do not seem to
have been reflected in the Fund’s Work Program.
Macroeconomic policies
The authorities recognize the need for fiscal consolidation. After successfully lowering the
ratio of public debt to GDP by over 50 percentage points from a peak of 185 percent in 2006,
this ratio started to increase again. The main contributor to this turnaround has been the
slowdown in growth that is associated with the Syrian crisis. The crisis has also had a direct
effect on public finances, estimated by the World Bank at 1¾ of GDP per annum over 20122014. This estimate—which may have increased since then—roughly corresponds to the rise
in public debt. The authorities accordingly keep reiterating the need for the international
community to provide additional assistance, including direct budget support.
The authorities are hopeful that the formation of a new government following the recent
election of a president will facilitate the adoption of fiscal reforms, which have been
hampered by political impasse in recent years. Nevertheless, the authorities have managed to
undertake measures to strengthen public finances, notably through efforts to improve tax
collections. It should be noted that the lack of parliamentary approval of the budget has not
undermined fiscal discipline. The Ministry of Finance issues spending limits to line
ministries that cannot be exceeded, and budgets have to be approved by the Cabinet. Any
additional spending initiatives need to be matched by new revenue measures. This process
has helped the government achieve fiscal primary surpluses.

3
With the scope for fiscal manoeuver compromised by political impasse (which has started to
ease with the election of a President and appointment of a Prime Minister), the central bank
has played an important role in maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and in
supporting growth. In late 2016, it resorted to nonconventional policies in a financial
operation that bolstered its foreign exchange reserves, strengthened bank capital, lowered the
government’s borrowing cost, and provided liquidity for domestic lending.
The Financial system
Lebanon has maintained financial stability despite a series of extreme events. Financial
stability was preserved throughout the civil war (1975-1990), foreign occupation (19801992), political assassinations (including Prime Minister Hariri in 2005), a war that destroyed
considerable infrastructure (2006), the failure to elect a President (2014-2016), and
protracted political disagreements. Many of these events could be considered as tail events in
stress tests. Lebanon had only one financial crisis in its modern history, in 1966, which
provided the authorities with important lessons and heightened their awareness to the dangers
of financial instability. The importance that all political parties attach to the stability and
resilience of the financial system was reflected in their readiness to hold an extraordinary
parliamentary session to adoption of key legislative initiatives related to the financial system
in 2015, at a time when parliament was not convening because of disagreements related to
the election of a President.
The authorities’ interest in preserving this stability—and their confidence in the resilience of
the system and its supervision—is also reflected in the request for an FSAP during a very
challenging period. As noted in the staff report and in the FSSA, besides the massive influx
of refugees, low growth, domestic political impasse, there was also a slowdown in capital
inflows and an increasing threat of a disruption in correspondent bank relationships.
The authorities welcome the FSAP findings, which confirmed the resilience of the financial
system and its effective supervision. While they also welcomed the staff recommendations
for further strengthening and developing the system, the authorities were surprised by the
suggestion to remove bank secrecy, especially as the staff recognize that bank secrecy has
not impeded supervision, nor has it prevented the authorities from lifting secrecy on
AML/CFT grounds. Moreover, the central bank and the Special Investigative Commission
have proven agile in dealing with suspicious accounts, have complied with TF related
targeted financial sanctions, and have not hesitated from requiring banks to close accounts
with suspicious activities. Lebanon was assessed as fully compliant with AML/CFT rules in
the latest assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and MENA FATF. The
authorities are keenly aware of the importance of the integrity of the banking system and of
the need to maintain confidence in it.
