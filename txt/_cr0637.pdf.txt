•

Discussions on the 2005 Article IV consultation and first staff assessment under the staffmonitored program (SMP) were held in Conakry during August 31-September 13, 2005.
The mission team comprised Messrs. de la Piedra (head), Nsengiyumva, Gorbanyov, and
Dudine (all AFR). It was assisted by Mr. Jones, the IMF Resident Representative in Guinea,
and the resident mission’s economist, Mr. Barry. Messrs. Gnandou and Engelke (World
Bank) attended the meetings as well.

•

The mission met with Prime Minister Diallo; the Minister of Economy and Finance,
Mr. Camara; the Governor of the Central Bank (BCRG), Mr. Daffé; and other senior
officials and representatives of the private sector, civil society, and the press.

•

The last Article IV was concluded on August 27, 2004 (Country Report No. 04/392). The
SMP, covering April 2005-March 2006, was approved by IMF management at end-May
2005 (Country Report No. 05/222).

•

Guinea adopted a floating exchange rate regime on March 1, 2005, and has accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
Guinea has unified and liberalized the interbank foreign exchange market. This eliminated
a multiple currency practice arising from the potential divergence of the official auction rate
and the interbank market rate by more than 2 percent and an exchange restriction arising out
of the administrative practice limiting participation in official auctions to financing
transactions for rice and petroleum imports. However, Guinea maintains another multiple
currency practice arising from the potential divergence of the official reference rate and the
interbank market rate of more than 2 percent.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Guinea’s economic performance has deteriorated in recent years largely as a
result of a weaker policy framework and against a background of mounting
regional insecurity and low prices for its key commodity exports. Economic
growth has slowed to about 2.5 percent, inflation has accelerated to about 30 percent,
international reserves have fallen to less than one month of imports, and the external
public debt has risen to almost 100 percent of GDP and is unsustainable.

•

In early 2005, a new economic team tightened financial policies and took the
initial steps toward unification and liberalization of the foreign exchange
market. IMF management approved a staff-monitored program (SMP), covering
April 2005-March 2006, in support of the authorities’ stabilization and reform efforts.

•

Real GDP growth will recover moderately in 2005 but little progress is expected
in reducing inflation. The modest improvement in real GDP growth to 3 percent
reflects a rebound in agricultural activity as well as stronger growth in the
construction and mining sectors. Inflation, while edging down, is expected to be
about 28 percent at end-2005, well above the government’s objective of less than
19 percent. Gross international reserves are expected to increase from 0.8 to
1.3 months of imports during 2005.

•

Guinea’s immediate challenge is to stabilize the economy and particularly to
bring inflation down to single digits. With progress on macroeconomic
stabilization, the objectives of higher growth and poverty reduction call for action in
three areas:
o Establishing economic institutions, particularly on the budget and central bank
operations, that can cope with the cyclical nature of the mining sector and
sustain macroeconomic stability.
o Securing debt sustainability including through reaching the HIPC completion
point and the MDRI.
o Promoting private sector development through structural reform to strengthen
public services provision, develop infrastructure, and address legal and
governance issues.

•

With regard to the SMP, Guinea met all end-June quantitative targets and structural
benchmarks, except for the accumulation of central bank net foreign assets and the
introduction of a new multiple currency practice. In the attached Letter of Intent and
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the authorities lay out
additional measures to help ensure that the program remains on track.

I. BACKGROUND AND POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Background
1.
Following a decade of relatively
strong growth, Guinea’s economic
performance weakened beginning in
2000. During the 1990s, growth averaged
about 4.5 percent a year as buoyant
commodity prices allowed Guinea to
reap the benefits of its natural resource
base. With a tightening of financial
policies over the decade, inflation
reached single digits by the late 1990s.
Since 2000, however, growth has slowed
to an average rate of about 2.5 percent a
year (Figure 1);1 at the same time,
inflation accelerated to about 28 percent
by 2004.

2.
Guinea’s disappointing economic performance since 2000 reflects a weaker
policy framework. The fiscal deficit, which averaged just over 3 percent of GDP in the
second half of the 1990s, rose to an average of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2000-04. Government
revenues from the mining sector dropped, reflecting a decline in commodity export prices,
and in particular bauxite—Guinea’s most important export.2 In addition, a heightened level
of regional insecurity3 and a considerable number of refugees in Guinea put pressure on
government outlays.4
3.
Monetary policy became highly accommodative of the weakened fiscal stance,
while the exchange regime became more rigid. After adopting a floating exchange rate
regime in 1994 and allowing the exchange rate to depreciate by almost 30 percent, the
authorities took a series of measures from late 1999 through 2002 that reduced exchange rate
flexibility and led to the development of a parallel market.5 This change in the exchange rate
1

For a detailed analysis of Guinea’s growth performance, see the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

2

The share of mining sector revenue in total government revenue declined from an average of about 40 percent
during the first half of the 1990s to an average of about 20 percent during 2000-04 as mining sector revenue
dropped by 2.5 percentage points of GDP.
3

According to one proxy index, regional insecurity in the first four years of this decade is almost double that of
the last four years of the 1990s (see Selected Issues Paper on growth issues).

4

The impact on government outlays is difficult to estimate given the opacity in public accounting.

5

The authorities adopted a flexible exchange rate regime in October 1994 and created an interbank market for
foreign exchange. The central bank introduced a system of foreign exchange auctions in late 1999 and used

regime, together with the loss in the terms of trade, contributed to a deterioration in central
bank foreign assets, which declined from an average of 2.7 months of imports during the
second half of the 1990s to 1.8 months of imports during 2000-04. External public debt
increased to an unsustainable level of about 100 percent of GDP, and external arrears started
to accumulate.

5.
Reflecting the deteriorating policy and economic environment, foreign assistance
to Guinea declined. Guinea reached the decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 2000, which strengthened the fiscal outlook. However, official
assistance fell from an average of 3.7 percent of GDP in the late 1990s to 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2004. Owing to Guinea’s poor performance under the last program supported under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), Paris Club members, the IMF, and the
African Development Bank suspended their interim HIPC assistance in 2003.

moral suasion to limit the depreciation of the auction market exchange rate. A de facto peg of the official
exchange rate was re-established in late 2002. For a more detailed discussion, see the accompanying Selected
Issues Paper on exchange rate and competitiveness issues.
6

Although much of Guinea’s population is engaged in agriculture, exploitation of its rich endowments of
bauxite, iron and precious metals, accounting for 85 percent of exports, has driven economic growth.

7

The nominal price of bauxite in 2002 was 35 percent below the price in 1991. It has recovered in the past three
years but still stands 10 percent below its level in 1991.

education the net primary enrollment ratio is now 60 percent; however, the quality of
education and health care still needs to be improved. In the area of health, the government is
focusing on arresting the spread of HIV/AIDS, whose rate remains relatively low but shows
signs of rising.
B. Policy Challenges
7.
Guinea’s policy challenges remain considerable.9 At this juncture, the main
challenge is to achieve macroeconomic stability, by adopting a fiscal and monetary policy
stance consistent with bringing inflation down to single digits. Thus, broadening the revenue
base, strengthening expenditure management, and reinforcing the central bank’s ability to
ensure the smooth operation of the foreign exchange market and manage monetary
instruments are critical. Such improvements will support Guinea’s efforts to reach the HIPC
completion point and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and take advantage of
debt relief, which will help bring about a sustainable debt position. Although the natural
resource sector will continue to be the engine of economic growth over the medium term,
there is a need to diversify the export base of the economy, improve the business
environment, strengthen public infrastructure, and enhance the operation of public utilities.

According to United Nations data on the status of the Millennium Development Goals (Table 8), the
proportion of the population in Guinea living on less than one U.S. dollar a day fell from 40 percent in 1995 to
27 percent in 2001 (more recent data are unavailable).

Box 1. Guinea: 2004 Article IV Recommendations and the Authorities’ Response
The last Article IV consultation with Guinea was concluded on August 27, 2004 (Country
Report No. 04/392). Executive Directors emphasized the importance of fiscal consolidation to
achieve faster growth and lower inflation as well as the need for a more proactive liquidity
management stance. They cautioned the central bank not to accommodate expansionary fiscal
policies. They expressed concern that the pegging of the exchange rate and the administrative
allocation of foreign exchange prevalent at the time had introduced substantial distortions into the
economy. Directors also had serious concerns about Guinea’s difficulties in servicing its external
debt, its heavy external debt burden, and its limited foreign exchange reserves. They commended
Guinea’s efforts to advance the poverty reduction agenda but emphasized that Guinea had to
correct the macroeconomic imbalances to achieve sustained poverty reduction.
The Guinean authorities took steps to address many of the issues raised by Executive
Directors. In particular, they tightened fiscal and monetary policies, reformed the foreign
exchange market, and initiated contacts with external creditors to regularize the arrears situation.
At the same time, the authorities continued to implement their poverty reduction agenda. Based on
these efforts, IMF management approved a staff-monitored program covering April 2005-March
2006.

Box 2. Guinea: Main Conclusions of the 2004 Ex-Post Assessment
The ex-post assessment (EPA) of Guinea’s performance under IMF-supported programs
was concluded in 2004 (Country Report No. 04/377). It concluded that a lack of ownership at
the highest level of government and weak policies contributed to Guinea’s failure to implement a
successful long-term development strategy. In particular, the EPA highlighted the lax fiscal policy
stance and accommodative monetary policy in Guinea. In addition, important structural reforms,
including in tax and customs administration and the civil service, remained to be completed. On
the positive side, the EPA noted the country’s progress in improving financial sector soundness,
downsizing the civil service, and increasing spending on education and health care. The EPA’s
main recommendations were to:
• enhance ownership, to be demonstrated by decisive action in implementing structural
reform in key areas such as governance, the utility sector, and the judiciary system;
• raise fiscal revenue by eliminating tax and customs exemptions;
• reduce corruption and improve governance;
• develop contingency plans in annual programs; and
• integrate poverty-reduction programs into the budget.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
8.
Guinea’s economic performance in 2004 was lackluster. Real GDP growth
increased to 2.7 percent from just 1.2 percent growth in 2003, reflecting a pickup in
agriculture, construction, and manufacturing activities, which more than offset weakening
mining sector activity. However, consumer price inflation accelerated from 15 percent in
2003 to 28 percent, while the deficit in the external current account widened from 4 percent
of GDP in 2003 to nearly 6 percent of GDP and was mostly financed through an
accumulation of external arrears.10 Given this economic performance, Guinea failed to meet
the primary convergence criteria of the West Africa Monetary Zone for the second
consecutive year (Figure 3).

Data for the current account of the balance of payments have been updated on the basis of revised
information provided by the authorities. The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, is now
estimated at 5.8 percent of GDP in 2004, compared with 4.2 percent of GDP estimated at the time of the
preparation of the SMP.

The disappointing macroeconomic performance in 2004 reflected the continued
weakness of the policy framework. Although there was some tightening of fiscal policy,
higher-than-budgeted defense spending and interest outlays prevented the authorities from
reaching their fiscal targets for the year. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants), which
had reached 9 percent of GDP in 2003, was still almost 6 percent of GDP in 2004. At the
same time, monetary policy continued to accommodate the needs of the government, leading
to an expansion in broad money of over 35 percent for the second consecutive year.
10.
In 2005, the authorities tightened fiscal policy and abandoned the
accommodative stance of monetary policy. Reflecting a significant contraction of
expenditures, the fiscal primary balance improved from a deficit of almost ½ percent of GDP
in 2004 to a surplus of over 2 percent of GDP by June 2005, while at the same time the
overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) came down from almost 6 percent of GDP in 2004 to
0.2 percent of GDP by June 2005. As a result, net central bank credit to the government
increased by just over 1 percent of reserve money in the first half of 2005, compared with
10 percent of reserve money in the same period of 2004.
11.
As part of their new policy stance, the authorities took the first steps to unify and
liberalize the foreign exchange market, abandoning the system of rationing foreign
exchange through official auctions, liberalizing foreign exchange operations, and publishing
a reference exchange rate based on market quotes.11 Foreign exchange market reforms have
11

Currently, the reference exchange rate is calculated as a simple average and published weekly.

largely—although not fully—eliminated multiple currency practices.12 The official foreign
exchange auctions—which stood at the heart of a dual foreign exchange market and were
Guinea’s primary multiple currency practice—were suspended in March 2005. The new
unified foreign exchange market includes both banks and authorized exchange bureaus, and
the official exchange reference rate is calculated as an average of all reported exchange
rates.13
12.
Following the liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the Guinean franc
depreciated faster than expected but the pace of depreciation has slowed since midJuly. The gap between the exchange rates at the commercial banks and those at the exchange
bureaus shrank to less than 5 percent by mid-2005 and to about 2 percent by October 2005,
from 25-30 percent in early 2005. By removing institutional constraints that limited the
accumulation of foreign assets and the depreciation of the national currency, exchange
market liberalization led to the release of pent-up demand for foreign currency assets,
evidenced by the buildup in the foreign exchange position of local banks. The slowing of the
depreciation of the Guinean franc in the past few months and the narrowing of exchange rate
differentials between banks and exchange bureaus indicate that this pent-up demand has now
been largely satisfied.
13.
Staff estimates suggest that the
recent nominal depreciation of the
Guinean franc, amounting to about
38 percent since end-February 2005, has
brought the real exchange rate close to its
underlying equilibrium rate. 14 External
competitiveness indicators show that the real
effective exchange rate was about 20 percent
overvalued at the end of 2004 and that a
nominal depreciation of about 25 percent
was needed to bring the real exchange rate
back to its equilibrium level.15

Owing to the weekly publication of the official reference rate, the daily interbank rate can deviate from the
official rate by more than 2 percent thereby giving rise to a multiple currency practice (MCP). The MCP can be
eliminated by moving to a daily calculation of the reference rate based on the intra-day weighted average
interbank market rates.
13

A cash-based informal parallel market is still in operation, but it is not officially recognized. The central bank
at times buys foreign exchange from certain exporters, but does so through the commercial banks.

The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 15 percent during the first eight months of 2005.

A pass-through coefficient of 0.25 of nominal currency depreciation to consumer prices is assumed. See the
accompanying Selected Issues Paper on competitiveness and the equilibrium exchange rate.

14.
The banking sector remains relatively sound and profitable, although some
prudential ratios are not satisfied by all banks (Table 6). The ratio of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) to total assets declined from 26 percent in 2004 to about 22 percent at end-June
2005, a relatively low figure by regional standards, and provisions cover over 97 percent of
NPLs. However, in mid-2005 the capital adequacy ratios of two banks dipped below the
10 percent prudential limit. Commercial bank credit to the private sector remains weak; at
23 percent of total bank assets, it is less than banks’ credit to the government, which
represents about 28 percent of their total assets. The government recently privatized part of
its stake in the largest national bank, reducing its share in the bank’s capital from 38 percent
to 15 percent.
15.
To support the authorities’ stabilization and reform efforts, IMF management
approved, at end-May 2005, a staff-monitored program (SMP) for April 2005-March
2006. The new government economic team that was appointed in late 2004 appears
committed to the SMP, and this is helping to increase political ownership of the program
(Box 3 describes the objectives and performance under the SMP).
Box 3. Guinea: Performance Under the Staff-Monitored Program
The SMP aims to restore macroeconomic stability and, through structural reform, to lay the
groundwork for renewed growth, debt sustainability, and poverty reduction. Its objectives
for 2005 are to reach real GDP growth of 3 percent, predicated on a rebound in the mining, trade,
and service sectors, reduce year-end consumer price inflation to below 19 percent, and increase
gross central bank reserves by the equivalent of one-third of a month of imports.
The authorities expressed their commitment to achieving the objectives of the SMP. In the
attached Letter of Intent and MEFP (Appendix I), they outline the additional policy measures
necessary to ensure achievement of the quantitative indicative targets and structural benchmarks
during the remaining period of the program.
All end-June quantitative targets under the SMP were met, except for the accumulation of
central bank net foreign assets. Fiscal revenue targets were achieved and expenditure
commitments were kept under control as programmed. The overall fiscal balance (cash basis)
reached a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in the first half of the year, compared with a deficit of
1 percent of GDP under the program, and the government was able to reduce the level of domestic
financing. Reserve money expansion, which had reached 49 percent on a 12-month basis by
March 2005, dropped to 36 percent by end-June. The net foreign assets of the central bank
expanded by US$13.4 million in the first half of 2005, but remained US$3.6 million short of the
amount needed to meet the SMP target (see Table 2 of the MEFP).
The authorities also made important progress on structural reforms, meeting all end-June
structural benchmarks under the SMP, except the continuous benchmark on refraining
from introducing new multiple currency practices. In March 2005, the initial steps to liberalize
the foreign exchange market, a prior action for the SMP, were implemented; however, a multiple
currency practice remains arising from the potential spread of more than 2 percent between
interbank market spot rates and the central bank’s reference rate. Regarding fiscal reform, the
WAEMU common external tariff was adopted and reforms in the customs and tax administrations
and in public expenditure management advanced as expected. Finally, action plans to reduce fraud
and enhance the efficiency of the water and electricity sectors were adopted.

B.

Short-Term Outlook

16.
Real GDP growth is projected to reach 3 percent in 2005 and progress is
expected in reducing inflation. The strengthening in real GDP growth reflects a pickup in
agriculture, construction, and mining activity. Inflation is expected to drop from a high of
43 percent (on a 12-month basis) in July 2005 to 28 percent by end-2005, compared with the
authorities’ objective of less than 19 percent for the year. The inflation overrun in 2005
reflects mainly the effects of the higher-than-expected depreciation of the Guinean franc and
the higher-than-programmed increase in domestic petroleum prices in May 2005 (Box 4).
Box 4. Guinea: Factors Contributing to the Inflation Overrun in 2005
Despite Guinea’s tightening of fiscal and monetary policies in 2005, inflation will fall by
less than envisaged, owing mostly to

program. Based on pass-through
coefficients reflecting data for Guinea and similar countries, the additional increase in
petroleum prices explains about 2.7 additional percentage points in measured inflation, and the
faster depreciation of the currency—reflected in the inflation level through its impact on the
prices of the food and transportation components of the consumer price index—explains about
6.3 percentage points. These two factors account for an increase of 9 percentage points in the
inflation rate, which is about the same as the expected overrun with respect to the authorities’
objectives for 2005.

17.
The external current account deficit is expected to narrow in 2005 by just over
1 percentage point of GDP, to about 4.6 percent of GDP. The overall balance is expected
to improve from a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP in
2005. Although rising international prices have inflated the oil import bill in 2005, the prices
of bauxite and alumina also have risen, boosting the value of exports, and the rapid
depreciation of the currency during the year has dampened non-oil imports. Gross central
bank international reserves are expected to increase to 1.3 months of imports during 2005.

The savings-investment balance is expected to improve in 2005, mainly as a
result of the significant adjustment of government finances. Domestic savings, which
contracted as a proportion of GDP in 2003-04, is expected to increase by about
2½ percentage points of GDP in 2005, reflecting a substantial rise in government savings and
the effects of the real depreciation of the currency.16 Mainly as a result of continued
investment in the mining sector, private investment is expected to increase in 2005, as it did
16

Despite the effects of the real depreciation of the currency, private sector savings are expected to decline
slightly in 2005 (by about ½ percent of GDP), as economic agents cope with a situation of high inflation and
reduced resource transfers from the public sector as fiscal adjustment took hold.

in 2004. Total investment is expected to expand somewhat more slowly, as the efforts to

22.
The medium-term outlook, however, remains vulnerable to political conditions
in Guinea. Although at present the political situation in Guinea has stabilized and progress
under the SMP has shored up the position of the prime minister and his reform policies
within the government, domestic and regional issues leave the situation fragile. Nationwide
municipal elections have been set to take place on December 18, 2005; the election campaign
has so far remained tense but calm. On the regional front, lingering instability in neighboring
countries could exacerbate the refugee and security situation in border regions of Guinea.

III.

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

23.
The authorities and the staff broadly agreed on the policy agenda. Discussions
focused on the measures required to maintain tight fiscal policies, strengthen the functioning
of the foreign exchange market, and improve central bank liquidity management, with a view
to further stabilizing the exchange rate and reducing inflation. The mission also discussed the
government’s structural reform agenda, which aims to strengthen the environment for the
private sector and expand access to public services.

A few large-scale mining projects are expected to come on stream in the next few years, including a
US$2 billion investment project by a Canadian conglomerate to establish an alumina refining plant.

A. Fiscal Policy
24.
The authorities have stressed their determination to implement prudent fiscal
policies. The key to restoring stability will be to tighten fiscal policy so as to allow a
reduction in central bank financing of the government deficit and in this way regain control
over monetary expansion.
25.
The authorities are implementing measures to strengthen revenue collection.
These measures include (i) the application of the common external tariff of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),18 (ii) the elimination of all ad-hoc tax or customs
tariff exemptions, and (iii) the strengthening of tax and customs administration.19 Over the
medium term, the emphasis will be on consolidating the new tariff system adopted in early
2005 and on continuing to strengthen tax and customs administration. This should allow
revenues to increase from 12 percent of GDP in 2005 to 13.5 percent in 2008.
26.
In the face of expenditure pressures arising from the larger-than-expected
depreciation of the currency, the government has taken action to control expenditures
in 2005 and beyond. The authorities have decided to cut current spending by at least
10 billion Guinean francs (0.3 percent of GDP) in the last quarter of 2005, mainly by limiting
outlays related to missions abroad and containing transfers and subsidies. The mission
remarked that a larger cut would have been desirable, but the authorities indicated that they
were constrained by the effect of the larger-than-expected depreciation on government
outlays. The medium-term budget framework envisages a gradual increase in priority
spending over 2006-08, to be offset by a reduction in nonpriority spending as a percent of
GDP.
27.
The authorities have implemented measures to strengthen public expenditure
management in order to improve the monitoring of budget execution, streamline budget
procedures, and increase transparency. These measures include (i) enforcing the
application of budget and accounting rules and procedures, (ii) closing the loopholes that
allow government entities to exceed their budgetary allocations, (iii) making the
computerized budget management system fully operational, and (iv) unifying existing
personnel management systems.20 The staff welcomed these measures, which are in line with
the recommendations made by a February 2005 FAD technical assistance mission.

18

Members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) agreed to harmonize their
external tariff system with that of the WAEMU as a step to encourage regional trade and simplify existing
national tariff systems.

19

These measures are being implemented on the basis of recommendations of two FAD missions in tax and
customs administration. FAD will provide further technical assistance in tax and customs administration
through West AFRITAC and a regional tax advisor based in Guinea-Bissau.

20

Specifically, the authorities have (i) provided training to budget inspectors at the central and local levels,
(ii) published in the budget law a limited list of expenditures that could be executed outside normal budgetary

28.
The mission expressed concerns about certain recent fiscal measures. First, the
government pledged future tax revenues as guarantees for funds advanced from the large
mining companies to pay for current government obligations, a practice that introduces
significant rigidity into the budget.21 The authorities have committed in their November 2005
MEFP (Appendix I, paragraph 13) to stop using future tax payments to pay for current
obligations. Second, the government agreed to provide a subsidy—in the form of an
exchange rate guarantee—to rice importers during July-September 2005. This arrangement,
which in the end was never operative, constituted an open-ended and unbudgeted fiscal
commitment and could have distorted the operation of the foreign exchange market. The
authorities also have committed in their November 2005 MEFP (Appendix I, paragraph 13)
to avoiding any such exchange rate guarantee scheme in the future.
29.
The authorities have started work on the 2006 budget. Budget estimates are based
on ongoing efforts to strengthen revenue collection, control the expansion of expenditures,
eliminate central bank financing of the government, and reduce domestic and external
arrears. The authorities have expressed their intention to improve the coverage of financial
operations of public administration entities in government statistics.

procedures, and (iii) adopted ceilings for public procurement contracts that could be awarded by regional
offices.
21

The main mining companies agreed to provide Guinea with tax advances of US$18 million in August 2005
(½ percent of GDP); these resources are being used to pay external creditors, including the IMF. The authorities
indicated that these funds have been provided at no interest and will be repaid over one to two years through
deductions from taxes owed by the mining companies. These tax advances are reflected fully in the fiscal
accounts as nonbank financing.

- 19 -

31.
To strengthen the operation of the new foreign exchange market and fully
address the remaining multiple currency practice, the staff underscored the need to
implement additional measures, guided by the recommendations of the August 2005 MFD
technical assistance mission.22 These measures include obtaining information from banks that
would allow calculation of a weighted average reference exchange rate on an intra-day basis,
publishing the reference rate daily, and ensuring that the information provided by the banks
reflects true market conditions. Also, the mission proposed that the central bank reorganize
and modernize its foreign exchange department by separating front-office and back-office
operations, improving the flow of statistical information for decision making, and hiring
additional staff. Finally, the mission encouraged the central bank to eliminate the backlog in
banks’ foreign exchange transfers abroad.23 It also emphasized the need to design a marketbased strategy that would allow the central bank to manage its net foreign assets more
flexibly. The authorities agreed with the thrust of the staff’s recommendations.
32.
The staff also emphasized the need to reinforce central bank liquidity
management, so as to better transmit to the market the stance of monetary policy and
support the central bank’s operations in the foreign exchange market. Currently, mostly
reflecting the lack of lending opportunities, the banking system maintains a very large level
of unremunerated excess reserves in the central bank.24 These large levels of excess reserves
do not provide an adequate framework for the conduct of monetary policy, as banks do not
need to access central bank financing. To mop up banks’ large excess liquidity, the central
bank increased the reserve requirement coefficient on bank deposits from 5½ percent to
9½ percent in October 2005.25 Also, the central bank plans to enhance the role of the auctions
of central bank bills (TRMs) as a monetary policy instrument, in part by holding auctions
separate from treasury bond auctions. In parallel, it will reactivate the treasury committee to
improve communication between the treasury and the central bank and will set up an internal
committee to refine liquidity forecasting and management.
33.
Earlier this year, the central bank’s international reserves were adjusted
downward by US$23 million (about one-third of a month of imports).26 This adjustment,
prompted in part by the IMF safeguards process, reflected a 2003 central bank cash payment
to a government supplier that had not been recorded previously. Following the adjustment of
the central bank accounts, the government launched a formal inquiry into the unrecorded
payment. It has now been clarified that the supplier, which also received payment from the
22

MFD will provide further technical assistance to follow up on the implementation of these recommendations.

23

The backlog in banks’ foreign exchange transfers abroad was reduced from more than US$18 million at the
onset of the market unification to US$2½ million by end-September 2005.

24

As of June 2005, banks’ excess reserves in the central bank amounted to over 2½ times the level of required
reserves.

25

The authorities indicated that they may consider a further increase to 11½ percent if excess bank liquidity
continues to be a problem.

26

Central bank credit to the private sector was adjusted upward by the same amount.

government in the form of treasury bonds, was effectively paid twice for the same operation.
At this stage no legal action has been pursued; however, the inquiry commission has yet to
conclude its deliberations. Nevertheless, the central bank has initiated action to ensure that
the supplier repays the central bank with the proceeds of the treasury bonds as they mature;
the staff emphasized the need to use these resources to rebuild international reserves.
C. Banking Sector
34.
The authorities are implementing changes in the legal and supervisory
framework for the banking system. Following MFD recommendations, the central bank is
deepening the capacity of its banking supervision department and is stepping up on-site bank
inspections. The new banking law, adopted in July 2005, and the microfinance law, which
has already been submitted to the National Assembly, will also help to strengthen the central
bank’s supervisory role. The staff emphasized the need to ensure that all banks comply with
minimum capital requirements and other prudential ratios. With regard to measures to
combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the authorities indicated their
commitment to accelerate implementation of measures to address these issues; a law is being
finalized and will be presented to the National Assembly by the end of the year.27
D. External Sector Policies and Debt
35.
Guinea’s adoption of the WAEMU common external tariff and removal of
nontariff barriers have resulted in a more open trade regime. The authorities indicated
that they would continue to promote export diversification while maintaining a liberal trade
system. To this end, they intend to follow up on measures recommended by the 2003
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) to reduce supply constraints. They are also
actively participating in regional trade integration initiatives, notably in the context of
ECOWAS, designed to improve trade-related institutions and infrastructure in the region.
36.
Despite a series of external sector reforms undertaken since the mid-1990s, the
lack of diversification of exports leaves Guinea vulnerable to exogenous shocks. The
authorities have identified agricultural products, fishing, and tourism as the key sectors
through which export diversification could be pursued. The lack of appropriate infrastructure
and storage facilities and weaknesses in the provision of public and financial services are key
impediments to export diversification28

includes reaching the HIPC
completion point and the MDRI in 2007, the net present value of debt-to-exports ratio would
be reduced and remain below the 100 percent threshold over the 2007-25 projection period,
thus reestablishing external debt sustainability.30
39.
The staff and the authorities concurred that successful implementation of
Guinea’s reform program would be an important step toward the resumption of
external budget support. With weak program implementation, most donors have stopped
their budgetary assistance to Guinea since 2002. The European Union, Guinea’s main
provider of budgetary aid, could resume its assistance in 2006, once the municipal elections
are completed and if a PRGF-supported program is in place. Other donors have also
indicated their willingness to resume assistance if Guinea agrees on a financial program with
the IMF.
40.
Guinea had difficulty making payments to the IMF until August 2005, but has
since taken action to prevent further delays. In line with their new strategy of making
advance deposits in their SDR account, the authorities have deposited enough funds in the
29

Guinea has obtained informal agreement on debt service forbearance with selected Paris Club members.
Rescheduling agreements have been concluded with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the
Saudi Fund for Development and the Islamic Development Bank, and an agreement with Romania is expected
by end-December 2005.
30

This scenario assumes continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms
under the SMP, followed by adoption of a PRGF-supported program in 2006, attainment of the HIPC
completion point and MDRI in early 2007, and no major exogenous shock or policy reversal after 2007. The
scenario reflects the authorities’ macroeconomic framework for 2005-08 and conservative macroeconomic
assumptions beyond 2008.

- 22 -

account to cover all obligations to the IMF falling due until the end of 2005. The staff
emphasized that timely payments to the IMF are an essential component of establishing a
good policy track record.
E. Domestic Petroleum Sector
41.
The authorities agreed with the mission on the need to adopt an automatic price
adjustment mechanism for petroleum products in the domestic market. As part of the
2006 budget law, they intend to implement a mechanism which will fully reflect exchange
rate and international oil price conditions. The authorities indicated that they would aim at a
price structure similar to that in neighboring countries, including if necessary by reducing
current taxes. The mission, however, emphasized that if the authorities reduce taxes, they
would need to identify alternative revenue sources so as not to weaken the fiscal outlook. In
the meantime, the authorities indicated that they will implement limited adjustments of
domestic oil prices during the last quarter of 2005. Despite the large price hike decreed last
May, and owing to the rapid increase in international oil prices and the depreciation of the
Guinean franc, petroleum products are currently being sold at a loss in the domestic market.
According to the authorities, the accumulated losses of the petroleum companies exceed
US$10 million (⅓ percent of GDP); the oil companies’ weaker financial position may impair
their ability to ensure the necessary bank financing for oil imports.31
F. Business Environment
42.
To enhance Guinea’s medium-term growth prospects, the government is
working to improve the business environment for the private sector by implementing
structural reforms, improving investment conditions in the mining sector, and
strengthening the judicial system. On the structural front, it has adopted action plans to
improve the quality and availability of electricity and water; in the area of
telecommunications, it has adopted a new regulatory framework and is preparing the
enabling legislation. Privatization of government assets is also a component of the structural
reform program; the shares or assets of 10 government companies will be sold in 2005
(including shares in the largest domestic bank), and the authorities intend to privatize
20 enterprises over the next three years.32 The staff encouraged the authorities to implement
the sectoral action plans and to move forward as planned in the area of privatization.

31

A mechanism is in place whereby, whenever the sale price of petroleum products differs from the actual cost
by more than 5 percent, the resulting loss or gain for the oil companies is lodged in an account called the
arrondi. The oil companies’ accumulated losses in this account constitute a contingent government liability.
Normally, losses and gains are expected to cancel out over time; however, owing to the failure of domestic
prices to keep pace with market conditions for most of the period since mid-2003, the arrondi account has now
accumulated a loss of the amount noted.
32

The World Bank is assisting the authorities in these efforts.

- 23 -

43.
The government is taking measures to improve investment conditions and
transparency in the mining sector. It will review the legal framework for investment in the
sector to align it with international best practices, while the government’s recent participation
in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) will help improve transparency in
state-investor relations.33 A new mining sector policy statement that embodies these policy
initiatives will be finalized soon.
44.
The mission discussed with the authorities recent progress in strengthening
governance and the judicial system, and encouraged them to continue moving forward.
The recently held national and regional seminars on governance and corruption led to the
adoption of an action plan to combat corruption. The National Agency to Combat Corruption
has been strengthened, and an anticorruption law will be submitted to the National Assembly
during the first half of 2006. Finally, the authorities are implementing the decrees signed in
March 2005 on the reorganization of the judicial system.
G. Poverty Reduction Strategy
45.
Despite the economic difficulties of the last few years, the authorities have
continued making efforts to implement the policies and measures included in the
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). The mission underscored the close link between
a stable macroeconomic situation and the possibility of implementing far-reaching povertyreducing policies. The mission also stressed the need to ensure that sectoral investment plans
reflect the government priorities set out in the PRSP.
46.
The government is finalizing the second annual progress report on the
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS). While progress has been made
in the priority sectors, especially in education, the overall implementation has been hampered
by Guinea’s macroeconomic instability. The authorities indicated that they had not been able
to compensate for the lower levels of foreign assistance received in 2003 and 2004 by
mobilizing additional domestic resources and that better macroeconomic management could
help correct some of the obstacles encountered in 2004. The authorities are concentrating
their efforts in (i) trying to improve the policy formulation process and its link to budgetary
resources and (ii) putting in place a system of performance indicators that could facilitate
closer monitoring of the budget strategy.
47.
In February 2005, the authorities, with the assistance of donors, completed a
second progress report on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
report concluded that reaching the MDGs remains a significant challenge, particularly (i) the
eradication of poverty and hunger, (ii) the promotion of gender equality, and
33

The first EITI workshop was held in April 2005. The government issued a decree establishing the EITI
Steering Committee in June 2005. On July 1, the second meeting of the EITI Steering Committee took place,
approving a set of rules and procedures to implement the EITI. The process to select an international auditor
will start in November 2005. Publication of nonaudited data is expected to begin by March 2006, and the target
date to publish audited data is June 2006.

- 24 -

(iii) environmental protection and access to safe water. The authorities intend to adopt in
2006 an action plan to alleviate the key obstacles to achieving the MDGs, particularly in the
above three areas. They concurred with the staff, however, that a pro-poor growth strategy
and an annual economic growth rate higher than 6 percent would be needed beyond 2008 to
reach the MDGs.
H. Statistical Issues
48.
Although available statistics allow for adequate program monitoring,
improvements are needed in several areas. Monetary and fiscal statistics are generally
adequate, although unrecorded transactions remain a concern. The compilation of real sector
and balance of payment statistics, however, needs to be substantially improved. The staff
encouraged the authorities to improve the collection and reconciliation of external and
domestic debt data to get ready for a full-fledged DSA that will be required if Guinea reaches
the completion point under the HIPC Initiative.
49.
Guinea became a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
in December 2003. The mission encouraged the authorities to design an overall strategy to
comply with the country’s obligations under the GDDS, to be included in the PRSP
framework, that could be supported by the IMF’s Statistics Department and other donors.
50.
SMP program implementation will continue to be monitored on the basis of the
quantitative targets and structural benchmarks specified in the authorities’
memorandum of May 31, 2005. The next quarterly staff assessment of the program will
take place on the basis of data for end-September 2005.

IV.

STAFF APPRAISAL

51.
If the authorities maintain sound policies, the Guinean economy could reach an
average real GDP growth rate of 6 percent in the medium term and single-digit
inflation even sooner. The key policy areas to consolidate recent progress and move towards
such medium term objectives include strengthening government revenue mobilization and
expenditure management; reinforcing the operations of the central bank; deepening structural
reforms, including in the foreign exchange market and public utilities; addressing
institutional and capacity constraints to policy design and implementation; and improving the
business environment for the private sector. External debt relief in the context of the
enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI is also an essential element of the medium-term
scenario.
52.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts in tightening macroeconomic policy
under the framework of the SMP. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2005, the
government has pursued tight fiscal and monetary policies in lieu of the prior expansionary
fiscal stance and accommodative monetary policy. Also, the staff welcomes the authorities’

- 25 -

determination to reform the foreign exchange market, customs and tax administration,
expenditure management, and the public utilities.
53.
The staff commends the authorities for the measures taken in March 2005 to
unify and liberalize the foreign exchange market. These steps have been key to making
the exchange rate flexible and market-determined, which has allowed the real exchange rate
to come close to its underlying equilibrium value. The staff urges the authorities to take all
necessary measures to deepen the reform of the foreign exchange market, including efforts to
ensure daily and accurate reporting by the banks of their foreign exchange transactions and
measures to reorganize the foreign exchange department of the central bank. The staff also
notes that the changes in the foreign exchange market have eliminated the multiple currency
practice arising from the previous institutional setup. However, a multiple currency practice
is still in effect; the staff does not recommend its approval and encourages the authorities to
eliminate it by calculating the reference exchange rate on the basis of intra-day exchange
rates quoted by banks and exchange bureaus.
54.
Progress so far towards achieving macroeconomic stability is fragile as
evidenced by the fact that inflation, although declining, exceeds the authorities’
objective. As stated in the attached Letter of Intent and MEFP (Appendix I), the authorities
have committed to implementing all necessary additional policies to strengthen
macroeconomic stabilization and achieve the SMP’s objectives. They would thereby build
the track record that would allow Guinea to move eventually to an IMF-supported
arrangement.
55.
The authorities’ immediate challenges are to bring inflation under control and to
ensure that the central bank can achieve its net foreign assets objective. They must
therefore continue implementing tight fiscal policies, strengthen the operation of the foreign
exchange market, and reinforce the central bank’s liquidity management operations.
56.
The 2006 government budget should embody a prudent fiscal policy, consistent
with the stabilization objective for next year. The budget framework should be based on
improving revenue collection, controlling expenditure while allowing the allocations to
priority sectors to expand, and containing bank financing in line with prudent monetary
management. Continued progress in customs and tax administration and in public
expenditure management will be key to achieving these objectives. The 2006 budget also will
include measures to ensure that petroleum products in the domestic market are priced in line
with international prices.
57.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ structural reform and governance measures
and encourages them to continue pursuing those objectives. Efforts to improve the
operations of the water and electricity companies are essential to enhance growth prospects
and the well-being of the population. Progress in the divestiture program is needed to boost
economic efficiency. The steps the authorities are taking to combat corruption and improve
the justice system will reduce the costs of doing business in Guinea.

- 26 -

58.
The extent of poverty in Guinea remains worrisome. The staff encourages the
authorities to give priority to the social sectors in government spending and investment plans.
These efforts should be undertaken within the PRSP framework; the staff encourages the
authorities to keep their PRSP under constant review and ensure that the investment plans of
the different government agencies reflect the priorities set out in the PRSP.
59.
Guinea had significant difficulties in the past in making payments to the IMF on
time. To prevent this problem from recurring, the authorities are depositing funds in their
SDR account in advance of upcoming obligations. The staff encourages them to address the
underlying difficulties that gave rise to the repeated delays in payments—such as poor
planning and those arising from unpredictability of foreign exchange inflows.
60.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Mr. de Rato,
1.
Guinea is implementing a staff-monitored economic and financial program (SMP)
covering the period April 2005-March 2006.
2.
We have made important progress under our program. In particular, all the
quantitative targets and structural benchmarks for end-June, with the exception of the target
relating to the accumulation of net foreign assets by the Central Bank of the Republic of
Guinea (BCRG), were met.
3.
The attached memorandum (Annex I) outlines the additional economic and financial
policies that the government intends to implement in addition to the policies described in our
letter to you of May 31, 2005. The government is implementing the additional policies to
ensure that the macroeconomic and structural objectives under the SMP will be met in a
timely manner and on the basis of good policies.
4.
The government undertakes to provide Fund staff with all the information needed to
monitor the implementation of the measures envisaged under the program and the
achievement of its objectives. The attached technical memorandum of understanding restates
the programs targets and benchmarks for the period until March 2006, defines the relevant
economic variables, and specifies the type of data to be reported to the IMF (Annex II).
5.
The Guinean government believes that the additional policies and measures set forth
in the attached memorandum will help ensure the achievement of the objectives of the
program. If necessary, it stands ready to take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose.
6.
During the program period, the government will consult with you, at its own initiative
or when you request it, regarding Guinea’s economic and financial policies.
7.
In order to evaluate progress achieved in program implementation, the IMF staff, in
conjunction with the government of Guinea, will conduct the next staff assessment by earlyDecember 2005 based on the benchmarks for end-September 2005.
8.
The Guinean government agrees to the publication of this letter and of the
government’s memorandum of economic and financial policies

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER 2005 – MARCH 2006

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Within the framework of a staff-monitored program (SMP), Guinea adopted a
program—covering the period April 2005-March 2006—of prudent fiscal and monetary
policies and structural reform. The program is intended to stabilize the economy and thus lay
the basis to accelerate growth, reduce poverty, and lay a solid basis for achievement of the
Millennium Developments Goals.
2.
This Memorandum is a complement to the Memorandum of May 31, 2005. It reports
on recent developments, and describes the additional policies necessary to ensure
achievement of the quantitative targets and structural benchmarks during the remaining
period of the SMP.
II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

3.
As envisaged in the program, real GDP growth is recovering moderately and is
expected to reach 3 percent in 2005. The improvement in real GDP growth reflects a
rebound of agricultural activity as well as stronger growth in the construction and mining
sectors. Several large investment projects are expected to come on stream and to contribute
to strong growth and exports in the mining sector in the coming years.
4.
However, inflation has remained above the programmed level. Inflation is
expected to reach 28 percent by the end of 2005 (12-month basis), reflecting the faster-thanexpected depreciation of the Guinean franc as well as the effects of the significant increase in
domestic petroleum prices decreed last May. The exchange rate moved from 2,850 Guinea
francs per U.S. dollar on March 1 to 3,827 on June 30, compared to 3,200 in the program.
However, the depreciation of the exchange rate has slowed significantly since mid-June,
while at the same time the spread between the exchange rate in the banks and the exchange
houses has dropped to less than 5 percent.
5.
The balance of payments is expected to improve in 2005. The current account
deficit is expected to contract from 5½ percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.8 percent of GDP in
2005, while the overall balance is expected to improve from a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP
in 2004 to a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2005. The increase in the price of bauxite and
alumina boosted the value of exports, whereas the faster-than-expected exchange rate
depreciation dampened non-oil imports. Gross international reserves are expected to increase

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

from 0.8 to 1.3 months of imports during 2005. Earlier this year, the international reserves of
the central bank were adjusted downwards by the equivalent of ⅓ months of imports to
reflect a 2003 cash payment to a government supplier which had remained unaccounted for;
the central bank has initiated action to recover the funds, and intends to use them to
reconstitute international reserves.
6.
All end-June quantitative targets under the SMP were met, except for the
accumulation of central bank net foreign assets (NFA). Fiscal revenue targets were
achieved and expenditure commitments were kept under control as programmed. The overall
fiscal balance (cash basis) reached a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in the first half of the
year, compared to a deficit of 1 percent of GDP under the program, and the government was
able to reduce the level of domestic financing. Reserve money expansion, which had reached
49 percent on a 12-month basis by March 2005, dropped to 36 percent by end-June. Broad
money expanded by 34.6 percent in the year ended in June 2005, compared to 32.1 percent
under the program, but this was the result of the effect of the faster-than-expected
depreciation of the Guinean franc on the value of foreign currency deposits. The NFA of the
central bank expanded by US$13 million in the first half of 2005, but this was not enough to
meet the SMP target.
7.
There has been important progress in the area of structural reform in the last
few months, and all end-June structural benchmarks under the SMP were met except
the continuous benchmark on refraining from introducing new multiple currency
practices. The initial steps to liberalize the foreign exchange market were implemented last
March; however, a multiple currency practice remains arising from the potential spread of
more than 2 percent between interbank market spot rates and the central bank’s reference
rate. Regarding fiscal reform, the WAEMU common external tariff was adopted and reforms
in the customs and tax administrations and in public expenditure management advanced as
expected. There was progress under the divestiture program, including the sale of shares in
the largest commercial bank to a foreign bank for about US$2 million in September 2005.
Action plans to reduce fraud and enhance the efficiency of the water and electricity sectors
were adopted. Finally, work on the audits of the central bank accounts and foreign asset
position is almost complete.
8.
Despite the large increase in domestic petroleum prices of last May, the domestic
petroleum sector continues to face serious difficulties. The petroleum companies are again
selling at a loss in the domestic market, owing to the rapid increase of international oil prices
coupled with the depreciation of the exchange rate. This situation needs to be addressed to
ensure continued supply of petroleum products in the domestic market.
9.
Guinea continued to experience difficulties in meeting its payments to the Fund
on a timely basis. As of the SMP test date of June 30, Guinea had overdue obligations

- 43 -

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

amounting to SDR 3 million, which were not settled until mid-August. To avoid the
recurrence of this problem, the government will adopt a strategy of paying upcoming
obligations in advance of the due date. We have already deposited in our SDR account the
necessary funds to cover all obligations to the IMF falling due in 2005, and we will continue
to use this mechanism for the settlement of future payments to the IMF.
III.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR SEPTEMBER 2005-MARCH 2006

10.
The government confirms its strong commitment to the objectives of the SMP.
Current financial policies will be strengthened and additional steps will be taken as needed to
ensure success in reducing inflation, promoting growth, and accumulating international
reserves. To achieve its objectives, the government will maintain a tight stance of fiscal and
monetary policies, and will take measures to strengthen the institutional framework and
enhance the efficiency of the foreign exchange market. Also, the government will adopt
measures to ensure the continued supply of petroleum products in Guinea.
Fiscal policy
11.
Fiscal performance was satisfactory during the period January-August 2005.
Revenue growth exceeded program objectives, especially in the area of international trade
taxes, reflecting the combined effect of improved efficiency of the tax and customs
administration, the implementation of the WAEMU common external tariff, and the faster
rate of currency depreciation. The faster-than-expected exchange rate depreciation also has
exerted substantial pressure on government expenditures, but the government was able to
contain total outlays within the confines of the budget. The end-August primary surplus was
0.5 percentage points of GDP higher than targeted and the overall deficit, excluding grants,
was 0.2 percentage points lower than expected, which allowed the government to reduce its
net indebtedness vis-à-vis the central bank.
12.
The government will take specific measures during the last quarter of the year to
ensure meeting the SMP’s fiscal targets in the face of additional expenditure pressures.
Initial projections indicate that primary current expenditure during the last quarter of the year
could exceed program projections, in part owing to additional pressure from the higher rate
of currency depreciation. The government has decided to reduce expenditures on goods and
services for at least 10 billion relative to the latest projections, mainly by pursuing efforts to
limit foreign mission expenditures and containing transfers and subsidies to their program
level.
13.
Faced with particular problems in the last few months, the government took
measures not envisaged in the SMP policy framework. First, to ensure availability of

- 44 -

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

foreign exchange to meet external debt service obligations, including to the Fund, the
government received last August an interest-free advance of tax payments for US$18 million
from the mining companies. To avoid the rigidity that such operations introduce in the
budget, the government undertakes not to use future tax payments to meet current obligations
during the period of the SMP. Second, faced with the increase in the cost of imported rice,
the authorities agreed to provide an exchange rate guarantee to rice importers through
September 2005. In the future, when faced with similar situations, the government will
consult with the IMF on any policy actions that were not envisaged in its reform plan agreed
with the IMF staff.
14.
The 2006 government budget is a key instrument to consolidate progress under
the SMP. It is being prepared on the basis of further strengthening of revenue collection,
controlling the expansion of expenditures, and reducing central bank financing of the
government as well as refraining from the use of nonconcessional external resources. As part
of the 2006 budget preparation efforts, the government will take steps to gain better control
over government activities that still remain outside the realm of the budget, and will request
technical assistance from the IMF in this regard. The finance law for 2006 also will address
the issue of the pricing mechanism of petroleum products in the domestic market (see
below). Furthermore, the government will seek to improve expenditure composition to insure
that the 2006 budget reflects the recommendations of the second progress report of the
poverty reduction strategy.
Monetary and exchange policy
15.
Monetary and exchange policy will be conducted in a manner consistent with the
targets and objectives of the SMP. In this regard, the central bank will follow closely the
recommendations made by the August 2005 mission of the IMF Monetary and Financial
Systems Department (MFD), as described in the next two paragraphs.
16.
The central bank will implement policies to encourage the participation of
economic agents in the formal foreign exchange market and to allow the market to be
representative of the true underlying conditions in the economy. First, the central bank
will start calculating the reference exchange rate as a weighted average of the amounts
transacted by the banks and exchange houses. At the same time, the central bank will take
steps (including on-site inspections) to guarantee timely and complete reporting by the banks
and the exchange bureaus of actual exchange rates and of volumes transacted. The central
bank intends to start publishing a daily reference rate based on intra-day data, which will
eliminate the remaining multiple currency practice. Also, the central bank will continue
reducing the backlog in transferring banks’ foreign exchange to correspondents abroad. In
the last quarter of 2005, the central bank will set up an internal control structure for its
foreign exchange operations as well as an agreement detailing the obligations of the central
bank and the commercial banks in the foreign exchange market. During the last quarter of

- 45 -

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

2005, the central bank also will reorganize of its Foreign Exchange Department, while
foreign exchange market regulations will be reviewed to reflect the institutional changes in
the foreign exchange market implemented so far. The central bank also will assess the
operation of the regulation on maximum withdrawals of foreign exchange cash. Finally, the
central bank will work closely with the customs administration, the banking system and
exporters to ensure full repatriation of export revenues in accordance with existing
regulations.
17.
The central bank will implement policies that will allow it to transmit to the
markets the stance of monetary policy and to support its operations in the foreign
exchange market. Given the situation of structural excess liquidity in the market—apparent
in the large level of excess reserves that the banks maintain in the central bank—the reserve
requirement coefficient on bank deposits will be increased in October 2005 to 9 ½ percent of
bank deposits, after consultation with the commercial banks. At the same time, the period for
calculation of compliance with reserve requirements will be extended from 10 to 15 days. To
enhance the role of the auctions of central bank bills (TRMs) as a monetary policy
instrument, the auctions of Treasury bills and TRMs will be carried out in different days of
the week. The Treasury Committee will be reactivated to enhance the communication
between the Treasury and the central bank, while a Liquidity Committee will be set up in the
central bank. At the same time, the central bank will start work to revise the regulations
pertaining to central bank advances to the government, with a view to eliminate statutory
advances in the future.
The petroleum sector
18.
The government will introduce an automatic price adjustment mechanism for
petroleum products in the 2006 budget law. This automatic price adjustment mechanism
will fully reflect exchange rate and international oil price conditions, and will be applied on a
regular monthly basis. If the government decides to lower domestic petroleum taxes as part
of the new price mechanism to ensure that the price structure in Guinea does not deviate from
that in neighboring countries to a significant degree, other measures for an equal amount of
resources will be identified so as to reach a neutral fiscal effect. In the meantime, the
government will start implementing limited monthly adjustments of domestic oil prices in the
fourth quarter of 2005.
IV.

PROGRAM MONITORING

19.
Program implementation will continue to be monitored on the basis of the
quantitative indicators and structural benchmarks specified in the Memorandum of
May 31, 2005, for end-September and end-December 2005 and end-March 2006. Table 1
specifies the quantitative targets of the program, which are identical to those of the
Memorandum of May 31, 2005, except for two adjustments. First, the stock of net foreign

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ANNEX I

assets of the central bank has been revised downwards throughout by about US$23 million,
following the adjustment to the central bank balance sheet on account of a 2003 import
operation mentioned above (repayments received by the central bank corresponding to this
operations will not count towards meeting the program objectives). Second, the target for the
accumulation of net foreign assets of the central bank has been (a) revised upwards from
June 2005 for US$1 million of exceptional budget assistance received from China, and
(b) revised downwards from December 2005 for 75 percent of US$8.2 million of projected
foreign financing from the European Union that is no longer expected to be received during
the SMP period. The next quarterly staff assessment of the program will take place on the
basis of data for end-September 2005.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of
Guinea (BCRG) was subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement,
which was approved on May 2, 2001. The assessment concluded that substantial risks
existed in the central bank’s external audit mechanism, financial reporting framework,
and system of internal controls. Following the recommendations of the safeguards
assessment mission, the BCRG contracted services of a reputable international firm to
conduct a special audit of the foreign assets of the central bank and of the BCRG itself.
Implementation of other measures by the BCRG is monitored by staff. An updated
assessment will be needed with regard to a new arrangement.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements:

On March 1, 2005, the Guinean authorities unified and liberalized the foreign exchange
system, and abandoned the foreign exchange rate auction mechanism. The Central Bank
calculates the reference exchange rate on a weekly basis, as the arithmetic average of the
exchange rates quoted by deposit money banks and foreign exchange bureaus. A multiple
currency practice arises from the potential spread of over 2 percent of effective rates
between the Central Bank’s reference rate and the interbank market rate

APPENDIX III

Guinea: IMF-World Bank Relations
(As of October 12, 2005)
Partnership in Guinea’s Development Strategy
1.
Guinea’s development strategy is laid out in the government’s poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP), which was endorsed by the Executive Boards of the Fund and the
World Bank in July, 2002. The PRSP rests on three pillars: first, to foster sustainable growth,
and create income-earning and employment opportunities, particularly for the rural poor;
second, to extend access to basic services and improve their quality; and third, to improve
governance and strengthen institutional and human capacity. The PRSP builds on Guinea’s
poverty reduction policies as formulated in the “Guinea—Vision 2010” document of
December 1996 and the interim PRSP of 2000.
2.
The Fund and the World Bank cooperate closely, within their respective mandates, in
assisting the government to implement its medium-term poverty reduction and growth
strategy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies. The World Bank is
taking the lead in areas of structural reforms, including banking sector restructuring;
privatization in the telecommunication, electricity, and water sectors; health, education,
administrative decentralization; capacity building; rural development, road maintenance; and
on governance issues.
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy
3.
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2004-06) for Guinea was approved by
the Board in June 2003. The CAS presents three scenarios. In the high-case scenario, the
Bank would increase budget support through the PRSC and provide project financing to the
power and water sectors. The PRSC would provide an adequate time frame and resources for
tackling medium- and long-term reforms in the key areas of decentralization, governance,
and privatization of utilities (water, electricity and telecommunication). In the base case, the
CAS would support key aspects of the PRSP and prepare the way for a new relationship with
the development partners based on a gradual phasing in of programmatic lending, leading to
more efficient allocation and utilization of external aid. Finally, the low-case scenario
assumes government is unable to make significant progress in resolving key macroeconomic,
fiscal and governance issues. Any assistance would be limited to safeguarding the progress
achieved in the priority sectors, vital to poverty reduction. There would be no budget support,
nor infrastructure financing.
4.
IDA provided in 2001 a fourth Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC IV) to Guinea. The
credit operation was to support the country’s poverty reduction strategy in the areas of public
expenditure management, governance, and public services delivery to the poor. The SAC IV
has had a satisfactory impact on the country’s macroeconomic performance. The credit was
disbursed in one tranche (US$50 million) on the grounds that, despite the lack of any external
budget support for a two-year period, Guinea had kept its economy broadly on track and had
demonstrated commitment to the program reforms with regard to public expenditure
management, governance, and the decentralization of basic service delivery. The adjustment

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

program supported by SAC IV was planned to be succeeded during FY 2004 by a Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). The PRSC assumed continuing sound macroeconomic
performance and reform implementation. However, macroeconomic management
deteriorated seriously since mid-2002 and the Fund’s PRGF supported program went off
track in December 2002. Key contributing factors were overspending related to security
outlays, lax monetary policies, and a fixing of the exchange rate, leading to rising inflation
and a sharp decline in gross reserves. Structural reforms came also to a halt. The wavering
macroeconomic policies, compounded by lower prices for bauxite and other commodities,
led to slow GDP growth in 2003 (1.2 percent) and 2004 (2.6 percent). Given the poor
macroeconomic performance, Guinea qualifies currently only for the CAS’ low-case lending
scenario. Since early 2005 a new government is making significant progress towards a
gradual stabilization of the macroeconomic aggregates, resumes the path of structural
reforms, and lays the ground for a renewed donor engagement, including by the World Bank.
5.
As of end-July 2005, the IDA has approved 63 credits for Guinea, of which eleven
were in the transport and infrastructure sector; thirteen in the energy, mining, water, and
telecommunications sector; three in strengthening the country’s management capability; five
in public sector/governance; twelve in financing rural sector development; three in the urban
sector; five in the health sector; seven in the education sector; one in social protection; three
in the financial sector. The total value of these projects amounts to about US$1,460 million
equivalent, of which US$1,334 million has been disbursed. During the period FY1998/2005,
the Board approved two adjustment operations (Public Expenditure Management Adjustment
Credit and the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit) and 9 investment operations: the
National Rural Infrastructure Project, Decentralized Rural Electrification, Education for All,
Village Community Support Program, the Capacity Building for Service Delivery Program,
the Microfinance LIL, the Pre-Service Teacher Education LIL, the Urban Project, and the
Population and Reproductive Health Project. The Bank’s current portfolio in Guinea reflects
the priorities of the PRSP. It comprises eight projects totaling US$236.6 million, of which
US$20.3 million is in the form of a grant, and US$133.6 million remain undisbursed. The
Capacity Building for Service Delivery Project (US$19 million, with an undisbursed balance
of $14.3 million) which closed on June 30, 2004, was retroactively extended to May 31, 2005
in order to permit the financing of a forensic audit. The non lending program includes
fiduciary assessment; a public expenditure review (PER); analysis of public finance
management and audit systems; a cross-cutting assessment of Guinea’s social, structural, and
sector development under the PRSP; and Bank/Fund collaborative work on social impact
analysis
6.
Under the current low-case CAS scenario, the proposed World Bank lending program
for FY2004/06 will support a National Rural Infrastructure Project ($30.3 m) which was
approved in August 2004 and a Second Health Sector Project (US$25 million), which got
approved early June 2005; and a Second Village Community Support Program
(US$45 million) is included in FY06. A second phase of the Urban APL in FY07 could be
advanced, if Guinea moves up to the base case.

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
7.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting
the government’s poverty reduction strategy and structural reforms. As part of its overall
assistance to Guinea through lending, country analytic work, and technical assistance, the
Bank supports policy reforms in the following areas in collaboration with the Fund.
Public Expenditure Management
8.
Improvements in public expenditure management have been one of the priorities of
the Guinean government since 1996. The Bank, the Fund, and other donors have worked
closely to provide the government with the needed support for institutional and policy
reforms. While the Fund is leading the dialogue on tax policy, the Bank is focusing on
strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency of public expenditures. To enhance
strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency, the Bank has assisted the government
in the preparation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and is supporting the
strengthening of the budget process as well as the allocation of resources to pro-poor priority
areas at the decentralized level. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was
undertaken in 2002 and a Public Expenditure Review (PER) followed in 2004. The PER was
managed by the Bank, enjoyed strong government ownership, and benefited from extensive
consultation of beneficiaries and development partners in close collaboration with the Fund and
the AfDB. The PER was complemented by a full Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) which focused on public expenditure management systems, the auditing of public
finances and related governance issues

Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
9.
The Bank and Fund’s respective Guinea country teams are currently discussing the
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. It is envisaged that a few selected areas may be
analyzed over the coming years. These might cover: an analysis of the impact on social
output indicators of government spending in health and education, an assessment of the
impact of the adoption of the Common External Tariff of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) on the taxation of basic consumer goods, an assessment of the
impact of exchange rate flexibility on consumer prices, a social impact analysis of trade
reforms, and an analysis of the impact of taxation on growth and income distribution. The
selection of the few reforms to analyze will be based on the importance of the expected
poverty and social impacts of each reform, the prominence of the issue in the government’s
agenda, the timing and urgency of the reform, and the level of national debate surrounding
the reform. The 2002 household survey has been completed during the first semester of 2005,
making it possible to better identify key determinants of poverty and their interdependency
and track poverty impact over time. An updated poverty diagnostic is about to be finalized.

- 57 -

APPENDIX III

Public Service Reform and Improved Service Delivery
10.
In recent years, the Government of Guinea, with the support of the Bank and other
donors, has launched a number of initiatives to improve administrative performance and to
foster greater accountability, transparency, and integrity in the public sector. The Bank
supported these efforts through : (i) the Economic Management Technical Assistance Project
between 1993 and 2000 (Projet d’Appui à la Gestion Economique et Financière – PAGE),
(ii) the Capacity Building for Service Delivery Project from 2000-2004 (Projet de
Renforcement des Capacités Institutionelles Pour une Meilleure Prestation des Services PRCI), (iii) governance and corruption surveys launched by the former Anti-Corruption
Commission (Conseil National de Lutte contre la Corruption - CNLC) and (iv) a grant to
strengthen the capacity of the Finance Committee of the National Assembly and the Chamber
of Accounts.
11.
These reforms aim to improve service delivery and financial accountability through
capacity building and support to the Government’s decentralization process. However, the
impact of PAGE on public service efficiency and effectiveness was limited and the PRCI was
suspended in August 2003 because of corruption, leaving most of the project’s results
indicators unachieved. In contrast, evaluation of the corruption surveys is ongoing and will
lead to a medium term governance and anti-corruption strategy by the end of 2005. Progress
has been made in strengthening the capacity of the Parliament’s Finance Committee and the
Chamber of Accounts.
12.
Cooperation between the Bank and the Fund covers those areas where public sector
reform has a direct impact on fiscal stability and public sector financial management.
Trade Reforms
13.
The Bank and the Fund also are working together closely to assist Guinea in
establishing a pro-growth trade framework. While the Fund has taken the lead in reforms in
the tariff regime, the Bank is trying to foster trade through the Integrated Trade Framework.
The Bank is also involved in a dialogue on trade reforms in the context of the WAEMU at
the regional level.

APPENDIX IV

Guinea: Statistical Issues
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for program
monitoring and surveillance. However, scope exists to improve the internal consistency of
fiscal data as well as their consistency with monetary accounts.
2.
Guinea participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its
metadata were first posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB) on
December 12, 2003. However, as the metadata currently disseminated on the DSBB were
written in March 2002, the plans for improvements and the metadata for all data categories
need to be updated
3.
Improvements have been made in recent years in the availability of detailed
government finance data. However, serious statistical problems remain, particularly in the
compilation of real sector and balance of payments statistics. Changes in the financial system
in recent years have adversely affected the quality of data for deposit money banks. A law on
statistics that organizes the institutional setting for producing statistics at a decentralized
level was approved in 1995. However, neither the National Direction of Statistics (DNS),
responsible for coordinating the production of statistics, nor a technical committee
responsible for providing recommendations on the statistical program—both created under
the new law—seem to have improved the quality of statistics.
Real sector statistics
4.
Statistics on the real sector are weak and incomplete, and not published timely
enough to support economic policy making. Only the consumer price index (CPI) is
published on a monthly basis in a timely manner (see below), while other statistics are
published less frequently, and more erratically, and are often not reliable. Some of these
series are available on the DNS website.1 The monthly surveys on mining, industrial and
agricultural production are produced with very long delays. Statistics on employment and
population are only published annually. A program to reinforce the national accounts is being
undertaken with the technical assistance of the regional statistical office (AFRISTAT) and
the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). The work is expected to lead to the
production of input-output matrices on an annual basis.
5.
The consumer price index for Conakry is available on a monthly basis, with a
one-month lag. Export prices are estimated on the basis of information supplied directly by
the mining companies, while import prices are based on a weighted average of partner
countries’ export prices. Exchange rates are reported weekly.
6.
Additional data on the agriculture sector have been published sporadically in the form
of Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations Development Program surveys. No
data on employment or labor costs are published.

See http://www.afristat.org/ins-guinee/index.htm.

- 60 -

APPENDIX IV

7.
In March 2000, a STA mission presented detailed recommendations on how to
improve real sector statistics. The mission identified the lack of a budget for the compilation
of current statistics and insufficient training as the main causes of the statistical system’s
weakness. Guinea has developed an action plan to address these weaknesses, but financial
resources for many of these measures have yet to be identified.
Balance of payments statistics
8.
The authorities have implemented some of the recommendations made by a balance
of payments statistics mission in May 1995. Notably, coverage of trade in services, private
transfers, and capital flows has been expanded by surveying service providers and large
companies on an annual basis. However, the survey is not comprehensive, and there are no
sanctions for nonresponse. In view of the difficulties encountered with the compilation of
annual statistics, the mission’s recommendation to compile data on a quarterly basis has not
yet been implemented.
9.
Merchandise trade statistics are reported in the standard Harmonized System of
Customs Classification, net of imports by diplomats and transit trade. In spite of the
technically advanced method of presentation, the data are inconsistent with actual
developments in the country. Some of these inconsistencies may be due to smuggling, as
Guinea’s borders are porous. However, there appear to be compilation errors; for example,
they report significant exports of aluminum products, which, according to the Ministry of
Mining and Energy, are not produced in the country. Thus, these data are substantially
adjusted prior to publication.
10.
Weaknesses in balance of payments statistics also affect national accounts data. The
national accounts are based on trade data that include transit trade and imports by diplomats,
and thus overestimate the openness of the economy. However, the national accounts use
estimates of trade in services, which are well below those estimated on the basis of the
surveys conducted by the central bank. The authorities have requested additional technical
assistance from STA for balance of payments statistics. Monthly data on international
reserves have not been reported to the IMF Statistics Department since December 2002.

- 61 -

APPENDIX IV

Government finance statistics
11.
Comprehensive monthly central government budgetary data are compiled by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance on a cash basis for revenue and on commitment and cash
bases for expenditure. AFR receives preliminary data within one month. Budgetary data are
often not internally consistent. Consolidated central government operations data come from
the Treasury.
12.
The budget includes the bulk of all government operations, although it excludes a
number of “satellite” accounts that are not directly incorporated in the budget. There are also
significant differences between the national definition of general government and that
provided by the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM). Moreover, autonomous
funds, such as the Road Fund, are only partly incorporated in the budget. For the Road Fund,
the largest autonomous fund, 100 percent of resources are “committed” through the budget
and transferred from the budget to the fund. Actual disbursements are made at the Road
Fund’s discretion (albeit monitored through its account at the central bank). The fuel tax is
not expressly earmarked for the Road Fund, but it is received by the general budget and
transferred to the Road Fund through the budget.

Monthly data on monetary authorities, deposit money banks, and interest rates are

the same time lag. Developments in the financial system during the last few years, including
the liquidation and restructuring of a number of banks, are not fully reflected in the monetary
statistics, owing partly to problems in data collection, the classification of instruments, and
the sectorization of economic activities. The authorities have made some progress in adopted
the recommendations of a STA mission that visited Conakry in 2000, but further work is
needed to update and otherwise strengthen the deposit money banks’ reporting practices,
including those relating to the classification of nonperforming loans.
15.
Beginning in 2001, the authorities undertook regular reporting of monetary data for
publication in IFS. Following a deterioration in 2003, the authorities report monetary data for
publication in IFS more frequently, although not on a monthly basis. The latest monetary
data published in IFS are for June 2005.

APPENDIX V

Guinea: Debt Sustainability Analysis1
1.
This annex assesses the external and public debt dynamics of Guinea using the
joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for low income
countries (LIC DSA). The main finding is that Guinea is in debt distress, and upon
reaching completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative (assumed to take place in
early 2007), the country would be at a high risk of debt distress into the medium-term
under the baseline scenario. Preliminary results from the public sector DSA reveal that
domestic debt levels represent an additional risk to the probability of debt distress in
Guinea.
Background
2.
Guinea reached the decision point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000, qualifying for US$545 million (in NPV terms) in debt relief. Interim
debt relief has been provided by all main creditors including the IMF and IDA until early
2003 when the PRGF went off-track. Only IDA and the European Union and two Paris
Club creditors have continued to provide interim relief under the Initiative. Consequently,
Guinea has had difficulties servicing its external debt over the period. Total external
arrears to multilateral and bilateral creditors accumulated at end-2004 amounted to
US$62.4 million (about 2.0 percent of GDP). HIPC debt relief will restart irrevocably
once the completion point is reached.
3.
At end-2004, Guinea’s public and
publicly guaranteed external debt is
estimated to be US$3,270 million.
Multilateral creditors account for 65 percent of
the total, with the World Bank and the African
Development Bank group making up threequarters of the multilateral’s share. The Paris
Club group of creditors accounts for
22 percent of total, while non-Paris Club
creditors and commercial creditors make up
the rest. Like most HIPC countries the
currency composition of its external debt
leaves it vulnerable to changes in the U.S.
dollar against major international currencies.
With over 70 percent of Guinea’s external debt
denominated in euros, yen and SDR (Figure
2), the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
major international currencies since decision
point has increased the U.S. dollar value of
Guinea’s external debt (Box 2 details the other

factors that have contributed to the increase in the NPV external debt-to-export ratio).
External Debt Sustainability Analysis (2005-25)
4.
A key feature of the low income debt sustainability analysis framework is
that it compares Guinea’s debt burden indicators to indicative policy-based
thresholds. The thresholds are based on the empirical finding that low-income countries
with stronger policies and

under the baseline scenario.
2/ Simple average.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
The NPV of debt-to-GDP and
revenues ratios also breach the policy-based thresholds under the baseline scenario before
declining below the thresholds in the medium-term (Table 1). The external debt service
ratio quickly falls below the relevant threshold once HIPC debt relief resumes in full at
completion point.
5.
The baseline macroeconomic framework underpinning this DSA assumes
continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms under
the SMP, followed by adoption of a PRGF-supported program in mid-2006, attainment of
the completion point in early 2007 and no major exogenous shock or policy reversal after
2007. This scenario reflects the authorities’ macroeconomic framework for 2005-08
discussed with Fund staff in the context of the 2005 Article IV consultation and
conservative macroeconomic assumptions beyond 2008 (Box 1). It also assumes that all
new loans will be on concessional terms.
6.
Guinea’s debt burden indicators are sensitive to exogenous shocks and policy
reversal. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the baseline debt burden indicators are most
vulnerable to an exogenous shock to export growth and a one-time depreciation of the
Guinean franc against the U.S. dollar. The debt ratios exhibit a significant level increase
and are slower to return to policy-based thresholds when exports are subjected to a one
standard deviation shock for two years and a one-time franc/U.S. dollar exchange rate
depreciation (see extreme stress tests in Figure 3). A scenario where key macroeconomic
variables remain at historical values sharply increases the risk of debt distress. Guinea’s

Countries—Further Considerations” (IDA/R2005-0056), April 2005.

- 65 -

APPENDIX V

external debt ratios would follow a continuous upward path if key economic variables
remain at their historical averages from 2005.3
7.
An alternative scenario that simulates possible G-8 debt relief indicates a
sharp reduction in the risk of debt distress at the expected completion point
(Figure 3, MDRI Scenario). The G-8 debt relief proposal calls for the write-down of debt
outstanding to IDA, the IMF and the African Development Fund as of end-2004 for all
HIPC countries that have reached or will reach completion point. Simulating the
implementation of G-8 debt relief in 2007 reduces Guinea’s external debt ratios in half on
average and the ratios remain well below the policy-based thresholds for the entire
projection period. The analysis underscores the importance of the authorities’
remaining committed to policy reform to achieve sustained economic growth, to
reach completion point and to potentially benefit from G-8 debt relief.
Box 1. Guinea: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP is expected to grow by 3.0 percent in 2005 and by an annual average of 5.5 percent over
2006-10 and 5.0 percent over 2011-2025. The higher growth during 2006-08 over the historically observed
trend is anticipated on account of better macro policies, rebound in the mining sector and improved public
infrastructure.
Average CPI Inflation, which was 17.5 percent in 2004, is expected to reach 30.7 percent in 2005
reflecting mainly the depreciation of the Guinean franc and the increase in petroleum prices Thereafter it is
expected to decline and average 9.6 percent in 2006-08 and 5.0 percent for the remaining forecast period,
based on the authorities’ commitment to abandon their accommodative policy stance and to strengthen their
monetary policy. Following the liberalization of the foreign exchange market in March 2005, the Guinean
franc lost almost one-third of its nominal value against the US dollar. Total nominal depreciation for 2005
is expected to reach 38 percent in foreign currency terms in 2005 and to remain equal to the projected
inflation differential between Guinea and its main trade partners.
Export growth is projected to average about 7.2 percent over the 2005-10 period and 8.2 percent over
2011-25.and external current account deficit, excluding official transfers is forecast to decline from
5.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to 4.6 percent in 2005 and 2.5, on average, over the 2006-25 period.
Fiscal policy is assumed to remain tightened in line with ongoing staff-monitored program and possible
PRGF-supported program starting in mid-2006. Government revenues which averaged 11.0 percent of
GDP during 1995-04 are anticipated higher at about 13 percent of GDP in 2005, 13.2 percent in 2006-08,
14.7 percent in 2009-15 and 17.2 percent in 2016-25. The increase in revenues is premised on envisaged
measures to strengthen customs and tax administration, eliminate ad hoc tax or customs tariff exemptions
and consolidate the implementation of the new tariff system adopted in early 2005. The primary surplus is
projected to decrease from an average of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2006-08 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2016-25.
New borrowing, the financing gap is filled mainly with concessional funds, significantly from IDA.

APPENDIX V

Box 2. HIPC DSA Update and Comparison to the LIC DSA Framework
This box updates the DSA presented in Guinea’s decision point document (www.imf.org) using the HIPC methodology.
Updates for new borrowing, exchange and discount rate parameters as of end-2004 and export data are used, while
HIPC debt relief simulations conducted at decision point are redone to reflect the interruption of relief during the
interim period and the accumulation of arrears.
As of end-2004, the NPV of debt after assuming the full delivery of enhanced HIPC assistance is estimated to be
US$1,521 compared with US$1,293 projected for end-2004 in the decision point document. While new borrowing was
lower-than-projected at decision point, it nevertheless did contribute to the increase in the NPV of external debt.
Moreover, the fall in the U.S dollar vis-à-vis major international currencies and the decline in discount rates also
contributed to the increase. The NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio is estimated at 189 percent as of end-2004, almost
40 percentage points higher than projected at decision point. Export growth between decision point and end-2004 fell
well short of expectations. However, the export growth that was realized between decision point and end-2004
contributed to a small reduction in the ratio, but the reduction was far from sufficient to offset the increase in the ratio
due to new borrowing and the change in exchange and discount rates

Using the HIPC methodology to update the decision point DSA results in an end-2004 ratio (189 percent) that is slightly
lower than that generated with the new LIC DSA framework (192 percent). There are a number of methodological
differences between the two frameworks that explain the difference: (i) the LIC DSA uses annual exports rather than a
three-year backward looking average; (ii) the LIC DSA uses exchange rate projections from the WEO to project debt
service streams rather than end-2004 exchanges rates under the HIPC methodology; and (iii) the LIC DSA uses a single
discount rate of 5 percent to calculate the NPV of debt rather than currency specific discount rates.
In the case of Guinea, the difference resulting from the change in the exchange rates used to project future debt streams
increases the debt ratios by more than the offsetting changes in discount rates and exports used between the two
methods.

APPENDIX V

Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (2005-25)
8.
Guinea’s central government fiscal deficit (commitment basis, including
grants) has been at an average deficit of 6.3 per cent of GDP during the period 1994
to 2004. Reflecting fiscal slippages, the deficit deteriorated steadily from 5.3 percent of
GDP in 1999 to reach 8.9 percent of GDP by end-2003. The fiscal imbalances reflect
higher-than-budgeted expenditures on account of defense spending, interest charges on
domestic debt, and domestically financed investment outlays. During the period,
expenditures averaged 17.2 percent of GDP while revenues (including grants) were
13.7 percent of GDP on average, resulting in the growing primary deficit and the
accumulation of domestic debt.
9.
At end-2004, the government’s domestic debt represented about 22 percent
of GDP and included advances from the central bank (15 percent), treasury bills owned
by commercial banks (4 percent) and accumulated arrears to the private sector
(3 percent). The government had also a sizable amount of non-certified debt to the private
non-financial sector and public enterprises, which is awaiting certification by external
auditors. This category of debt is not captured in the data used in this analysis.4 In the
context of ongoing Staff-Monitored Program, the authorities have undertaken an
inventory of its debt vis-à-vis the private non-financial sector and public enterprises, and
intend to complete an audit of this debt by end-December 2005.
10.
An important component of the baseline macroeconomic scenario is
increasing government revenues combined with restrained government spending.
The resulting fiscal adjustment is expected to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement over time. Consequently, the domestic debt stock is assumed to fall over
time, reaching 7 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. The combination of
strong revenue growth and a diminishing domestic debt stock, result in a falling public
sector debt burden over time. However, the starting levels are extremely high with the
NPV of total public sector debt to fiscal revenues ratio estimated to be 577 percent and
the NPV of public debt to GDP to be 134 percent in 2005 (Table 4).
11.
As in the external debt sustainability analysis, sensitivity analysis indicates a
sharp rise in the risk of debt over the medium term. In the no reform scenario, which
maintains the primary balance at the 2004 level, all debt burden indicators increase
significantly relative to the baseline scenario. For example, the NPV of public debt to
revenues ratio increases on average about 130 percentage points. A one-time 30 percent
real depreciation in the franc would also generate a significant increase in the debt burden
indicators (most extreme stress tests in Figure 4).

4

One of the stress tests in the LIC DSA framework assumes a 10 percent of GDP increase in debt creating
flows in 2006, which could approximate the inclusion of non-certified domestic debt.

- 68 -

12.
The results of the public sector DSA underscore the importance of domestic
debt management, especially the limiting of domestic borrowing from the central
bank and the accumulation of domestic arrears to the private sector.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Public sector debt refers to central government and nonfinancial public sector on a gross basis.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues including grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ The implicit nominal interest rate on domestic debt differs from nominal effective rates because the implicit rates are calculated on the basis of the total stock of debt to the central bank, commercial banks,
and the private non-financial sector, which is higher than the stock of domestic debt which is actually being serviced.

Key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions
Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on forex debt (in percent)
Average real interest rate on domestic currency debt (in percent)
Real exchange rate depreciation (in percent, + indicates depreciation)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 23, 2005
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation and Staff-Monitored Program. This
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Although Guinea met most of the quantitative criteria and structural
benchmarks under the SMP for end-September 2005, inflation remains high and
recently there were slippages in policy implementation. Notwithstanding the decline in
inflation in recent months, the authorities’ year-end objective is likely to be exceeded by a
wide margin. Monthly inflation has declined gradually from a peak of 6 percent in June 2005
to 0.8 percent in November; however, 12-month inflation is expected to reach close to
29 percent by end-2005, compared to the SMP objective of 19 percent. Recent indicators
suggest that real GDP growth as well as balance of payments developments in 2005 remain
in line with the expectations in the staff report.
3.
All but one of the end-September 2005 quantitative indicative targets under the
staff-monitored program (SMP) were met (Table 1):
•

The fiscal primary balance improved to a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in the first
nine months of 2005 compared to the target of 2.2 percent of GDP.

•

The indicative target on central government noninterest current expenditure was
exceeded, albeit by a small margin; the excess was mainly due to the faster than
expected depreciation of the exchange rate.

•

Net bank credit to the government contracted during the first nine months of 2004.

•

Reserve money contracted by GNF 25 billion between March and September,
compared to an expansion of GNF 29 billion under the SMP.

•

The target on the stock of net foreign assets (NFA) of the central bank was met, in
part owing to tax advances from the mining companies (discussed in the staff report)
and the proceeds of the sale of a GSM telephone license to a foreign operator in the
third quarter of 2005.

4.
All end-September SMP structural benchmarks were met (except for the
continued presence of a multiple currency practice; Table 2):
•

A provision of the general rules on public accounting was amended to eliminate the
possibility of extrabudgetary spending, and the government launched a call for bids
for an audit of the computerized expenditure management system.

-2•

The government adopted an action plan to combat corruption. As part of this plan, a
draft anti-corruption law is being finalized. In addition, a number of measures are
being taken to strengthen the ability of citizens to bring cases of corruption to the
attention of the authorities and to increase public awareness of corruption. The anticorruption plan is part of a broader strategy to promote good governance, which is
being developed with the support of the World Bank and the European Union.

•

Action plans were adopted to strengthen the financial situation of the water and
electricity companies. These plans envisage actions to reduce widespread fraud,
clarify financial relationships between the government and the utilities, ensure timely
payment of government bills for water and electricity consumption, and prepare an
opening balance for 2006.

•

No new ad-hoc tax or customs exemptions (a continuous structural benchmark) were
introduced.

•

The external audit of the international reserve position of the central bank was
completed by the external auditor, and the central bank forwarded its reactions by
end-September. The auditor submitted his final report in October 2005.

5.
However, there were serious slippages in program implementation during
October-November 2005, as a result of which several of the SMP’s end-December 2005
quantitative targets may not be attained. As of end-November, base money had almost
reached the level of the end-December target and central bank NFA had dropped to their endDecember program levels. Also, external arrears—which had contracted until September
2005—increased in October-November. The main problems were a very rapid expansion of
central bank credit to the government (reflecting in part higher government expenditures that
had been delayed from earlier in the year and reduced commercial bank financing to the
government) and the absence of an efficient program monitoring mechanism.
6.
The authorities are taking measures to bring their program back on track. These
measures include efforts to place additional treasury bonds with the commercial banks,
including by raising interest rates; purchasing foreign exchange in the market to rebuild
central bank NFA; and reducing external arrears by end-December to below the program
ceiling. The authorities will also take action to improve policy coordination between the
fiscal and monetary authorities; in particular, they will set up the treasury and liquidity
committees, as specified in their November 2005 MEFP.
7.
There was progress in the area of structural reform during the last quarter, and
all but one of the end-December structural benchmarks under the SMP are likely to be
achieved. The benchmarks related to the audit of the 2004 accounts of the central bank,
closing private accounts in the central bank, performing an inventory of cross-debts between
the government and the public enterprises, and adopting a plan to settle these cross debts will
be met. However, the benchmark relating to the audit of domestic government debt to the
private sector is not expected to be completed on time. A number of other positive
developments have taken place in the last few months. On the fiscal front, wage demands
have been kept under control in the face of social pressure, the number of military personnel

-3was reduced substantially in the last quarter of 2005, and the civil service census is
advancing as planned. Regarding monetary and exchange rate policy, the central bank is
taking action to publish the reference exchange rate on a daily and weighted basis and to
reinforce its foreign exchange department; it also raised reserve requirements. The
government sold a significant proportion of its shares in the largest commercial bank to a key
foreign investor. Also, three foreign investors have announced plans to develop large alumina
refinery plants in Guinea. Finally, nationwide local elections took place on December 18,
2005; the elections were peaceful although voter participation seems to have been very low.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 27, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Guinea
On December 23, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guinea.1
Background
Guinea’s economic performance deteriorated in recent years, largely as a result of a weak
policy framework and against a background of mounting regional insecurity and low prices for
its main commodity exports. Having averaged 4.7 percent in the late 1990s, economic growth
since 2000 has slowed to an average of about 2.5 percent, inflation accelerated to almost 30
percent, international reserves fell to less than one month of imports, and the external public
debt rose to almost 100 percent of GDP and is unsustainable.
Real GDP growth is expected to recover moderately in 2005 but little progress is expected in
reducing inflation. The modest improvement in output growth to 3 percent reflects a rebound in
agricultural activity as well as stronger growth in the construction and mining sectors. Inflation,
while edging down, is expected to be nearly 28 percent at end-2005, well above the
government’s objective of less than 19 percent. Gross international reserves are expected to
edge up from 0.8 to 1.3 months of import cover during 2005.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the December 23, 2005 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2The improvement in economic performance in 2005 followed the tightening of fiscal and
monetary policy early in the year and the implementation of the first steps to unify and liberalize
the foreign exchange market. Reflecting a significant contraction of expenditures, the overall
fiscal deficit (excluding grants) came down from 6 percent of GDP in 2004 to 0.2 percent of
GDP by June 2005. As a result, net central bank credit to the government increased by just over
1 percent of reserve money in the first half of 2005, compared with 10 percent of reserve money
in the same period of 2004. At the same time, the recent nominal depreciation of the Guinean
franc, amounting to about 38 percent since end-February 2005, has brought the real exchange
rate close to its underlying equilibrium rate.
The authorities are taking steps to enhance the business environment for the private sector, by
implementing structural reforms, improving investment conditions in the mining sector, and
strengthening governance and the judicial system. On the structural front, they have adopted
plans to improve the quality and availability of electricity and water services, and are carrying
out a program of privatization of government assets (including a substantial reduction of the
government’s stake in the largest commercial bank).
In support of the authorities’ efforts, IMF management approved a staff-monitored program
(SMP) covering April 2005–March 2006. The SMP aims to restore macroeconomic stability and,
through structural reform, to lay the basis for renewed growth, debt sustainability, and poverty
reduction. Guinea met all end-June and end-September indicative quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks under the SMP, except for the end-June accumulation of central bank
net foreign assets and the introduction of a new multiple currency practice.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the commitment of the new economic team—which took charge
in late 2004—to implementing prudent economic policies and advancing structural reforms in
order to address Guinea’s macroeconomic imbalances, boost economic growth, and fight the
pervasive poverty. They commended the actions taken in 2005, including the tightening of fiscal
and monetary policies, the unification and liberalization of the foreign exchange market, and the
efforts to improve the environment for private sector development. Directors were disappointed
at the slippages in policy implementation toward the end of the year, but welcomed the
corrective measures being taken. They noted that the overall strengthening of policies in 2005
has led to a decline in inflation in the last few months, a narrowing of the external current
account deficit, and a small rebound in economic growth. Directors considered that these
developments bode well for Guinea’s economic future.
Directors emphasized, however, that much more needs to be done to achieve lasting progress
toward macroeconomic stability and the Millennium Development Goals. Despite the recent
progress, inflation remains high, the public debt unsustainable, the external position weak, and
economic activity narrow-based and subdued. Directors therefore urged the authorities to
implement promptly and vigorously the measures adopted in their economic program agreed
with Fund staff, and to put in place an efficient policy coordination and monitoring mechanism to
ensure that fiscal and monetary policies are implemented in a consistent way. This will also
enable Guinea to build the track record that would allow it to move eventually to an IMF-

-3supported arrangement, and subsequently to reach the completion point under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative and to benefit from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation is a key requirement for Guinea’s return to higher
and sustained economic growth and to a sustainable debt level. In this regard, they
underscored the importance of adopting a prudent 2006 budget, consistent with the authorities’
stabilization objectives. Key measures will be to continue to improve tax and customs
administration and widen the tax base, control the growth of government outlays while
promoting priority expenditures, deepen public expenditure management, intensify reform of the
public utilities, and address institutional and capacity constraints to policy design,
implementation and monitoring. Directors also advised that domestic prices of petroleum
products be allowed to move in line with international prices.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take action to strengthen monetary control, including
through institutional and operational strengthening of the central bank and further progress on
financial sector reform. They urged the authorities to avoid central bank financing of budget
operations, and to instead issue government securities such as treasury bills, which should help
develop domestic capital markets. Directors recommended that interest rates be liberalized to
help reverse recent dollarization, allow interest rates to send a clear signal of the stance of
monetary policy, and promote a more efficient allocation of resources. While Directors were
encouraged by the improvement in financial sector soundness indicators, they expressed
concern at the high level of non-performing loans and concentration of credit, and called for
continued reinforcement of banking supervision and for vigilant prudential oversight. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to address as soon as possible the shortcomings identified in
the audit of the central bank’s 2004 accounts and foreign exchange position.
Directors encouraged the central bank to calculate the reference exchange rate on the basis of
a weighted average of intra-day market transactions and to publish it daily. This will further unify
and liberalize the foreign exchange market, make the exchange rate fully flexible and marketdetermined, and help eliminate the remaining multiple currency practice. Directors also
supported the planned reorganization of the foreign exchange department of the central bank.
Directors commended the progress on structural reform and strengthening governance. In
particular, they noted that the water and electricity sector reforms and the privatization of stateowned enterprises will be crucial for stimulating private sector-led growth and improving social
conditions. They welcomed the steps taken to combat corruption and improve the justice
system, and Guinea’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and
urged the authorities to accelerate efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors also stressed the need to diversify the export base in order to reduce Guinea’s
vulnerability to external shocks, and in this regard they commended the authorities’ decision to
adopt the WAEMU common external tariff and remove non-tariff barriers.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to stay current on their external debt payments,
and, in particular, the measures taken to ensure that timely payments are made to the Fund.
They encouraged the authorities to remain in close contact with their external creditors to work
toward a plan to clear arrears.

-4Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress in implementing their poverty reduction strategy.
They underscored the importance of orienting public expenditure toward the social sectors,
consistent with the framework of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). In this regard,
they encouraged the authorities to keep their PRSP under review, and to ensure that the
investment plans of the different government agencies reflect the priorities set out in the PRSP.
Directors also underscored the importance of strengthening the statistical system, and
encouraged the incorporation of an overall strategy for statistics development into the PRSP
framework.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with the Guinea may be made available at a
later stage if the authorities consent.

Statement by Damien Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Guinea
December 23, 2005
Introduction
My Guinean authorities would like to express their deep appreciation to staff for their
comprehensive assessment of macroeconomic developments in 2005 and Guinea’s
performance under the ongoing Staff Monitored Program (SMP). They also would like to
thank management for the candid exchange of views and constructive policy dialogue and
assistance in support of their adjustment and reform efforts.
Instability in the neighboring countries with its large inflows of refugees as well as the decline
in bauxite prices –Guinea’s most important export- have placed, over the past years,
enormous pressure on government finance. However, the return of peace in the neighboring
countries have enabled the authorities to strengthen economic and financial policies leading
to significant progress.
The Guinean authorities have made commendable progress under the Staff Monitored
Program that started in April 2005 with a view to addressing macroeconomic imbalances.
They remain strongly committed to the successful implementation of the SMP meant to
establish a track record for a new PRGF arrangement aimed at improving the economy’s
performance and fight the pervasive poverty. Indeed, all end-June quantitative targets under
the SMP were met, with the exception of the central bank net foreign assets. The foreign
exchange market has been unified and liberalized through the adoption in March of the
floating exchange rate regime. With regard to the structural reforms, targets were also met,
except for the benchmark on refraining from introducing new multiple currency practices, due
to lack of capacity. On this issue, my Guinean authorities are committed to implementing
recommendations made by the August 2005 MFD mission. The central bank will start
publishing, instead of a weekly rate, a daily reference rate based on intra-day data, hence
eliminating the remaining multiple currency practices.
Among the efforts made by my authorities to continue controlling and tightening the public
expenditure, notably the wage bill, it should be noted that nearly 1,500 civil servants and 2,000
military are being retired at the end of 2005. My Guinean authorities are fully mindful of the
challenges facing the economy and with the assistance from the international community, they are
strongly committed to restoring the macroeconomic stability through sound policies and structural
reforms leading to the resumption of growth, debt sustainability and poverty reduction.
Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the SMP
Real GDP growth will reach 3 percent in 2005 from 1.2 in 2003, due mainly to buoyant
agricultural activity and stronger growth in the construction and mining sectors. Inflation is
expected to decrease substantially from 43 percent in July 2005 to 29 percent by endDecember 2005, although remaining above the authorities’ target of less that 19 percent. The

-2-

inflation acceleration in 2005 is due to the adjustment measures with regard to the exchange
rate and domestic petroleum prices. Indeed, the Guinean Franc depreciated faster than
expected, by 38 percent, since end-February, and the domestic petroleum prices were
increased by 55 percent in 2005.Gross international reserves are expected to increase from 0.8
to 1.3 months of imports.
As regards the fiscal sector, the authorities tightened their policy and abandoned the
accommodative stance of monetary policy. As a result, the fiscal primary balance improved
from a deficit to a surplus of over 2 percent of GDP by June and the overall fiscal deficit,
excluding grants, declined from almost 6 percent in 2004 to 0.2 percent of GDP by June 2005.
Under the ongoing SMP, fiscal revenue targets were achieved and expenditure commitments
were kept under control as programmed. For the last quarter of the year, the authorities are
determined to further improve public expenditure management as expected . On the other
hand, the strengthening of tax and customs administration was pursued, ad-hoc exemptions
were eliminated and the WAEMU external tariff system was put in place.
In view of the lack of foreign reserves, the authorities’ intention to be current on their external
payments, in particular with the Fund experienced some delays. To reverse the situation, the
authorities had to have recourse to advance tax payments from the mining companies. They
also adopted a strategy of paying upcoming obligations to the Fund through deposits of the
necessary funds in their SDR account to cover all obligations due in 2005. The same
mechanism will be used for the settlement of future payments to the Fund.
In the monetary area, the authorities have implemented a number of measures with the
technical assistance from MFD, with a view to strengthen the foreign exchange market and
bring monetary aggregates under control. Monetary policy was less expansionary in 2005.
The depreciation of the currency has slowed since mid July and the necessary steps are
underway, in order to avoid the occurrence of multiple currency practices. Only the target on
the central bank foreign assets was missed at end-June, due to the lack of external support and
the need to be current on external payments. The banking system remains sound and
profitable. The main soundness ratios are above prudential limits and the central bank is
implementing changes in the legal and supervisory framework, following the adoption of the
new banking law in last July. Moreover, the National Assembly has approved the
microfinance law and the law on money laundering and financing of terrorism is under
consideration
In the structural area, the authorities concur with staff on the need to continue deepening
structural reforms. To diversify the export base, agriculture, fishing and tourism have been
identified as key sectors. Regarding the poverty reduction strategy, the authorities with the
assistance of donors completed in last February the second progress report on achieving the
MDGs. They intend to adopt in 2006 an action plan to alleviate key obstacles to achieving the
MDGs particularly in the areas of eradication of poverty and hunger, promotion of gender
equality and environmental protection and access to safe water. Action plans have also been
adopted with regard to the improvement of the water and electricity companies’ operations. In
addition, the authorities have implemented the decision to reduce to less than 20 percent the

-3-

state’s share in the capital of the largest commercial bank namely the Banque Internationale
pour le Commerce et l’ Industrie de la Guinée (BICIGUI). In their continued efforts to reduce
the cost of doing business in Guinea, the authorities implemented strong measures to combat
corruption and improve the judicial system. Under the EITI Initiative, a working group made
up of representatives of mining companies, civil society, national assembly and government
has been set up with the assistance from the World Bank.
Overall recent developments have shown the difficult circumstances facing my authorities as
evidenced by the rapid growth in central bank credit and reduction of the central bank net
foreign assets. In order to maintain the SMP on track my Guinean authorities have already
adopted remedial measures which include allowing interest rates on treasury bonds to rise so
as to increase commercial bank financing of the government, purchasing foreign exchange in
the market to ensure meeting the targets on central bank net foreign assets (NFA), repaying
arrears as called for under the program, and enhancing policy coordination among the fiscal
and monetary authorities.
Medium-Term Program and Policies for 2006.
My Guinean authorities will continue their efforts to improve macroeconomic management
and accelerate structural reform. In this respect, current financial policies will be strengthened
and additional measures will be taken as needed with a view to ensure success in reducing
inflation, promoting growth and accumulating international reserves.
Fiscal policy
In order to ensure the realization of all fiscal targets set out in the SMP, the authorities have
decided to maintain expenditures under control, thus allowing further reduction of the
government net indebtness with the central bank. Focus will also be put on increasing
expenditures in priority sectors while non-priority expenditures will decrease. On the revenue
side, they will continue to improve on the efficiency of the tax and customs administration. To
avoid in the future the rigidity attached to advance of tax payment made by mining
companies, the authorities undertake not to use future tax payments to meet external debt
service obligations. In the context of the 2006 budget, defined as a key instrument to
consolidate progress made under the SMP, the authorities have requested Fund’s technical
assistance, in their efforts to improve the management of public finances.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Achieving single digit inflation, increasing the level of international reserves and improving
the financial intermediation are the objectives of the monetary program. To this end,
strengthening the institutional framework and enhancing the efficiency of the foreign exchange
market as agreed on with the recent MFD mission will be carefully implemented. In particular,
the authorities are committed to (i) take measures encouraging the participation of economic
agents in the formal foreign market; (ii) publish a daily reference exchange rate weighting the
average transactions by the banks and exchange houses; (ii) set up an internal control structure

within the central bank for its foreign exchange operations as well as an agreement detailing
the obligations of the central bank and the commercial banks in the foreign exchange market;
(iv) reflect the new institutional changes in the foreign exchange market regulations and (v)
bring the customs administration, the banking system, the exporters and the central bank to
work closely in the repatriation of export proceeds in accordance with the existing regulations.
In addition, the central bank will start work to revise the regulations pertaining to central bank
advances to government with a view to eliminate statutory advances in the future. The
Treasury Committee will be reactivated to enhance the communication between the central
bank and the Treasury, while a Liquidity Committee will be created within the central bank.
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, an audit of the central bank covering its
foreign assets and its full 2004 accounts was conducted by a reputable international firm. The
authorities are fully determined to implement remedial recommendations contained in the audit
report.
Structural reforms
Building on progress made under the SMP, my authorities are determined to pursue
vigorously their structural reforms agenda, thus laying the ground for a new program that
could be supported by the PRGF. In the 2006 budget law, the authorities will introduce an
automatic price adjustment mechanism for petroleum product which help to address financial
difficulties facing the oil companies as well as the government due to the increases in
international oil prices .The action plan designed for water and electricity companies will also
be fully implemented in order to enhance efficiency and reduce fraud. In addition, the
authorities are committed to promote export diversification while maintaining a liberal trade
regime. To this end measures recommended by the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
(DTIS) will be fully implemented with a view to reduce supply constraints.
Conclusion
My Guinean authorities are determined to pursue their efforts in implementing sound policies
and needed structural reforms in order to strengthen progress made so far and achieve the
objectives set out under the SMP. To supplement these efforts and achieve the macroeconomic
stability and foster economic growth, a strong and sustainable support from the international
community is needed. In this regard, my authorities are hopeful that their ongoing efforts under
the SMP will be well recognized and will lead to a new PRGF-supported program early 2006,
thus enabling the country to reach the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and
benefit from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
