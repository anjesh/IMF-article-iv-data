IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Morocco
On December 14, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with Morocco.1
Morocco’s macroeconomic situation continues to improve. After declining to 2.4 percent in
2014, growth is expected to recover to 4.7 percent in 2015, thanks to a good agricultural season
and improvements in construction activity. However, nonagricultural growth remains sluggish,
including in sectors related to tourism, which are affected by geopolitical risks, and some
traditional manufacturing, such as textiles. The unemployment rate picked up slightly to 10.1
percent in Q3 2015, and youth unemployment is particularly high, at 21.4 percent. Headline
inflation (y-o-y) remained low at 1.4 percent in October, reflecting lower food prices.
External imbalances have fallen substantially. The current account deficit is expected to narrow
to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015 (against 5.7 percent in 2014). Strong phosphate and newly
developed industries’ exports, and lower energy and food imports, as well as strong remittances,
are more than offsetting the impact of declining tourism revenues. As a result and with continued
robust FDI, international reserves are now close to 6.5 month of imports.
Fiscal consolidation has continued, and the authorities appear to be on track to meet the fiscal
deficit objective of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2015, down from 4.9 percent in 2014. This reflects
lower wage and subsidy spending (thanks to declining oil prices and the full implementation of
energy subsidy reforms), which offset the decline in grant and tax revenues due to lower VAT on
imported goods.
The financial sector remains well capitalized and profitable. Banking sector capital adequacy
ratios stood at 13.8 percent in June 2015, well above the Basel III requirement. Bank profitability
is stable, and while nonperforming loans have increased, they are adequately provisioned.
Morocco’s medium-term prospects are favorable, with growth projected to get close to 5 percent
by 2020, although risks remain, such as that of lower growth in the euro area or increased

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

international oil prices. Stronger medium term growth will hinge on continued implementation of
comprehensive reforms with regard to labor participation and labor market efficiency, access to
finance, quality education, efficiency of public spending, and further improvements to the
business environment. Finally, better healthcare coverage, continued poverty reduction, and
lower regional and gender disparities will also be crucial to achieve a sustainable and more
inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management
and the ongoing improvements to the policy framework which have helped yield positive
outcomes, including strengthened fiscal and external buffers, a recovery of growth, and progress
on unemployment and poverty reduction. The medium term outlook is favorable but remains
vulnerable to fragile external conditions and geopolitical risks. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ continued strong commitment to sound policies and encouraged them to move
forward with reforms to further reduce vulnerabilities and promote stronger job creation and
more inclusive growth.
Directors recognized the progress made in fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities
to continue their efforts to gradually reduce the level of public debt over the medium term, while
preserving fiscal space for pro-growth and social spending. In this context, Directors supported
steps to further reduce wage and subsidy spending, while protecting the most vulnerable
segments of the society; advance tax and pension reforms; and improve the efficiency of public
spending. Directors welcomed the new organic budget law which will strengthen the fiscal
framework by improving accountability and transparency. They advised the authorities to move
carefully with the fiscal decentralization process.
Directors endorsed the current monetary policy stance in the context of low inflation and slow
credit growth. They encouraged the authorities to finalize the revision of the new central bank
law, which will strengthen its independence and expand its supervisory powers and mandate.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to move gradually to a more flexible exchange rate
regime and new monetary policy framework, noting that this will help preserve competitiveness
and better insulate the economy against shocks. Continued efforts to promote financial market
deepening will strengthen monetary policy transmission.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains sound and resilient to adverse economic shocks
but stressed that rising non-performing loans and credit concentration risks require continued

monitoring. They welcomed Bank Al Maghrib’s (BAM) efforts to strengthen the financial
regulatory and supervisory framework by implementing the new banking law and taking steps to
implement the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations. Directors looked
forward to further progress in improving cross border bank supervision, tightening rules for
consolidated risk management, strengthening the bank resolution framework, and fostering
financial inclusion. They supported BAM’s intention to strengthen its supervisory resources in
view of its expanding responsibilities.
Directors emphasized the importance of sustained implementation of structural reforms to
promote higher and more inclusive growth. Continued efforts to improve the business
environment, as well as reform of the labor market, and increased efficiency of public spending
on education, will be critical to bolster growth, reduce unemployment, especially among the
youth, and strengthen competitiveness. Directors welcomed the progress made to reduce
government bureaucracy and the forthcoming national strategy to fight corruption, and looked
forward to further progress on promoting good governance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 30, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The macro-economic situation continues to improve. Growth is recovering
and should reach 4.7 percent in 2015, but non-agricultural activity remains sluggish.
Inflation remains low. The authorities appear to be on track to meet the 2015 public
deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP. The external position continues to improve,
benefiting from lower oil prices, the current account deficit will narrow to about
1.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and international reserves will exceed 110 percent of the
Fund’s Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric. Poverty rates, unemployment and
inequalities have declined, but much remains to be done to reduce structural
unemployment, increase labor force participation rates, and secure higher and more
inclusive growth. Reforms have slowed down somewhat, especially pension reform and
the new central bank law. The 2015 FSAP assessed that banks are well capitalized and
profitable, and benefit from stable funding.
Outlook and risks. Growth should strengthen gradually in the medium term. In 2016,
growth will be affected by a base effect following the very good 2015 agricultural
season, but a gradual recovery is expected in 2017. Growth is expected to get close to
5 percent by 2020. Headline inflation is expected to remain low at 1.5 percent in 2016
and to stabilize around 2 percent thereafter. The external position should continue to
improve. While the medium-term outlook is favorable and risks have decreased, they
remain substantial, particularly because of Morocco’s strong ties to the euro zone. Key
risks are lower growth in advanced and emerging countries; an increase in world energy
prices due to geopolitical tensions; and a surge in global financial market volatility.
Policy discussions. Recent policy action and a more favorable external environment
have yielded macroeconomic improvements, but the reform momentum needs to be
maintained in order to secure longer term stability and raise growth potential. The
period ahead provides an opportunity to consolidate gains in macroeconomic
stabilization and “aim higher and try harder” to reduce social and regional disparities,
address youth unemployment, increase labor force participation, and achieve higher
and more inclusive growth. The discussions focused on securing stronger buffers and
raising potential growth while significantly reducing unemployment and inequalities,
and in particular on: (i) maintaining an adequate policy stance; (ii) securing macrofinancial sustainability; (iii) reinforcing monetary policy transmission; and,
(iv) establishing a more growth-friendly and inclusive environment.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
A sound policy framework and prudent macroeconomic management have served
Morocco well over the last few years, even though challenges remain. In response to shocks to
external demand and terms of trade, the authorities undertook fiscal consolidation and important
structural reforms, including subsidy reforms. These measures have helped reduce vulnerabilities,
but challenges to growth, employment, and poverty reduction remain. The IMF is supporting the
authorities’ program through a two-year precautionary and liquidity line (PLL) arrangement
approved in July 2014, which provides insurance against external risks.

A. Recent Developments
2.
Growth is recovering and should reach 4.7 percent in 2015, but non-agricultural
activity remains sluggish. The 2015 agricultural season was particularly good, while construction
activity showed signs of recovery. However, the European recovery is slower than expected, rising
geopolitical risks in the region have affected tourism, and activity in several traditional sectors (such
as the food or textile industries) is slower than expected. In light of these recent developments,
staff’s growth projection for 2015 has been revised to 4.7 percent (against 4.9 percent at the time of
the second review under the PLL arrangement). The current output level is estimated to be slightly
below potential, and inflation remained low at 1.6 percent in September.
3.
Poverty rates, unemployment and inequalities have declined, but much remains to be
done to secure higher and more inclusive growth. Unemployment increased to 10.1 percent in
the third quarter of 2015, and is still very high among the youth (21.4 percent) and in particular in
urban areas (39.3 percent). Multidimensional poverty is above the average for oil-importer countries
in the region.1 Continued efforts are needed to reduce structural unemployment, increase female
labor force participation rates (which have been below 28 percent since 2006), reduce the gender
gap, and address social and regional disparities.2 In particular, better healthcare and medical
coverage, improved access to quality education (the average number of schooling years is about
6 years) and increased literacy rates (currently of about 65 percent) are crucial to achieve more
inclusive growth and higher potential output.
4.
While the fiscal deficit has declined in recent years and fiscal developments have been
positive so far in 2015. In the past several years, external shocks have affected public finances, with
the overall fiscal deficit rising to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2012, putting public debt on a rising path.
The authorities responded to these developments with strong policy actions, including subsidy
reforms, which brought back the overall fiscal deficit to 4.9 percent in 2014, although public debt
continued to increase and reached 63.4 percent of GDP (against 58.3 percent in 2012). In 2015, there

MOROCCO

have been improvements, including a further reduction in subsidy spending, which was sufficient to
offset the lower–than-projected tax revenues and grants. Overall, the fiscal outturn through
September suggests that the authorities are on track to meet the projected annual deficit of
4.3 percent, corresponding to a primary balance that would stabilize public debt at a sustainable
level of less than 64 percent of GDP (Annex I).
5.
External stability has strengthened further. Staff analyses suggest that the exchange rate
of the dirham is in line with fundamentals, reflecting improvements in the external position over the
last two years (Annex II).3 The current account deficit narrowed further in 2015 and is projected to be
about 1.5 percent of GDP (against 5.7 percent of GDP in 2014), as low oil and food prices and the
good agricultural season reduced fuel and food import bills, while automobile exports and
remittances remained robust. Capital inflows are strong and stable, and external debt is relatively
low. International reserves have increased and represent about 110 percent of the Fund’s Assessing
Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric, and 154 percent of the metric adjusted for capital controls, at end2015. Morocco’s net international investment position started to improve in 2015: after deteriorating
from -50 to -67 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2014, it is projected to reach -64 percent of GDP
at end-2015 and -56 percent of GDP over the medium term. Overall competitiveness has
strengthened somewhat in recent years, with Morocco now being ranked at the median in the
sample of 140 countries included in the Global Competiveness Report (GCR).4
6.
Credit has remained subdued under stable policy rates and monetary conditions. BankAl-Maghrib (BAM) has kept its policy rate unchanged at 2.5 percent in recent months, taking into
consideration mixed economic developments, a moderate increase in inflation, and an uncertain
economic outlook. Banking liquidity has continued to improve due to increased foreign reserves and
the reduced fiscal deficit (bank liquidity needs were estimated at 30.4 billion dirhams in August
2015, against 69.2 billion dirhams at end 2013). While bank lending grew at a modest rate of
1.1 percent in September 2015 (year-on-year), there is no evidence that bank credit supply is a
significant constraint to credit growth, given the soundness of the banking system, continued slow
non-agricultural growth, and lower imports. Lending rates declined but other lending conditions
(including collateral requirements) remained tight, especially for corporations, in view of increased
credit risks. Acknowledging that the current economic environment could be particularly difficult for
very small, small and medium enterprises (VSMEs), BAM raised its support to VSME credit by
increasing its range of eligible collaterals and through the VSME funding support program.5
7.
Overall, the banking system is sound despite financial strains in parts of the corporate
sector. In recent years, Morocco’s banking system has deepened, with total bank assets reaching
140 percent of GDP, and become more complex, including through a rapid expansion in SubSaharan Africa. In aggregate, the regulatory capital adequacy ratio stood at 13.8 percent as of end3

The dirham is pegged to a currency basket including the euro (60 percent) and the dollar (40 percent).

4 Morocco ranks favorably in terms of quality of institutions, infrastructures and macroeconomic environment, but
lower in the areas of education, health and labor market efficiency.

2014, well above Basel III requirements, and bank profitability has been stable despite slow lending
activity. However, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has been rising since 2012, due to weak
economic activity and strains in parts of the corporate sector, reaching 7.5 percent in August 2015.
The highest NPL ratios are observed in sectors most affected by weak growth in Europe, such as
tourism (with a NPL ratio of 21 percent in the hotel and restaurant sector), as well as transport and
communications, agriculture, trade, and construction. Many corporations face liquidity difficulties
due to payment delays that affect their cash flow situation. A recent decree on public procurement
will limit payment delays by public enterprises to 60 days starting in January 2016.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Growth should strengthen gradually in the medium term. In 2016, growth will be
affected by a base effect following the good 2015 agricultural season, but a gradual recovery is
expected in 2017, supported by improving prospects in Europe and domestic confidence, and low
oil prices. Growth is expected to get close to 5 percent by 2020, slightly lower than estimated
previously. This revision reflects weaker global growth prospects due to lower capital stock growth
and potential output in many developed and emerging economies,6 which could affect capital
investment levels and productivity gains in Morocco. Staff and the authorities agreed that raising
potential growth and reducing unemployment will require steadfast efforts in a range of reform
areas, including human capital and labor participation, labor market efficiency, access to finance for
very small, small and medium enterprises, and the broader business environment.7 Headline inflation
is expected to remain low at 1.6 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent in 2016, and to stabilize around
2 percent thereafter.
9.
The external position is also expected to improve over the medium term. With oil prices
projected to remain low and external demand to strengthen, solid export performance (especially in
new and fast-growing industries such as automobiles) should help reduce the current account
deficit further to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016, and stabilize it around 1.3 percent of GDP over the
medium term. FDI inflows should remain strong, helping raise the reserves position above
150 percent of the ARA metric over the medium term.
10.
Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, but have decreased somewhat.
Staff and the authorities agreed that external risks include lower-than-expected growth in Europe,
volatility in global financial markets, and geopolitical risks resulting in oil price volatility. Weak
growth in Europe, in particular, would affect export revenues, and FDI and remittance inflows. Higher
volatility in global financial markets would affect global growth and Morocco’s growth and
borrowing costs. Given Morocco’s high dependence on oil imports, increases in oil prices may also
reverse some of the recent improvements in the current account. However, relative to 2014, oil
prices are now much lower and Europe’s growth outlook has improved. As such, the impact of the

above shocks would also be less severe than in 2014. On the domestic front, there is a risk of lower
appetite for reforms as the 2016 parliamentary elections loom.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Recent policy action and a more favorable external environment have yielded
macroeconomic improvements, but the reform momentum needs to be maintained in order
to secure longer term stability and raise growth potential (Box 1). Despite positive
developments in certain sectors (industry, energy, and telecommunication), there are still mixed
signals about non-agricultural growth and risks remain, in particular regarding future external
demand. Securing stronger buffers and raising potential growth while significantly reducing
unemployment and inequalities will require:


Maintaining an adequate policy stance;



Securing macro-financial sustainability;



Reinforcing monetary transmission;



Establishing a more growth-friendly and inclusive environment.

A. Policy Stance
12.
The authorities remain committed to their fiscal deficit objective of 4.3 percent of GDP
in 2015. As noted, a revenue shortfall of about 0.7 percent of GDP is expected for 2015, due mainly
to lower-than-anticipated grants from Gulf countries. However, the impact would be offset by the
significant under-spending expected due to continued wage bill control and reductions in subsidies
and transfers. Therefore, the authorities appear to be on track to meet 2015 deficit target. Staff
encouraged the authorities to engage with donors to secure the expected disbursements, and the
authorities were confident that they could achieve this before the end of 2015.
13.
The proposed 2016 budget continues the consolidation effort of previous years, based
on strong revenue performance and modest growth in current spending. The fiscal stance, as
measured by the structural fiscal deficit, will remain broadly neutral. The overall deficit is projected
to decline to 3.5 percent of GDP, in line with projections at the time of the second review of the PLL
arrangement. This would reflect a rapid growth in tax revenues (by more than 8 percent, or 0.6
percent of GDP), due mostly to the introduction of new corporate tax brackets (while new VAT
measures would induce a net loss of 0.3 percent of GDP). At the same time, current spending would
increase modestly (3.7 percent), as the authorities plan to further reduce subsidies while maintaining
a relatively rapid growth in public investment spending. Staff supported the 2016 budget objectives,
while noting that, like in 2015, the reliance on grant financing may require contingent measures to
control public expenditures. In this regard, the authorities noted that they had already identified the
sources of grant revenues for 2016 budget which should mitigate this risk.

MOROCCO

Box 1. Morocco: Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly in line with past Fund advice:
Fiscal policy. The authorities continued subsidy reform. The promulgation of a revised organic budget law
was a critical step in improving the fiscal framework; it will start being implemented with the 2016 budget.
Pension reform is now expected to be implemented in early 2017.
Monetary policy. Inflation remains low and inflation expectations are well-anchored. BAM has maintained
its main policy interest rates unchanged at 2.5 percent in 2015. Preparations for a more flexible exchange
rate have progressed, including with technical assistance from the Fund.
Financial policies. Solid progress has been made in upgrading the financial policy framework, including
moving to Basel III norms and implementing the new banking law. Most regulations to implement the new
banking law are expected to be in place by end-2015. The new central bank law has not yet been adopted.
Structural reforms. Morocco has made progress in Doing Business indicators, but much remains to be
done to further improve the business climate, competition, governance and transparency. Strengthening
further the functioning of the job market and the quality of education will be key in order to increase
competitiveness, growth, and employment.

14.
Given the existence of capital controls, the central bank has some room for maneuver
to conduct monetary policy under the exchange rate peg. In the second half of 2014, BAM
lowered its policy rate (unchanged since March 2012) by 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent, and has left it
unchanged since then. In recent months, as noted, BAM has continued to provide liquidity and
foster greater (V)SME access to credit, but such liquidity injections have been reduced overall, in line
with decreasing liquidity pressures (which, on current trends, may disappear in 2016). Going forward,
staff noted that in the baseline scenario, where the output gap closes only gradually, the current
monetary policy stance would remain appropriate. However, in addition to the large credit support
already provided by BAM, further monetary easing may be needed should non-agricultural growth
stall and reserves continue to improve, and as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored.
The authorities agreed but noted that BAM’s main objective is inflation, which had recently risen to
close to 2 percent, and that credit growth had not increased noticeably as a result of the last two
reductions in policy rates.

B. Securing Macro-Financial Sustainability
Public Finances
15.
While sustainable, Morocco’s public debt should be placed firmly on a downward path
and reduced to at most 60 percent of GDP over the medium term. Public debt rose from
47 percent of GDP in 2009 to 63.6 percent of GDP by end 2015, and is expected to peak at
64.4 percent of GDP in 2016. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that debt remains
sustainable and robust to various shocks

allow more fiscal space. Based on analyses
of the fiscal multiplier in Morocco (Box 2), staff noted that this would not significantly weaken
growth prospects.
16.
The above public debt path will require bringing the fiscal deficit down gradually to
about 2 percent of GDP by 2020. Following important reforms to rein in public spending in recent
years, consolidation going forward would have to rely more on structural tax measures, including
because grant revenues are expected to decline after 2017. Specifically:


Tax reforms. In line with recommendations from the 2013 national tax conference, the
authorities have initiated reforms to make the tax system more equitable and better able to
support competitiveness, as reflected in the 2016 budget proposal. Such reforms include
removing tax exemptions on large agricultural firms, simplifying the VAT regime, gradually
introducing progressivity in corporate taxation, and better enforcing tax payments from selfemployed and liberal professions. Staff supported these reforms, and encouraged the
authorities to pursue them expeditiously, as they could yield about 1.5–2 percent of GDP of
additional public revenues over the medium term.



Pension reform. Implementing the proposed parametric reform, as planned under the medium
term fiscal projections, remains urgent in order to extend the sustainability of the pension
system. Staff stressed the urgency of implementing this reform, since the gap between
contributions and benefits will continue to widen in the near term and, absent reform, could

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MOROCCO

exhaust pension reserves by 2022. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to this
reform, and expect that it will be approved soon and implemented at the beginning of 2017.8
Subsidies reforms. Subsidies on all liquid petroleum products (diesel, gasoline, fuel) have now
been eliminated, and the authorities plans to gradually reduce subsidies on food beginning in
2016. The timing of butane subsidies reduction is still under discussion. Staff welcomed these
plans while stressing the need to protect the most vulnerable populations from their impact. The
authorities agreed and noted that the reduction in fuel subsidies has been accompanied by an
expansion of social programs in health and education, and the introduction of a number of
mitigating programs.



Box 2. Fiscal Multiplier in Morocco1
Morocco’s strong policy action on wage bill containment and subsidies reforms contributed to reduce the
overall fiscal deficit from a peak of 7.3 percent in 2012 to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2014. This work assesses
the impact of such a fiscal deficit reduction on aggregate demand, looking at the effects of government
consumption on the economic activity.
Methodology
We estimated the size of fiscal multiplier for Morocco and explored factors explaining their magnitude.
Using the Ilzetzki et al. (2012) empirical approach based on quarterly data and the Blanchard and Perotti
(2002) structural identification methodology, we estimate a SVAR on government consumption, the GDP,
the trade balance and the reel effective exchange rate. We then use the SVAR impulse functions to assess
the size of fiscal multipliers (the change in the real GDP caused by one unit increase in the government
consumption). We mostly focus on the impact multiplier (i.e., the change in the GDP at the moment the
impulse to the government consumption occurs) and the cumulative multiplier (the change in the GDP over
the period the impulse to government consumption vanishes).
Main conclusions


Fiscal multipliers for Morocco are relatively small: the impact multiplier varies between 0.095 and
0.3, and the cumulative multiplier is estimated to be around 0.6.



The SVAR suggests that a government consumption shock would worsen the trade balance, lead
to real appreciation, and raise output. However, while the impacts on the trade balance and real
effective exchange rate are statistically significant, the impact on real GDP appears limited.



The magnitude of the fiscal multipliers could be affected by several factors, including the degree of
exchange rate flexibility, the openness of the economy, the monetary policy stance, and the public
debt level.



Household behaviors are critical in determining the size of fiscal multipliers. Specifically, a high
propensity to consume and import foreign goods dampens the impact of a government spending
shock on real GDP.



Overall, the analysis tends to suggest that well-designed fiscal consolidation (i.e., tilted to public
consumption) would reduce public debt with limited contractionary effect on growth.

17.
Ongoing institutional reforms remain critical to stronger fiscal outcomes, and the
decentralization initiative will need to be designed and implemented carefully. The new
organic budget law (OBL) will strengthen Morocco’s fiscal framework starting in 2016, since most of
its provisions enter into force in January 2016 (especially with regard to fiscal performance
management and transparency, and parliamentary approval process), and the remaining ones are
gradually introduced by 2020. The authorities confirmed that the OBL was being implemented
according to plan. In parallel, they are pursuing a major decentralization initiative that will lead to
transferring a range of political and administrative responsibilities to the regional level. Key
objectives are to increase efficiency in the allocation of public resources, improve governance, and
facilitate economic growth and poverty reduction. The proposed 2016 budget increases the
proportion of income tax revenues allocated to regions from 1 to 2 percent. Staff discussed the
authorities’ intentions and noted that while such reforms may yield benefits, they also entail
significant risks, including from a fiscal standpoint.9 Staff also noted that Morocco could benefit
from cross-country experience in terms of key requirements, such as for coordination between
different governmental levels, tax collection, spending and debt controls, and local implementation
capacity and accountability. The authorities were well aware of the risks associated with fiscal
decentralization, and welcomed staff suggestion to provide Fund TA support in the above areas.
Financial Stability
18.
The FSAP assessed that risks to financial stability are limited, although rising NPL
levels and concentration risks need to be monitored. Banks are well capitalized and profitable,
and benefit from stable funding sources. FSAP stress tests show that aggregate capitalization levels
would remain adequate under adverse scenarios, and that, at this juncture, spillover risks related to
Moroccan banks’ expansion into SSA remain marginal.10 However, as noted, NPLs have been rising
(although NPL provisioning levels, averaging 66 percent, are high), and concentration risks arising
from single or group exposures are significant. Staff emphasized some of the key FSAP
recommendations regarding the need to continue monitoring bank asset quality closely, including
through periodic comprehensive asset quality reviews for systemic banks, a review of national loan
classification and provisioning rules, and an impact study of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) implementation (Table 8). The authorities noted that they were in the process of
gradually reducing overall levels of concentration risk in the system, broadening the coverage of
their NPL “watchlists,” and increasing related bank provisioning requirements.
19.
Bank supervision is effective and has kept improving, but will require more resources
going forward. A new banking law was introduced in 2014, further implementing Basel III, and
enhancing systemic risk surveillance. While a lot of progress has been made, there is still room for
improvement in the following areas:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MOROCCO



Central bank law. The draft law, which is being discussed in the government and has yet to be
sent to Parliament for adoption, would further strengthen BAM’s independence and
transparency, and extend its supervisory powers, in line with best international practices. Staff
encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously, and the authorities indicated that the draft
law would likely be submitted to Parliament in early 2016.



Supervisory resources. BAM needs additional supervisory resources in order to effectively
handle its existing and new responsibilities, especially given the increasing complexity and cross
border expansion of Morocco’s banking system. The authorities endorsed the FSAP
recommendation and noted that they already have plans to reinforce supervisory resources.



Macroprudential policy framework. The 2014 banking law set up a macroprudential policy
committee, the Systemic Risk Surveillance and Coordination Committee (CCSRS) in which BAM
plays a leading role. However, the powers, instruments and voting arrangements of the CCSRS
need to be clarified. In addition, a counter-cyclical buffer should be implemented, and the
current toolkit should include targeted sectoral instruments such as provisioning requirements
or loss-given-default floors for risky and nonperforming cross-border loans. The authorities
agreed with these recommendations and have started implementing them.



Financial crisis management and safety net. Significant progress has been made in improving
the institutional framework, but the new banking resolution regime remains untested and its
legal framework needs to be strengthened, including by designating a resolution authority,
incorporating the “least-cost” principle, introducing bail-in powers, and clarifying the hierarchy
of creditors’ claims. The emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) framework should also be
enhanced. The authorities intend to seek technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank in
these areas.

C. Reinforcing Monetary Policy Transmission
20.
The authorities reiterated their intention to move to a new exchange rate and
monetary policy regime. A more flexible regime would help absorb external shocks and preserve
competitiveness. The improved external and reserves position, together with the insurance provided
by the PLL arrangement, would allow Morocco to move from a position of strength and to ensure a
gradual transition. While not without risks in a global context of volatile financial conditions, staff
and the authorities agreed that the current situation was appropriate for a move (Box 3):


14

The key requirements are in place: economic and external diversification has progressed and
Morocco could benefit from a more independent monetary policy (i.e., less aimed at targeting
the exchange rate); fiscal, monetary and financial policy frameworks have been strengthened
(including through recent subsidy reforms); and the dirham’s alignment with fundamentals
reduces the risk of a large adjustment. The Fund has contributed to the preparations through
intensive technical support, including for a move to an inflation targeting regime.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MOROCCO



The economy is seen as resilient to potential exchange rate volatility. The FSAP analyses
indicate that the direct effect of a dirham depreciation would be positive as banks have a
positive FX open position. The indirect effects on credit quality are also likely to be limited
because the share of foreign currency loans in total loans is below 4 percent (and some foreign
currency borrowers hedge their foreign currency exposures).



Options for a gradual transition. In staff’s view, the authorities could choose among several
options, such as a horizontal band to be widened gradually (possibly in several steps); or a
flexible band (moving up or down depending for example on the authorities’ required balance in
supply and demand in the FX market). The latter option is more robust to different scenarios as
it allows movements in both directions, depending in particular on market pressures. Staff will
continue to support the authorities in implementing their preferred option. Staff also
recommended decoupling the exchange rate transition from the removal of remaining
restrictions on capital outflows by residents, which would add unnecessary uncertainty.

21.
As part of the transition to a new monetary regime, continued financial market
deepening will help further improve monetary policy transmission. Under a more flexible
exchange rate regime, the monetary policy transmission mechanisms would play a key role in
supporting the authorities’ objectives of price and macro-economic stability. Reforms in the last
decade led to enhanced independence and operational capacity of the central bank, stronger
financial intermediation, and more developed domestic Treasury securities market.11 This also
allowed to improve monetary policy transmission, including by helping better align the policy rate
and the money market rate (Box 4). Going forward, ongoing deepening of domestic capital markets
will help bring about further improvements in monetary transmission.

Box 3. Morocco: Transition Toward a More Flexible Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy
Framework
This Box summarizes the main steps already taken by the authorities and the preparatory work contributed
by the Fund to help the authorities finalize their plans on the next steps in the transition toward greater
exchange rate flexibility.
Morocco meets the necessary preconditions


Supportive macroeconomic policies. Fiscal, monetary and financial frameworks have been
strengthened (such as, recently, through subsidy reform) and would be supportive of a move
toward more flexibility.



Foreign exchange market. As the dirham is pegged to a EUR/USD basket rather than to a single
currency, changes in bilateral rates have already incentivized banks and corporations to put in place
systems to manage exchange risk. An active foreign exchange market has already developed as
result.



Operational exchange rate management. Options in designing a policy framework for foreign
exchange market interventions and operational management were extensively discussed during
past Fund technical assistance.



Operational framework for monetary policy. An alternative anchor to the exchange rate is in
place to some extent: BAM’s use of interest rate instruments and its focus on inflation have already
led economic agents to focus on inflation rather than the exchange rate. The Fund has provided
technical assistance to help BAM in strengthening its macro modeling capacity; building a new
forecasting and policy analysis system; and using the models for macroeconomic projections, policy
advice, and communications with the public and financial markets.

The move is not without risks, but risks appear contained and manageable

16



Pass-through. The potential pass-through of exchange rate movements to consumer prices is
expected to be relatively low on average. Staff estimated at end 2013 that such pass-through
elasticity was about 0.25 in the short term and 0.18 in the long term.



Banks. The direct effect of a 30 percent dirham depreciation on bank balance sheets would be
positive because banks have more FX assets than liabilities. The indirect effects on credit quality are
also likely to be limited because the share of foreign currency loans in total loans in the economy is
below 4 percent (and foreign currency borrowers may hedge their FX exposures).



Public debt: Public debt is sustainable and its foreign currency denominated share is limited (and
actively managed in terms of currency and interest rate structure), and therefore it does not
constitute a major source of risks.



Capital outflows: Greater exchange rate flexibility is unlikely to lead to large-scale capital outflows
due to the existence of capital controls limiting the ability of residents to convert dirham balances
into foreign currency or to move funds offshore.

Box 4. The Yield Curve in Morocco: Links with Macroeconomic Policies1
The monetary policy framework and fiscal policy actions in Morocco have evolved over time and their
impact on the economy is transmitted in particular through the yield curve. This work documents such
dynamics in Morocco and draw relevant policy implications.
We analyzed the relation between macroeconomic policies and the yield curve in Morocco.
Changes in the monetary policy framework and reforms of the government security market in the
mid-2000s have made the yield curve more responsive to macroeconomic policies. Using a NelsonSiegel model, we derived the factors that characterize the yield curve. We then used a vector autoregression (VAR) model to explore the link between the factors of the yield curve and different
variables of macroeconomic policy.
Main conclusions and policy lessons:


Improvements in the monetary policy and fiscal/debt management frameworks have help improved
the functioning of the government securities market, as demonstrated by the tighter range of
interest rates at short and long maturities.



The VAR estimation suggests that policy transmission channels work properly. Monetary policy
autonomy has been enhanced by the improved credibility of the central bank.



Improvements in the fiscal position result in improvements in the financial sector, lower interest
rates and higher growth, albeit with a delay.



Financial deepening would improve monetary policy transmission.



Overall, the monetary policy framework should keep improving so as to reinforce the credibility of
the central bank, particularly as Morocco contemplates a move to a flexible exchange rate regime.

“Dynamics of the Yield Curve in Morocco: Links with Macroeconomic Variables,” by Ahokpossi, Garcia-Martinez, and
Kemoe, forthcoming IMF Working Paper.

D. More Growth-Friendly and Inclusive Environment
22.
High youth unemployment results in part from shortcomings in the quality of
education, and more efficient public spending could help reach better outcomes. Increases in
public spending on education have been substantial over the last decade. However, the quality of
education (as measured by students’ scores at international tests) is lagging behind many emerging
countries, and skills mismatches are widely recognized as a key factor behind the large level of
unemployment.12 Moroccan students’ results are lower than in other countries spending equivalent
amount of public resources in education, raising an efficiency issue.13 The authorities shared staff’s
assessment that large efficiency gains in public spending can be achieved and help reduce this gap
significantly. Staff highlighted in particular the following priorities:

Croissance du Maroc; Sutherland, D., Price, R., and Gonand, F. (2009), Improving Public Spending Efficiency in Primary
and Secondary Education, OECD.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MOROCCO



Institutional quality and governance: By better defining responsibilities between the central
government and sub-national authorities, decentralization reforms may help reduce the
inefficiency of public spending. The authorities should manage financial and human resources,
and strengthen the allocation of public spending in accordance with the differing educational
needs across regions. In this respect, transfers of competences to local authorities should be
supported by proper incentive systems.



Budget management: Increasing managerial autonomy in budget implementation would also
improve the adequacy of resources allocation through more flexible job status, wage-setting
process, budget allocation and teaching methods. At the school level, it would enhance
decision-making autonomy and assessment policies concerning student performance, and allow
for benchmarking between schools.

Public spending in education is substantial and is among

Morocco’s business environment has been improving, but much remains to be done to
diversify the economy and increase its competitiveness. Efforts have been made to simplify
administrative procedures (such as for customs transactions, property registration, and enterprise
creation), and to limit payment delays in the public sector. In October 2015, Morocco’s ranking in
the 2016 World Bank’s Doing Business indicators improved to 75 (against 80 in 2015). Nevertheless,
in addition to the above, key reforms need to be implemented in order to improve the business
climate and unlock growth potential, especially: improving labor market regulation; reducing
government bureaucracy; improving transparency and addressing corruption; and strengthening the
judiciary system (including procedures to address chronic payment delays). The authorities noted
that they were pursuing further reforms in a number of the above areas, including through a
national strategy to fight corruption, which was about to be launched.
24.
Significant challenges remain regarding access to financial services for small firms. As
noted in the FSAP, Morocco has achieved notable progress since 2007, but lack of financial access is
still a constraint for (V)SMEs, which represent 90 percent of total firms. For example, only about
35 percent of firms use banks to finance investment. In response, BAM set up special refinancing
mechanisms in 2012 and 2013 which helped increase the provision of (V)SME finance by banks: the
share of total credit allocated to (V)SMEs increased from 33 percent in 2012 to 37 percent in 2014—
a level significantly better than the MENA region average of less than 10 percent. However, (V)SMEs
still encounter numerous administrative difficulties and tighter conditions in their access to credit.
Staff welcomed plans to improve the availability of credit information (such as through better quality
data from credit bureaus), and noted that other conditions, including expeditious judicial
procedures, were essential. The authorities indicated that they were about to set up a national
observatory for (V)SMEs and to modernize the legal framework for securities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
A sound policy framework and prudent macroeconomic management have helped the
economy respond to shocks, but challenges remain. Structural reforms, including in the area of
subsidies, have improved the resilience of economy, and positioned the budget to benefit from low
oil prices in 2015. The development of new industrial sectors has supported strong export growth.
However, growth performance in 2015 was hampered by a slower-than-expected recovery in Europe
and reduced tourism activity due to geopolitical risks. Going forward, growth prospects will continue
to be subject to these uncertainties.
26.
Raising Morocco’s growth potential will require continued efforts to improve job
creation and inclusiveness. Morocco’s growth potential may have declined somewhat, in line with
lower global growth prospects in developed and emerging economies. However, continued efforts
to address youth unemployment, increase labor force participation rates, reduce the gender gap
and social and regional disparities, are crucial to achieve more inclusive growth and higher potential
output. In particular, improving access to quality education and literacy rates, widely recognized as
key factors behind the high level of unemployment, is critical to reduce skills mismatches and
support the diversification of the economy and its insertion in global value chains.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27.
The external position has improved, but risks remain and will require stronger buffers.
The current account continues to improve, helped mostly by strong export and lower oil imports.
This, along with strong capital inflows, has resulted in a substantial rebuilding of international
reserves. Nevertheless, the economy remains vulnerable to global conditions, notably the risk of a
protracted period of slow growth in Europe or oil price volatility. Therefore, it is important that the
authorities continue implementing reforms to strengthen external and fiscal buffers and
competitiveness, and increase the resilience of the economy.
28.
The current macroeconomic policy mix consisting of tighter fiscal policy and
accommodative monetary policy is appropriate. The fiscal deficit is expected to further decline in
2015 as subsidy expenditures are contained. At the same time, there are uncertainties about grant
revenues in the remainder of 2015, which may require some corrective measures. As the economy
continues to recover, the expected fiscal adjustment for 2016 is gradual and appropriate. Since
inflation expectations are well-anchored, monetary policy could potentially help support credit
expansion and economic growth, should inflation decline further, and taking into account potential
risks.
29.
Going forward, further fiscal consolidation will be needed to reduce public debt
gradually, and will require steadfast implementation of the authorities’ reform agenda. Public
debt is sustainable, but remains relatively high, and a commitment to bring it down to at most
60 percent of GDP over the medium term is desirable to create the fiscal space needed to increase
social and growth-enhancing capital expenditures. The corresponding medium term fiscal
consolidation would be progressive and not detrimental to growth. In order to achieve it, the
authorities should further reduce subsidies, complete pension reform, continue to contain the public
wage bill, and rely more on structural tax measures. The regionalization process should proceed with
care, as international experiences indicate that it is often associated with adverse fiscal implications.
30.
Measures should be taken to improve the efficiency of public spending on education,
where Morocco lags comparable countries. Although public spending on education is among the
highest among all countries, Moroccan students’ scores in international tests are below comparable
countries, and important efficiency gains can be achieved in the allocation of public resources. In
particular, education quality could improve, with the same amount of resources, though better
government spending management, improved governance and reduced corruption, and stronger
focus on teachers’ training.
31.
Morocco could now transition gradually, and from a position of strength, toward
greater exchange rate flexibility. The authorities’ intention to move to a new exchange rate and
monetary policy regime is welcome, as a more flexible exchange rate would help the economy
absorb external shocks and preserve competitiveness. In light of the improved external and reserves
position, and with key policy and operational requirements in place, the current situation is
appropriate for a move. As part of the transition, continued financial market deepening will help
bring about further improvements in monetary policy transmission and support the authorities’
objectives of price and macro-economic stability. The adoption of the new statute of BAM would
also help further strengthen the central bank independence.

32.
The 2015 FSAP assessed that risks to financial stability are limited, but rising NPL
levels and concentration risks need to be monitored. Banks are well capitalized and profitable,
and benefit from stable funding sources. Given that rising NPL levels and concentration risks arising
from single or group exposures are significant, continued monitoring of bank asset quality is
required. The authorities’ recent efforts to tighten bank regulation on concentration risks and to
strengthen bank provisioning requirements are welcome. More broadly, considerable progress has
been achieved in strengthening the financial sector policy framework, including the new banking law
introduced in 2014, and enhanced systemic risk surveillance. Going forward, supervisory resources
will need to increase in order for BAM to effectively handle its expanding responsibilities; new tools
will be needed to support the new macroprudential policy framework; and the institutional
framework for financial crisis management will need to be strengthened.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
staff’s view). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff’s views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
Note: Colored boxes on the left hand side represent shock likelihood and colored boxes on the right hand side represent severity of
impact. Red = High, Yellow = Medium and Green = Low.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Morocco’s public debt remains sustainable. While the gross debt-to-GDP ratio declined between 2000
and 2010, external shocks and domestic factors have caused the ratio to rise again since then.
Nevertheless, at about 63 percent of GDP at end-2014, public debt remains sustainable, and the DSA
shows it to be resilient to various shocks. Vulnerabilities linked to the debt’s level and profile appear
moderate for the most part. However, gross financing needs have been high (mainly linked to the
rollover of existing debt), and have exceeded the benchmark of 15 percent of GDP over the past three
years, highlighting some risks despite a relatively moderate debt level.
1.
This DSA updates the analysis conducted for the second review of the current
arrangement under the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The overall analysis remains
largely unchanged, and public debt remains sustainable. A slight downward revision to the real
output growth projections during 2015–20 has not affected the debt-to-GDP ratio significantly
given that the authorities maintain their deficit target for 2017 unchanged, and intend to put the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path over the medium-term.
2.
After declining in the previous decade, Morocco’s public debt-to-GDP ratio started
rising in 2010 as macroeconomic performance deteriorated. Rising international commodity
prices contributed to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, mainly through higher food and fuel
subsidies, and public debt rose from 48 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 63 percent in 2014. About
half of this increase occurred in 2012, when the economy was most affected by the crisis in Europe
(Morocco’s main trade partner) and higher oil prices, and the authorities encountered difficulties in
containing the fiscal deficit. However, the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to
help bring the debt ratio down toward 60 percent of GDP in the medium term.
3.
Public debt is generally resilient to shocks, but there are risks linked to financing
needs and, to a lesser extent, to shocks to growth and the primary balance (heat map below).
Baseline projections are realistic when compared to a group of market access countries. Morocco’s
projected fiscal consolidation efforts, aimed at lowering the overall deficit below 3 percent of GDP in
the medium term, do not appear exceptional relative to the distribution of other country cases. The
debt level remains below the debt burden benchmark of 70 percent of GDP for emerging markets
when various shocks are assumed, except in cases of shocks to real GDP growth or to the primary
balance. Vulnerabilities linked to the profile of debt are mostly moderate, except for an exceptional
increase in short-term debt in 2013—however, short term debt still represents a very small part of
total debt (about 5 percent). Relevant indicators exceed the lower early-warning benchmarks but
not the upper risk assessment benchmarks (chart). Gross financing needs of about 17 percent of
GDP exceed the benchmark of 15 percent in 2014, but are expected to decline under this benchmark
in 2015. The investment base, mostly composed of local investors (many of which long term
investors) also mitigates risks from gross financing needs. Nonetheless, these risks highlight the
importance of continuing on the path of fiscal consolidation to reduce debt-financed deficits, and of
carefully managing the maturity profile of public debt.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
External stability has further strengthened in 2015 as the current account has improved, external debt
has remained low and the reserve position has strengthened. However, challenges remain as the
global economic environment remains fragile.
Improvements in the current account over the last few years have brought the exchange rate
back in line with its fundamentals (Box 1). The External Balance Assessment, based on 2015 data,
indicates that the dirham is broadly in line with fundamentals. The current account method shows
that the current account gap relative to norm is 0.6 percent of GDP, corresponding to an
undervaluation of about 2.0 percent of the dirham, and the external sustainability method indicates
an undervaluation of 11.7 percent.1 However, the Real Effective Exchange Rate method shows an
overvaluation of 9.1 percent of the dirham.2 Overall, the first two methods, which were used in past
reports, have shown significant realignment of the dirham with fundamentals over the last two
years. On balance, staff estimates that the dirham is now in line with fundamentals.
The external position continues to improve. Reserves in months of prospective imports of goods
and services are projected to rise from 6.1 months at end-2014 to 6.7 at end-2015. This is equivalent
to reserves rising from 94.2 percent of the Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric at end-2014 to
110.7 percent of the metric at end-2015 (153.8 percent of the metric when factoring in existing
capital account restrictions). External debt is sustainable and is projected to reach 32.5 percent of
GDP at end-2015 before gradually declining to 29.0 percent of GDP over the medium term.
However, a 30-percent depreciation would result in a significant increase in debt relative to GDP.
Capital flows have remained strong, and
Morocco’s net international investment liability
position started to improve in 2015. FDI flows
are robust and are supporting the development of
new export sectors as well as the real estate
sector. In recent years, portfolio flows are
dominated by the government bond issuances
and those by the national phosphate company
(including €1 billion Eurobonds in April 2015). At
the same time, the strengthening reserve position,
which is expected to continue in the mediumterm, has helped improve the international

1 This result is sensitive to the NFA benchmark used. In this case, the benchmark is the actual 2014 NFA of 66 percent of GDP, which is arguably too loose as the NFA has deteriorated substantially over the last few years.
However, even using a more conservative NFA, such as that at the beginning of the first PLL program (-58 percent),
the overall assessment would not change.

This approach was not estimated for Morocco in the past because of the lack of data on the home bias variable
(share of domestic debt detained by residents/non-residents). The limited time series used for the estimation this
time may affect the robustness of the results.

investment liability position: after deteriorating from -50 percent of GDP in 2010 to -67 percent of
GDP in 2014, it is projected to decline to -64 at end-2015 and -56 percent of GDP over the mediumterm.
Challenges remain as the global economic environment remains fragile. While oil prices are
low, risk of higher oil price volatility remain substantial, and such volatility would adversely affect
Morocco’s current account and reserve positions. In addition, if stress reemerges in advanced
countries and growth disappoints in the Euro Area, Moroccan exports, remittances and tourism
would be lower. Volatility in international financial markets would also limit the opportunity the
Moroccan sovereign and private sector to borrow at a low cost in the international markets. All
these risks suggest that the authorities should continue their effort to strengthen the resilience of
the economy to external shocks. In particular, more should be done on the front of subsidies reform,
the diversification of energy sources, and the diversification of the export products and destinations.

Box 1. Morocco: Exchange Rate Assessment
The EBA indicates that the dirham is in line with its fundamentals. The Current Account (CA) approach
of the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology points to a current account gap of 0.6 percent
of GDP (as compared to 3.0 for the 2014 assessment). This is equivalent to an undervaluation of the dirham
by 2 percent. The External Sustainability (ES) approach indicates an 11.7 percent undervaluation of the
dirham, while the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) approach shows an overvaluation of 9.1 percent.
While the results indicate a rebalancing of the exchange rate, which was assessed as overvalued in past
years, the improvement needs to be sustained by continued reduction of the fiscal and health policies gaps
(as shown by the CA approach).

Box 2. Morocco: External Stress Index
Overall assessment. The external stress index for Morocco indicates that the external pressure faced by
the country has abated in recent years. However, as shown in the downside scenario, external risks remain
substantial for Morocco.

Background. The external stress index is an indicator of the evolution of the external environment faced by
a particular country.1 The index is based on: (i) a consideration of the key external risks facing Morocco;
(ii) the selection of proxy variables capturing these risks; and (iii) the choice of the weights to apply to each
of these variables.
Risks. The main external risks for Morocco, as explained in detail in the 2014 PLL arrangement request and
further updated according to the latest Global Risk Assessment Matrix (G-RAM), are (i) a structurally weak
growth in key advanced economies, in particular the Euro area, resulting in lower exports, FDI, tourism and
remittances; (ii) an increase in volatility of energy prices due to uncertainty about the persistence of the oil
supply shock and the underlying drivers of the price decline; and (iii) tighter or more volatile global
financial conditions.2
Variables. (i) Lower exports, FDI and remittances from Europe are captured by growth in the Euro area, the
main trading partner of Morocco (representing more than 50 percent of trade, FDI and remittances); (ii)
higher oil imports are captured by oil prices; and (iii) the impact of global financial volatility on Morocco are
proxied by the emerging markets volatility index (VXEEM).
Weights. We used a data-based approach to determine the weight of each variable. Under this method,
weights are determined by the economic size of the respective balance of payments items that are
vulnerable to respective risks, relative to the overall size of the economy.

Baseline scenario. The baseline projections are based on WEO baseline projections for growth in Europe
and oil prices. The VXEEM is assumed unchanged from its level of September 14, 2015.
Downside scenario. The downside scenario is in line with those from the most recent IMF spillover reports.
The 2013 spillover report estimates that a slowdown in the euro area could result in the GDP level in the
euro area being 4 percent below baseline after four years. The 2014 spillover report estimates that
geopolitical crises could result in oil prices being 25 percent above baseline.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain restrictions
relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN
Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with
Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the
exchange rate within its target range, defined around a fixed central rate. Morocco has a
conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies comprising the euro and the U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 60 percent
and 40 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value
of the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international
exchange markets. As of November 9, 2015, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 13.74.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on February 23, 2015. The discussions for the 2015 consultation were held in Rabat
and Casablanca during October 21–November 4, 2015.

Safeguard assessment
An update of the 2013 safeguards assessment of the BAM, completed in January 2015, found that
the safeguards framework at the BAM remains relatively strong. The Board continues to be engaged
and governance arrangements are supported by strong internal audit and risk management
functions. A new law on BAM statutes that would lead to sustained good governance practices and
autonomy remain in progress. In this regard, the authorities prepared draft amendments to the
central bank law, and progress is underway to strengthen financial reporting practices.

Morocco—Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
(As of November 25, 2015)

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
December 14, 2015
The Moroccan authorities thank staff for the fruitful exchange during the Article IV
Consultation discussions and the FSAP mission, and broadly agree with their assessment
and recommendations. In a still difficult external environment characterized by slow
growth in the euro area and regional insecurity problems affecting tourism and investor
confidence, the authorities continue to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen the
foundations for stronger, private sector-led, and more inclusive and job-rich growth. In
this regard, they remain firmly committed to maintaining macroeconomic and financial
stability and further rebuilding fiscal and external buffers through sound policies,
strengthening of the policy framework, and further advancing the structural reform
agenda.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
The macroeconomic situation continues to improve. Growth in 2015 is estimated at
4.7 percent, reflecting a record cereal crop and a modest recovery in nonagricultural
production. After a decline in growth in 2016 with the return to more normal weather
conditions, ongoing strengthening of the euro area economy and continued reforms to
enhance productivity and potential output along with improved confidence would
improve the outlook, with Morocco’s growth expected to accelerate gradually to average
5 percent over the medium term. Average inflation is projected to remain low at
1.6 percent in 2015 and to stabilize thereafter at about 2 percent. The current account
deficit is projected to decline to 1.5 percent of GDP (from 5.7 percent in 2014 and
9.5 percent in 2012) and remain broadly at this level over the medium term. Reserves
continue to strengthen and should reach the equivalent of 6.7 months of imports of goods
and services, 111 percent of the normal ARA metric and 154 percent of the adjusted
ARA metric by end-2015, as against 6.1 months, 94 and 130 percent, respectively, in
2014. It is expected that reserves accumulation would continue over the medium term.
The significant improvement in the external position in 2015 owes much to the decline in
oil and food prices and lower cereal imports, notwithstanding lower tourism receipts. It
also reflects continued strong phosphates and automobiles exports and workers’
remittances, as well as robust FDI, which financed 160 percent of the current account
deficit. As a result, the external debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 29.6 percent in 2014 to
29.2 percent. It is expected that the external position will continue to strengthen and
external vulnerabilities to decline as a result of the ongoing diversification of the
economy, with emergence of new dynamic export-oriented sectors, and strengthening of
traditional ones under the sector-specific development strategies recently adopted.

Despite this favorable economic performance, the high level of unemployment, in
particular for the youth and new graduates, remains a concern. Further, labor force
participation is low, especially for women. Moreover, while significant progress has been
made in improving human development indicators and reducing poverty and inequality,
much remains to be done in this area, including in reducing regional inequality and
empowering women and the underprivileged groups of the population.
Fiscal Developments and Policy
The authorities remain firmly committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability. They
intend to continue with fiscal consolidation to achieve their 3 percent of GDP deficit
target in 2017 by further strengthening the tax system and improving expenditure
prioritization. Fiscal developments so far in 2015 are broadly in line with the
achievement of the 4.3 percent of GDP deficit target. Despite the tax revenue shortfall,
resulting from slower-than-expected nonagricultural growth, and lower grants, the
authorities are confident that lower subsidy and wage spending, along with stronger
revenue mobilization effort and tighter monitoring of other expenditures would help
maintain the deficit within target.
The 2016 draft budget seeks a further reduction of the deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP. It
contains a number of new revenue generating measures, including further steps in tax
reform to simplify the system and improve its performance in line with the
recommendations of the 2013 Assises Fiscales. It also maintains a prudent expenditure
policy, including on wages and subsidies, despite the complexity of the task in an election
year, which attests to the authorities’ strong resolve to pursue fiscal consolidation. In this
regard, the authorities are firmly determined to adopt the pension reform in 2016, with
implementation to start under the 2017 budget.
After its sharp increase during 2008–13, public debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilized since
2014 at 63-64 percent and should start declining in 2017 to reach 60 percent by 2020,
reflecting continued fiscal consolidation. In addition, debt management continues to be
improved to extend maturities and reduce costs, including through prudent borrowing
policies, careful balance between domestic and external borrowing, and mitigation of
interest rate and exchange rate risks.
Selected Issues Paper
The authorities thank staff for the papers and the presentations in Rabat. On Fiscal
Multipliers, the paper finds that they are small in Morocco as in other EMDCs. However,
the assessment was made for a period during which the economy was close to potential,
whereas it is now at below potential. As highlighted by Olivier Blanchard and Daniel
Leigh in WP/13/1, “fiscal multipliers associated with government spending can fluctuate

from being near zero in normal times to about 2.5 during recessions.” Therefore, the
paper’s conclusion that reducing public consumption would not affect growth may need
further substantiation. Moreover, it would have been useful to expand the analysis to tax
and investment multipliers in addition to those on public consumption.
On Efficiency of Spending on Education in Morocco, the paper recognizes that staff
findings are consistent with the authorities’ own diagnosis on the education system. A
strategic vision for education reform was announced in May this year, after several years
of diagnostics and discussions by a high level and broadly representative committee.
Several of the recommendations in the staff paper are also part of the strategy, including
improving efficiency and governance as well as teachers’ training. Other issues are of a
more complex nature, including reforming programs, curricula, pedagogical methods and
teachers’ ethics. A framework law (loi-cadre) will soon be prepared to formulate the
objectives of the reform strategy and the roadmap for its implementation. This being said,
the task of reforming education is a very complex one, in view of the various
constituencies involved and the long time horizon for reaching measurable results, and it
is important to garner broad support to the reform to maximize the likelihood of its
success.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
In an environment of improving bank liquidity and modest credit growth, Bank Al
Maghrib has continued its accommodative policy and support to Very Small, Small and
Medium-Sized Enterprises (V-SMEs). In this regard, it is the authorities’ view that while
lending conditions have tightened as indicated in page 5 of the staff report, this was true
for some but not all sectors of the economy. The next meeting of BAM’s Council later
this month will provide the opportunity to reassess the policy stance in light of
developments in inflation and economic activity and related risks
The authorities agree with staff assessment that the small overvaluation estimated in
recent years has been corrected and that the exchange rate is now in line with
fundamentals. They are thankful to staff from MCM, Research, and MCD for their
technical assistance and advice in assessing the conditions and preparing for a transition
to a more flexible exchange rate regime and a new monetary policy framework. They
broadly agree with staff assessment that current conditions are propitious for such a
move, although additional work is needed to prepare private economic agents to this
important transition. The authorities intend to build on staff extensive work and thorough
discussions to finalize and reach consensus on an action plan in this area.

Financial Sector Developments and Policies
The recent Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) attests to the soundness and
resilience of the banking sector, the progress made in financial inclusion, and the
continued improvement in regulation and supervision in line with best international
practices. A new Banking Law was adopted in 2014, enhancing systemic risk
surveillance, and Basel III capital and liquidity requirements have been implemented.
The FSSA also highlights BAM’s efforts to strengthen oversight of cross-border
activities of Moroccan banks and improve coordination with host countries’ supervisors,
and finds that risks from such activities to the Moroccan banking system are limited. The
draft central bank law is at the last stage of finalization before its submission to the
government, which should happen soon. The new law should strengthen central bank
independence, governance, and supervisory powers and expand its mandate to include
contribution to financial stability.
The authorities broadly agree with the FSAP findings and recommendations. In his letter
to the Financial Counselor and Director of MCM last month, the Minister of Economy
and Finance reiterated the authorities’ appreciation for the high quality work and
pertinent recommendations and announced the creation of a committee grouping all
financial sector regulators with the task of drawing a roadmap for implementation of
these recommendations. The Minister also requested Fund technical assistance in the
areas of bank resolution, crisis management, macroprudential oversight and financial
inclusion.
Structural Reforms
Along with continued strengthening of the policy framework, the authorities are
cognizant of the crucial importance of further improving the business climate, reducing
labor market
rigidities, upgrading human resources, and ensuring equal access to quality public
services and financing, including for women. Implementation of the new Organic Budget
Law adopted in June 2015 will significantly strengthen the fiscal framework through a
fiscal rule and multi-year and results-based budgeting, enhance public financial
management and monitoring of fiscal policy, including by increasing transparency and
accountability, and help address remaining vulnerabilities in the budget process. The
Advanced Regionalization Program will be implemented starting in 2016. This program
aims at enhancing project selection and monitoring through budget devolution to elected
regional assemblies and promoting local resource mobilization. If well-designed, it could
contribute significantly to improving spending efficiency in a number of key areas,
including health and education, and reduce regional disparities.

Several reforms toward enhancing the business climate and improving governance have
been implemented over the past few years, which contributed to improving Morocco’s
rating under the Doing Business Indicators. In the fiscal area, in addition to the tax
measures aimed at reducing informality and distortions in the tax system and simplifying
procedures, a decree was adopted earlier this year to provide for timely reimbursement of
accumulated VAT credits which hinder the development of several businesses. A new
law on public-private partnerships was adopted, which should strengthen private sector
involvement in infrastructure development projects, while limiting risks to the budget in
line with best international practices. A new law was adopted in June establishing an
agency in charge of initiating, coordinating and overseeing government policies with
regard to preventing and fighting corruption and promoting good governance. The new
Prices and Competition Law and the Competition Council Law became effective this year
with the adoption of the relevant decrees, which should help create an enabling
environment for improved efficiency and productivity. In this regard, after elimination of
all subsidies to liquid petroleum products by end-2014, prices of these products were
fully liberalized at end-November 2015, as scheduled.
The authorities are cognizant of the key role of enhancing labor market flexibility and
improving education and training in reducing skill mismatches and promoting
employment. A national employment strategy has been announced recently, which would
help coordinate government actions in this area. Discussions on labor code reform have
been held with social partners, and are still ongoing. In the meantime, the authorities are
strengthening active labor market policies, with focus on training, reducing hiring costs,
and providing incentives to self-employment and very small enterprises. In this regard
vocational training programs under the OFPPT, and the active role played by the
employment intermediation agency (ANAPEC) throughout the country are helping
increase the employability of young job seekers.
Social Inclusion
The authorities pay particular attention to social inclusion and reducing inequality in their
development strategy. Implementation of various programs under the National Initiative
for Human Development (INDH) has benefitted close to 10 million people since its
inception in 2005, with an aggregate cost of $3 billion (of which 60 percent from the
INDH). These programs aim at strengthening capacity, facilitating access to
infrastructure and basic services, and promoting income generating activities. The
authorities continue to expand the coverage of and strengthen resources for social
protection programs under the Social Cohesion Fund, including the TAYSSIR
(conditional transfers for education) and RAMED (basic health coverage) programs, as
well as the recently-established assistance to widows in a precarious situation and persons
with special needs. Moreover, a multiyear rural development program with a total cost of
$5 billion was announced in July, aimed at better integrating remote areas to the rest of

the country through rural roads and other infrastructure and enhancing the provision of
basic services. The efficiency and targeting of these programs are expected to improve
under the ongoing regionalization program.
Conclusion
The authorities are encouraged by the progress achieved in strengthening the economy’s
fundamentals and maintaining broadly favorable performance in a generally still
unfavorable external environment. They have taken benefit of every available
opportunity to strengthen macroeconomic stability and advance the reform agenda to
achieve their goals of improved standards of living and increased inclusion, with close
attention to maintaining social peace and cohesion. They look forward to further fruitful
cooperation with the Fund.
