STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 31, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth is gaining momentum, led by strong external demand while domestic
demand is also picking up. The central bank’s foreign exchange intervention policy has
helped stem deflationary pressures but inflation is still well below target. Following
substantial fiscal adjustment over the past three years, an easing of the fiscal stance is
underway and the new government’s medium-term fiscal plans have not yet been fully
elaborated. The financial system is sound and resilient to shocks, and improvements in
the regulatory and supervisory architecture are ongoing. The challenge for the
authorities is to create the conditions for strong and sustainable growth while
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Policy recommendations. Policies should aim at comprehensively addressing obstacles
to strong, sustained growth; and maintaining buffers.
 Fiscal policy. Adopt a growth-friendly fiscal strategy. Support the nascent recovery
through an increase in capital spending financed by a slight relaxation of the fiscal
stance over the near term. Adopt a medium-term fiscal framework that helps anchor
fiscal policy, enhance predictability, and avoid pro-cyclicality.
 Monetary policy. Continue to focus on inflation targeting. Keep the exchange rate
floor in place until deflation risks recede, and the inflation forecast and inflation
expectations become entrenched around the inflation target.
 Financial sector. Remain vigilant and be ready to address possible risks to financial
stability.
 Structural reforms. Advance structural reforms aimed at increasing labor market
participation, enhancing investment in human and physical capital, and improving the
business climate.

CONTEXT
1.
The Czech economy has gained momentum, but policymakers still face challenges.
Following a prolonged period of stagnation which was exacerbated by significant fiscal
consolidation that went beyond what was necessary under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), the
economy has turned a corner, driven by strong external demand and a pickup in domestic demand.
An easing of the fiscal stance is now envisaged, although the authorities’ fiscal policy agenda is yet
to be clearly elaborated. With the policy rate at the zero lower bound, the central bank’s foreign
exchange intervention policy has helped stem deflationary pressures but inflation remains well
below target.
2.
A new pro-European, but ideologically-diverse, coalition government took office in
January 2014. In contrast to the previous right-wing and euro-skeptic coalition, the new
government—a coalition of the Social Democrats, a new center right party (ANO), and the Christian
Democrats—is friendlier to the EU policy agenda. It already endorsed the Fiscal Compact and stated
that euro adoption is a possibility before 2020, albeit not within its current mandate. However, the
new government is ideologically diverse. Its overall orientation is toward more activist social welfareenhancing policies, as evidenced by the decision to increase the minimum wage and introduce a
lower VAT rate for some items, and the promise to resume full pension indexation (to a mix of
inflation and wage growth). On the other hand, ANO has pledged not to increase taxes.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The Czech economy exited the recession in 2013. Notwithstanding an average annual
decline of 0.9 percent in real GDP, quarterReal GDP and Exports

by improvements in labor income. As a
result, year-over-year growth reached
2.9 percent in 2014:Q1. Moreover, high
frequency indicators, such as industrial production and sentiment surveys, suggest that growth has
remained strong in recent months.
4.
The labor market is poised for a recovery. Unemployment entered a gradually declining
path in 2013 on the back of gains in employment, and reached 6.6 percent (seasonally adjusted)
in 2014:Q1 compared with 7.2 percent a year earlier. While these employment gains were coupled

CZECH REPUBLIC

with lower hours worked per employee and declining real wages through 2013, this trend was
reversed in 2014:Q1 with real wages recording a solid increase.
5.
Inflation has been falling, but is still in positive territory aided by the weaker exchange
rate. Headline inflation declined from its September 2012 peak of 3.4 percent to zero in June 2014,
in tandem with inflation in the euro area and in regional trade partners. About two thirds of the
decline was accounted for by a moderation of food and energy prices. The decline in inflation has
been mitigated by the exchange rate depreciation, which had a rapid pass-through to tradables
prices—non-energy goods inflation (HICP basis) increased from -0.6 percent in November 2013 to
0.7 percent in June 2014, turning positive for the first time since 2008—and helped keep inflation at
an average of 0.2 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2014. Various core inflation indicators
also exhibit a trend towards normalization; inflation excluding indirect tax changes and fuels reached
1 percent, its highest level since 2011. Moreover, inflation expectations, as measured by analyst
surveys, have also increased following the exchange rate move.

A sharp fiscal adjustment led to an exit from the EDP and kept debt levels contained,
but exacerbated the recession. The adjustment was driven mainly by a compression of capital
expenditure, partly due to implementation bottlenecks, while an increase in VAT rates helped boost
revenue. The fiscal stance continued to improve, with the structural deficit narrowing by
1.3 percentage points of GDP on the heels of a cumulative 2.4 percentage point consolidation
during 2011–12. The decline in the headline deficit, from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012 to 1.5 percent
in 2013, was even more pronounced due to one-off factors in 2012, which had elevated that year’s
deficit. The European Council abrogated the EDP in June 2014.
7.
Constrained by the zero lower bound, the Czech National Bank (CNB)—an inflation
targeter—resorted to foreign exchange intervention to avoid deflation, consistent with Fund
advice. The koruna had been strong in 2012–13, not responding significantly to the weak economy
in the last few years, partly buoyed by strengthening capital flows since 2011. In November 2013,
facing the zero lower bound for its policy rate and the risk of a persistent undershoot of its inflation
target, the CNB decided to use the exchange rate as an additional instrument for inflation targeting
and announced its commitment “to prevent excessive appreciation of the koruna below CZK27 per €

by intervening in the foreign exchange market”, implying a 6 percent depreciation that was
expected to bring inflation to target in the monetary policy horizon.1 The exchange rate is currently
around CZK27.5 per €, and there has been no intervention in the foreign exchange market since
November 2013. In the last Article IV consultation, the Fund recommended foreign exchange
intervention as preferable over purely quantitative easing through purchases of domestic financial
assets given the systemic liquidity surplus in the banking system, scarcity of private financial assets
to purchase, and the very low long-term interest rates for government bonds.

8.
The banking sector remains strong, but credit provision is lackluster. Banks have
improved their already strong capital position reaching a capitalization ratio of 16.5 percent at end2013 compared with 15.6 percent in 2012. Profits moderated somewhat as net interest income was
compressed, but banks continue to enjoy strong asset quality, low non-performing loans, and stable
and cheap local deposit funding. At the same time, credit growth was subdued at 3.0 percent,
mainly due to weak demand from corporates.
9.
Creditworthiness remains high. Czech Republic is rated investment grade with a stable
outlook. Five-year credit default swaps have been remarkably stable at around 50 basis points. Bond
yields increased somewhat in the second half of 2013 in line with global trends, but have recently
approached historical lows: the 10-year bond yielded an average of 1.5 percent in June.
10.
The current account deficit is on a moderate narrowing trend. It remained broadly stable
at 1.4 percent of GDP in 2013, as a growing income deficit balanced out the improvement in the
trade balance. The improving trend of the latter is expected to continue this year supported by
robust export growth, thus contributing to a narrowing of the current account deficit to 0.2 percent

of GDP, a level staff assesses to be in line with fundamentals, including the ouput gap and still weak
domestic demand.
11.
Staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Estimates based on the EBA methodology yield mixed results for the Czech Republic. Specifically,
the Current Account Balance approach suggests that the current account deficit is still somewhat
wider than the cyclically-adjusted norm of 0.4 percent of GDP deficit, indicating an overvaluation of
about 5 percent in 2013. Benchmarked against the 2 percent of GDP deficit that would stabilize the
net foreign asset position, the 2013 outturn suggests a very slight undervaluation. While the
multilateral REER approach finds an 18 percent overvaluation, this appears too high in view of the
current account-based assessment, and needs to be treated with caution as it may not capture
factors such as an initial undervaluation, and rapid quality and productivity improvements. Other
considerations also point to the absence of evident imbalances in the external position (Box 2) or of
significant shortcomings in non-price competitiveness indicators (Figure 6). Overall, staff assesses
the exchange rate to be in broad equilibrium, and the confidence level of this assessment has
increased with the koruna now 6 percent weaker than the 2013 average.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Economic activity is expected to strengthen further. The projected euro area recovery,
supportive fiscal and monetary policies, and substantial slack in the economy will underpin growth
performance over 2014–15. Staff projects growth at 2.5 percent this year, with one third and two
thirds contributions from foreign and domestic demand, respectively—the latter is expected to turn
positive for the first time since 2010. Investment will be supported by higher capacity utilization,
greater clarity about the economic environment, foreign direct investment inflows, and greater takeup of European Union funds, whereas consumers will benefit from gains in labor income as well as
improving confidence. At the same time, strong export performance (exports are projected to grow
7 percent in real terms this year) will be underpinned by positive trends in traditional markets
(mainly the euro area) and products (mainly automotive and machinery). The effects of the
depreciated exchange rate and recovering demand conditions are expected to push inflation
gradually toward the 2 percent target. Over the medium term, output growth is set to stabilize at
around 2 percent driven by domestic demand, as the current account stabilizes around a small
deficit of ½ percent of GDP.

13.
Risks to the outlook are balanced. The ongoing recovery in Czech Republic’s trade
partners, domestic slack, supportive macroeconomic policies, and the improving automotive cycle
point to upside risks to growth. On the downside, escalation of geopolitical tensions in the region
could affect exports and also create uncertainty regarding energy security (Box 3). Moreover, if the
euro area recovery falters, the Czech economy will be negatively affected mainly through the trade
channel. The impact would be larger if low growth turns self-reinforcing through low investment in
physical and human capital (see Risk Assessment Matrix).

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with the near-term outlook, medium-term prospects,
and the balance of risks. Against a relatively upbeat baseline, they saw mostly externally-driven
downside risks. They were somewhat concerned about re-emergence of financial stress in the euro
area, possibly related to the outcomes from the Asset Quality Review and stress tests, as well as risks
from potential geopolitical tensions in the region. On the whole, the authorities saw these risks as a
reason to sustain or even strengthen policies that are supportive of domestic demand. Finally, they
saw the need to boost potential growth as a key element for future prosperity and the convergence
process.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policies should be geared toward ensuring a sustainable recovery and macroeconomic stability,
while creating the conditions for higher potential growth. Discussions thus focused on the need to
adopt a comprehensive growth strategy that would encompass a growth-friendly medium-term
fiscal strategy and structural reforms, with monetary policy continuing to play a stabilizing role.
Such a strategy would contribute to a higher level of investment and growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
15.
The authorities are committed to the medium-term objective of a 1 percent of GDP
structural deficit, which will need to be embedded into a clear medium-term fiscal framework,
enshrined in legislation. The Ministry of Finance has prepared an updated draft Fiscal Framework
Reform (FFR) and plans to submit it to Parliament for discussion and approval later this year. The
draft includes expenditure ceilings derived from the medium-term objective, a debt brake rule
starting at 55 percent of GDP, and a Fiscal Council (Box 4). The proposed structural deficit rule
strikes the right balance between reducing debt and creating fiscal space. It would also help
eliminate the pro-cyclical bias of fiscal policy and would be consistent with EU fiscal framework
requirements. While the debt brake has the potential to introduce a pro-cyclical bias, the current
debt level provides an adequate buffer against this risk. Finally, an independent Fiscal Council with
sufficient analytical and institutional capacity would further strengthen the fiscal framework. Staff
urged the authorities to move expeditiously with the approval of the FFR to help anchor fiscal policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

16.
The authorities are still elaborating the timeline for reaching the medium-term fiscal
objective and underlying policies. Latest official projections as published in the Convergence
Programme (CP) are subject to sizeable upside risks on the revenue side, while expenditure
pressures exist in several areas. Near-term policies thus carry some degree of uncertainty.


The fiscal stance is projected to remain neutral in 2014. On the expenditure side, the budget
foresees a sharp increase in capital spending to the pre-2013 levels, while other expenditure
remains broadly unchanged as a share of GDP. Possible shortfalls in capital spending would be
broadly neutral due to EU financing. However, the budget includes conservative revenue
projections as they are based on an older vintage of macro assumptions. All in all, the CP
includes a 1.8 percent of GDP projection for the headline deficit. However, in light of strong
revenue performance so far this year and consistent with staff’s baseline macroeconomic
framework, as long as the approved expenditure ceilings are respected, the general government
deficit is projected at 1.2 percent of GDP in 2014. This would imply a broadly neutral fiscal
stance.



Fiscal plans for 2015 are still being elaborated. The CP includes a 2.3 percent of GDP
projection for the headline deficit, although the actual target is likely to be lower. However,
there is uncertainty regarding the structure of the budget and the deficit target, as the coalition
partners’ priorities are still being elaborated. The government has approved a lower VAT rate for
pharmaceuticals, books, and infant food, and promised to abolish the reduced pension
indexation—both effective next year. Based on staff’s baseline macroeconomic framework and
assuming that the expenditure allocations included in the CP are respected, the general
government deficit is projected at 1.4 percent of GDP, thus implying a moderate structural
easing of ½ percentage point.



The CP includes a structural deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2017 and reiterates the
government’s commitment to the medium-term deficit objective. This fiscal path implies
that public debt would decline to about 42 percent of GDP by 2019, thus reinforcing Czech
Republic’s strong fiscal position (Appendix II).

17.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to the medium-term deficit objective,
but noted the need for more clarity regarding the fiscal targets and underlying policies. Staff
noted that, pending adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework by Parliament, fiscal targets
should be consistent with the medium-term objective of a 1 percent of GDP structural deficit,
ensuring that the chosen fiscal path strikes a balance between sustaining the economic recovery and
creating space for addressing the country’s infrastructure needs. To this end, staff supported an
increase in capital spending financed by a modest increase in the structural deficit to 1¼ percent of
GDP during 2014–15. Moreover, staff recommended that better-than-expected tax revenues not to
be channeled to re-current spending.
18.
Staff emphasized the need to improve the efficiency of capital expenditure. Higher
utilization of EU funds should be the first step. Eliminating obstacles in planning and
implementation of public projects without compromising governance would help in this respect.
Within the envelope of a 1 percent of GDP structural deficit, increases in capital spending can also
be financed through rationalizing re-current spending and stepped-up efforts to improve tax
administration. In this connection, staff noted that the introduction of a new lower VAT rate was a
much less efficient way to address social priorities than a more targeted measure would be, and also
an unwelcome complication for tax administration.

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the medium-term fiscal objective, but
not to a particular timeline to achieve it. They acknowledged upside risks to revenue that, were to
materialize, would lead to a 2014 fiscal outturn better than the one projected in the CP. In fact, at
end-July they revised their deficit projection to 1.5 percent of GDP. As for the medium term, the
draft Fiscal Framework Reform foresees the medium-term objective of 1 percent of GDP structural
deficit being reached in 2020. As of now, the authorities saw the 3 percent of GDP headline fiscal
deficit threshold (i.e., the EDP limit) as the only binding requirement for fiscal policy. They noted that
they would elaborate their position on the path and timeline for reaching the medium-term
objective in the course of the preparation of the 2015 budget. To this end, they expected detailed
discussions in the fall at which time coalition partners would have to agree on the government’s
priorities. They admitted though that there were expenditure pressures in several areas, which may
lead to an increase in expenditure ceilings. In particular, the authorities highlighted that the recent
episode of fiscal consolidation has led to an undue compression of public investment and a
resulting infrastructure deficit in several areas such as transportation and energy. They also saw
benefits from a slight fiscal expansion in terms of insurance against downside macroeconomic risks.
Finally, the authorities noted that the approval of the new fiscal framework by Parliament could take
time, despite the government’s commitment to move expeditiously.

B. Monetary Policy
20.
Under the baseline scenario, with the economic recovery gathering momentum,
inflation is set to rise gradually toward the central bank’s target. While headline inflation

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

remains very low—weighed down by administered prices (e.g., gas and electricity) and food—core
measures and demand-sensitive components of inflation are generally stronger and exceed headline
inflation (Box 5). Demand for durables is strengthening, suggesting that the tail risk of a self-fulfilling
deflationary spiral has been averted. Labor income growth is gaining momentum, underpinning
solid consumption trends. Under staff’s baseline scenario, the effects of the weaker exchange rate
and recovering demand conditions are expected to push inflation gradually toward the central
bank’s 2 percent target over the monetary policy horizon. Moreover, inflation expectations have
increased following the exchange rate move and CNB’s stated commitment to maintain the
exchange rate floor into early 2015 as an instrument for achieving the inflation objective. In fact,
inflation expectations have matched the CNB’s inflation forecast for a slight overshoot of the
inflation target in the first half of 2015, before moderating to 2 percent by end-2015.
21.
With these considerations in mind, staff recommended that the CNB continue to focus
on inflation targeting, and maintain the current supportive monetary conditions for now.
There are still risks to the recovery mostly from external developments; the output gap is still sizable;
and inflation remains very low, including in wage agreements. Therefore, staff suggested keeping in
place the exchange rate floor for now, even though it has not been binding. However, staff
recommended a return to a floating exchange rate once deflation risks recede, and the inflation
forecast and inflation expectations, as well as wage developments, become entrenched around the
central bank’s target. The pre-existence of a consistent monetary policy and inflation targeting
framework, and a credible and transparent central bank, make the exit easier than in the case of
traditional pegs. Moreover, the current monetary and exchange rate settings are consistent with
broad macroeconomic equilibrium. In this context, staff recommended abolishing the exchange rate
floor in one step rather than gradually. This is likely to be the first stage in the normalization of
monetary policy, with interest rate hikes following in due course.

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with the inflation outlook and noted their commitment
to inflation targeting, while for now continuing to use the foreign exchange intervention
policy as an instrument for achieving their inflation objective. They were generally satisfied with
the results of the intervention policy, and noted the underlying positive trends in the inflation data,
which were overshadowed by still-low headline inflation. However, relative to their pre-intervention
forecasts, negative price shocks have been more pronounced, and the hoped-for overshoot of
inflation relative to target—to decisively break the inertia in inflation expectations—is now unlikely.
As a result of a lower inflation profile, the authorities have decided to maintain the intervention
policy as an instrument for achieving their inflation objective for longer, announcing in June that the
policy will be in place until at least the second quarter of 2015. Nevertheless, once the conditions for
exiting from the intervention policy were in place, they would return to a floating exchange rate. In
this connection, the central bank would consider exit modalities in detail in the fall of this year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

CZECH REPUBLIC

C. Financial Sector
23.
The financial sector is sound and resilient. Czech banks, which are largely owned by euro
area banking groups, are self-financed with a low system-wide loan to deposit ratio and strong
capital and liquidity buffers. Profitability moderated somewhat on the back of still-weak credit
growth, but still helped to further strengthen banks’ capital to above 16 percent. Recent CNB stress
tests indicate that aggregate bank capitalization would remain above 13 percent, significantly better
than the regulatory minimum of 8 percent, even in a severe stress scenario with a large output drop
and protracted stagnation. Many Czech bank parents are going through the ECB’s comprehensive
risk assessment, but their Czech subsidiaries are self-funded and net creditors vis-à-vis abroad, and
should thus be relatively resilient to shocks to parents.
24.
Credit growth is likely to be boosted by the recovery. Despite healthy bank balance
sheets and moderate debt levels in the non-financial sector, credit growth remains subdued due to
a combination of low credit demand and somewhat tighter lending standards. However, with
healthy balance sheets in the financial and non-financial sectors, this is mostly expected to be a
cyclical phenomenon—in fact, lending surveys suggest banks are turning cautiously optimistic, with
the July lending survey showing that credit standards to corporates were eased for the first time
since 2011. Approval rates for most loan categories remain high, and banks noted lack of fixed
investment activity and financing from internal resources as limiting corporate credit demand, but
they also saw initial signs of a recovery.
25.
Improvements in regulations and the supervisory architecture are continuing. Building
on last year’s progress toward implementing FSAP recommendations,2 supervisory resources have
been increased for on-site inspections. Moreover, a draft law on credit unions—a small but
problematic sector of credit providers—has been prepared, and would help reduce reputation risks
to the financial system. The implementing law of the EU Directive on access to the activity of credit
institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms has been
approved by Parliament, and systemic banks have already been notified of upcoming capital buffer
requirements, with which they would be largely in compliance at current capital levels. Finally, work
on the EU-wide initiative for unified resolution schemes and deposit insurance framework is
continuing.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment of a healthy financial sector. They saw a
domestic balance sheet recession as the main risk to the financial system, but attached to this a
smaller likelihood than before. They also highlighted the ongoing follow-up on FSAP
recommendations and supranational regulatory initiatives. Finally, the authorities are considering

diminishing low-base effects and demographic
headwinds will constrain growth to 2 percent
over the medium term (Appendix I). This is well
below the level necessary to facilitate convergence of Czech per capita output to the level of other
advanced European economies. The employment rate is expected to remain stable, but with
declining working age population, the economy would require wider sources of labor supply.3
Moreover, labor force participation of some demographic groups is low, there are skill mismatches,
and investment in research and development (R&D) is low. Although such labor market constraints
may not be binding at this stage, they could impede the country’s medium-term growth prospects.
28.
Renewed structural reform momentum is needed to put the Czech Republic on a
higher growth trajectory. Important steps have been taken to reduce labor market rigidities,
including more flexible employment arrangements, strengthened public employment services,
affordable high-quality child-care facilities, and increased rental housing availability. However, labor
participation in some segments of the population—e.g., women with young children—remains low4,
thus calling for targeted policies. Consideration could be given to upgrading skills and addressing
skill shortages in the technical fields by education and training of less-advantaged populations (e.g.,
through apprenticeship programs), vocational training in close cooperation with businesses, and
improved incentives in the education system to better match workforce needs. Moreover, reducing
uncertainty regarding tax policies, simplifying compliance with taxation requirements, and
combating corruption in line with the authorities’ 2014 National Reform Programme should help
enhance the business environment. Finally, strengthening R&D, improving infrastructure, and

facilitating SMEs’ expansion and better integration into the international value chain would support
stronger growth.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities agreed that this is an opportune time to undertake structural reform.
They broadly shared the mission’s assessment regarding impediments to stronger growth, and also
noted the lack of part-time job arrangements as a barrier for increasing female labor force
participation, the need to have more cooperation between the industry and schools to address the
decline in the number of students majoring in technical fields, and the importance of higher public
investment. To this end, they pointed to the steps in their National Reform Programme to stimulate
growth, including investment in infrastructure, strong efforts to improve the absorption capacity for
EU funds, development of child care services, support for vocational education, and co-operation
between schools and employers. They felt confident that all these steps in the context of an
improving external environment would help boost investment and growth.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Czech economy is strengthening but continues to face challenges. The economy
has emerged from the prolonged recession, growth is gaining momentum, and unemployment has
been falling. The recovery was triggered by exports, but has been increasingly supported by
domestic demand. Despite these positive developments, inflation is still well below target, the new
government’s medium-term fiscal plans are yet to be clearly elaborated, and potential growth is well
below the level necessary to facilitate convergence of Czech per capita income to the level of other
advanced European economies.
31.
Following a sharp fiscal consolidation over the last three years, a growth-friendly fiscal
strategy along with a clear medium-term fiscal framework is needed. On account of the need to
sustain the nascent recovery and improve infrastructure, an increase in capital spending financed by
a slight relaxation of the fiscal stance in the near term would be appropriate. At the same time, using
revenue over-performance to ratchet up re-current expenditure should be avoided. The authorities’
commitment to a medium-term objective for the structural deficit is welcome, and it will need to be
backed by a clear strategy on the underlying fiscal targets and policies. In addition, the mediumterm deficit objective should be cast in a medium-term fiscal framework—enshrined in legislation—
that would also include a debt brake rule, and an independent Fiscal Council, thus helping anchor
fiscal policy, improve policy predictability, and contain pro-cyclicality.
32.
The central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting and maintain the
current supportive monetary conditions for now. The effects of the depreciated exchange rate
and recovering demand conditions are expected to push inflation gradually toward the central
bank’s target. At the same time, though, there are still risks to the recovery, the output gap is still
sizeable, inflation remains very low, and inflation expectations are not yet well-anchored around the
inflation target. These considerations argue for keeping the exchange rate floor in place for now.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CZECH REPUBLIC

Nevertheless, the central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting and return to a
floating exchange rate once deflation risks recede, and the inflation forecast and inflation
expectations become entrenched around the inflation target.
33.
The financial system is sound and resilient; continued vigilance will help sustain its
health. The banking sector has strong capital and liquidity buffers, which make it resilient to shocks.
Moreover, bank supervision has been enhanced by strengthening supervisory resources and
legislative changes. Still, proactive supervision would be necessary along with gradual improvements
in the supervisory architecture in line with the European and global initiatives.
34.
Unleashing Czech Republic’s full growth potential requires renewed structural reform
momentum. Implementation of structural reforms aimed at enhancing investment in physical and
human capital, and improving the business environment is critical to support Czech Republic’s
advancement in the international value chain and support stronger growth. Efforts to increase labor
participation should continue, and greater emphasis should be placed on strengthening research
and development, and upgrading skills in the technical fields.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
"high" a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks at the time of discussions with
the authorities.

Box 1. Response to Past Fund Policy Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly consistent with IMF advice with the fiscal stance being an
exception.

Key recommendations
Further pro-cyclical fiscal policy should be
avoided until the economic recovery gains
strength.

Implemented policies
Not implemented. The structural balance continued to
improve in 2013; however, much of this improvement
was due to an inability to execute spending, especially
in the investment area, owing to political and legal
bottlenecks.

Adopt a fiscal rule which has wide coverage,
is easy to monitor, incorporates a debt brake,
and is monitored by an independent Fiscal
Council.

Not yet implemented. A new proposal by the Ministry
of Finance, broadly in line with these recommendations,
is under discussion.

If a persistent and large undershooting of the
inflation target is in prospect, foreign
exchange interventions could be employed
to help guide inflation expectations toward
the target.

Implemented. As it became clear that inflation will
remain below target for a significant period of time, and
facing risks that inflation expectations will become
unanchored, the Czech National Bank intervened in the
foreign exchange market in November 2013.

Continue improving the financial sector
supervisory architecture.

Implemented. Supervisory resources have been boosted
to intensify on-site supervision. Financial sector
regulation is being modified in line with EU-wide
initiatives. Stricter regulation of credit unions is under
preparation.

Current account deficits have been largely financed by FDI inflows, the net international investment
position (NIIP) has stabilized, and reserves are strong. Reflecting the high FDI stock, Czech Republic has
traditionally had a large income deficit that outweighs the trade surplus to produce moderate current
account deficits. However, these deficits have been largely financed by FDI flows that are underpinned by
foreign earnings reinvested in the country, as well as new investments. The accumulated external deficits
over the years have led to a moderate negative NIIP of about 45 percent of GDP, but the NIIP has stabilized
in recent years. Excluding the FDI stock, the NIIP is positive reflecting low external indebtedness and a strong
reserve position. In fact, foreign exchange reserves are well above the suggested adequacy range, providing
ample cushion against external shocks.

Box 3. The Czech Republic’s Links with Russia and Ukraine
Real sector links with Russia and Ukraine, except for energy imports, are limited; and direct financial links are
negligible.
Czech Republic’s dependency on Russia and Ukraine is mainly through indirect supply chain links.
Direct trade links are moderate. Russia is Czech Republic’s 8 th largest export market with 3.2 percent of
Czech exports going to Russia, and the 6th largest importer, with 5 percent of imports originating from
Russia. Czech exports to Ukraine are about 1 percent of total exports and imports from Ukraine represent
0.8 percent of total. Moreover, the share of Russian value added embodied in Czech gross exports is
somewhat above 5 percent only in two industries. However, final demand from Russia, in particular for
automobiles produced in the Czech Republic and supplied indirectly through the German-Central European
Supply Chain, is an important driver for exports, and thus lower growth in Russia could lower Czech exports.
The Czech Republic has a significant dependency on Russia and Ukraine for its energy imports. The
share of Russian gas in the Czech Republic’s total gas consumption is 80 percent—the third largest share
after Finland and Belarus. In addition, as the entire region is heavily dependent on energy imports from
Russia, lengthy disruptions in gas supply would adversely affect production in the Czech Republic also
through the impact on other countries. Nevertheless, there is scope for re-routing gas imports through
other countries and, with seasonally-low demand, the Czech Republic could overcome short-lived
disruptions.
Direct financial linkages are negligible. However, there is a risk of contagion through confidence effects.
There is significant reliance on tourism from Russia. The number of Russian tourists to the Czech
Republic increased sharply in recent years, and now is the second largest only after the one of tourists from
neighboring Germany.

general government spending. As a result, the
Czech Republic stands relatively low in the
European Commission’s (EC) ranking of fiscal rule strength.
The proposed fiscal framework aims at addressing these weaknesses. It encompasses a structural
balance rule, a debt brake supplemented with a debt restriction on local governments, and a deficit
constraint on social security funds. The debt brake starts to apply when public debt, adjusted for the Ministry
of Finance’s liquid reserves, exceeds 55 percent of GDP. The debt brake and the structural balance rule
incorporate escape clauses applicable in cases of serious economic downturns, natural disasters, or
emergency.
According to the debt brake, several automatic procedures would be launched when debt exceeds
55 percent of GDP. In such a case, the state budget as well as budgets of public health insurance
companies and local governments must target a balance or surplus. Any new state guarantee would be
provided only after a majority approval (by both Chambers of Parliament). While the debt brake has the
potential to introduce a pro-cyclical bias, the current debt level provides an adequate buffer against this risk.
The proposed structural balance rule foresees a limit of 1 percent of GDP for the structural deficit,
identical to the medium-term objective agreed between the previous government that the EC. Adoption of a
structural balance rule would also be in line with the Fiscal Compact.
The proposed framework is to be implemented by a Constitutional Law and an Act on Rules of Fiscal
Responsibility. The former incorporates the debt brake, Fiscal Council, and local governments’ debt rule
and requires a super majority in both chambers of Parliament to be modified. The latter specifies the
practical implementation of the Constitutional Act including the structural balance rule and requires a simple
majority in both chambers of Parliament to be modified.
Transparency and accountability would be enhanced with the introduction of a Committee for
Budgetary Forecasts and an independent Fiscal Council. The Committee would assess government
forecasts and could require their revision if deemed optimistic. At the same time, more demanding and
regular reporting criteria will be introduced, along with annual reports including on tax expenditures and
contingent liabilities. The establishment of an independent Fiscal Council, with sufficient institutional and
analytical capacity, would further enhance transparency and accountability of fiscal operations.

the shifting of bonuses during the calendar year, even adjusted for this effect, private sector wage dynamics
seem to have turned the corner.

Appendix I. Potential Growth
Raising Czech Republic’s potential
growth faces significant challenges.
After important gains in the years prior to
the 2008 global financial crisis, labor
productivity improved only very little
during 2008–13 (Figure 1). Moreover, as
the working age population (ages 15–64)
is projected to decline by 0.4 percent
annually during 2010–50, medium-term
growth will have to rely on a bounce back
of labor productivity growth and higher
labor force participation.

The slowdown in labor productivity may not be just cyclical. Aggregate employment declined
during 2008–13 and aggregate output dropped even more, thus suggesting a possible role of labor
hoarding—firms underutilizing productive employees and hence tending not to actively hire new
ones—and that the slowdown in labor productivity may be cyclical. However, sectoral level data do
not fully support this: e.g., the employment drop in manufacturing and real estate was larger than
the output drop in the respective sector. Service sectors, such as finance and insurance, and
information and communication expanded significantly, which is perhaps inconsistent with labor
hoarding. Finally, sectors whose change in labor productivity seems not to be explained by labor
hoarding account for more than 80 percent of the total labor force. This suggests that a slowdown
in labor productivity may be more entrenched than being purely cyclical.

CZECH REPUBLIC

The Czech growth model may be facing increasing constraints. The current growth model of the
Czech Republic relies on a strengthening of the economy’s position in the German-Central European
Supply Chain (GCESC) by attracting FDI and relying on relatively cheap and high-skilled labor.
However, this model may increasingly be facing limits, especially as the income convergence has
substantially reduced unit labor cost differentials with Germany. Moreover, increased competition
from other countries in the region creates additional headwinds.
Trends in total factor productivity (TFP) and unit labor costs (ULC) seem to be the main
drivers of growth in countries with an income level higher than the Czech Republic’s. To assess
the Czech growth potential, we analyze the experience of OECD countries with per capita income
above the one of the Czech Republic.1 Figure 2 depicts the relationship between per capita GDP
growth and the gap with US income level, ULC growth, TFP growth, and gross fixed capital
formation. For each country, we define the time when the country’s real purchasing power2 started
to exceed the Czech Republic’s 2014 level as time 0. We then compute per capita GDP over US per
capita GDP and real ULC growth3 in the five years before time 0; and TFP growth and gross fixed
capital formation over GDP in the five years after time 0. This analysis suggests that higher per
capita real GDP growth is positively associated with: (i) a higher gap from the US income level; (ii)
more moderate historical ULC growth; (iii) higher TFP growth; and (iv) higher capital formation.
Moreover, strong TFP growth and moderate ULC growth seem to be the main drivers of growth.
The importance of TFP and ULC growth is confirmed by regression analysis. We examine the
whole period between time 0—the time when each country’s real purchasing power started to
exceed the 2014 level of the Czech Republic—and year 2013 and divide the period into five year
intervals. Then, we conduct a pool-OLS regression analysis4 over these country-five year interval
pairs, with the dependent variable being per capita real GDP growth in the five years, and the
explanatory variables of the average ratio of per-capita GDP over the US per capita GDP and ULC
growth in the previous five years, TFP growth and the average ratio of investment to GDP in the five
years, as well as the world trade stock growth in the five years, the FDI stock growth, services share
in export, and export share in GDP in the previous five years. The results of the regression analysis
(Table 1) broadly support the observations made above. For example, a 1 percent increase in annual
ULC growth implies a 0.1 percent decline in the annual per-capita GDP growth; while a 1 percent
increase in annual TFP growth would lead to a 0.7 percent increase in annual per-capita GDP

These countries include (the years in the parentheses are the time when each country’s per-capita GDP in PPP US$
deflated by the US GDP deflator started to exceed the Czech Republic’s 2014 level): Australia (1989), Austria (1987),

We choose not to do a panel analysis because of a small sample size. The regression results are robust to various
specifications. If we drop FDI stock growth, we will have around 80 observations, and results are largely unchanged.

This analysis suggests a potential GDP growth of around 2½ percent for the Czech Republic.
The model-predicted per capita real GDP growth for the Czech Republic over 2014–19, based on the
regression coefficients and estimations/projections for the explanatory variables is 2.6 percent
(Figure 3). However, this figure could be slightly over-estimated for two reasons. First,
0.7 percentage point growth comes from the Czech Republic’s per capita GDP being on average
34 percent of the US per capita GDP in 2008–13. Such growth due to relatively low initial income
level may be better seen as potential for catch up rather than as an actual projection. Second,
0.15 percentage point growth comes from negative real ULC growth during 2009–14, which,
however, should be largely attributed to the 2008 global financial recession and not necessarily
imply gains in competitiveness. Considering these factors, the average potential real GDP growth of
2.2 percent over 2014–19 assumed in the staff’s baseline scenario is in line with what this analysis
suggests.

These results point to the importance of investment in research and development (R&D). R&D
spending of the Czech Republic stood at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2011, significantly lower than the
OECD average of 2.4 percent. The mission’s discussions with private sector representatives suggest
that this could be to a large extent due to the lack of co-operation between businesses, universities,
and the government; e.g., the government’s funding support tends to favor projects in the basic
research and large companies which already have sufficient funding for innovation. If that is the
case, there could be room for government support to strengthen R&D in the private sector, in a way
that can help strengthen technology spillovers from the Germany-Central Europe Supply Chain6 to
the domestic economy.
Accelerating TFP growth should also entail enhancing domestic value-added in exports. The
domestic value added of Czech exports stood at around 55 percent in 2012, substantially lower than
in other advanced economies. On the one hand, the low domestic content in export may reflect the
fact that the Czech Republic is exporting highly sophisticated products, whose intermediate inputs

6

Largely due to the participation in the GCESC, data suggest that the export sophistication (measured using the
method developed by Hatzichronoglou, T. (1997) “Revision of the high-technology sector and product classification”,
OECD Science, Technology and Industry Working Papers, 1997/02, OECD Publishing.) of the Czech Republic was
higher than most advanced economies with similar or smaller population sizes in 2012, with notable exceptions of
Ireland and Switzerland. This implies a large potential for technology spill-over in the Czech Republic.

tend to be produced by more than one country. On the other hand, recent OECD studies7 point out
two other explanations: first, intermediate goods produced in the Czech Republic are relatively little
used in Czech exports or as intermediate inputs in global production; and second, services sectors
are poorly integrated into the supply chain, and the services content in Czech exports is the lowest
among OECD countries. These explanations suggest room for the Czech Republic to enhance the
integration of its domestic firms into the international value chain, which can be important for the
TFP growth of the Czech Republic, as studies (Eaton & Kortum, 19998) show that international
technology spill-over plays a large role even for the TFP growth of advanced economies.

Addressing skill mismatches in the labor market is also important. Demographic headwinds
may lead to labor shortages, with segments of skill mismatch suffering most, so the resulted upward
pressure in the ULC will hamper growth. The Czech Republic has done relatively poorly in aligning its
fields of study with job requirements (horizontal mismatch, Figure 5). Various interlocutors of the
mission pointed to potential lack of workers trained in technical fields down the road as increasingly
more students choose social science as their majors, since compensation is similar or even higher,
and completion of such degrees may be less challenging. Coming to the underlying causes, it has
been suggested that there are insufficient incentives for the education system to shift focus on the
market needs when training students, as the university funding is based on the number of students
rather than on their job market performance. To this end, recent OECD analysis9 suggests a need for
the Czech Republic to improve tertiary education quality, including publicizing information on labor
market outcomes by field of study and education institutions, and developing accreditation criteria
for tertiary education accordingly. Adopting measures to address skill mismatch and improve labor
force skills will not only help contain ULC growth but also accelerate TFP growth.10

10

There are two reasons for this: first, we do not control for quality of labor when estimating the TFP, and
strengthening the labor skill naturally increases the TFP as defined in the current context. Second, highly-skilled labor
force can increase the capacity for firms to absorb new technologies, and hence facilitate technology spill-over.

Finally, it is important to further develop the services sector and enhance labor force
participation. The services sector in the Czech Republic hired 60 percent of the labor force in 2013,
compared with, e.g., 70 percent and 80 percent in Germany and the UK, respectively. There is
evidence that services industries, which tend to hire more women, are less-developed in the Czech
Republic. For example, the top five sectors in the share of female employees (namely, health and
social work, education, accommodation and food services, finance and intermediation, and
administrative support) in Germany belong to the services sector and hired around 30 percent of the
total labor force in 2013, while the same industries hired 38 percent in the UK and only 22 percent in
the Czech Republic. In the same year, only 74 percent of employed women were working in the
services sector in the Czech Republic compared with 83 percent and 91 percent in Germany and the
UK, respectively. This evident suggests that the less-developed state of the services sectors may
have contributed to the relatively low female labor force participation, by offering fewer attractive
job opportunities. Moreover, a number of studies (e.g., Dabla-Norris et al., 201311) show that a
higher dependency ratio leads to a larger value-added share of the services sector in the total
economy. Given the aging of the population, the services sector could perhaps play a more
prominent role in the Czech Republic. Therefore, reducing domestic entry barriers in the services
sectors and enhancing competition could help further develop these sectors and achieve a dual goal
of enhancing women labor force participation and better preparing for the aging society.

Appendix II. Czech Republic: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt has stabilized at around 46 percent of GDP, as the effect of narrowing structural deficits
was counterbalanced by economic contraction in 2012–13. Provided the expenditure ceilings as
specified in the Convergence Programme are respected, public debt is projected to stay on a
downward path reaching 42 percent of GDP by 2019 on the back of the economic recovery and
strong revenue collection. Public debt and gross financing needs are relatively resilient to isolated
shocks to key variables, but a combination of shocks to real GDP growth, interest rate, exchange
rate, and revenue shortfalls could lead to a significant ratcheting up of the debt level.

Baseline and Realism of Projections
The baseline scenario assumes a structural relaxation from a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2012 to 1.2 percent in 2015 with structural balances staying close to a 1 percent of GDP
deficit over the medium term. It is underpinned by the following assumptions:


Expenditure ceilings: The baseline assumes that the expenditure ceilings set forth in medium
term budget framework for the 2014–17 period will be respected. The small structural relaxation
is mostly due to the increase in the capital expenditures from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013 to
3.6 percent in 2015.



Growth and inflation: Underpinned by a recovery in domestic demand and exports, real GDP is
projected to increase by 2.5 percent in 2014 and 2015, with medium-term growth converging
close to 2 percent. The inflation rate is forecast to converge to the 2 percent target by end-2015.

The outlook for the fiscal path is benign under the baseline. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP
ratio will decrease from 46 percent in 2013 to 44.4 percent in 2014–15, before starting to steadily
decline to 42.3 percent in 2019. The temporary stabilization in 2015 at 44.4 percent in part reflects
the scheduled government structural stimulus to aid the nascent recovery. Gross financing needs are
projected to stay below 9 percent of GDP throughout the projection period.

Shock and Stress Tests
A combination of macro-fiscal shocks is the main risk to debt sustainability. Assuming that
shocks to real GDP growth, the primary balance, the real exchange rate and the real interest rate
would occur simultaneously, public debt would increase sharply and stabilize around 62 percent of
GDP. Gross financing needs would also climb to 14 percent of GDP in 2019.

CZECH REPUBLIC

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on February 8, 1993 upon the
dissolution of the currency union with the Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna
as its currency. From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a basket of two
currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996,
the Czech National Bank widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. Between 2002 and 2013, the
CNB has not engaged in direct interventions in the foreign exchange market, and the de facto
exchange rate regime was classified as a free float. In November 2013, facing zero lower bound for
policy rates and a persistent and large undershooting of its inflation target, the CNB intervened in
the market to weaken the currency, and announced its commitment to resist any appreciation
beyond CZK 27 per euro. As a result, the de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified as ‘other
managed’. The de jure exchange rate arrangement remains floating. On June 30 2014, the exchange
rate stood at CZK 27.45 per euro and CZK 20.10 per U.S. dollar.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system
that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The Czech Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN
Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union Regulations that have been notified
to the Fund for approval under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic was concluded on July 24, 2013. The staff
report and the press release were published on August 2, 2013.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was carried out in late 2000/ early 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment was
considered by the Executive Board on July 16, 2001, concurrently with the staff report for the 2001
Article IV Consultation. An FSAP update was carried out in 2011. ROSCs on: banking supervision;
data dissemination; fiscal transparency; securities market; and transparency of monetary and
financial policies were published on the Fund’s external website on July 1, 2000.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard in April 1998, and metadata and annual observance reports for
2006–09 are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
2.
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with
minimal lags. Interest rates set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), and exchange rates are
reported daily with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly basis
with a one week lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week
lag. Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending interest rates, central
government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with a lag of between one and
four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about one month. GDP and
balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a lag of two to three months.
Since 2003, the main components of the balance of payments are also available monthly. Annual
data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general
government, including the extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These annual
data are available on a timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in International Financial Statistics
(IFS) cover state budget accounts and are available with a two- to three-month lag.
3.
While data quality is generally high, some deficiencies remain in certain areas, and the
authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.


National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the small scale private
sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data collection on this sector are
not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of unrecorded activity stems from tax
evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates based on the production method and the
expenditure method are large and are subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of
national accounts are derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates
are subject to bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several expenditure
categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in individual components of
spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter bring into question the reliability of the
quarterly data and hamper business cycle analysis. The Czech Republic is adopting the European
System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in September 2014. The transition from the ESA 1995
(ESA95) requires a revision of national accounts data. New data sources will also be incorporated
in the new estimates which are due to be published in September/October 2014.



Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external trade
statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of foreign trade
statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and imports; these indices are
currently presented on the basis of the same month of the previous year. Starting in 2014,
external sector statistics are compiled according to the Balance of Payments and International

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

CZECH REPUBLIC

Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance with legal requirements of
the ECB and Eurostat.


Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate for policy
purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float, especially at the end
of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary developments. The CNB has made a major
effort to identify the causes of these variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU
statistical conventions, the CNB implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for
collecting, compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also forms the
basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the website, which are
thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics published in IFS, although the
presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.



Annual and quarterly fiscal data are compiled on ESA95 basis by the Czech Statistical Office,
including non-financial accounts, financial accounts, and financial balance sheets. Starting from
September 2014, GFS data will be based on ESA 2010 methodology which is likely to include
revisions of the general government deficit and debt levels from 1995 onwards. The Ministry of
Finance uses the ESA methodology for the Convergence Program targets. Some adjustments are
to be done when converting data from the national (fiscal targeting) methodology to the ESA
based fiscal accounts. The differences relate mainly to the coverage of the institutions classified
in the general government sector, exclusion of financial transactions, different classification of
some specific government transactions (for example, called guarantees) and the time of
recording of government transactions (ESA records transactions on accrual basis).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Czech Republic
August 27, 2014

This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
finalized. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The Board of the Czech National Bank (CNB) extended its timeline for using the exchange
rate as an additional monetary policy instrument to end-2015. This decision was underpinned
by a new quarterly macroeconomic forecast, which foresees achievement of the inflation
target conditional on continuation of current market interest rates and the use of the exchange
rate as a monetary policy instrument for inflation targeting until 2015:Q3. The CNB Board
assessed the risks to the new forecast as being to the downside, mainly from very low euro
area inflation, and therefore extended its guidance for using the exchange rate as a monetary
policy instrument. While staff supports the view that it is appropriate to keep the exchange
rate floor in place for now, the central bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting
with a view to exiting the intervention policy as soon as conditions allow (as emphasized in
the staff appraisal). Following the decision, the koruna entered a slight depreciation trend,
and, as of August 21, was about 2 percent weaker than the level prevailing at end-July and
about 4 percent weaker than the CNB’s floor of 27 koruny per euro.
The latest national accounts data confirmed the economy’s growth momentum,
notwithstanding one-off effects from stocks. Preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP
grew 2.6 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2014. Compared to the first quarter,
real GDP remained unchanged mainly due to the impact of continued destocking of tobacco
products following the excise tax hike.
Inflation picked up somewhat. Headline inflation increased to 0.5 percent year-on-year in
July from 0 percent year-on-year in June, mainly due to a slight acceleration of food price
inflation. Inflation excluding regulated prices, indirect price changes, food, and fuels
remained unchanged at 0.7 percent year-on-year in July.

Press Release No. 14/402
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 2, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Czech Republic
On August 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Czech Republic.
The Czech economy exited the recession in 2013. The recovery was triggered by exports, but has
been increasingly supported by domestic demand, with contributions from investment and
household consumption. Moreover, high frequency indicators suggest that growth has remained
strong in recent months. Unemployment entered a gradually declining path in 2013 on the back
of gains in employment. Exports are performing very well, and the current account deficit is
likely to narrow and approach balance this year. Inflation has been falling and is fluctuating just
above zero, but this is mainly due to administrative prices and energy prices, while core
indicators are on a moderate upwards trend.
A sharp fiscal adjustment led to an exit from the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and kept
debt levels contained, but exacerbated the recession. The adjustment was driven mainly by a
compression of capital expenditure, partly due to implementation bottlenecks, while an increase
in VAT rates helped boost revenue. As a result, but also owing to one-off factors, the overall
fiscal deficit narrowed from 4.2 percent of GDP in 2012 to 1.5 percent in 2013. The fiscal stance

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
continued to improve, with the structural deficit narrowing by 1.3 percentage points of GDP on
the heels of a cumulative 2.4 percentage point of GDP consolidation during 2011–12.
The Czech National Bank (CNB)—an inflation targeter—resorted to foreign exchange
intervention to avoid deflation, consistent with Fund advice. In November 2013, facing the zero
lower bound for its policy rate and the risk of a persistent undershoot of its inflation target, the
CNB decided to use the exchange rate as an additional instrument for inflation targeting and
announced its commitment “to prevent excessive appreciation of the koruna below CZK27 per
euro by intervening in the foreign exchange market”, implying a 6 percent depreciation that was
expected to bring inflation to target in the monetary policy horizon.
The financial sector remains strong and financial market volatility is low. Banks have improved
their already strong capital position reaching a capitalization ratio of 16.5 percent at end-2013
compared with 15.6 percent in 2012. Credit growth is currently low, mainly due to weak
demand, but is likely to recover gradually given strong balance sheets in both financial and nonfinancial sectors. Bond yields increased somewhat in the second half of 2013 in line with global
trends, but have recently approached historical lows again.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the recent strong and broad-based rebound of the Czech
economy, with falling unemployment and more robust domestic demand. These notwithstanding,
inflation remains well below target, and potential growth is still below the level necessary to
facilitate convergence of Czech per capita income to that of other advanced European
economies. Meanwhile, external uncertainties, including about growth prospects and geopolitical
tensions in the region, continue to cloud the near-term outlook. In this light, Directors stressed
the importance of a comprehensive growth strategy that includes supportive macroeconomic
policies and accelerated structural reforms.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors underscored the need for a growth-friendly fiscal strategy, anchored in a clear
medium-term framework. They generally supported the prudent easing of the fiscal stance in the
near term, geared toward increasing capital investment, particularly in infrastructure. At the same
time, they encouraged the authorities to continue to improve tax administration, combat tax
evasion, and use revenue over-performance for priority expenditures and debt reduction.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to the medium-term structural deficit target,
and looked forward to the adoption of a new medium-term fiscal framework, comprising fiscal
rules, a debt brake, and an independent fiscal council.
Directors noted that while inflation is projected to rise gradually toward the central bank’s target,
there remain a sizable output gap and considerable risks to the economic recovery. They
therefore saw merit in maintaining the current accommodative stance by keeping the exchange
rate floor in place while considering modalities for a timely exit. Directors agreed that the central
bank should continue to focus on inflation targeting and return to the floating exchange rate once
deflation risks recede and the inflation forecast and inflation expectations become entrenched
around the inflation target.
Directors observed that the financial system is sound and resilient, with banks maintaining strong
capital and liquidity buffers. They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant, conduct
proactive supervision, and improve the supervisory architecture in line with the European and
global initiatives, building on recent progress in implementing the FSAP recommendations.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ consideration of the pros and cons of joining the euro-area
banking union ahead of euro adoption.
Directors called for renewed momentum in structural reform to boost potential growth,
especially in light of demographic challenges. They recommended that priority be given to
increasing investment in physical and human capital, removing labor market rigidities, and
improving the business environment more broadly. They also encouraged further steps to
promote labor participation, advance research and development, and upgrade technical skills.

Statement by Johann Prader, Executive Director for Czech Republic
and Miroslav Kollar, Second Alternate Executive Director
August 27, 2014

The Czech economy has recovered from the negative growth of the last two years and is
experiencing a strong and balanced recovery. Households’ consumption growth has resumed and
is beginning to contribute meaningfully to economic growth. With stronger growth in the euro
area over the last twelve months, the external environment has been positive for Czech exports.
After graduating from the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure, fiscal policy is no longer a drag on
the economy. Private and public sector investments are picking up as demand continues to
improve, and the execution of projects from EU funds has improved.
The authorities expect the real GDP to grow in the order of 2.7 - 2.9 percent this year and in the
order of 2.5 - 3 percent next year. Risks to the forecast stem from the speed in EU funds
absorption, a continuation of the positive consumer sentiment, disinflationary risks in the euro
area, the development of global commodities prices, and geopolitical risks in Ukraine and Iraq.
The unemployment rate is projected to decline from its peak of 7 percent in 2013, to 6.4 in 2014,
and then 6.1 in 2015. The current account is expected to reach a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in
2014 (for the first time since 1993) and remain balanced in 2015.
The Czech economy has weathered last summer’s pullback of capital flows from emerging
markets well. Since 2008, the current account and fiscal deficits have decreased significantly and
the economy has become less reliant on foreign capital. As a result, and faced with decelerating
inflation, monetary policy has continued with easing, and fiscal policy can use the acquired fiscal
space to provide targeted support to the economy this year.
Monetary policy stance
The Czech National Bank (CNB) reached the zero interest rate bound in November 2012, but the
economy continued to experience weakness throughout 2013, households’ consumption was
weak, fiscal consolidation was ongoing and weak demand and economic uncertainty weighed
negatively on investment. Inflation slowed down rapidly over 2013 towards zero, with
households starting to postpone consumption as prices were falling.
Faced with the risks of a deflationary spiral, missing its inflation target, and the continued lowinflation environment in the euro area, the CNB launched foreign exchange interventions in the
fall of 2013 in order to further ease monetary conditions to bring inflation to its 2 percent
inflation target. The CNB adopted the commitment to intervene in the foreign exchange market
to weaken the koruna so as to maintain the exchange rate close to CZK 27 to the euro. The CNB
only intervened during the first few days after its announcement; the exchange rate adjusted
accordingly and has been above this level without significant fluctuations. The CNB
communicated that further changes to its exchange rate floor towards the greater weakening of
its exchange rate would be warranted only if economic conditions and the medium-term outlook
were to change significantly. The CNB is an inflation-targeting central bank and foreign

exchange interventions are used only as a tool to further ease monetary conditions in order to
reach the inflation target in situations when monetary policy interest rates have reached the zero
bound.
The fact that inflation was still only 0.5 percent in July (well below the lower boundary of the
tolerance band around the CNB’s inflation target) despite the slightly weaker exchange rate (27.8
CZK/EUR as of August 22) and in an environment where growth is picking up strongly suggests
that the output gap could have been even deeper than expected and the extent of households’
savings glut even greater than anticipated. Therefore, foreign exchange interventions have been
successful in averting the threat of a deflationary spiral.
The current CNB forecast sees more downside inflation risks than in the previous quarter, and
inflation gradually returning to the target from its presently very low levels in the second half of
2015, as wage growth in the business sector picks up. The Bank Board therefore decided to
continue using the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument at least until 2016 (originally
the beginning of 2015), on the condition that there is sufficient certainty after the exit from
foreign exchange interventions that inflation would not immediately fall below its target again.
The Bank Board continues to discuss the exit strategy, and exchanging views with Fund staff
during the June Article IV mission was very helpful in this regard. An exit from foreign
exchange intervention will not imply the appreciation of the exchange rate to the level recorded
before the CNB began to intervene, as the weaker exchange rate will in the meantime pass
through to the price level and other nominal variables.
Government policies
The new government took office in January 2014, aiming for more pro-growth policies and
emphasizing social policy priorities, while adhering to overall budgetary responsibility.
Fiscal policy
The Czech Republic exited the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure this year after considerable
fiscal consolidation that brought down the fiscal deficit from its peak of 5.8 percent of GDP in
2009 to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2013, primarily due to the increase in VAT rates and a reduction
in public investment. The government expects the fiscal deficit to reach 1.5 percent of GDP in
2014. In 2014, the government’s fiscal policy strategy expects to utilize this newly-created fiscal
space to support the domestic economy’s fragile recovery in the short term, with a neutral effect
in the medium term. Government investment (mainly as a result of the increase in investment
financed from EU sources) and government current spending (primarily on social benefits) are
projected to pick up this year, while there are only relatively moderate discretionary tax
measures planned for this year. The wage bill in the state administration was approved to
increase by 2 percent this year. Tax revenues are expected to improve in 2014 on the back of the
strengthening economy.
The gross government debt is expected to decline from 46.2 percent of GDP in 2012 to 46
percent of GDP in 2013, then 44 percent of GDP in 2014 (currently among the lowest in the EU).
The net financial government debt is estimated at 29.9 percent of GDP in 2014. Government

debt denominated in foreign currency is estimated at 14 percent of total debt (or 4.1 percent of
GDP, adjusted for collateral and assets). Expenditures on interest payments remain low and
yields on government bonds remain at a historical low, due to the stable debt development, the
country’s economic stability, and the favorable situation on global financial markets.
As to the modification of the tax legislation, the Lower House of Parliament already approved an
increase in the rates on the excise duty on tobacco products in line with EU requirements,
particularly due to the currency depreciation. As of January1, 2015, the government plans to
amend the personal income tax legislation, including by increasing tax credits for children and
reintroducing tax discounts for pensioners; to introduce a second, reduced VAT rate of 10
percent on drugs, books, and essential infant nutrition; and to abolish fees for prescription and
outpatient treatment.
The government is committed to the medium-term structural deficit objective of 1 percent of
GDP by 2020 and the headline deficit below 3 percent. In the medium term, the government
expects to reach a headline fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2017, and plans changes in the
area of direct and indirect taxation. The government’s priority is to increase the effectiveness of
tax collection and more successfully fight against tax evasion. The rationalization of expenditure
and savings in the government sector’s current expenditure are also among the key priorities.
The wage bill in the state administration is expected to grow by 1 percent in the medium term,
and the wages of medical doctors should increase in 2015 and 2016. A larger amount of funding
will be directed to the healthcare sector, as public and private spending on health care is below
the OECD average. The gross fixed capital formation of the government sector is expected to be
around 3 percent annually in the medium-term outlook horizon until 2017. The structural deficit
is expected to deteriorate to 1.7 percent of GDP by 2017 as a result of the reduced emphasis on
public sector consolidation. Government debt is projected to increase only slightly by 2017, in
view of the expected recovery of GDP growth.
The government committed to adopt the Fiscal Compact of the EU. Furthermore, the government
continues its work on the Constitutional Act on Fiscal Responsibility with the government’s aim
of enacting it in 2015. The Act will introduce numerical fiscal rules, a debt break, and a fiscal
council. Based on the agreement between the Government and the two political parties in the
parliamentary opposition, the new Civil Service Act is to be approved with a view to entering
into force on January 1, 2015.
Structural policies
In line with staff recommendations to increase labor force participation, a draft Act to introduce a
new type of service to provide childcare was adopted by the Lower House of the Parliament. The
government also aims to create suitable conditions for long-term sustainable employment, based
on a targeted active employment policy and by modifying the investment incentive system to
improve employers’ motivation to invest in regions with an above-average unemployment rate.
The government will also start implementing measures to reduce entrepreneurs’ administrative
and regulatory burden. The minimum wage should be increased annually in order to reflect the
socio-economic environment and to raise it over time to 40 percent of the average wage.

The government is returning to the pre-2012 rules for the indexation of pensions to allow for its
indexation based on the CPI index and real wage growth. From 2015, the average, independently
paid old-age pension will increase by at least 1.8 percent annually. The main goal is to stop the
decrease of the real value of pensions and to prevent the decrease of the standard of living of
pensioners.
With the measures from 2011 introducing increases in the retirement age, the average period of
pension payments was stabilized for the long term, in accordance with the expected future
demographic development and changes in life expectancy. However, being aware of the
uncertainty regarding demographic forecasts, the current government considered the possibility
to implement standardized procedures of regular revisions to the retirement age increase rate.
In line with the Policy Statement of the Government, an expert committee has been established
to propose changes to the current pension system with a view to bringing a long-term stable
setup of the system, enhancing the sustainability of its funding, and the adequacy of the provided
benefits. The Government also mandated the expert committee to submit a proposal for
termination of Pillar II of the pension system on January 1, 2016.
Financial sector
The Czech banking sector remains stable and sound. Czech banks follow a traditional banking
model, are well-capitalized (17.1 percent capital adequacy ratio) and continue to be some of the
most profitable in the region (18.4 percent return on equity). Bank lending is predominantly
financed by domestic deposits (a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74 percent, among the best in EU) and
foreign exchange loans to households are virtually non-existent. Banks operate in an
environment of excess liquidity. The net external position of the Czech banking sector is
positive. Non-performing loans are leveling up at 6.5 percent of total loans while non-performing
loan provisioning remains flat at 48 percent. Credit growth remains moderate, with growth in
loans to households being low and growth in loans to the non-financial corporate sector
stagnating due to weak domestic demand.
The CNB’s most recent bank stress tests again showed that the banking sector is sufficiently
resilient to even very unfavorable shocks, owing to its profitable business model, and strong
capital and liquidity position. The insurance sector also showed sufficient resilience to the
adverse scenario on account of its large capital buffer. The pension management company sector
(pillar III) remains sensitive to a rise in yields on securities holdings.
The Czech Republic transposed the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) into Czech
law as of June this year, with selected parts taking effect in 2015 and 2016, and banks are already
in compliance with the new regulation. The EU Directive establishing a framework for the
recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (BRRD) is expected to be
transposed into Czech law in 2015. The Czech authorities continue to address the weaknesses in
the non-systemic sector of credit unions, following up on the recent FSAP recommendations, by
closing down unviable businesses and strengthening the regulation for the sector. In line with
FSAP recommendations, the CNB also increased staff in financial sector supervision.

The Czech authorities thank the Article IV team for a constructive exchange of views during its
mission.
