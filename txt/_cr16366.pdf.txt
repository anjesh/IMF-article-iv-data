IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Cabo Verde

On November 18, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation1 with Cabo Verde.
In 2015, economic growth stagnated at 1.5 percent, slightly below the 1.9 percent registered in
2014. Tourism recovered and remittances remained robust, but FDI and public investment
slowed. The unemployment rate declined to 12.4 percent, as did youth unemployment, which
nevertheless remained high at 28.6 percent. Consumer price inflation remained muted owing to
lower food and energy prices, averaging 0.1 percent for 2015. On the external front, the current
account deficit shrank markedly to an estimated 4.25 percent of GDP, reflecting lower imports
due to the slowdown in public and foreign direct investment, the recovery in tourism and
continued strong remittances. International reserves increased to about 5.75 months of
prospective imports. In the first half of 2016, tourism continued its strong growth and FDI
accelerated, reflecting a large increase in the pipeline of projects.
In the absence of imminent pressures on the balance of payments or consumer prices and to
support the economic recovery, the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) reduced its policy rate by
25 basis points to 3.5 percent in February 2015, and lowered the minimum reserve requirement
ratio from 18 to 15 percent. Lending rates have so far been slow to respond, reflecting the
corporate debt overhang, and banks’ risk aversion. Asset quality and bank profitability remain a
concern, but capital buffers appear adequate, and non-performing loans (NPLs) have continued
to decline from their August 2014 peak of 22.4 percent, reaching 16.9 percent in June 2016.
With the authorities embarking on fiscal consolidation, the fiscal deficit fell to 4.1 percent of
GDP in 2015, about 3.4 percentage points less than the year before, on account of a strong
revenue performance. Total financing needs (including onlending to state-owned enterprises)
also declined by 2.3 percentage points to 8.3 percent of GDP as the investment program was

lowered to slow the buildup of public debt. Total public debt reached an estimated 125.8 percent
of GDP by end-2015, reflecting the scaling up of externally financed public investment since
2008 coupled with low growth, falling prices and the recent strong appreciation of the
U.S. dollar.
In 2016, growth is forecast to recover to 3.2 percent supported by FDI, domestic demand,
agriculture, and tourism, which should benefit from the mild upswing in Europe. Domestically,
consumer and investor confidence has started to recover, supported by continued strong
remittances and the accommodative monetary policy stance. Inflation is expected to remain
benign. The current account deficit should widen in 2016 reflecting strong FDI inflows and
related imports, while the large-scale public investment program is gradually phased out over the
medium term.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ macroeconomic management amid the difficult
external environment of recent years due to spillovers from the global financial and euro area
crises. Directors welcomed Cabo Verde’s long-term economic and social progress and that the
economy appears to be at the onset of a recovery with prospects for a marked acceleration of
growth in 2016. At the same time, Directors noted that the country is vulnerable to external
shocks, and that its public debt, while mainly on concessional terms, is high. They encouraged
fiscal consolidation to rebuild buffers, as well as structural reforms to promote the private sector
as the main engine of growth, bolster productivity, and facilitate long-term growth.
Directors welcomed the fiscal consolidation achieved in 2015 and the authorities’ plans to
restrain spending in 2016 and beyond. They recommended safeguarding critical social spending
and prioritizing strategic public investment projects while enhancing their efficiency. Directors
saw merit in efforts to bolster domestic revenue mobilization, and noted the role of Fund
technical assistance in supporting reforms in this area. They welcomed continued efforts to
improve the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and noted that acceleration of the privatization
program would help bolster private sector growth. Directors emphasized that the financial
difficulties of two state-owned enterprises require swift resolution and welcomed the authorities’
determination in that regard.
Directors agreed that the recent loosening of monetary policy and continued accommodative
stance is appropriate, given the slow private sector credit growth and provided there are no
pressures on international reserves or prices. However, Directors encouraged the authorities to
continue strengthening their liquidity management capacity to strengthen the monetary

transmission mechanism and thus the effectiveness of monetary policy, improve interbank
market efficiency, and continue developing the government securities market.
Directors supported continued efforts to safeguard financial stability and address non-performing
loans, including new regulations that facilitate their recognition and heightened bank
supervision. They welcomed the progress in following up on the recommendations of the 2009
Financial Sector Assessment Program and encouraged the authorities to implement the
remaining recommendations.
Directors emphasized the importance of stepping up the structural reform agenda to enhance the
economy’s resilience to external shocks and diversify its sources of growth. They called for
further progress on reforms to bolster competitiveness, including improving the business climate,
increasing labor market efficiency, and supporting education and vocational training to reduce
skill mismatches.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Cabo Verde appears to be at the onset of a recovery from the growth
slowdown of 2012–15. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks
notably from Europe, the main source of tourism revenue, FDI and remittances.
The Public Investment Program, while addressing key infrastructure gaps, has
contributed to a marked rise in public debt (125.8 percent of GDP in 2015). The Debt
Sustainability Analysis indicates that debt risks are high on account of the elevated stock
of debt, while debt service indicators remain comfortable.
Challenges: Policies should focus on sustaining the growth momentum while curbing
public debt. This would include reevaluating the public investment pipeline with a view
on reducing externally financed capital spending, and encouraging the private sector to
take on a larger role in investment and growth. Over the medium term, continued
implementation of the ambitious structural reform agenda is critical to help the country
reap the benefits of the infrastructure investment scaling up.
Key policy recommendations:


Fiscal consolidation remains key to macroeconomic and debt sustainability.
Addressing financial difficulties in state owned enterprises and improving
investment efficiency are central to healthy public finances.



In line with staff advice, the authorities revisited the scope and timeline of
externally financed public investment with a view to put external debt on a
downward path and lower the risk of debt distress in the medium term.



Monetary policy should remain accommodative while carefully monitoring
international reserves for any signs of pressure.



The authorities should remain vigilant regarding risks to financial stability, and
continue heightened supervision of the banking sector.



Structural reforms should continue, especially toward improving the business
environment and enhancing revenue performance. Reforms should be prioritized
based on expected returns and in line with reform implementation capacity.

CABO VERDE

CONTEXT: STALLING GROWTH, HIGH PUBLIC DEBT
A. The Long-Term Setting
1.
Cabo Verde has a robust democracy and has enjoyed prolonged political stability.
After 15 years in opposition, the center-right Movimento para Democracia (MpD) won an absolute
majority in the parliamentary elections of March 2016 and landslide victories in subsequent
municipal and presidential elections. The transfer of power was smooth, testifying to the country’s
institutional strength and maturity.
2.
Cabo Verde has made impressive progress in economic development and poverty
reduction over the last two decades. Cabo Verde’s rapid economic growth has allowed the
country to triple per capita GDP and graduate to middle-income country status. Living standards
have risen, and great strides have been made in reducing poverty.
3.
However, growth stalled in the aftermath of the global financial and the euro crises,
despite a substantial scaling up of public infrastructure investment (Figure 1). Starting in 2008,
the previous government scaled up public investment to build much needed infrastructure while
concessional resources were still available, providing a boost to the stuttering economy.
Despite this, growth over 2009–15 averaged only about 1.3 percent. Furthermore, over 2009–15
Cabo Verde’s growth trailed that of peer Small Middle Income Countries (SMICs), owing to higher
exposure to Europe (Figure 3).
4.
The public investment scaling up combined with lower than expected growth,
declining inflation and a strengthening U.S. dollar has pushed up public debt to GDP ratios.
Public debt reached 125.8 percent of GDP at end-2015. However, debt service remains manageable
owing to the high concessionality of external debt.
5.
With fiscal consolidation key to ensuring debt sustainability, the focus should be on
enabling the private sector to take on a stronger role in sustaining growth. As the authorities
wind down public investment and reduce financing needs, it is important to crowd in the private
sector to take advantage of the improved infrastructure. Policies should aim at devolving the
activities of public companies, ensuring a strong and competitive business environment, and
improving private access to finance.
6.
The new government which came into office in April 2016 has a comprehensive
agenda. Policy priorities include (i) fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt, in particular external
debt; (ii) containing or resolving contingent liabilities related to SOEs, in particular the national
housing company and airline; (iii) crowding in the private sector through improving the business
environment, increasing access to financing for SMEs, attracting FDI and promoting exports,
accelerating the privatization of SOEs, and connecting the local economy with the tourism sector;
and (iv) encouraging formalization of the informal sector.

CABO VERDE

B. Recent Developments
7.
Growth remained low in 2015 as the external environment remained challenging and
domestic demand lackluster. Real GDP growth stagnated at 1.5 percent in 2015, slightly below the
1.9 percent experienced in 2014. Solid performance in fisheries and agriculture contributed to
growth, as did tourism, but construction and services contracted, and private sector credit stagnated
due to weak demand and the corporate debt hangover from the real estate boom of previous years
which ended abruptly with the growth slowdown. Headline inflation remained muted owing to lower
food and energy prices, averaging 0.1 percent for 2015.
8.
The current account deficit contracted in 2015, and international reserve cover
improved. The current account deficit shrank markedly to an estimated 4¼ percent of GDP,
reflecting lower imports due to the slowdown in public and foreign direct investment, the recovery
in tourism and continued strong remittances, with reserve coverage of 5.8 months of prospective
imports. Tourism receipts increased by 3.3 percent and the number of tourists by 5½ percent in
2015, reflecting price competition and gains from the decline in tourism in North Africa.1
9.
The recovery showed signs of taking off in the first six months of 2016. Real GDP grew
by 5.9 and 3.6 percent respectively in the first and second quarter on account of tourism, agriculture,
and public services. Tourist arrivals grew by 16 percent. Domestic demand showed signs of recovery
as remittances remained strong and private sector credit inched up, reflecting the gradual reduction
of corporate non-performing loans (NPLs).
10.
Policy implementation was broadly in line with Fund staff advice (Text Table 1).
The authorities agreed that external debt should be curbed by reducing public investment while being
mindful of growth. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue their structural reform program but
advised a slightly more gradual approach, especially in the fiscal area where capacity constraints could
be a significant challenge. In line with Fund advice, the BCV reduced the minimum reserve
requirement to encourage credit growth and embarked on an accommodative monetary policy
stance. Furthermore, a new labor code increasing labor market flexibility and lowering the cost of staff
layoffs was submitted to parliament in late 2015 and entered into force in October 2016.

1

Growth in tourism in 2015 was 4.4 percent globally, led by Europe with 5 percent, while SSA saw zero growth, and
tourism in North Africa declined by 8 percent (World Tourism Organization, 2015).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS: THE RECOVERY CONTINUES,
BUT VULNERABILITIES REMAIN
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
11.
With spillovers from the global financial and euro crises having subsided, Cabo Verde’s
economy is expected to resume its higher growth trajectory driven mainly by tourism and FDI.
In 2016, growth is forecast to recover to 3.2 percent supported by FDI, domestic demand,
agriculture, and tourism, which should benefit from the mild upswing in Europe. Tourism-related FDI
worth €625 million (42 percent of 2016 GDP) from signed projects is expected over the medium
term, and further projects worth some €700 million are under discussion. Domestic demand is
expected to improve, reflecting the reversal of the long-term decline in confidence indicators, the
resumption of growth in private sector credit, and robust remittances. Average inflation is projected
to remain negative at about -1.6 percent in 2016.
12.
While growth prior to the recent slowdown averaged 6.8 percent during 2001–08,
recent experience and the global low-growth environment suggest that such a growth pace
may be difficult to attain. Over the medium term, trend growth of about 4 percent seems
achievable, drawing on peer experience and expected returns on large-scale public investment in
past years. 2 Inflation is expected to return to positive territory but remain benign over the medium
term. Tourism should continue growing at a strong pace, reflecting ongoing FDI and the resulting

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

increase in capacity, and goods exports are also projected to grow robustly. 3 Domestic demand is
projected to pick up, supported by rising credit growth and continued strong remittances.
Gross international reserves are forecast to remain above 5 months of prospective imports,
supported by tourism, FDI and remittances.
13.
The outlook remains subject to external and domestic downside risks (Table 6).
Externally, Cabo Verde’s high dependence on tourism and remittances makes it vulnerable to
adverse developments in Europe, including risks related to Brexit—about 20 percent of the country’s
tourists come from the UK. Global financial market volatility and sovereign stress could impede FDI
and be transmitted via the banking sector linkages to Portugal. Domestic risks are primarily fiscal, as
public debt has risen to uncomfortably high levels. The elevated level of NPLs indicates risks in the
financial sector, and continued weakness in credit creation could depress consumption and
investment.
14.
Over the longer term, economic growth will depend critically on increasing
productivity and strengthening the private sector. The implementation of productivityenhancing structural reforms—in particular in the areas of access to financing, labor market
efficiency, and human capital development—is crucial for increasing Cabo Verde’s long-term growth
potential. With the public investment program winding down, it will be important to crowd in the
private sector to take over as the engine of growth and reap the returns from improved
infrastructure.

B. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
15.
The risk of debt distress is high, though baseline debt service indicators remain at
comfortable levels (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Mainly reflecting the recent dollar appreciation
and lower GDP growth and inflation, total nominal debt reached 125.8 percent of GDP. The present
value (PV) of external debt to GDP reached 61.8 percent in 2015, exceeding the 50 percent
threshold, and is projected to gradually decline to below 50 percent in the medium term (Figure 1).
Debt sustainability remains highly sensitive to a depreciation shock.

Tourism in Cabo Verde is mainly supply constrained and the growth projection reflects the expected expansion of
capacity related to the very large pipeline of tourism related FDI as well as the expansion of airport capacities.
Growth in goods exports reflects mainly an expansion of fish processing as the industry is currently operating well
below capacity and seeking to increase the supply of fish.

C. External Stability Assessment
16.
The external position in 2015 was broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings, and short-term risks appear low. The External Stability Assessment
(ESA) finds that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, but underscores the
importance of enhancing the business environment (Appendix I). The two complementary
assessment models based on the extended External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology do
not indicate significant misalignments of Cabo Verde’s real exchange rate. 4 Cabo Verde’s current
account has been characterized by deficits mainly reflecting FDI and, more recently, government
borrowing. While the international investment position reached minus $235 million in 2015, it is not
considered a threat to external stability as it reflects continued net FDI inflows. International reserves
are projected to be broadly adequate at over 5 months of prospective imports over the medium
term (Appendix). However, the country’s high dependence on tourism and remittances represents
a significant external vulnerability in the longer run. Further improving the business environment—
particularly in the area of access to financing and labor market efficiency as well as by enhancing the
productivity of human and physical capital—will play an important role in diversifying production
and exports and increasing resilience to external shocks.

THE POLICY AGENDA
A. Fiscal Policy: Ensuring Debt Sustainability and Safeguarding Growth
17.
In 2015, budget execution was managed carefully and fiscal consolidation was
achieved on account of higher than expected revenue. Tax revenue increased strongly by about

12 percent in 2015. While this reflects the revenue administration reforms of recent years, it also
includes one-off effects which should not be carried over into the revenue projections for the outer
years.5 Capital spending was reprogrammed downward during the year, and the fiscal deficit
decreased to 4.1 percent of GDP, about 3.4 percent of GDP lower than in 2014. Overall financing
needs including onlending to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) declined from 10.6 percent of GDP in
2014 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2015.
18.
The main challenge for fiscal policy is to contain public debt and secure debt
sustainability without stifling the emerging growth recovery. Tax revenue is
expected to increase by about 1 percent of GDP over 2015–19, reflecting the economic recovery
and recent FAD-supported tax administration reforms, compensating for the decline in grants.
Current spending is predominantly funded by tax revenue and domestic financing, which is capped
at 3 percent of GDP annually. In contrast, the public investment program (PIP) that the new
government inherited is predominantly externally financed. To rein in debt without unduly
endangering the prospects for economic recovery, fiscal consolidation should focus on reducing
externally financed capital spending (which has a much lower multiplier of about 0.15 than current
spending due to high import content), while rationalizing current expenditure in line with past
practice.
19.
The 2016 budget and mid-2016 medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) envisioned an
expansionary fiscal policy stance for 2016–17 before embarking on a fiscal consolidation in
the outer years (Text Table 2, Authorities’ mid-2016 MTFF and PIP). Broadly in line with previous
Fund advice, the MTFF envisioned reducing total financing needs to about 4 percent of GDP by 2019
by rationalizing current spending and curtailing onlending. However, the consolidation path was
back-loaded and financing needs for 2016–17 were high.
20.
In light of the discussions, the authorities revised their 2016 budget, the MTFF, and the
associated externally financed PIP broadly in line with IMF staff advice (Text Table 2,
Authorities’ Current MTFF and PIP). In line with their commitment to fiscal consolidation, the
authorities agreed with staff advice that a stronger and more frontloaded fiscal consolidation
charting out a clear path toward debt reduction would send a strong signal of fiscal responsibility
to donors and investors. They implemented contingent containment measures already included in
the budget. The MTFF and PIP were revised by cutting domestically financed capital spending,
including to make space for sudden financial demands on the budget for a recapitalization of the
loss-making national airline TACV (Text Table 2); and by postponing several externally financed
projects to 2018–19, thus reducing the external debt build-up in 2016. These measures are quite
significant, especially in light of the abrupt need of TACV for financial support, and taking into

One-off effects result from the switch to intra-year collection of corporate income tax for 2015 in parallel to ex-post
collection for 2014, and collection of tax arrears. Tax arrears amounted to about 5 percent of GDP at end-2015, with
offsets due to pending VAT and income tax refunds of about 0.6 percent of GDP. The authorities are receiving
technical assistance from the Fund and bilateral donors in estimating the outstanding amounts and expedite the
clearing process.

Includes anticipated capitalization needs for SOEs.

21.
Budget execution is sufficiently flexible to reach the fiscal targets. Rather than a
commitment, current spending as approved by parliament represents a maximum amount of
authorized spending and can be cut by up to 30 percent in case revenue underperforms.
Similarly, the government can reduce capital spending.
22.
Efforts to enhance domestic revenue mobilization continued in 2014–15. In 2014
Cabo Verde completed an overhaul of the tax administration system by restructuring the revenue
administration, which became operational in September 2014. Staff welcomes the accelerated
efforts to collect the considerable VAT and corporate income tax arrears of about 5 percent of GDP.
In addition, tax declaration is now fully digitalized and conducted by the taxpayers themselves.
While this should help expedite tax payments and free human resources, its success will require
careful monitoring and the capacity to conduct targeted audits. Strengthening the capacity,
technical skills and IT of the national revenue administration (DNRI) remains a key priority.
23.
Structural fiscal reforms remain important to strengthen public finances. In the
medium term as concessional financing phases out, revenue mobilization efforts should continue.
Furthermore, the authorities will eventually also need to think about alternative domestic and
external financing options (see Selected Issues paper). Good management and maintenance of
infrastructure remains important. With reduced public investment, strengthening project evaluation

and implementation capacity is even more critical as is the selection of those projects that will
deliver the highest return on growth within the next few years. Staff welcomes the authorities’
ongoing efforts to strengthen the investment cycle by building a National Investment System and
enhancing the results based management of budget programs and projects, encompassing the
entire cycle from project formulation to selection, implementation and ex post evaluation.
24.
Swift and decisive action is needed with regard to two loss-making public enterprises
(SOEs) The situation of the national airline TACV—a longstanding problem which had already
worsened in 2015—continued to deteriorate in 2016 with operating losses requiring capital
increases from the budget to allow continuation of service. The financial situation of the housing
company (IFH) also deteriorated related to risks from its largest social housing project (€187 million),
requiring intervention and close monitoring. For these and other obligations for SOEs the authorities
have set aside CVE 2.5 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) in 2016 and CVE 1.1 billion annually through
2020. 7 Without urgent intervention, capital needs for TACV alone could rise to around 3.0 percent
of GDP in 2017, diverting much needed resources from growth enhancing expenditure.
25.
Further reform of other SOEs remains crucial to increase efficiency and reduce
contingent liabilities. SOEs account for about one third of the country’s GDP. According to
preliminary data for 2015, the aggregate result of all SOEs amounted to a loss of CVE 1.1 billion
(0.7 percent of GDP) on account of TACV, whereas contingent liabilities increased to CVE 41.4 billion
or 25.8 percent of GDP, from about 9 percent of GDP in 2014, primarily on account of loans
contracted by the IFH and the water and electricity (ELECTRA) company. Structural reforms,
recapitalization, and performance-based management contracts have generated encouraging
results at ELECTRA. Staff welcomes that mandatory performance contracts were extended in 2014 to
the remaining four SOEs which the authorities consider strategic. However, staff notes with concern
that customers have accumulated arrears to ELECTRA in the amount of CVE9.1 billion (5.5 percent of
GDP) and urges the authorities to step up collection efforts.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities pointed out that they are more optimistic for growth than staff.
Their growth forecast for 2016 is 3.5–4.5 percent, with a further acceleration in the following years.
27.
The authorities added that despite the high debt-to–GDP ratio, the debt is almost
exclusively concessional and debt service indicators continue to be comfortable.
This highlights Cabo Verde’s ability to service its debt.
28.
The authorities emphasized that they are fully committed to fiscal consolidation to
reduce debt risks, as evidenced by the adjustments in their MTFF. In tandem with this, the
authorities are stepping up their efforts to crowd in the private sector by accelerating privatization
(Section D).

7

Actual recapitalization payments for TACV from January to early September 2016 amounted to CVE 1.3 billion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

29.
The authorities noted that further reducing the externally financed PIP would be very
costly. All loans in the PIP pipeline had been contracted by the previous government. While the
authorities had made best efforts to stretch out and postpone projects to the extent possible,
cancellation of ongoing projects would be costly in terms of penalties and counterproductive.

B. Monetary Policy: Bolstering Private Credit and Protecting the Peg
30.
With muted inflation and robust international reserves, the BCV has taken an
appropriately accommodative monetary policy stance and measures to facilitate the
resolution of NPLs. In 2014, the BCV policy rate was cut by 200 basis points to 3.75 percent by
August 2014. In February 2015, the BCV further reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to
3.5 percent, lowered the minimum reserve requirement ratio (MRR) from 18 percent to 15 percent,
and cut the remuneration rate of excess reserves from 0.5 to 0.25 percent.
31.
Lending rates did not respond much, reflecting the corporate debt overhang and
banks’ risk aversion, but private sector credit started to grow again. Credit to the private sector
remained shy in 2015, with much of the 2.8 percent increase on account of SOEs. The BCV absorbed
excess liquidity to stabilize the monetary transmission mechanism, encourage the development of
the interbank market and discourage excessive risk-taking. However, with excess liquidity hovering
around 5 percent of deposits, the transmission mechanism remains weak and activity in the
interbank market is rare. The BCV pointed out that the cost of absorbing the full amount of excess
liquidity would be prohibitive.
32.
Credit growth is expected to accelerate. Confidence indicators suggest a gradual
improvement in the business climate and anecdotal evidence suggests that banks are cautiously
optimistic. Strong capital buffers combined with the NPL-resolution measures, low government
yields and the improved prospects of a sustained economic recovery should help credit extension
pick up in 2016.
Box 1. Cabo Verde: Financial Sector — Challenges and Opportunities
The financial benchmarking exercise in the attached Special Issues Paper shows that financial sector
performance is broadly in line with the estimated benchmarks, but a few issues deserve attention.
There is little financial sector activity outside of banking. Furthermore, asset concentration is high, and
lending activity is firmly concentrated in the top three banks (out of 8). While access to the banking
sector —measured by the number of branches per 100,000 adults— is high relative to expectations,
profitability is rather low, with returns from assets and equity significantly below the expected median.
Viewed together with the high asset concentration, this could suggest that the banking sector is
overcrowded.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

Box 1. Cabo Verde: Financial Sector — Challenges and Opportunities (concluded)
Furthermore, the paper examines whether the recent slowdown in private sector credit growth is
demand or supply driven. Using a disequilibrium model (Maddala and Nelson, 1974), staff estimates
show that, while demand factors have been the main drivers in Cabo Verde’s credit market in the late
2000s, supply factors’ role has increased in recent years. Accordingly, for Cabo Verde to promote more
sustainable private-sector led growth, reforms aiming at strengthening both credit demand and supply
will be essential.
Policies that aim at tackling demand-side obstacles could include increasing productivity by improving
the business environment for the private sector, and providing financial and business literacy training
to small businesses. Supply-side policies, on the other hand, could focus on: (i) strengthening the
financial sector through continued prudent banking supervision, (ii) reducing credit risks by resolving
the non-performing loan (NPL) overhang, and (iii) facilitating the reallocation of liquidity across banks
by developing the interbank market.

Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s views and analysis on the
monetary sector. They noted that credit growth in 2016 has shown signs of recovery, and agreed
that the monetary policy stance needs to remain accommodating provided that international
reserves remain strong.

C. Financial Supervision: Increasing Resilience
34.
Asset quality and bank profitability remain a concern, but capital buffers appear
adequate (Table 5). Despite high lending rates, profitability is depressed by low credit extension and
high NPLs. Short-term commercial bank spreads dropped sharply in early 2016, but longer-term
spreads increased, maintaining the average spread at 7.3 percent. NPLs which peaked at
22.3 percent in August 2014 continued to decline to 16.5 percent at end-2015, but inched up to
16.9 percent in June 2016. Capital adequacy has slightly declined to 14.8 percent in June 2016, yet
provisions to NPLs remain quite strong at about 53 percent.
35.
The authorities have taken regulatory measures to facilitate the resolution of NPLs and
thus encourage credit growth. In February 2015, the BCV extended the time period to liquidate
repossessed assets from NPLs from 2 to 5 years. In tandem, the finance ministry has postponed tax
collection to the time of sale of repossessed assets. Meanwhile, the BCV has continued its
heightened supervision and is in the process of making it even more pro-active by reinforcing its
supervision team and stepping up on-site audits. At the same time, it continues to encourage banks
and corporates to recognize and address NPLs.
36.
However, Cabo Verde continues to lag in financial market development. Although
Cabo Verde’s ranking in the WEF financial market development index has improved, it still trails the
country’s institutional development. The interbank money market only recently resumed activity

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CABO VERDE

after a couple of years of hiatus, suggesting that the reputational stigma attached to borrowing in
the interbank market may have eased. However, a secondary market for BCV and government bills
still needs to be established and activated. This would also help in preparing alternative financing
options beyond concessional borrowing in the medium to longer term (see Selected Issues paper).

D. Structural Reforms: Passing the Baton to the Private Sector for LongTerm Growth
37.
Further improvements in the business climate remain crucial to job creation and
private sector growth. There has been progress in recent years, for example in Cabo Verde’s move
from 122nd place in 2013/14 to 110th place in 2016/17 in the World Economic Forum global
competitiveness rankings. Importantly, a new labor code increasing labor market flexibility and
lowering the cost of staff layoffs came into effect on October 1, 2016. In late 2014, Cabo Verde
Investimentos (CI) launched an online one-stop-platform to ease the investment process for foreign
investors. Earlier in 2016, CI was transformed into Cabo Verde Trade-Invest to enhance the synergies
between FDI and export promotion, in particular in the tourism sector. In September 2016, the
authorities entered into a collaboration agreement to establish an African Growth and Opportunity
Act (AGOA) Trade Resource Center to promote exports. Also earlier in 2016, a credit guarantee
scheme (CV Garante) to facilitate financing for small and micro businesses became operational.
In 2015, the government provided for the establishment of credit bureaus to improve credit
information and ultimately access to financing—establishment of these bureaus should be
accelerated. Analytical work indicates that lack of know-how in accessing financing is a major factor
holding back credit extension—relevant training should be expanded.
38.
Despite a downward trend, unemployment remains high, in particular among youths
and women, pointing to structural reform needs to further reduce labor market rigidities and
in particular skill mismatches. The average unemployment rate declined from 15.8 percent (2014)
to 12.4 percent (2015), with higher unemployment observed in less connected islands.
Youth unemployment is particularly high, although it decreased from 35.8 percent in 2014 to
28.6 percent in 2015. While unemployment is overall higher among men than women, the highest
rates of unemployment are observed among young women between the ages of 15–19 and 20–24
who reside in rural areas. Analytical work also indicates that closing the gender gap in labor force
participation could increase per capita income by as much as 12 percent, depending on the
absorption capacity of the economy and the labor productivity of new entrants (Box 2).
Vocational training should be expanded and better aligned with the current and future needs of the
economy.

CABO VERDE

Box 2. Cabo Verde: Closing the Gender Gap
Demographic transition. Cabo Verde is currently undergoing a demographic transition with social
and economic implications for its development path going forward. As Cabo Verde’s demographic
transition slows, the size and potential of demographic dividends post-2015 will drop due to the
slowdown of the proportion of working-age population.
The gender gap. In this context, efforts towards closing the gender gap and making growth more
inclusive will become increasingly important. In 2014, the labor force participation rate of women was
51.2 percent of the total female working-age population; for men, it was 65 percent. The gap in labor
force participation is large, especially for young women and women in rural areas. Women tend to
enter the labor force later (age of 25–29) and leave it earlier (age of 55–59). A gender gap exists in the
labor market participation rate, employment conditions, and use of time dedicated to unpaid work.

Underlying labor market characteristics. According to the 2010 census, informality in the labor
market is high in Cabo Verde, with 59 percent of the workforce reporting working with no contract
(INE, 2015). The majority of these informal workers are women who mostly work in retail, family homes,
and agriculture. More women report being engaged in unpaid work (90%) compared to men (73%);
and women spend on average about 3.5 hours more than men on unpaid work each day. These gaps
increase with decreasing standards of living and levels of education, and with larger numbers of
dependents. The 2010 census also indicated that family tasks are a limiting factor for female access to
the labor force.
Impact on growth. Marone1 (2016), specifically on the Cabo Verde case, estimates that closing the
gender gap in labor force participation would increase the total labor force participation rate by
12.2 percent (26,428 workers) and could have a direct impact on the level of GDP between 7.4 to
12.2 percent. The actual impact of closing the gender gap on GDP would depend on several factors
such as the absorption capacity of the economy and the labor productivity of new entrants.
These results underline the fact that women tend to be one of the most “underutilized assets” in the
economy.

CABO VERDE

Box 2. Cabo Verde: Closing the Gender Gap (concluded)
Policy options. Improving women’s effective participation in the labor market requires well-designed
and integrated policies. In the Cabo Verde context, two main sets of policies could be effective: a focus
on decreasing time spent by women for unpaid work and a focus on increasing the employability and
hiring of women. The first policy set includes expanding the capacity and affordability of care services,
promoting shared responsibility in the care of dependents, more targeted cash transfer policies, and
other development initiatives such as increased access to water and electricity. The second set of
policies includes policies to promote flexible work arrangements, female entrepreneurship, specific
training that is integrated with economic diversification initiatives, access to financing, and awareness
campaigns to increase gender diversity in business.

39.
The privatization program has been accelerated. In 2014, the ministry of finance
established a unit to encourage and plan private-public partnerships and privatization, and oversee
the privatization of SOEs. Privatization of minority holdings in companies was accelerated starting in
2014. A modernized privatization law and a new Public-Private Partnership (PPP) law laying the legal
foundation for PPPs came into effect late in 2015. The authorities are currently reassessing the entire
privatization program to align it with the new government’s priorities.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Cabo Verde is at a crucial stage in its economic development where the private sector
will need to take over as driver of growth as public investment will gradually decline.
Given the high public debt and several major investment projects at or near completion, the
authorities have decided to gradually phase out the PIP. Private investment needs to take over as
the main growth engine in order to take advantage of the improved infrastructure and ensure
sustained long-term growth. To that end, accelerating the privatization program is an important
step in the right direction. In addition, the authorities need to continue improving the business
climate, enhance the efficiency of the financial sector, and ensure private sector compliance with the
new labor code.
41.
Staff forecast an acceleration of the recovery, but vulnerabilities remain. Staff expect
growth to continue to pick up speed and reach about 4 percent in the medium term, powered by
tourism and trade, and supported by FDI, remittances and private sector credit growth. Accelerated
progress on structural reforms could help growth reach an even higher trajectory. However,
vulnerabilities remain. Remittances and tourism growth could be thwarted by the implications of
Brexit on both the UK and the euro area, and credit to the private sector could be held back by a
slow resolution of NPLs.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

42.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation to address debt
risks. The revised PIP essentially foresees a gradual phasing out, as decided by the authorities.
These measures should help Cabo Verde regain a moderate risk of debt distress over the medium
term. Staff initially advised an even deeper and more frontloaded consolidation, but understands the
limits to consolidation as changes to ongoing investment projects need to be agreed with creditors
and contractors. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal consolidation path is necessary and realistic as
budget execution is flexible. The authorities will need to stay the course on fiscal consolidation and
should be ready to implement in-year expenditure containment if revenue falls short.
Staff welcomes the reforms taken to bolster tax revenue. The priority should now be on bringing
these reforms to fruition, including by strengthening the human resource and IT capacity.
43.
The financial situation of TACV and IFH requires urgent action and careful monitoring.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ determination to swiftly tackle the problems at TACV and reduce and
then eliminate recapitalizations, in close cooperation with the World Bank. Regarding IFH, staff
welcomes the government’s intention to quickly appoint a commission to review and salvage the
project with assistance from the World Bank.
44.
Staff commends the BCV for the timely decision to ease monetary conditions and
measures to facilitate the resolution of NPLs. Continued benign inflation and strong international
reserves should allow monetary policy to remain accommodative for the foreseeable future, while
monitoring euro interest rates, domestic liquidity conditions and international reserves for any signs
of pressure. In the medium term, strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism
(with MCM support) remains a key objective. Staff also considers that it is important to expedite the
resolution of NPLs to strengthen the banking sector and facilitate private sector credit growth.
45.
Staff welcomes the steps taken by the BCV to ensure financial stability, and supports
measures to improve financial market efficiency. The BCV should continue its heightened
supervision (including the provisioning for NPLs), implementing the regulations of the new banking
laws and, together with the finance ministry, making the Financial Stability Committee fully
operational to enhance crisis preparedness
46.
The macroeconomic policy mix is broadly appropriate. Fiscal consolidation is expected to
continue in 2016 and the medium term, supported by higher tax revenue and careful rationing of
current and capital spending. The fixed exchange rate regime has anchored macroeconomic
stability in Cabo Verde, and external stability does not appear to be at risk. However, the rapid
development of tourism has increased dependence on the sector, and Cabo Verde remains
vulnerable to exogenous shocks in particular from Europe. This reinforces the importance of
structural reforms to support economic diversification and enhance competitiveness to set growth
on a broader footing. At the same time, careful macroeconomic management remains crucial to
safeguard the peg and macroeconomic stability.
47.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12 month cycle.

Japan, and the United States) and
exacerbating legacy financial imbalances

NPLs have risen significantly in the
recent years, reflecting the slow
economic activity and intensified
supervision. Although NPLs as a share
of total loans have stabilized in 2015,
with the economy still being weak,
NPLs could rise further.

The banking system as a whole is fairly well
capitalized. Most banks have majority
foreign ownership and outside capital
would likely be available for
recapitalization. However, there is little
fiscal space for any public bail-out.

The authorities have adopted a
detailed agenda to reform SOEs.
However, implementation could be
delayed due to political challenges.

Medium/High
Financial weaknesses in some of the largest
SOEs represent contingent liabilities for the
government. As of end-2015, the debt of
SOEs amounted to 38 percent of GDP.
Persistent weak financial performance of
SOEs could crowd out public investment
and threaten fiscal sustainability.

Medium
Implementation of needed structural
reforms could be delayed due to
political concerns, especially in the
labor market (where Cabo Verde is
particularly uncompetitive)

Medium
Cabo Verde’s long-term growth depends
critically on bolstering productivity. Delays
in advancing the structural reform agenda
hinder external competitiveness, potential
GDP growth and employment.

Work with banks to
accelerate NPL
resolution and increase
fiscal space to widen
policy options.

Proceed with structural
reforms following the
example of Electra, and
consider privatization
when possible.

To crowd-in the private
sector, accelerate
structural reforms,
improve the banking
sector’s intermediation
ability, and improve
access to financing.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline scenario path discussed in this policy note, which
is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff. The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding this baseline.

Appendix I. External Stability Assessment
The external position in 2015 was broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings, and risks appear low. The real effective exchange rate is broadly aligned
with macroeconomic fundamentals. Competitiveness has improved but substantially more progress
is needed. Improving the business environment—such as access to financing, inefficient
bureaucracy, and labor flexibility—and increasing the productivity of human and physical capital
remain critical for bolstering medium- and long-term growth.
A. External Sector Developments
1.
Cabo Verde’s balance of payment has been characterised by a current account
deficit (about 10 percent over the period 2003–15) fuelled primarily by FDI and
government borrowing. FDI was the main driver of imports until 2008. However, FDI and grants
have since declined owing to the euro crisis, and the current account deficit has been increasingly
driven by government borrowing to finance investment, leading to a rise in external public debt.
Cabo Verde’s net international investment position reached minus $235 million in 2015, reflecting
the long-term trend of net inward flows of FDI, and thus suggesting that it does not pose a threat
to external stability.
2.
The current account deficit fell in 2015 to 4.3 percent of GDP (from 9 percent of
GDP in 2014), in part due to a fall in imports and a strong increase in emigrant remittances.
Over the medium term, staff forecasts the current account deficit to widen to about 8 percent of
GDP in 2017 owing to strong FDI and recovering growth, and then to gradually improve to
around 7 percent of GDP as goods exports continue to grow and the tourism sector recovers.
3.
International reserve coverage is broadly adequate at over 5 months of prospective
imports. The optimal reserve level has previously been estimated in the interval of 3.7–5 months
of prospective imports, and an updated assessment using the Fund’s LIC/MIC framework
estimates it at about 4 months of imports. 1 However, a higher level could be preferable taking
into account vulnerabilities stemming from the country’s size and lack of export diversification.

Model-Based Assessment

4.
Cabo Verde’s real exchange
rate has been relatively stable over
the past decade. In 2015, the real
effective exchange rate (REER)
remained in line with the average
over the past five years (Figure 2).
However, the observed moderate
cumulative appreciation over the last
decade may signal some erosion in
external competitiveness.

Figure 2. Cabo Verde: Real Exchange Rate

5.
Model-based assessments
indicate that Cabo Verde’s real
exchange rate is broadly in line
with its fundamentals. The two
complementary assessment models based on the extended External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite)
methodology do not indicate significant misalignments of Cabo Verde’s real exchange rate. 2 The
current account (CA) model of the EBA-lite methodology estimates a CA norm of -7.4 percent of
GDP for 2015 against the actual CA balance of -4.3 percent of GDP, implying that Cabo Verde’s
REER may be undervalued by 8 percent (Table 1). Out of the CA gap of 3.1 percent of GDP, only 0.2
percent of GDP is estimated to be due to policy. The REER index model of the EBA-lite

2

See IMF Policy Paper “Methodological Note on EBA-Lite”, February 2016.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

methodology, on the other hand, suggests that Cabo Verde’s REER for 2015 may be overvalued by
about 4 percent, out of which about -2½ percent is estimated to be related to policy. Although the
two assessment models point to opposite directions of REER misalignment, the results are below
the 10-percent threshold for the misalignments to be deemed statistically significant.
Table 1. Cabo Verde: Results of EBA-Lite Assessment
based on the CA Model

Figure 3. Cabo Verde: Results of EBA-Lite
Assessment based on the REER Index Model

C. Broader Competitiveness Indicators
6.
Cabo Verde’s competitiveness has improved, but it still lags behind the middleincome country average. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), Cabo Verde ranks
110th out of 138 countries in 2016–17 on global competitiveness, with considerable room for
improvement in labour market efficiency, financial market development, business sophistication
and innovation. (Table 2) The most problematic factors for doing business in Cabo Verde were
suggested to be access to financing, government bureaucracy, tax rates and complexity of the tax
system, and restrictive labor regulations. (Figure 4) Structural reforms aimed at improving the
business climate therefore remain critical for enhancing competitiveness and attracting private
investment.

Negative sign indicates worsening score; otherwise indicates improvement.

D. Conclusion
7.
An assessment of the real effective exchange rate suggests that there is no
indication of significant misalignment, but broader indicators show that structural
competitiveness issues remain. Cabo Verde’s external competitiveness in the medium and long
term will depend crucially on increasing competitiveness and productivity of both human and
physical capital. To this end, the government has carried out a large investment program in
infrastructure, initiated labour market reforms and is committed to reform weak SOEs. However,
more progress is required—particularly in improving the business environment.

Based on the Staff baseline scenario, Cabo Verde’s risk of external debt distress rating is assessed as
high, up from the moderate rating in the previous DSA. 1 Total public debt is expected to reach
considerably higher levels over the medium term than projected in the previous Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA). While public debt is high, it is overwhelmingly on highly concessional terms.
The assessment of high risk is reinforced by risks stemming from a slower-than-expected growth in
the Euro area, rising domestic debt, and contingent financial liabilities related to state-owned
enterprises. The authorities have taken important steps to contain the risk of debt distress, including
faster fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework underlying the
2014 Article IV report, with a particular focus on shifting the execution of some public investment
projects to beyond 2018. The debt situation bears careful monitoring in light of growth and
exchange rate vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND
1.
This DSA reflects official debt stock data for end-2015, and additional information
available as of October 2016. The staff’s fiscal projections for 2016–19 (Table 3a in the Staff
Report) are used to project debt-creating flows. The debt data include central government external
and domestic debt, and external debt contracted by the central government on behalf of stateowned enterprises (also referred to as "onlending"). The data do not include the domestic debt
contracted directly by state-owned enterprises and local governments that carry a centralgovernment guarantee; at end-2015, this debt was estimated at about 6.1 percent of GDP
(preliminary data). Projections for such publicly-guaranteed debt for 2016 and beyond were not
available at the time of this assessment.
2.
Private external debt is relatively low. Private external debt is estimated using non-bank
private sector debt data, and balance of payments data on bank liabilities to non-residents. On this
basis, private external debt was estimated at around 13 percent of GDP at end-2015. The authorities
compile non-bank private sector debt, but there is need for a more systematic monitoring of the
repayment flows.
3.
Total public debt in Cabo Verde continued to increase in 2015 as a result of the Public
Investment Program (PIP). The stock of public debt increased markedly from about 114.5 percent
of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 125.8 percent of GDP at end-2015, driven primarily by external debt
accumulation to finance the scaling-up of infrastructure. However, low growth, declining prices and
the appreciation of the U.S. dollar have also contributed significantly to the increase in the debt
ratio.

While external public debt is high, it is overwhelmingly concessional. Multilateral
institutions, in particular the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank, are the main
external creditors. Cabo Verde’s external public debt—including commercial debt, which is
subsidized by Portugal—has a long maturity profile and low average interest rates (Text Table 2).

5.
Cabo Verde’s domestic public debt has risen lately, but its structure and maturity remain
favorable. The government’s ability to finance the PIP through concessional external loans has helped
keep domestic debt at about 29 percent of GDP at end-2015. Moreover, the authorities strive to limit
domestic financing of the deficit to 3 percent of GDP per year. At end-2015 the National Pension Fund
held about 43 percent of domestic debt, and the rest was held by the banking system. Treasury bonds
make up about 96 percent of domestic debt. The average maturity of domestic debt at end-2014 was
about 7 years and the average interest rate was 5.7 percent. Domestic debt is projected to increase
gradually, peaking at about 38 percent in 2029 before declining to 35 percent in 2036, while external
debt is repaid and net foreign borrowing remains low.
6.
Cabo Verde is a strong policy performer for the purpose of determining the debt
burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Cabo Verde’s rating on the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 3.9 (on a scale of 1 to 6)
during 2013–15. Based on its 2015 CPIA score, Cabo Verde ranks second among IDA-recipient
countries in the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. The corresponding external public debt burden
thresholds for high risk are shown in Text Table 3.

BASELINE SCENARIO UNDERLYING THE DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
7.
The assumptions underlying the current DSA differ in a number of ways from those
used in the 2014 Article IV Consultation (Text Table 4 and Box 1). While the current baseline
scenario still assumes a rebound of economic activity in the medium term, the growth forecast for
2016–20 is overall lower than in the previous DSA owing to the shifting of some public investment
projects into later years. The GDP deflator is projected slightly lower, reflecting the low inflation in
the country and in the Euro area. The baseline scenario also assumes a different profile of fiscal
consolidation, reflecting the most recent MTFF. The current account deficit is also projected slightly
higher, reflecting the large pipeline of FDI for the next few years. Most importantly, the exchange
rate depreciation versus the dollar of about 30 percent at end-2015 is carried forward in the
projections, contributing significantly to the increase in the PV of debt.

CABO VERDE

Box 1. Cabo Verde: Macroeconomic Assumptions of the Baseline Scenario, 2016–36
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up after the slowdown in 2012–15, and settle at about 4 percent per
year in the long term. Growth assumptions are based on continued good performance in the tourism sector,
better conditions in the euro area, resumption of private credit growth, some product diversification into
areas like agriculture and fisheries, and an increase in productivity owing to payoffs from the PIP and from
structural reforms. In addition, medium-term growth projections take into account the impact of PIP
containment on the economy over 2015–17, as well as the postponement of several projects to 2018–20 and
beyond.
Fiscal policy. In the medium term (2015–20), the fiscal deficit and overall financing needs are expected to
decline by 4.1 and 5.9 percent of GDP, respectively, in line with the latest MTFF. Fiscal consolidation is
expected to continue in the long run, with the government continuing to reduce its financing needs as the
concessional borrowing window closes. In the long run (2019–36), with fiscal consolidation complete and
onlending coming to an end, net financing needs are projected to stay below 2 percent of GDP per year.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to widen in 2016–19 owing to the expected increase
in economic activity, public investment and FDI (which will drive up imports) and decline gradually
afterwards, as the Public Investment Program winds down.
Consumer price inflation and the GDP deflator are projected not to exceed 2 percent.
Financing. The concessionality of new external loans will decline significantly starting from 2019, and the
baseline assumes a slightly more accelerated move towards non-concessional financing than the previous
DSA. In addition, the baseline assumes that domestic financing will remain below 3 percent of GDP.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
E. External Public Debt
8.
Under the staff baseline scenario, the PV of external debt to GDP breaches the
50 percent threshold significantly. The PV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is
expected to peak at 64.4 percent of GDP in 2017, gradually decreasing to below 50 percent by 2023
(Figure 1). The debt service indicators remain safely below the threshold throughout 2036.
9.
Cabo Verde’s ability to service its debt is most sensitive to a growth slowdown
(embedded in the historical scenario) and a one-time depreciation shock. The PV of the debtto-exports and debt-to-revenue ratio, and the debt service to revenue ratio would breach the
threshold under the historical growth scenario. The PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio would breach
the threshold under a bound test that entails a 30 percent nominal depreciation shock in 2016, and
so would the debt-service-to-revenue ratio (Table 1b, scenario B6). Debt service rises over the
medium term owing to the grace period ending for several loans, but remains sustainable and
considerably below the threshold in the baseline scenario throughout the projection period.

CABO VERDE

F. Total Public Debt
10.
Total public debt peaks at about 130 percent, and its present value at 96.1 percent of
GDP in 2017, and declines gradually over the projection period (Table 2a, Figure 2). The PV of
total public debt exceeds the 74 percent benchmark and remains above it until 2028. Furthermore,
the debt outlook is vulnerable to a prolonged economic slowdown; developments in the Euro zone,
which would affect growth by depressing remittances and tourism income; and realization of losses
on contingent liabilities associated with SOEs. With regards to remittances, which accounted for
roughly 12 percent of GDP in 2015, there are also vulnerabilities related to financial stability. While
these flows have remained fairly stable over many years, problems in a systemic bank could cause
emigrants to re-assess their financial investment in Cabo Verde and withdraw their funds. Regarding
SOEs, while the financial situation of ELECTRA has improved during 2013–15, TACV’s financial
circumstances and the situation at IFH have deteriorated sharply.
11.
Public debt sustainability is sensitive to various alternative scenarios and stress tests
(Table 2b). The expansion of public debt is most pronounced under the scenario which keeps real
growth and the primary balance at historical averages. However, a primary balance as high as that
over the past decade seems unlikely, given that the primary balance over 2005–14 reflects a
temporarily high level of public investment.
12.
Public debt sustainability is also vulnerable to contingent liabilities associated with the debt
of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). At end-2015 (preliminary data), SOE-related contingent liabilities
amounted to 25 percent of GDP, up from 9 percent of GDP in 2014. If the financial situation of SOEs
were to deteriorate to such an extent that the central government had to take on all of this debt
(and respect the 3 percent limit on domestic financing), debt sustainability would be further
jeopardized, the serviceability of public debt would be put under significant strain.

G. Comparison with the Previous Debt Sustainability Analysis
13.
The PV of external debt does breach the threshold under the staff baseline scenario—
which was not the case in the previous DSA—and public debt peaks at a higher level. In the
previous DSA, the PV of external debt to GDP in 2015 was 48.5, and in the current DSA it increases
to 61.8, breaching the 50 percent threshold. While the debt profile has deteriorated owing to lower
than expected nominal GDP and a strong appreciation of the U.S. Dollar, the authorities PIP
containment measures were crucial in curbing the PV of external debt to GDP. In addition, while in
the previous DSA public debt peaked at 108 percent of GDP (in 2016), in the current DSA it reaches
130 percent in 2017.

H. The Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the results of the DSA. They noted, however,
that although the external debt level is high, the public investment scaling up that contributed to it
should help increase potential growth and boost revenue in the long term. In addition, the
authorities remarked that while the PV of external debt is high, the debt service indicators remain
comfortably below the threshold in the baseline scenario.

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION
15.
Based on the external debt burden indicators, the current DSA finds that the risk of
debt distress is high but Cabo Verde retains its capability to service its debt. The PV of external
debt to GDP threshold is breached over the 20-year projection period under the baseline scenario,
and the breach is significant. 2 Furthermore, debt sustainability remains sensitive to a depreciation
shock. However, the debt service indicators are comfortably below their respective thresholds.
16.
The authorities should stay the course on their fiscal consolidation which should help
set the country on the path to moderate risk of debt distress by 2023. Broadly in line with staff
advice, the authorities have embarked on a fiscal consolidation driven in large part by a reduction in
externally financed capital spending. The fiscal adjustment envisioned is realistic, and necessary to
give a strong message of fiscal responsibility to development partners and investors.,

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Safeguards Assessments
Two safeguards assessments of the Bank of Cabo Verde (BCV) were completed in 2002 and 2008.
The 2008 assessment was conducted voluntarily at the request of the authorities regarding the
Policy Support Instrument (PSI). It concluded that the BCV had adopted some of the measures
recommended in 2002, but also made new recommendations to address further safeguards
vulnerabilities notably in the internal audit mechanism, system of internal controls, and transparency
practices. Although the implementation of certain safeguards recommendations remains work in
progress, the BCV has since improved the completion of the audits and the publication of audited
financial statements on its website.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement of Cabo Verde is a conventional fixed peg.
The escudo has been pegged to the euro at a rate of CVE 110.265 per euro since January 4, 1999.
Cabo Verde accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Articles of Agreement
effective July 1, 2004. It maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Previous Article IV Consultation and PSI Reviews
The Executive Board concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation and approved a 15-month PSI
arrangement in November 2010 (Country Report No. 10/349). The Executive Board concluded the
first review under the PSI on a lapse-of-time basis on July 22, 2011 (Country Report No. 11/254); and
the second and final review on January 30, 2012 (Country Report No. 12/29). The Executive Board
concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation in April 2013 (Country Report No. 13/52). The Executive
Board concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation on May 28, 2014 (Country Report No. 14/296).

WORLD BANK AND IMF COLLABORATION
The IMF and the World Bank Cabo Verde teams maintain an ongoing exchange of views on relevant
macroeconomic and structural issues. The intense cooperation and the coordination include the
following:


Article IV consultations. The World Bank representatives met with the country team before
and during the 2016 IMF Article IV mission. This facilitated the discussions and provided
valuable input, in particular in the areas of mutual interest such as public financial
management, performance of state-owned enterprises, and investment planning.



Joint managerial action plan. The IMF and World Bank teams meet regularly to discuss and
exchange views on relevant issues. The Fund provides macroeconomic framework updates
crucial for the Bank’s sectoral work. The Bank’s work programs comprise work in the
following areas: poverty reduction, public sector efficiency, competitiveness and private
sector development, and management of state-owned enterprises. The Bank’s tourism
development study was completed in July 2013, while the Country Economic Memorandum
was completed in December 2013, covering the key challenges and structural reforms that
could potentially increase productivity-driven growth and broad-based poverty
reduction. The Bank has commenced the preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic
which will inform the next strategy due in 2017. The two teams have also engaged very
closely on discussions on public financial management and debt sustainability.



Joint Staff Advisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The staffs have
prepared a JSAN on the Third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP-III)
2012–16.

The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The following table describes
specific activities planned by the two country teams over the fiscal years 2016/2017. The Fund will
continue to lead on macroeconomic analysis, and the Bank will continue to lead on SOE reform and
investment planning. The two teams will closely cooperate in preparing a joint DSA.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 18, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. At the
same time improvements are needed in national accounts, government finance, and external
sector statistics. The authorities are taking steps to strengthen statistics, but the statistical system
still suffers from a shortage of financial and human resources. A comprehensive master plan has
been developed under the direction of the National Statistical Institute (INE), which assesses the
need for upgrading the agencies that constitute the statistical system and outlines steps to
broaden and improve all areas of statistics.
National Accounts: Significant improvements have been made to the national accounts—with
technical assistance from IMF STA—including the timely release of quarterly and yearly GDP data.
The most recent annual GDP data released are for 2015 (released in March 2016). In the past few
years, INE has worked on a complete overhaul of the national accounts. More specifically, INE has
implemented the estimation of GDP at chained prices—as recommended by the 1993 System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA)—as well as changing the base year from 1980 to 2007. The annual
national accounts based on the new methodology were presented for the first time in July 2013,
for 2011 and the backward projections of the old series of 2002–10. The quarterly national
accounts by the production approach were published for the first time in April 2015. Future
technical assistance missions will work on a GDP rebasing and developing estimates for
expenditure-side GDP components.
Full implementation of the 2008 SNA and quarterly national accounts require substantial
improvement in source data collection, for which capacity is currently limited. While capacity of
INE staff is found to be overstretched, INE has an ambitious target to continue building its
statistics series—ranging from business, household, and labor force surveys to governance
and security surveys. In addition, INE assesses in detail and corrects individual source data
entries—something not generally undertaken in most countries by national account compilers.
Given capacity constraints, a greater prioritization amongst data collection is encouraged.
Further technical assistance on how to preliminarily estimate or extrapolate economic activity
from random sampling surveys in various sectors could lead to crucial improvement in national
accounts estimates and the timeliness of the release.
Price Statistics: A revamped Consumer Price Index (CPI) with new methodology was launched in
February 2008. The previous official CPI was based on weights dating back to 1989, four years
before imports were liberalized. Import liberalization considerably changed consumption
patterns. INE has received assistance, from the National Statistics Institute of Portugal and IMF
STA CPI missions during 2006–07, to support the introduction and dissemination of the revised
CPI. The new index has new weights and an updated commodity basket. Price statistics are
published on a monthly basis and in a timely manner.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CABO VERDE

Government Finance Statistics: The fiscal data have improved. Benefiting from technical
assistance (TA) the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compilation system is being upgraded.
Recent TA helped the authorities compile GFS data in line with GFSM 2001. The authorities have
started reporting GFS for publication in the IFS and the GFS Yearbook.
However, quality is a concern. The fiscal accounts are subject to statistical discrepancies, and flows
and stocks are not always consistent. Tax arrears and overdue tax credits and refunds need to be
better measured and integrated into the budget. Also, institutional coverage of fiscal data needs
to be extended. A significant delay in donor reporting of project financing also affects the
accuracy of fiscal data. Despite the recent revision of external debt data, weaknesses regarding
the public and publically guaranteed debt of state-owned enterprises persist.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monetary and financial statistics are adequate and the
quality of the monetary survey has been improved. An STA mission undertaken in March 2007
helped the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) to finalize the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
reporting monetary statistics to STA. SRF-based monetary data for the central bank and other
depository corporations have been published in International Financial Statistics since June 2007
on a regular monthly basis. These data are fully aligned with the recommendations of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and the MFS Compilation Guide. The integrated
monetary database that meets STA, AFR, and BCV statistical needs is now in place.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Cabo Verde does not report financial soundness indicators for
dissemination on the IMF’s website.
External statistics: The BCV compiles Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment
Position (IIP) statistics on a BPM5 basis. Dissemination of quarterly BOP data on the BCV website
has been regular. The BCV reports quarterly BOP and annual IIP data to the STA and commenced
participation in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey starting with 2012 data. A greater use
of surveys, combined with the International Transactions Reporting System implemented by the
BCV, has permitted an expansion of data sources and statistical coverage, which to a large extent
follow the recommendations of the BPM6. However, problems and limitations in data sources and
compilation techniques remain and need to be addressed. Data coverage needs to be increased,
particularly for foreign trade in goods, direct investment, portfolio investment liabilities, and
nonbank sectors’ external transactions conducted via account abroad.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Cabo Verde has participated in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
February 2004.

No data ROSC has been done in Cabo Verde.

Our authorities reiterate their appreciation of staff’s excellent work during this year’s Article IV
consultation, as well as the valuable support received from headquarters, particularly on capacity
building.
2.
In 2016, Cabo Verde held presidential, legislative, and local elections. After obtaining a
clear majority in March’s parliamentary election, the largest then-opposition party formed a new
government that took office in April. The smooth political transition is a testimony to the maturity
of Cabo Verde’s political process and institutions. The country enjoys comparable rankings to
many advanced economies in areas such as freedom of press, and governance and transparency.
3.
The economic priorities of the new government include promoting a larger role for the
private sector and advancing fiscal consolidation. These priorities mark a shift from the strategy
pursue by the previous administration, which sought to scale up public infrastructure investment
in a period when access to concessional financing was coming to an end as Cabo Verde
graduated to middle-income status. Although the previous strategy played an important role in
reducing energy and transportation bottlenecks, boosting productivity, and enhancing
competitiveness, it also led to a substantial increase in public sector indebtedness. The new
authorities are now committed to put public debt on a firm downward path and to crowd-in
private investment.
Recent Economic Developments
4.
After growing by 7.4 percent on average during the period 1993–2008, the Cabo Verdean
economy decelerated significantly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Given its links to
Europe and particularly Portugal, Cabo Verde was severely hit by the euro area crisis. Between
2009 and 2015, real GDP growth averaged a mere 1.3 percent annually.
5.
Buoyed by the tourism sector, economic activity seems to have rebounded this year from
the low growth cycle of the 2009-2015 period. According to the most recent data released by the
National Institute of Statistics (INE), GDP grew by 4.7 percent in the first half of 2016 relative to
the same period of last year. Tourism activities grew by 15.2 percent, helped by political and
security instability in some Mediterranean destinations that compete directly with Cabo Verde in
the “sun, sand and sea” market. Agriculture and public utilities also grew at double-digit rates.
6.
Confidence indicators support the case that the recovery is taking hold. In the third
quarter of 2016, the INE’s Economic Situation Indicator reached its highest level since mid-2012,
due to the rebound in confidence in the retail and tourism activities. Confidence within the

2
tourism sector was at its highest level since the end of 2008, while there was also considerable
improvement in consumer sentiment to date in 2016.
7.
With the rebound in business and consumer confidence, credit growth gained some
momentum after remaining stagnant between 2013 and 2015. In the first eight months of 2016,
credit to the private sector grew by 4.1 percent, with banks reporting less restrictive credit
conditions and slightly lower lending rates.
8.
On the inflation front, Cabo Verde has benefited from imported deflation, especially from
the euro area – a result of the currency peg. After ending 2015 with annual deflation of
0.5 percent, consumer prices continued to decline, falling by 2.0 percent in the 12 months
through September. Public transportation, utilities and food items contributed to the fall in
consumer prices, the latter reflecting favorable domestic weather conditions and the consequent
increase in agriculture output this year.
9.
Cabo Verde continued to make progress towards strengthening its external buffers.
The improvement in the current account deficit (4.3 percent of GDP in 2015 compared to
9.0 percent of GDP in 2014 and 16.3 percent of GDP at the peak in 2011) can be attributed to the
good performance of tourism receipts, remittances and more recently, the reduction of imports in
the context of the phasing out of the public investment pipeline. As a result of favorable balance
of payment conditions, gross international reserves accumulated and are expected by staff to end
the year close to six months of prospective imports of goods and services.
Fiscal Policy
10.
The new Cabo Verdean authorities are well aware of the need to improve the fiscal
outlook. As a clear signal of their commitment to fiscal prudence, they have decided to accelerate
the pace of consolidation relative to what was previously envisaged. As highlighted by staff in the
reports, large fiscal deficits in recent years have been mainly driven by capital spending. As the
public investment program phases out, fiscal outcomes will improve substantially.
11.
The size of the public investment program has already been significantly scaled down.
At its 2012 peak—when it was entirely justified to adopt counter-cyclical policies—capital
spending represented 11.8 percent of GDP. It declined to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and is
currently expected to continue its downward trajectory until it reaches around 2 percent of GDP
by 2020. As a consequence, the overall deficit of the central government, which reached
10.3 percent of GDP in 2012, is estimated to converge to a balanced position by the end of the
decade.
12.
Raising fiscal revenues is an important component of the consolidation strategy.
The authorities continue to make progress in broadening the tax base, enhancing collection,
recovering tax arrears and strengthening the capacity of the tax agency (DNRE– Direção Nacional
de Receitas do Estado). These efforts are being supported by technical assistance provided by the
Fund.

3
13.
The performance of some state-owned enterprises (SOEs) remains a source of fiscal risk.
The financial situation of the energy company Electra, one of the vulnerable SOEs at the time of
the last Article IV consultation, has improved substantially. However, the financial difficulties of
the national airline TACV (Transportes Aéreos de Cabo Verde) remains unresolved. Any solution to
its challenges needs to take into account that Cabo Verde is an archipelago of nine dispersed
inhabited islands and inter-island air transportation is a public good. That said, the authorities are
conscious that the fragility of TACV not only represents a fiscal risk but also constrains tourism
development. An additional source of concern is the housing company IFH (Imobiliária, Fundiária
e Habitat) due to weaknesses in an externally-financed project, which is currently being
reevaluated.
14.
The authorities note that, although the public debt ratio is high, there is no major
sustainability concern. Most public debt is external, and was contracted under concessional
conditions, including long grace and repayment periods and low interest rates. As recognized by
staff in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), the external “debt service indicators remain safely
below the threshold throughout 2036” (page 5, emphasis added).
Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
15.
The authorities have been successful in supporting the exchange rate peg with the euro,
which continues to serve Cabo Verde well. We draw attention to staff’s assessment that the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and that international reserves coverage is
strong.
16.
Since 2013, the Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) has adopted an accommodative monetary
policy stance. In light of deflation pressures, the policy rate was lowered to 3.5 percent in February
2015 and has remained unchanged since then. In the same month, reserve requirements were
reduced to 15 percent from 18 percent. It should be noted that, in the case of Cabo Verde,
deflation does not seem to have adverse impacts on the economy, increasing real incomes and
supporting consumption.
17.
Cabo Verde’s banking sector remains relatively well capitalized and liquid. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have declined from the mid-2014 peak (22.3 percent), but remain
relatively high. The BCV took additional measures to stimulate credit growth, including the
extension from two to five years of banks’ liquidation period for repossessed assets from NPLs.
The BCV also continues to deepen its institutional and administrative capacities to monitor and
mitigate stability risks, including through improvements in regulation, supervision and crisis
resolution frameworks. Cabo Verde has a comprehensive AML/CFT framework and, contrary to
many other small states and economies that rely on remittances, the country has not been
affected by the loss of correspondent banking relationships.
Structural Agenda
18.
Cabo Verde is a country poor in terms of natural resources, geographically dispersed, with
relatively scarce arable land and low rain levels, and prone to natural disasters. In the last decades,

4
tourism and tourism-related foreign direct investment (FDI) have been the main engines of
growth. The upward trend in tourism arrivals and FDI was interrupted by the global financial crisis
in 2008-2009 and the euro crisis in 2011–13. More recently, however, Cabo Verde’s political
stability and improved infrastructure have led to a surge in FDI directed to tourism activities.
19.
As noted by staff in the report, tourism-related FDI from already signed projects is
estimated to represent 42 percent of GDP, with additional projects in the pipeline amounting to
around 50 percent of GDP. As these projects mature, they will contribute to radically transform
the Cabo Verdean economy and improve the living standards of its population. In this regards,
the government is aware that structural reforms are needed for the dynamism in the tourism
sector to disseminate into economic benefits for all.
20.
Among the growth-friendly reform initiatives, a new labor code entered into effect last
October. The new code increases labor market flexibility, extending the conditions and time
period under which temporary work contracts are allowed and facilitating dismissal due to
redundancy or performance at the job. At the same time, the government is committed to
continue to prepare and improve the skills of the labor force, in line with the needs of a more
diversified economy.
21.
With the phasing out of the public investment program, the authorities are aiming at
attracting the private sector, including but not limited to public private partnerships (PPPs) and
privatizations. The authorities are also exploring mechanisms to catalyze investment into the
country from the large Cabo Verdean diaspora. The private sector is expected to bring innovation
and diversification to the economy and boost overall productivity and competitiveness.
Final Remarks
22.
In light of the ongoing recovery of the economy, the Cabo Verdean authorities consider
staff’s short-term growth forecast to be on the low side. They also view the completion of the
public investment program and the crowding-in of private investment as providing the
foundations for higher potential growth comparatively to recent economic performance, a fact
that does not seem to have been fully captured in staff’s long-term growth projections.
23.
This year’s consultation offered both the new authorities and staff an opportunity for
a frank exchange of views on a range of topics that will certainly contribute to reshape
Cabo Verde’s macroeconomic policies. The authorities attribute high importance to the
engagement with the Fund and underline, once again, that technical assistance in areas such as
strengthening tax administration, debt management and macroeconomic statistics are
fundamental to Cabo Verde’s development aspirations.
