STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 23, 2013

Context: Strong growth on the order of 6 percent a year has been sustained over the last
decade, but the official unemployment rate has increased over the period and poverty
remains high. To make growth more inclusive, the authorities initiated a comprehensive
program in 2012, prioritizing macroeconomic stability and reforms to boost competitiveness
and productivity, especially in labor-intensive sectors. Initial outcomes have been generally
favorable although progress in some areas has been slower than originally envisaged.
Outlook and Risks: In 2013, growth is projected to remain strong and inflation to fall to
single digits. The key downside risks are (i) a large drop in world oil prices; and (ii) ongoing
slow progress in building consensus around key fiscal reforms.
KEY ISSUES
Creating fiscal space while ensuring macroeconomic stability: Achieving the planned
fiscal consolidation for 2013–15 will enable the rebuilding of buffers and create necessary
fiscal space for additional public investment. Ambitious reorientation of spending at the
federal level towards increased capital formation needs to be supported by efforts to boost
non-oil revenue, strengthen PFM, and build broad public support for the eventual full
deregulation of fuel prices.
Improving the fiscal framework: The authorities should continue to prioritize the transition
from the Excess Crude Account to the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which has a stronger legal
foundation, and should seek to reach understandings with the legislature on a rules-based
approach to setting the budget oil price.
Monetary policy should continue to be focused on a single-digit inflation objective.
Strengthening financial stability: With the 2009 banking crisis now resolved, the FSAP
pointed to the need to boost capacity for consolidated supervision of banks with
cross-border operations and for measures to promote access to credit for SMEs.
Structural reforms should focus on key impediments to improving competitiveness.
The momentum of the reforms in the power sector should be maintained. Targeted efforts
to modernize agriculture could contribute to major gains in employment and poverty
reduction but the authorities will need to avoid reliance on protectionist measures.

CONTEXT
1.
The overarching policy challenge facing Nigeria is to make substantial inroads in
reducing widespread poverty and unemployment. Strong growth, maintained even during the
global financial crisis, has been one of the highest in the region over the last decade. However, with
growth mainly concentrated in the large informal economy, low quality government spending, and
ongoing governance challenges, over 60 percent of the population still live below the poverty line;
the official unemployment rate has risen steadily from 15 percent in 2003 to 24 percent in 2011;1
and Nigeria places 157 out of 187 on the 2011 Human Development Index. (Table 1). The authorities
have laid out a comprehensive plan, the Transformation Agenda, for achieving strong inclusive
growth.2 These plans were supported by Directors at the time of the 2011 Article IV Consultation
and, over the past year, the authorities’ policies have been generally in line with Directors’
recommendations. The 2012 consultation discussions focused on the implementation of the
Transformation Agenda thus far, including areas where revisions have been or may need to be
made.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic and Policy Developments
2.
In 2012, macroeconomic performance has been broadly positive, underpinned by
buoyant international oil prices and prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Real GDP growth
decelerated slightly to 6.3 percent, reflecting the impact of the nationwide strike in early 2012,
floods in Q4 of 2012, and continued security problems in the north, which affected agriculture and
commerce (Table 2). Inflation increased from 10.3 percent at end-2011 to 12.3 percent (y-o-y) in
November 2012, owing mainly to the adjustment of administrative prices of fuel and electricity;
large increases in import tariffs on rice and wheat; and the impact of floods in Q3 (Figure 1). The
external position has strengthened and international reserves rose from $32.6 billion at end-2011 to
almost $46 billion in November 2012 (5 ½ months of prospective imports), helped by sustained high
oil prices, stricter administration of the gasoline subsidy regime, and strong portfolio inflows
(Table 3 and Figure 2).
3.
Fiscal consolidation is taking place and fiscal buffers are being rebuilt. Expenditure
restraint, including the reduction in the gasoline subsidy at the beginning of 2012, is expected to
have reduced the non-oil primary fiscal deficit (NOPD) of the consolidated government from
36 percent in 2011 to 30½ percent of non-oil GDP in 2012 (Figure 3). The overall fiscal balance is

The official unemployment definition counts as unemployed those working less than 40 hours a week. Using the
ILO definition, the unemployment rate would be around 1.7 percent.

NIGERIA

also expected to have improved slightly, while the combined balances of the Excess Crude Account
and Sovereign Wealth Fund reached US$9.7 billion at end-2012, up from US$4.6 billion at end-2011
(Table 4).
4.
Monetary policy remained tight in 2012 and there was continued improvement in the
health of the financial sector. The CBN maintained its policy interest corridor (12 percent +/- 200
basis points) but, in July, raised the cash reserve requirement for banks from 8 percent to 12 percent
and also lowered banks’ allowable open foreign exchange position from 3 percent to 1 percent of
capital. These actions helped keep money and credit growth under control (Figure 4) and supported
a nominal and real appreciation of the naira. Financial soundness indicators have improved markedly
since 2011, reflecting the successful recovery from the 2009 banking crisis (Table 6).

B. Medium Term Outlook and Risks
5.
Under the current WEO baseline projection for oil prices, the macroeconomic outlook
is positive. In 2013, growth is expected to recover to above 7 percent, driven, in part, by the positive
effects of World Bank-supported agriculture and electricity reforms. Inflation is projected to decline
below 10 percent, with a tight monetary policy stance supported by ongoing fiscal consolidation.
Based on the 2013 budget, staff projects that the NOPD will narrow to around 28 percent of non-oil
GDP. Over the medium term, continued progress on key structural reforms and on fiscal
consolidation broadly consistent with the targets of the authorities’ plans should lead to a gradual
increase in the growth rate and a generally more resilient economy, characterized by a low risk of
debt distress3 and positive external stability indicators (Box 1).
6.
However, downside risks to this outlook are significant (Table 7). The main risk is a
sharp decline in oil prices. While buffers are being rebuilt, they are still below the pre-crisis peak.
A large decline in oil prices would create financing problems, because oil revenue comprises about
75 percent of government revenue and 95 percent of exports. While the 2013 budget appears to
build in a large safety margin by framing the budget on a reference oil price of $79 per barrel, much
of the apparent savings to be made from the large difference between this reference price and the
world price for Nigerian oil (projected be $104 per barrel) are pre-committed to extra-budgetary
outlays, leaving the fiscal position vulnerable to a relatively moderate decline in world oil prices
(Box 2 and Figure 5).
7.
A second downside risk relates to the authorities’ difficulty in building a consensus for
key reforms that could durably strengthen the fiscal framework (e.g., full removal of fuel
subsidies, full implementation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund mechanism). As long as these
reforms are not implemented, there is a risk that the medium-term fiscal program could be
undermined. Finally, an intensification of the ongoing violence in northern Nigeria could adversely
impact growth prospects.

Box 1. External Sector Stability
Nigeria’s indicators of external sector stability are generally positive. CGER-based analysis
suggests that the real exchange rate is not misaligned and the projected external current account is
consistent with economic fundamentals and a sustainable net foreign asset position (Appendix 3).
Over the last couple years, the capital and financial account has improved significantly, reflecting
improved confidence from better macroeconomic management and increased oil prices and higher
yield spreads (Table 3). Foreign direct investment (FDI) and private sector portfolio inflows are
estimated to have increased to $12.3 billion (4.6 percent of GDP), from $7.8 billion (3.4 percent of
GDP) in 2010. These positive developments have contributed to a sharp increase in international
reserves to US$45 billion, equivalent to 6 months of import cover. Furthermore, under the staff’s
baseline medium-term projections, reserves would grow to over 7½ months of import cover, in line
with staff’s estimate of optimal reserves for a low-middle income commodity exporter (5–8 months
of import coverage) (Appendix 4).
Nevertheless, concentration of exports and
volatility of oil prices remain important
sources of vulnerability. Despite an increase the
global market share of non-oil exports (albeit
from a very low base), exports remain highly
concentrated; oil exports comprise over
95 percent of total exports. As such, Nigeria is
highly exposed to oil price volatility. As described
in the oil price shock scenario, a sustained
decrease in oil prices, by 25 percent relative to
the WEO baseline, would significantly weaken the
current account and reserves position (Figure 6).

Recent strong capital inflows are also subject to risk but their impact should be manageable.
The elimination in 2011 of a restriction requiring foreign investors to hold their securities for one
year increases the risk of capital flow reversals in the event of a change in risk appetite, for example
from a decline in oil prices or spillover effects of deteriorating financial sector conditions in Europe.
However, these portfolio inflows, estimated at US$11 billion and carefully tracked by the central
bank, are relatively modest compared with total reserves. Heightened global financial risk is likely
to have a relatively small impact on Nigeria’s financial system because banks are mainly
domestically-owned and do not currently rely significantly on external funding.

Box 2. The Budget Reference Oil Price –
Has it Been an Effective Tool for Fiscal Policy Management?
To cope with large oil revenue volatility, the authorities established an oil price-based fiscal
rule in 2004.1 The budget is framed around a “reference oil price,” intended to reflect long-run
average price trends, with the savings generated when oil revenues exceed budgeted revenues
being placed in the Excess Crude Account (ECA), which can then be drawn down in years where oil
revenues are below budget. The reference oil price used in the budget is not set by formula but
rather through negotiations between the government and legislature.
Setting the reference oil price below expected market prices suggests that there will be a
significant accumulation of savings in the ECA, but caution is needed in drawing this
inference. ECA resources are used to finance substantial extra-budgetary outlays (fuel subsidies,
ad hoc distributions) and compensate for any shortfall in non-oil revenues. The accumulation of
savings in the ECA is thus much smaller than suggested by the headline oil price differential, and
indeed can be negative even in years where the market oil price exceeds the budget reference
price.
The experience of 2011 provides a good illustration of the mechanisms involved. The
reference oil price in the 2011 budget was set at $75 per barrel (pb); the average price realized in
2011 was $109, a $34 “windfall” over the budgeted price, providing the government with additional
revenues of about US$18 billion. But $16 billion of this amount (some 6½ percent of GDP) was
used to finance shortfalls in non-oil revenue, fuel subsidies, and unusually large ad hoc
distributions from the ECA. In the event, the accumulation of savings in the ECA in 2011 was about
$2 billion, equivalent to the government’s take from an oil price “windfall” of $4 pb.
Nigeria’s fiscal position is thus more vulnerable to a drop in oil prices than a simple
comparison of the expected market price with the budget reference would suggest. For 2013,
staff projects that the accumulation of funds in the ECA will be on the order of $6 billion,
equivalent to the government’s take from an oil price “windfall” of about $9 pb. Thus, a decline of
even $10 per barrel in Nigerian crude prices (relative to the current WEO projection of $104) would,
absent a policy response, result in a decline in ECA balances in 2013; a one standard deviation
shock to oil prices (a drop of $32) would wipe out the existing ECA buffer within a year.

Oil revenue volatility has also been associated with output volatility, most recently during unrest in the Niger Delta

in 2006–09.

8.
To illustrate these risks, staff developed two alternative scenarios. The first scenario is
closely related to the alternative scenario in the October 2012 WEO that depicts a prolonged growth
slowdown in advanced economies (Figure 6). The second scenario looks at the implication of smaller
fiscal consolidation, with increased spending that is not growth enhancing (Figure 7). In the first
scenario, the drop in oil prices by about 25 percent would put substantial pressure on the fiscal and
external accounts. Under this scenario, the public debt to GDP ratio would rise to 19½ percent of
GDP by 2015 while the ECA would be exhausted by 2015. The exhaustion of the ECA means that
macroeconomic policies assumed in the baseline could not be maintained, and a significant
procyclical adjustment of fiscal policy would be needed. In the second scenario, government
spending is assumed to increase by 1 percent of GDP relative to baseline in 2013–2017, in the
context of a decline in world oil prices. Higher inflation and much lower fiscal buffers would
jeopardize macroeconomic stability and increase the economy’s vulnerability to an oil price shock.
9.
Under the baseline scenario, developments in Nigeria would have favorable effects on
its neighbors, though spillovers are estimated to be relatively small (Appendix 2). Nigeria is an
important (though not substantial) export market for a number of West African countries, and
shocks to Nigerian output appear to have a negligible impact on output in the rest of the region.
The main spillover channels are through Nigeria’s informal agricultural exports and illegal fuel
exports which impact regional inflation; and cross-border activities of Nigerian banks, which could
impact regional financial sector stability. In this context, the projected improvements in agricultural
productivity and banking system stability in Nigeria should augur well for the broader region.
10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities had a broadly similar view on the outlook and risks.
There was agreement on the need to continue to rebuild fiscal buffers to mitigate possible oil price
shocks. In this context, the authorities indicated that they had agreed with the states to build the
ECA to $10 billion by end-2012 and planned for further increases over the medium term. Moreover,
the authorities reiterated their commitment to the fiscal consolidation targets in their original
medium-term expenditure framework proposal. Although the projected fiscal deficits over the
medium term are similar, the authorities project much higher federal capital spending and sharply
lower real recurrent spending than are contained in the staff’s projections (Figure 8).

VULNERABILITIES
A. Building on Fiscal Consolidation While Creating Space for Higher
Investment
11.
The fiscal targets in the 2013 budget and the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan are consistent with maintaining medium-term macroeconomic stability.
The budget is also consistent with building ECA balances to around $20 billion by end-2013, which

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

would represent an adequate buffer against a moderate oil shock lasting 2–3 years4. By 2016, the
non-oil fiscal deficit of the consolidated government would decline to 23 percent of non-oil GDP.
Building on the progress in 2012, the planned fiscal consolidation is timely, especially as the
economy is growing strongly, and would complement the monetary policy efforts to reduce inflation
and keep public debt below 18 percent of GDP. However, strong efforts on many fronts, as
discussed below, will be needed to achieve these fiscal objectives.
12.
Mobilizing non-oil revenue, including at the sub-national government levels. Given
that oil revenues in real terms are projected to decline over the medium term on account of
moderating international oil prices, it will be important for the authorities to significantly boost
non-oil revenues in order to avoid a sharp contraction in spending. This is particularly urgent at the
sub-national government (SNG) level, where dependence on oil revenues is acute (Appendix 5).
Technical assistance (TA) from the Fund has been aimed at modernizing internal revenue
administration but it appears that progress in implementation has lagged this year, in part because
of delays in appointing a new head of the Inland Revenue Service. The authorities are programming
a substantial decline in real recurrent spending over the medium term to offset the decline in oil
revenues and make room for planned higher capital spending (Figure 8). Efforts are underway to
rationalize some agencies and strengthen payroll administration to restrain recurrent spending.
However, these efforts would need to be complemented with additional civil service reforms to
ensure that the programmed savings are achievable and sustainable. Staff noted that such
ambitious cuts may not be consistent with the authorities’ goal of improving public service delivery,
especially in areas of education and health.
13.
Authorities’ views. The authorities pointed to early gains from cleaning up public payrolls
and removing ghost workers. They agreed on the urgent need to boost non-oil revenues and
outlined a number of initiatives that were underway, including measures to increase remittances
from revenue-generating agencies and profit-making state enterprises, and expressed their
intention to follow through on key TA recommendations. The authorities also noted a major push by
a number of states to boost their internally-generated revenue.
14.
Moving toward full deregulation of fuel prices. The elimination of untargeted gasoline
subsidies would create substantial fiscal space for scaled up social and investment spending.
Experience from other countries indicates that successful subsidy reform requires a strong public
communication campaign to show true costs and beneficiaries of the subsidies; mitigating measures
to compensate the most vulnerable households; and convincing stakeholders that the subsidy
savings will be used for the public good. Staff recognized that time was needed for the government
to build public support for further reform. At the same time, they encouraged the authorities to
(i) set a ceiling on subsidy costs at the present level to contain fiscal risks and be ready to increase
prices if the amounts budgeted for subsidy payments are exhausted; (ii) publish the monthly costs

value-at-risk (Appendix 4).

of fuel subsidies and fund them directly from government budgets rather than from the ECA, to
increase transparency; (iii) continue to communicate progress on the implementation of the Subsidy
Re-investment and Empowerment (SURE) program;5 and (iv) deal aggressively with subsidy abuses.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to the eventual
deregulation of fuel prices—this policy is set out in the Petroleum Industry Bill that is now before the
Assembly (paragraph 29). However, they thought that it was inopportune to make any changes to
the subsidy regime at this time. They considered that building consensus for the elimination of the
subsidy was best done by demonstrating the positive results of the SURE program and by
continuing to improve the management of the subsidy regime. They noted that SURE interventions
had already facilitated the completion of a major north-south national railway project and improved
maternal and child care services in 500 primary health care centers. They also pointed to their
success in weeding out abuses in the subsidy program, which had resulted in a number of arrests of
oil marketers and a substantial decline in petroleum imports.

B. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework and Public Finances Management
16.
Nigeria’s fiscal framework consists of a budget reference oil price, to facilitate
smoothing of expenditure in the face of volatile oil revenues; an ECA that receives any excess
oil revenue or funds any shortfall; and a fiscal responsibility law (FRL).6 The ability of the
framework to serve as an effective fiscal anchor, ensure adequate fiscal buffers, and contain
procyclical spending has been mixed in recent years. In particular: (a) as the budget oil price is not
formally instituted, bargaining between the federal government and the legislature play an
important role in its determination;7 (b) as the ECA is based on a political agreement among federal,
state, and local governments and not a legal one, it is subject to many discretionary withdrawals;
and (c) the FRL does not cover the subnational governments (SNGs), which receive over half of total
oil revenue as prescribed in the constitution. These factors imply that the federal government has
only limited control over macro-fiscal management. This has resulted in the budget oil price being
set at a level that generates a federal fiscal deficit, in part to enforce spending discipline on SNGs,
which have limited borrowing capacity. However, this process is inefficient, because it forces the
federal government to issue relatively expensive debt, even as the ECA builds up deposits earning
little interest.

5

This program was established to re-invest savings from the January 2012 partial removal of the gasoline subsidy in
key social welfare and infrastructure projects. (SM/12/28, pp. 37–38 for details.)
6

The 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act prescribes an annual ceiling for the federal deficit (3 percent of GDP); and a
ceiling on government debt (25 percent of GDP). For details on the fiscal framework, (SM/12/28, p. 8).
7

The government originally proposed a budget oil price of US$75 per barrel for 2013. The National Assembly
subsequently raised it to US$79 per barrel.

NIGERIA

17.
To improve the current fiscal framework, staff pressed the case for adopting a formal
rule-based budget oil price and urged the authorities to continue to take steps to fully
operationalize the Sovereign Wealth Fund. Adopting a formalized rule-based approach to setting
the budget oil price, and enshrining it in the FRL, would depoliticize the setting of the price and
enhance the credibility of the FRL as a fiscal anchor. However, even if the budget oil price rule were
enshrined in the FRL, its effectiveness would still hinge on the extent to which excess oil revenues
were actually saved in good times to offset shortfalls during an adverse oil price shock. In this
context, it is crucial to transition as quickly as possible from the ECA to the Sovereign Wealth
Fund(SWF), which has a stronger legal framework, with better-defined rules for saving and using
excess oil revenue. The sub-national governments, as co-owners of the fund, have already agreed to
make the SWF operational but have resisted any additional transfers from the ECA to the SWF
beyond the initial distribution of US$1 billion that was made in late 2011. They have cited a number
of outstanding issues, including dissatisfaction with the existing revenue sharing arrangement; and
the cash-strapped situation of a few states, which left them with no funds for saving.
18.
PFM indicators are low by Sub-Saharan Africa standards. In addition, the execution rate
of the federal capital budget remains low (62 percent in 2011) and further capacity building,
especially in evaluating and implementing projects, is urgently needed to ensure that the planned
scaling up of capital spending will be effective. However, going forward, a number of ongoing
reforms are expected to substantially improve PFM. For example, Fund and World Bank-supported
reforms to expand coverage of the treasury single account (TSA) and GIFMIS systems will strengthen
expenditure management and budget execution. Recently a PEFA assessment has been conducted
to help guide additional reforms in the areas of PFM.
19.
Authorities’ views. The authorities expressed interest in learning more about how
rules-based approaches for setting the benchmark oil price had worked in other countries
(Appendix 6). They acknowledged that the replacement of the ECA with the SWF would need to
proceed more slowly than originally planned; continued progress toward building trust between the
federal and sub-national governments was needed first. In the meantime, the SWF management was
finalizing its investment strategy for submission to its executive board before the end of 2012 and
the authorities indicated that they were considering channeling a portion of their share of excess
crude revenues into the SWF and inviting like-minded states to do the same. The authorities noted
that SWF legislation sets the management of the fund in line with the international best practices,
including for audit, oversight, and public disclosure procedures.

C. Enhancing Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
20.
While core inflation appears to have peaked, it would be premature to begin easing
monetary policy at this juncture. Given that the rate of economic growth is still strong and
inflation remains above the central bank’s “single-digit” target, staff recommended that the current
tight stance be maintained pending signals pointing to a durable reduction in inflation pressures.
Staff suggested further rationalization of policy instruments, in particular, scaling back reliance on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

NIGERIA

the cash reserve ratio, while more actively using open market operations to guide short-term
interest rates within the interest rate corridor. Similarly, while the central bank is a structural net
supplier of foreign exchange, it has relied, at times, too heavily on such sales to sterilize liquidity or
lean against pressures on the currency.8
21.
Authorities’ views. Staff and the authorities concurred on the monetary policy stance. The
authorities also noted that the tight policy had contributed to portfolio inflows and the buildup in
reserves, which had provided valuable confidence to investors during a troubling period for the
global economy. In the authorities’ view, the increases in the cash reserve ratio had been used to
mop up structural excess liquidity and had proven to be very effective. They argued that exchange
rate stability played an important role in formulating inflation expectations, given high pass-through
as well as the country’s high import dependence. The central bank’s intervention policy was
designed to avoid volatility of the exchange rate that could potentially be large because of lumpy
foreign exchange transactions related to the oil sector. The authorities also argued that their
periodic interventions had been aimed at smoothing temporary fluctuations, and not leaning
against durable market trends.

D. Consolidating Financial System and Reform
22.
The recent FSAP Update concluded that the banking system had recovered well from
the 2009 crisis but that additional reforms were needed to further strengthen the system
(see the accompanying FSSA report). The authorities’ strategy has resulted in the recapitalization
of the intervened banks to levels satisfying prudential requirements and allowed for the unwinding
of most of the crisis resolution measures (e.g., central bank guarantees of interbank loans and
purchases of nonperforming loans (NPLs) by AMCON (paragraph 21)). By mid-2012, NPLs had fallen
to 5 percent of total loans (from a high of 35 percent in 2010), in part reflecting AMCON purchases;
and stress test results suggest that most Nigerian banks can withstand large credit or exchange rate
shocks (Appendix 7).
23.
The FSAP recommended formally establishing a sunset provision for the Nigerian asset
management corporation (AMCON). The corporation had been set up to handle the post-2009
cleanup of the banking system and has been a central element in the authorities’ response to the
crisis. However, now that banking sector stability had been restored, AMCON’s acquisition of
problem loans should be discontinued and a credible exit strategy devised to ensure a smooth
winding up of its operations by end-2017. This was important to minimize fiscal risks and avoid
potential moral hazard behavior by the banks. In addition, while Nigeria has a flexible crisis
resolution toolkit in place, additional reforms are needed to increase the authorities’ preparedness

for crisis management, including establishing a longer-term emergency liquidity facility and
amending laws to minimize the legal challenges to the resolution process.
24.
The FSAP also recommended strengthening aspects of the supervisory and regulatory
framework. It welcomed the marked improvement in bank supervision in recent years, including
through the introduction of risk-based supervision. However, it noted that the central bank’s
capacity for cross-border supervision and crisis resolution needed to be enhanced further in
conjunction with regional bank supervisors. While the CBN has signed many memoranda of
understanding (MoUs) on cross-border supervision and cooperation (including one with BCEAO),
it would also be important to agree with regional supervisors on ex ante crisis management and
resolution arrangements, possibly through amending the MoUs. Boosting the CBN’s capacity for
consolidated supervision of banks is also a priority, especially given the sizeable and growing
operations of Nigerian banks across Africa. The FSAP cited the need for further capacity building
to effectively implement the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that were introduced
in banks starting in 2012. On AML/CFT, the FSAP recommended stronger efforts to address strategic
deficiencies identified in Nigeria’s 2008 Mutual Evaluation Report. Staff encouraged the authorities
to fully implement the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force, and ensure the
effective implementation of the recently-adopted laws on money laundering and terrorism financing
25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with the key recommendations of the
FSAP mission and indicated that they had already begun to address gaps in consolidated and
cross-border supervision. They agreed that AMCON should not purchase any more assets or issue
any more debt and should focus instead on disposing of acquired assets. The central bank favors a
longer period for disposal of AMCON assets than proposed by staff, in the hope of minimizing the
fiscal cost to the government and not disrupting asset markets. In an attempt to reduce fiscal costs,
the levy on bank assets earmarked to pay down AMCON’s debt has been raised from 0.3 percent to
0.5 percent. On AML/CFT issues, the authorities acknowledged the technical assistance from the
Fund and other development partners and reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the
deficiencies.

KEY STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR PROMOTING
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
26.
There is an urgent need for policies that will better translate positive growth outcomes
into meaningful employment gains and declines in poverty. Growth has been mainly in the
subsistence-based and informal agricultural and trade sectors and there is evidence that wage jobs
have declined following the privatization of various parastatals in the mid 2000s, the 2009 banking
crisis, and the decline of labor-intensive manufacturing industries, notably textiles. The authorities
see economic diversification and increased competitiveness as vital to creating more formal sector
jobs and achieving strong inclusive growth. Their strategy of quickly addressing major infrastructure
gaps (mainly in power and transportation) and enhancing access to credit (especially for agriculture
and SMEs) would be major steps toward achieving their objectives. In this context, their view,
supported by staff, is that the level of the real exchange rate is not a major factor inhibiting
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

NIGERIA

the development of the non-oil economy. Staff’s analysis indicates the exchange rate is broadly in
line with the economic fundamentals (Appendix 3). In addition, adopting new legislation to reform
the oil and gas sector will open the doors for new investments in that sector and eventually for
increased public revenues.
27.
Power supply is improving and reforms are progressing. The authorities have taken
significant actions in the electricity sector, including raising power tariffs to near cost-recovery levels,
increasing power supply, advancing the process for the privatization of the generation and
distribution companies, and continuing improvements in gas-to-power infrastructure (Appendix 9).
In the near term, completing the privatization of the power generation and distribution companies
should be the top priority. The continued provision of lifeline tariffs for poor households with low
consumption is welcome. Finally, as the transmission company is to remain in government hands,
the authorities should ensure adequate and timely investments to increase transmission
capacity—and to reap the full benefits of privatization.
28.
Transforming agriculture is the linchpin of the reform program. Transforming
agriculture—which employs more than 50 percent of the labor force—from a subsistence into a
commercial sector with value-chain linkages to manufacturing holds a great potential for reducing
poverty. The authorities’ strategy involves targeting infrastructure spending on areas that increase
agriculture potential; an agricultural credit insurance scheme; a privately-managed subsidized
fertilizer scheme for poor farmers; and increased import tariffs (e.g., on rice and wheat) and other tax
incentives. Staff urged the authorities to avoid protectionist measures, emphasizing that the focus
should remain on correcting structural bottlenecks and reducing the costs of doing business.
Protectionist measures have not been successful in the past, typically resulting in large-scale
smuggling via Benin and Togo.
29.
Promoting the financial sector’s role in development is a key policy priority. As in many
developing economies, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria have very limited access to
bank credit or other financial services—in 2011, less than 10 percent of SMEs had a loan or line of
credit and only 5 percent of bank lending went to SMEs. Not surprisingly, in various business climate
surveys, access to finance has been identified as one of the biggest obstacles to doing business.
To boost access will require efforts in many areas, including training for entrepreneurs in the
preparation of adequate business plans; improving credit reporting systems; and strengthening
enforcement of lenders’ rights over collateral. While these and other financial infrastructure reforms
are being instituted, specialized credit schemes targeted at the SMEs (e.g., CBN schemes and
planned SME development fund) could fill the gap in the interim, provided they are
implementedeffectively. The FSAP recommended a performance review of recent central bank credit
and guarantee schemes to help improve their effectiveness and draw lessons for the planned new
fund. It also recommended that such schemes be run by institutions outside the central bank and
funded from fiscal sources.

14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

30.
The passage of a sound Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) is crucial for ensuring strong
growth in the sector and boosting oil revenues. Attempts to pass omnibus legislation to regulate
and manage the petroleum sector have been underway since 2008. Uncertainty over the new
legislation has had an adverse impact on oil-related FDI in the past few years. In July, yet another
draft of the PIB was submitted to the National Assembly. This bill combines a multitude of laws and
regulations into a single consistent piece of legislation that modifies the fiscal regime; overhauls the
national oil company and other key executive and regulatory agencies; sets the stage for
deregulation of downstream activities; and introduces measures to improve transparency and
accountability (Appendix 10).
31.
Staff welcomed these developments, but also proposed adjustments aimed at
strengthening the fiscal regime and the bills’ transparency and accountability provisions. In
particular, staff recommended including royalty rates in the legislation instead of leaving them to be
implemented via subsequent ministerial regulation. In addition, staff argued that providing the
President the power to grant oil licenses without an open and competitive bidding process was a
structural loophole that could undermine implementation over time. Another key issue is the wide
difference of opinion between the oil companies and the government regarding the impact of the
PIB on future oil production and government’s share in oil revenues, partly because of different
assessments of industry costs. The cost issue is mainly a technical question that, in principle, could
be resolved by contracting internationally-renowned (and independent) oil experts.
32.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the
Transformation Agenda and pointed to many completed and ongoing difficult reforms to this effect.
They argued that tariff measures for supporting the development of the agriculture sector are
needed to offset many structural bottlenecks that impede the sector’s development and are
intended to be temporary; the goal is to make agriculture a vibrant export sector. The authorities
were open to the staff’s feedback on the PIB. Acknowledging that some aspects of the PIB are
controversial, they noted that all concerns regarding the Bill would be fully aired during the debate
in the National Assembly, which is expected to vote on the bill by mid-2013. The authorities agreed
that it would be crucial to ensure that the final legislation retains the spirit and objectives of the
original bill, which aimed to significantly enhance transparency and accountability in the sector.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Nigeria’s continued strong growth performance is welcome. Macroeconomic
performance was broadly positive in 2012, underpinned by buoyant international oil prices and
prudent fiscal and monetary policies. In 2013, growth is projected to recover from the modest dip in
2012 and inflation is expected to fall to single digits. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in
line with macroeconomic fundamentals and the risks to external stability appear low in the baseline.
The main downside risks relate to a possible decline in oil prices and a weaker fiscal policy stance
over the medium term. Although fiscal buffers are being rebuilt, a moderate oil price shock would
put pressure on budget financing and the balance of payments.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NIGERIA

34.
The fiscal targets for the 2013 budget and the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan are consistent with supporting macroeconomic stability and creating fiscal
space for much needed additional investment and social spending. The planned fiscal
consolidation, which is timely given the current strong economic growth, would keep debt at low
sustainable levels and allow for the rebuilding of an adequate fiscal buffer.
35.
However, additional policy measures will be needed to achieve the fiscal targets. The
authorities’ large projected savings in recurrent spending will require comprehensive public sector
reforms that may not be feasible in the short term. In this context, it will be important to build
consensus for the phasing out of fuel subsidies by making transparent their cost and beneficiaries;
continuing the aggressive efforts to improve the administration of the subsidy regime; and
continuing to ensure and publicize the productive deployment of the subsidy savings via the SURE
program. To reduce fiscal risks, staff also recommends capping subsidy spending at the current
level, adjusting retail prices if needed.
36.
There is also an urgent need to mobilize non-oil revenues by moving quickly to
improve tax administration in line with Fund TA recommendations. Important savings could
also be achieved by advancing on the Fund and World Bank-supported reforms in public financial
management. PFM reforms will be needed to effectively scale up capital spending as planned.
37.
Continued efforts are needed to strengthen the fiscal framework as its effectiveness in
delivering adequate fiscal buffers or preventing procyclical spending has been mixed. In
particular, excess oil revenues have not been saved as envisaged and the budget oil price has been
subject to political bargaining, reducing its effectiveness in promoting fiscal stability over the
medium term. In this regard, adopting a formalized rule-based approach to setting the budget oil
price that is enshrined in the fiscal responsibility legislation would enhance macroeconomic
performance. In addition, full transition from the ECA to the SWF by making the latter fully
operational should remain a priority; ongoing efforts to build support for this policy with the states
are welcome.
38.
Maintaining the tight monetary policy stance, pending signals pointing to a durable
reduction in inflation pressures, is appropriate. Growth remains strong, inflation is still above the
authorities’ single digit objective, and the risk of a negative oil price shock puts a premium on
safeguarding international reserves.
39.
The health of the banking system has improved considerably following the authorities’
vigorous actions in handling the 2009 banking crisis. Going forward, the authorities are urged to
quickly address the remaining gaps in the bank supervisory and regulatory framework in line with
FSAP recommendations. In particular, enhancing consolidated and cross-border bank supervision,
building capacity for effective implementation of the IFRS, and adopting quickly a macro-prudential
framework are key priorities. Regarding the AML/CFT framework, the authorities should move
quickly to implement the action plan agreed with the FATF before the next assessment date.

16 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

40.
A formal sunset provision on AMCON operations is needed to minimize potential fiscal
and moral hazard risks. While retaining a readily available vehicle as a tool to respond quickly to
possible future banking crises is appropriate, the authorities should aim at winding up all AMCON
operations associated with the 2009 crisis within the next five years. In this context, the authorities’
statement that AMCON would no longer purchase any assets from banks or issue new debt is
welcome.
41.
Planned structural reforms can substantially boost prospects for inclusive growth. Staff
commends the authorities for bold reforms underway in the energy sector, and urges them to
complete the privatization process expeditiously, while ensuring adequate and timely investment in
the transmission subsector to reap the full benefit of expanded generation capacity. Initiatives to
transform agriculture into a commercially-oriented, higher-productivity sector are welcome. The
authorities are urged to ensure that recently-introduced tariff and tax incentives in support of the
sector are temporary and strictly time-bound; policies should instead focus on resolving key
structural bottlenecks as soon as possible in order to encourage private investment and boost
competitiveness in this and other sectors. A key bottleneck is the low access to credit and other
financial services by SMEs. The authorities are encouraged to undertake reforms of the financial
infrastructure, including by improving credit reporting systems and strengthening enforcement of
lenders’ rights over collateral, complemented with prudent use of specialized credit promotion
schemes in the interim. The authorities should also prioritize the passage of the PIB, making sure
that the approved bill retains the key objectives of the original bill while including stronger
provisions for transparency and accountability.
42.
Nigeria’s macroeconomic statistics are generally adequate for surveillance and policy
making. However, improvements in a number of areas, in particular, national income accounts and
state and local fiscal accounts are urgently needed; work on updating the national income accounts
is currently underway.
43.
Staff recommends that Nigeria remain on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

Source: 2012 AFR Fall REO, and IMF Staff estimates.
Oil price shock scenario: Economic agents gradually realize that the potential output is lower than baseline in
advanced and emerging markets, which also implies more subdued external prospects for emerging economies
and commodity exporters. Thus, the scenario assumes that the global real GDP level falls and stays below the
baseline for a prolonged period, and weak global demand depresses oil prices, which fall by 3.85 percent in
2013 and are on average 24.25 percent below the levels in the baseline in 2014–17.

The budget oil price is set at $82 per barrel in 2013-17 (compared with $79 in the baseline for 2013 and $75
afterwards) and ad hoc withdrawals from the ECA are assumed to continue as in the recent past, financing
spending that is not growth enhancing.

The risk of a substantial oil price shock



MEDIUM to HIGH
Given Nigeria’s high dependence on
oil, a large oil price shock affects
the whole economy.

 An adverse oil price scenario is

reported in Figure 6, which shows a

The failure to strengthen the fiscal framework
will continue to put pressure on spending
potentially undermine the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation plans. The Assembly’s
decision to increase the 2013 budget oil
price by $5 per barrel above the authorities’
proposal and the continuing ad hoc
withdrawals from the Excess Crude Account
highlight this risk..
LOW
The campaign of violence currently being
waged by Boko Haram has adversely
impacted agriculture and commerce in the
north, contributing to deceleration in overall
growth in 2012. Were the conflict to
intensify, the adverse impact on economic
activity would be more marked.





MEDIUM
A weaker fiscal stance is depicted in
Figure 7. Pro-growth spending is
assumed to be crowded out and
macroeconomic stability is
jeopardized as inflation rises and

Little oil sector fallout envisaged but
non-oil growth and investor
confidence could be adversely
affected.

Note: This risk assessment is based on staff views at the time of the discussions with the authorities.

Appendix 1. Nexus Between Growth, Unemployment and Poverty and
Quality of Public Spending1
Over the last decade, the Nigerian economy has been growing strongly. However, the official
unemployment rate, which includes all those working for less than 40 hours a week, has risen steadily
from14.8 percent in 2003 to 24 percent in 2010 and the poverty rate is still above 60 percent. This note
explores the causes of the high unemployment and poverty rates despite the strong growth
performance.

Sources of growth
1.
Growth has been largely driven by the non-oil sector, in particular agriculture, trade,
and selective services.

Agriculture, which averaged 6.6 percent annual growth during 2003-2011, contributed 48 percent of
the non-oil growth over the last decade. It was followed by the trade (21 percent) and services
sectors (21 percent, including telecommunications). Structural reforms in the services sector, for
instance privatization of the telecommunication company in the early to mid-2000s, have translated
into strong growth.

Explaining high unemployment and poverty
2.
With growth concentrated in the pro-poor, labor-intensive agriculture and trade sectors, the
disappointing outcomes in unemployment and poverty reduction are somewhat puzzling.
Notwithstanding problems with data,2 deeper analysis offers some explanation to this conundrum.

Various household surveys show that the proportion of the working age population with wage jobs
declined in Nigeria, from 15 percent in 1999 to 10 percent in 2006 (Haywood, 2007, and Haywood
and Teal, 2008). During the same period, jobs among the self employed in the non agricultural
sector also decreased from 24 percent to 22.9 percent. Only employment in family agriculture rose
from 31 percent to 38 percent. Complementing these studies, a recent report issued by the National
Bureau of Statistics showed that, over the last five years, new entrants into the labor market
averaged around 1.8 million per year.
3.

This growing unemployment reflects five developments:



The two main growing sectors, agriculture and trade are largely subsistence-based and
informal. In these sectors, an important part of employment tends to be irregular and less
than 40 hours a week; therefore the official definition would tend not to capture some jobs
created in these sectors.3 Moreover, the growth in agriculture has been attributable to
increasing land under cultivation, rather than increases in productivity, so that the impact on
poverty reduction could be small. The other growth sector, telecommunications, require
specialized skills and is not labor intensive.



The retrenchment of civil servants following the privatization of many parastatals has led to
a decline in public service employment which had long dominated total employment;



Some industries with large wage employment, notability the textile industry, have been in
decline for a number of years and have shed a considerable part of their work force; A
mismatch between required skills by the job market and new graduates’ skills has also
exacerbated the job market crisis. The education system still gives priority to general
secondary education and various kinds of tertiary education, at the expense of vocational
education.



Demographic dynamics: (i) female participation in the labor force has been increasing; and
(ii) because of the global economic crisis, many Nigerian across the Diaspora losing their
jobs are returning home.

3

Unemployment is officially defined as people in the labor force, which covers those who, between the ages of 15
and 65 not in school, are looking for a job but unable to find one. Also counted as unemployed are those working
less than 40 hours a week. Using ILO definition unemployment would be around 1.7 percent.

Over the last five years, public spending on health services has been less stable compared to peers,
though sometimes higher. Critical problems persist in the area of education as enrollment rate in
primary education has decreased from 84.2 percent in 1990 to 83.3 percent in 2010; in health,
Nigeria is not on track to fulfill the MDGs 4 and 5 (reduction in maternal and child mortality). More
generally, efficiency of public spending has lagged that of similar countries.4 These relative low
levels and quality of spending can be associated with the Nigeria’s high unemployment and poverty
rates compared to sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, and India.
5.
The World Bank also cites other factors contributing to the low service delivery in health and
education, including (i) more spending on personnel instead of on materials, supplies, or capital
spending; (ii) a lack of effective coordination across federal, state, and local levels; and (iii) low
quality of teachers.

4

The efficiency of public spending is assessed based on the public investment management index (PIMI) computed
by Era Dablas-Norris et al. from data collected during the 2007-2010 period for 71 countries. Each country’s index
(1 –less efficient to 4-more efficient) is computed by scoring the projects’ phases: appraisal, evaluation,
implementation, and evaluation. The scores are based on data from different sources, in particular the PEFA and
PEMFAR of countries (Era Dabla-Norris (references).

Appendix 2. Nigeria Spillovers to Sub-Saharan Africa1, 2
1. Trade links between Nigeria and a number of West African countries are important. Official
trade data point to Nigeria as a significant, though not substantial market for West African exports.
In terms of exporting country GDP, exports to Nigeria during 2008-10 were most important for
Niger (6 percent of GDP), Togo (4 percent) and Côte d’Ivoire (3 percent). Meanwhile, imports from
Nigeria (predominantly oil) measured in terms of importing country GDP, were more sizeble,
especially for Democratic Republic of Congo (17 percent), Equatorial Guinea (12 percent), and
Cote d’Ivoire (7 percent). At the same time, various studies point to important informal trade links,
in particular in petroleum products and food cereals: Nigeria meets 70 percent of the cereals needs
of Niger and Chad. Nigeria’s highly subsidized gasoline contributes to substantial illegal exports to
neighboring countries. Most notably, over 80 percent of gasoline consumed in Benin is smuggled
from Nigeria.
2. Another potential source of spillover from Nigeria to other sub-Saharan African countries
is the expanding cross-border activity of Nigerian-based banks. Since the consolidation of the
banking system in 2004, the number of foreign subsidiaries increased from a total of just 3 in 2002,
to 44 now operating in 21 sub-Saharan African countries outside Nigeria. In at least 15 of these
countries there is at least one Nigerian subsidiary that accounts for more than 10 percent of system
wide deposits or credit. However, the 2009–10 Nigerian banking crises did not lead to systemic
contagion across the region. This is partly because the banks with the largest cross-border
operations, accounting for more than half of the number of foreign subsidiaries, were not among
the troubled banks. Another factor that minimized systemic contagion was that the banking systems
of the host countries are mainly funded by local deposits and therefore do not significantly depend
on Nigerian funding.
3. Notwithstanding these stylized facts, systematic linkages between fluctuations in growth
rates in Nigeria and neighboring countries are difficult to identify. Correlations between
Nigerian GDP and that of neighboring countries are generally weak and these results are reinforced
with SVAR analysis, i.e., after controlling for common global factors, shocks to Nigerian GDP have a
negligible impact on GDP in neighboring countries.
4. On the other hand, SVAR analysis suggests that inflation in neighboring countries is quite
responsive to inflation dynamics in Nigeria. A one standard deviation (3 percent) shock to
inflation in Nigeria would raise inflation by at least 1 percent in nearly all the neighboring countries.
Shocks are also mostly transmitted fairly quickly—with the impact taking place within the same year.

The spillovers are strongest in Niger (2 percent) and Chad (2 percent), which is consistent with their
close informal sector trading relationships with Nigeria. The integrated grain market within the
region seems to be one of the main transmission channels, as food prices react strongly to shocks to
food inflation in Nigeria. smuggled fuel from Nigeria is also another important channel: in January
2012, Nigeria’s decision to cut fuel subsidies by half was immediately and fully passed through to
the informal gasoline market in Benin, increasing average inflation from 1.8 percent in the last
quarter of 2011 to 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012, and dampening domestic demand as
households adjusted to higher fuel prices.

Appendix 3. Nigeria—Staff Assessment of Real Exchange Rate1
1.
This assessment uses the CGER-based methodologies for oil exporters to determine
whether the level of the Nigerian real exchange rate is in line with fundamentals, taking into
account some of the key characteristics of the Nigerian economy. The three methodologies
provide complementary perspectives on the exchange rate assessment for Nigeria, but the results
must be treated with caution. Differences arise due to the potential instability of the underlying
macroeconomic links or to the inherent difficulty of incorporating critical country-specific
information into cross-country approaches. These differences are most prominent for low-income
countries and for oil exporters, which obviously complicates the assessment for Nigeria. Defining a
current account norm is complex because of the relatively poor BOP data quality. This assessment is
based on data as of November 2012.
2.
This assessment suggests that there is no fundamental misalignment of the exchange
rate (see Text Table below). Two methods—equilibrium real exchange rate (RER) and
macroeconomic balance approaches—suggest that the naira is broadly in line with fundamentals.
The external sustainability approach, comparing the projected current account surplus with the level
needed to stabilize net foreign assets, suggests that the naira is overvalued by 6½ percent.

the latest projections for 2012 were used for Nigeria while projections for 2012 under the
September 2012 WEO were used for global variables and trading partners. As to the level of REER
in 2012, the average level of REER during the first eight months of 2012 was used as a proxy.
The Macroeconomic Balance Approach
4.
Macroeconomic balance approach resulted in slight undervaluation in 2012. To
estimate the current account norm for Nigeria, panel regression results for oil exporting countries
presented by Bems and de Carvalho Filho (2009, IMF WP/09/281) were applied to Nigeria. In
calculating the determinants of the current account norm (non-oil fiscal balance, oil balance, relative
income, lagged current account, relative growth, dependency ratio, and population growth), the
latest projections for 2017 were used for Nigeria while projections for 2017 under the September
2012 WEO were used for trading partners.3 It yields a current account norm for Nigeria of
+0.9 percent of GDP. Nigeria’s projected current account balance is +1.2 percent of GDP in 2017.
Given the estimated elasticity of current account balance in Nigeria, the exchange rate is estimated
to be undervalued by 1.4 percent.
The External Sustainability Approach
5.
Based on the medium-term projections for real growth and inflation, an external
current account surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP would stabilize net foreign assets at the
projected end-2012 level over the medium term. This is somewhat higher than staff’s projected
medium-term current account surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP, which suggests that the currency is
overvalued by6.5 percent. However, determining the appropriate target level for net foreign assets
in Nigeria is not straightforward. As an oil producer, it could be argued that Nigeria should be
seeking to accumulate financial assets via a higher current account surplus to preserve oil wealth for
future generation. On the other hand, as a low-income country with substantial investment needs,
there is also a strong case for using its oil savings for infrastructure investments.

3

As to the non-oil fiscal balance, data were available only for Nigeria and Russia. As to the trading partners’ non-oil
fiscal balance other than Russia, overall fiscal balance was used as a proxy.

Appendix 4. Nigeria—Staff Assessment of Reserve Adequacy1
1. The current level of international reserves is estimated to be close to the optimal levels.
Staff analyzed the import coverage of Nigeria’s international reserves, as reported in the staff report,
using the standard methodology for low-income countries.2 This assessment assumes that the
authorities implement the projected fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. In addition to policy
conduct, changes in the projected economic outlook could also affect this assessment, which,
therefore, call for caution in interpreting the results.
2. This assessment method takes account of both costs and benefits of holding reserves. In
this framework, the optimal level of reserves is determined when the crisis prevention and mitigation
benefits of reserves are balanced against the net financial cost of holding reserves, where financial
cost is defined as the difference between marginal product of capital foregone and the earnings on
reserves. The optimal level of reserves estimated under this method is interpreted as the optimal
level in the face of large external shocks, given the country’s fundamentals (fiscal balance, institution,
and exchange rate regime).
3. Key assumptions. Except for aid, external shock variables were set at the bottom 10 percentile
of Nigeria-specific distribution over the last decade (2002–2011). The shock to foreign aid is
assumed to be zero given Nigeria’s little reliance on aid. Fundamentals are set under the baseline as
follows: the CPIA score was set at the latest year (2011); the fiscal balance was set at the average
level realized during 2007–2011; the exchange rate regime was set at “not flexible” given that it is
heavily managed. These assumptions are summarized in Text table A2.1 below.
4. Optimal reserves. Under these assumptions, the optimal level of reserves varies from
4.2 months to 8.1 months of next year’s imports of goods and services, depending on the unit cost
of holding reserves (Text table A2.2). Staff analyzed impact of a wider fiscal deficit (5 percent of
GDP) than the levels projected in the baseline case. This more expansionary fiscal policy scenario
requires higher optimal levels of reserves than those in the baseline.

that, as long as the fiscal consolidation and structural reform take place as planned, the end-2012
level of reserves in the staff report (5½ months of prospective imports) would be close to optimal
for Nigeria.3 However, in light of high uncertainty about economic outlook and policy conduct, this

Appendix 5. The Optimal Size of Stabilization Buffer in Nigeria1
1. An oil stabilization buffer helps protect public spending from excessive volatility in
revenue, which primarily emanates from oil prices. The optimal size of such a buffer depends on
a number of factors: the size and duration of oil revenue volatility, the extent of dependence on oil
revenue, and the degree of aversion to spending swings. In practice, two methods have been used
to estimate the optimal size of the buffer: benchmarking and value-at-risk (VaR) modeling.


Benchmarking can be used to estimate the buffer size for a specific oil price shock. For
example, a price shock of ½ standard deviation of oil prices—a decline of about $11 a barrel—
for a period of three years would require a buffer of around $25 billion to protect spending.
Benchmarking can also be done based on cross-country comparisons. The 2008 Presidential
Panel assessed the appropriate size of the Nigeria Sovereign Wealth Fund at 15.5 percent of
GDP ($30 billion at that time), equivalent to the average size of SWFs of a “peer group” of oil
producing countries.



The VaR method is, however, preferred over benchmarking because VaR estimates can take
into account cross-country differences in fiscal regimes, the degree of dependency on oil
revenues, or reserve and production horizons. The size of the stabilization buffer depends on the
stochastic properties of the revenue volatility and assumptions on shock persistence, the desired
insurance horizon, and the desired degree of confidence to avoid buffer depletion.

2. Oil stabilization buffer for Nigeria. Assuming a budget oil price rule based on an eight-year
moving average of oil prices (actual prices for past 5 years and projected prices for the next 3 years),
a buffer of 55 percent of annual consolidated government oil revenues or $20 billion would provide
a high degree of confidence (a likelihood of 75–85 percent) in achieving the stabilization objective
(Table 1). In case of a sharp decline in oil prices, spending levels could be maintained over a three
years by drawing down the buffers. This provides room for designing plans for expenditure
adjustment within the rolling medium-term expenditures framework, and executing such plans in
case the price shock appears to be persistent. Different price rules (e.g., 10-year or 5-year historical
averages) imply different degrees of smoothing to a given shock and thus have a different level of
confidence. In sum, both VaR and benchmarking methods suggest that around $20–$25 billion will
provide a high degree of confidence in achieving government spending smoothing in the face of a
negative oil price shock for a period of three years.

Appendix 6. Public Finances of States and Local Governments in Nigeria1
1. In Nigeria, the sub-national governments (SNGs), accounting for about half of
consolidated revenue and expenditure, are important in understanding the nation’s public
finances. The SNGs, comprised of 36 state and 774 local governments, receive over half of oil
revenue and a large portion of selected taxes. However, policymakers in Nigeria face challenges in
formulating fiscal policy and monitoring its implementations because of lack of official fiscal data on
SNGs, particularly on their expenditures, with the harmonized definitions and classifications
comparable to those for the federal government (FGN).2 This appendix sheds some light on the
public finance of the state governments by utilizing data from Central Bank of Nigeria’s survey
returns from 36 states.
2. Most of public revenues are shared between the Federal government and SNGs while the
state governments have fiscal and budgetary autonomy. Under the fiscal federal system, all oil
and gas revenue and two categories of tax revenues (company income tax (CIT) and customs) are
pooled in the Federation Account, with VAT revenue separately in the VAT Pool, for sharing among
all tiers of governments. Legal provisions for the revenue sharing formula for oil and gas revenue,
which accounts for over 75 percent of total revenue, are prescribed in the Constitution:3 after
allocating 13 percent to all oil revenue to producing states, the remainder is shared as following:
federal government (48.5 percent), states (26.7 percent), local governments (20.6 percent); and
extra-budgetary funds (4.2 percent). The same formula applies to the distribution of CIT and
customs. The allocation of VAT revenue follows a different formula: federal government (15 percent),
states (50 percent), and local governments (35 percent). Internally generated revenue, which is
relatively small, is excluded from the sharing and retained by the collecting governments (FGN or
SNGs).
3. A large variation in allocation of revenue across states is observed. On the revenue side,
excluding the 13 percent derivation charge accruing to the oil producing states, the allocation of
other revenues among the 36 states is in part determined by the population size of each state.4

2

In many states, efforts are underway to systematically collect and report fiscal data in the standard format as part of
broad PFM modernizations and in preparation of the Fiscal Responsibility Law with technical assistance from World
Bank and other donors (e.g., UK DFID). Staff’s estimates of SNG spending shown in the fiscal accounts are based on
the revenue and financing (net claims on SNGs from monetary survey).
3

The currently used formula is a modification of the original formula, which was based on an Act of National
Assembly by virtue of Section 315 of 1999 Constitution, by the Honorable Minister of Finance
(Letter No AGF/TRY/796/VOL.IV/41, dated January 15, 2004).
4

In exercising its constitutional responsibility, the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Finance Commission
proposed a new revenue allocation formula based on several variables, including constitutional provisions, tax
jurisdiction and responsibilities of all tiers, socio-economic as well as political conditions. However, this proposal has
stalled in the National Assembly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

There is a large variation across states in terms of amount of “shared” revenue allocated to each
state—from 0.8 percent of GDP in Rivers to 0.13 percent in Abia (Figure 1).5 When compared in
terms of allocated revenue per capita, the gap between richest and poorest states is also large
(about 7-fold difference)—from N120,750 (about US$800) per person in Bayelsa to N17,310
(US$112) per person in Abia (Figure 2).
4. Public spending in most states is heavily dependent on shared revenue. With limited
borrowing capacity and little effort in mobilizing internally generated revenue (except for a few
states such as Lagos and Abia as shown in Figure 3), many SNGs rely almost entirely on shared
revenues to finance their budgets, resulting in large differences in the amount of expenditure across
states as well (Figure 4). This restricted budget space has left some states dissatisfied with the
existing vertical and horizontal revenue sharing arrangements and created stronger incentives for
some cash-strapped states to demand full distribution of oil revenue, including withdrawals from
the ECA. This also makes it more difficult for the federal government to fully engage SNGs with the
fiscal framework built around the ECA/SWF.
5. SNGs allocate a considerable portion of their revenue for capital projects and social
programs. Over half of the states allocate more than 30 percent of the budget to capital
expenditures (Figure 5). The state governments allocate about 15 percent of their total spending for
key social sectors (education, health, agriculture, water, and housing).6

5

The “shared” revenue includes statutory allocations of the oil (including the derivation charge) and non-oil tax
revenue (CIT, customs, and VAT) as well as distributions from the ECA (i.e., budget augmentation and ad hoc
distributions).

Appendix 7. Oil-Price Based Fiscal Rules and the Budget Oil Price1
1. Many resource-dependent countries must deal with very volatile exports, revenues, and
GDP growth. A price-based rule can help insulate the public finances against resource price
volatility and thereby reduce the pressure for procyclical fiscal policies.
2. A key decision is the reference price used to determine savings for stabilization purposes
(i.e., how much of the oil revenue to save or spend). Two approaches are possible: the reference
price could be set by using an automatic formula or by an independent committee. In practice, the
former approach is more common. Chile is an exception where an independent committee of
experts makes a judgment on medium- to long-term reference prices. In most developing countries,
limited institutional capacity and lack of a deep pool of independent experts suggest that pricebased rules should rely on automatic formulas. In principle, both approaches can bolster credibility
and protect fiscal policy from the spending pressures of the political cycle, provided that they are
carefully designed and formally written into law, such as a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), along with
supporting measures including strict withdrawal rule.
3. In practice, the price smoothing formula can take a number of possible specifications and
may operate as either a fiscal rule or a budgeting procedure to forecast resource revenue.


Mexico uses a weighted-average of the 10-year historical average of oil prices
(25 percent weight), the short-term futures price (50 percent weight), and medium-term futures
prices (25 percent weight). In addition, there are three oil revenue stabilization funds – for the
federal government, state-owned PEMEX, and state governments to reduce oil-related volatility
in the budget. This reflected a desire to avoid unplanned budget cuts if prices declined. The
rules of the funds were defined in the 2006 FR, which also included provisions for setting a
budget reference price for oil.



Ghana’s petroleum revenue legislation projects revenues on the basis of a 7-year moving
average of benchmark oil prices, including three future years.

4. In Nigeria, however, the budget oil price is determined through negotiations between the
federal government and the National Assembly. In the case of Chile, an explicit fiscal rule was
adopted in 2000 restricting overall central government spending to an estimate of trend central
government revenue consistent with trend estimates for GDP and the price of copper, with a 1
percent of GDP target for the structural balance. In 2002, and as way to enhance the rule’s
credibility, the government nominated an independent panel of experts to determine this price.

1

Prepared by Jaejoon Woo, Fiscal Affairs Department.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

The authorization to delegate to an independent panel the determination of the long-term copper
prices was enshrined in the FRL enacted in 2006. This copper panel meets once a year to define the
long-term copper price that determines the budget envelope for the following year. In 2010, the
independent commission (similar to an independent fiscal council) was also established to monitor
the enforcements of the fiscal rule. The rule’s credibility is strong, partly because of the
government’s decision to rely on two independent panels of experts to determine critical inputs for
the estimation of the structural balance. To enhance transparency and accountability, statements
identifying the members and documenting the panels’ results are published by the Budget
Directorate on a regular basis.2
5. These countries’ experiences have important implications. First, a robust fiscal framework for
successful management of natural resources requires some legal backing (e.g., formalization of the
fiscal rule in the FRL), a quality institutional setup, and fundamentally strong political commitment.
Second, establishing an independent panel of experts to determine the reference oil price can be
considered as a good alternative to adopting a price-smoothing formula. In the absence of its
formalization with a firm and transparent legal backing and a strong institutional framework,
however, the objective of setting up the independent expert panel could be seriously undermined.
Also, limited institutional capacity and a lack of a deep pool of independent experts may act as a
potential constraint for this option. Finally, best international practices strongly suggest that a clear
and simple rule with a credible enforcement mechanism can support fiscal discipline.

Appendix 8. Nigeria: Key FSSA Findings and Recommendations1
The FSSA is based on the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update for Nigeria, which was
undertaken in September 2012. The key macro-relevant findings and recommendations of the FSSA
are the following.

Health of Nigerian Banking System
1.
Findings: The Nigerian banking system is well capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Nonperforming loans fell to 5 percent of gross loans by mid-2012, as bad assets of all banks above this
threshold were transferred to AMCON. By mid-2012, return on assets for the industry rose to
1.2 percent, and return on equity to 8.9 percent. Stress test analysis suggests that most banks could
withstand extreme credit shocks; and risks from exchange rate shocks are minimal given the
stringent net open position limits and the limited foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers.
Although systemic risk has declined since the peak of the 2009 crisis, the financial system is still
exposed to a variety of risks from both global and domestic factors. Thus, further strengthening of
the supervisory and regulatory framework is needed to be able to prepare timely responses to
emerging risks.
2.

Key recommendations:
Finalize and implement the draft consolidated supervision framework, the draft code of
corporate governance, and the framework for financial holding company structures.
Review and update the Banking Act (BOFIA), last amended in 1999, in light of changes to the
generally accepted sound framework for bank regulation and supervision.
Build capacity for macroprudential oversight, including by improving quality of data.





Crisis Management and Resolution Preparedness
3.
Findings: The CBN and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation have a broad resolution
toolkit which was put to use during the crisis to resolve the intervened banks. At the time of the
crisis, the CBN had an overnight standing lending facility, a repurchase facility (up to 90 days, with
an option to roll over) and a rediscount facility. However, the CBN was able to utilize the flexibility of
the existing framework for longer-term liquidity. An expanded discount window facility, with loans
up to 360 days, was utilized during the crisis and the range of eligible collateral was increased to
include non-federal government securities. To enhance systemic liquidity, the CBN granted a blanket
guarantee on interbank claims and provided substantial liquidity through subordinated loans.
However, a longer term liquidity facility is missing. The authorities arranged mergers and
acquisitions, set up bridge banks to take over assets and liabilities of problem banks, and

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

established an asset management company (AMCON) to deal with NPLs and recapitalization of
banks. However, many of these crisis resolution measures invoked legal and procedural challenges.
4.
Key recommendations:
 Establish a longer-term emergency liquidity facility with clear policies and guidelines for
solvency tests, eligibility requirements, applicable interest rates and acceptable collaterals. Banks
that access such a facility should be subject to enhanced supervision.


Take measures to minimize the disruption to the resolution process caused by legal challenges.
For example, amend laws to provide that (a) in the event that there is any challenge to
resolution actions, there should be no suspension of resolution proceedings; and (b) redress for
wrongful measures should take the form of monetary compensation.



Devise a credible exit strategy for AMCON, and establish end–2017 as the sunset on AMCON
operations, disallow further acquisition of assets, and use surplus funds to buy back bonds



Shorten the 90-day payout term for the mainstream banking system to 30 days.

Cross Border Risk Management
5.
Findings. While Nigeria’s banking system is dominated by domestic banks, international
linkages are increasing as these banks expand beyond Nigeria. In addition, the Ecobank,
headquartered outside Nigeria and active in over 30 African countries, has its largest subsidiary in
Nigeria. The CBN has introduced a number of initiatives to enhance cross-border oversight,
including establishing a dedicated unit for cross-border supervision and executing many bilateral
MoUs on cross-border supervision and cooperation (including one with BCEAO signed in 2012). It
has commenced joint examinations of Nigerian banks with host central banks in West African
countries, and initiated a process for establishing specific Colleges of Supervisors for foreign
subsidiaries of Nigerian banks. However, a number of difficulties remain, including differences in
quality of supervision, reporting requirements, data reliability in some weaker jurisdictions, and offsite monitoring systems.
6.

Key recommendations:



Enhance supervisory oversight over banks with cross-border operations, including through joint
inspections in cases where Nigeria is host and where it is the home authority. In particular, when
a bank is systemically important, ensure that the CBN understands the consolidated health of
the institution.



Establish ex ante arrangements on what to do in the event of crisis; most signed MoUs do not
have a clear crisis management module.

Appendix 9. Nigeria: Power Sector Reforms1
In August 2010, President Goodluck Jonathan launched an ambitious plan for power sector reforms to
eliminate chronic power shortages. Since then, significant progress has been made and a number of
important reforms are ongoing.

Chronic Problem of Power Shortages
1. Nigeria’s power sector has not been able to supply adequate and reliable power. While
access to power is at levels close to middle-income countries in SSA, installed capacity
(per million people) in Nigeria is only about 5 percent of these countries’ average capacity.
Moreover, about one-third of its capacity is not in operation. The power situation worsened in the
second half of the last decade, as stagnant supply could not keep pace with increasing electricity
demand, partly because of sustained high economic growth. Consequently, average electricity
consumption per capita declined from 152 kWh in the mid-2000s to about 108 kWh in late 2000s.2
The economic impact of protracted power shortages have been substantial: enterprise surveys show
that 83 percent of businesses identified the lack of power as the biggest obstacle to doing business;
over 60 percent of businesses own backup generators, while the cost of self-generation is very high
(estimated at $0.40 per kWh); and formal sector firms lost about 10 percent of their revenue because
of power outages.
2. Despite many attempts at reforms, power utilities remained inefficient and inadequately
financed. Despite the end of the state’s monopoly in the supply of electricity in 1998, limited
change occurred in the subsequent decade. The 2005 Electric Power Sector Reform Act envisaged
dividing the national power authority into a number of successor generation and distribution
companies. The Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) was created and subsequently
17 generation and distribution units were formed under PHCN. However, by 2010, not much
privatization of these successor companies was realized. The National Electricity Regulatory
Commission (NERC) began to regulate the power sector and has issued about 29 power generation
licenses to independent power producers since 2006. Although operational inefficiency in power
utilities was reduced by 2010, the remaining inefficiencies were considerable: average collection rate
was at 88 percent and line power losses were close to 20 percent. More importantly, however, the
average effective tariff rate was about one-third of the average total cost of producing one unit of
electricity. These inefficiencies and tariffs well below the cost recovery levels have discouraged
investment in new generation and distribution infrastructure.

Reform Targets in the Power Sector Roadmap
3. There are two key goals of the Reform Roadmap: (a) privatizing the successor generation and
distribution companies to induce large private investments to meet demand for electricity and help
develop a competitive electricity market; and, (b) improving service delivery throughout the
transition period and after, to maintain broad support for reforms. To achieve these objectives, the
following actions were planned.3
a) Removing obstacles to private sector investment


Achieving cost-reflective electricity tariffs to ensure financial viability for successor companies
and to induce competitive bidding for these companies. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory
Commission will prepare a proposal for cost-reflective tariffs, with a view to maintain
appropriate lifeline tariffs to protect vulnerable consumers.



Establishing a bulk power purchaser to carry out contract management and bulk trading until
such time as the industry has developed capacity for successful bilateral contracting



Activating the Nigerian Electricity Liability Management Company (NELMCO to assume and
manage non-performing assets, legacy liabilities and other obligations that could not be easily
transferred from PHCN to any of the successor companies.



Contracting out the management of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to a private
company which has both the requisite project management and technical expertise, to ensure
adequate investment in transmission segment.



Clarifying the government’s strategy on the divestiture of the PHCN successor companies. The
3 hydro power generating plants will be subject to concessions for the operation because of the
magnitude of the capital requirements and associated water rights issues



The thermal generating plants and the distribution companies will be privatized via the sale of a
minimum of 51 percent equity to core investors that clearly demonstrate the technical and
financial ability to operate and expand production and service.

b) Improving service delivery throughout the transition


Transition to principally privately owned and controlled power sector cannot happen
overnight. In the interim period, the government will be accountable for service delivery across
large parts of the electricity value chain.



In short term, a substantial increase in the total power delivered to electricity consumers is
necessary step. By end-2013, at least double power supply from the mid-2010 levels.

Implementation of the Power Sector Roadmap
4. Substantial progress has been made on many targets of the roadmap.


Power supply has improved significantly (a new all-time record generation was achieved in
August 2012 with an available supply of nearly 4500 MW); power stability has improved; and
revenue collection increased from N 8 billion a month to N 11 billion in the last 12 months;



The role of the regulator (NERC) has been strengthened and made more independent;



The bulk trader company has been established and activated.



In June 2012, power tariffs were raised to cost-reflective levels, while lowering the lifeline tariff
for low consumption levels of low-income consumers;



PHCN’s six successor generation companies are being privatized and most received participation
from international and reputable partners; transfer of ownership is proceeding;



PHCN’s 10 successor distribution companies also privatized, and transfer of ownership is
underway;



To reduce risks to private investors from future policy actions, the government has entered into
a partial risk guarantee arrangement with the World Bank;



A 5-year management contract for the Nigerian Transmission Company with a Canadian firm
has been activated to improve efficiency; and there has been continued strengthening of the
fuel-to-power segment, through additional investment in gas pipelines and increased prices for
gas feedstock.

5. Looking ahead, the ongoing privatization process will require sustained commitment to
overcome any hurdles may appear in such a complicated reform process.

Appendix 10. The Petroleum Industry Bill1
1. Since 2008, many attempts have been made to overhaul the regulatory and supervisory
framework for the petroleum sector. The first Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), submitted to the
National Assembly in 2008, was stalled for many years and led to irreconcilable versions of the Bill
in the two houses of the National Assembly. In January 2012, following the partial removal of the
gasoline subsidy, the Minister of Petroleum Resources constituted a Task Force to revise and
reconcile various previous versions of the PIB with the goal of expediting its passage into law.
The revised PIB, after approval by the Cabinet, was submitted to the National Assembly in July.
2. The Bill is aimed at a wide-range of reforms in the oil and gas sector. This bill combines
a multitude of laws and regulations into a single consistent legislation. For example, it proposes
modifications in the fiscal regime; a complete overhaul of the national oil company (NNPC) and
other key executive and regulatory agencies; additional measures to improve transparency and
accountability; and the deregulation of the downstream activities. The issues involved are complex,
and their resolution can be expected to have significant implications for investment flows, industry
activity, and government revenues.
3. A key objective of the PIB is to raise the government take from operations under
production sharing contracts (PSCs)—one of the two main oil production contracts enforced
in Nigeria. For this purpose, the PIB proposes replacing the petroleum profit tax (PPT) with the
corporate income tax (CIT) and a new national hydrocarbon tax (NHT). While combined rates for
NHT and CIT for onshore operations remains at 85 percent (same as the current PPT rate), the
combined tax on deepwater operations is proposed to be raised to 55 percent from the current PPT
rate of 50 percent. Also, replacing the investment tax credit with a general production allowance for
PSCs executed before July 1998 will increase government take.
4. However, some aspects of the proposed fiscal regime may require careful reconsideration.
For example, introducing royalty rates—another important determinant of the overall take of the
government—by subsequent regulations instead of setting them in the law increases the risk of
regime instability. Investors may feel a significant risk of future changes, which may discourage
investment. Discretionary power by the Minister to change the rates or to impose additional
differentiation of royalties could lead to a very complex system and increase incentives for rent
seeking. Similarly, the bill assigns borrowing authority to multiple institutions, which could lead to
potential fiscal risks. Ideally, borrowing powers, especially for foreign loans, should be conferred
only if essential and should be subject to a centralized oversight process.

5. While some institutional reforms are needed, the proposed institutional setup is complex
and unwieldy. Attempts to separate the management of the state’s assets and investments in oil
sector from the regulatory and supervisory functions are welcome—currently all these functions are
housed in a single entity (NNPC). However, the proposed institutional changes could easily become
too complex and costly. For example, the current operations of NNPC are proposed to be divided up
into four companies: a National Oil Company, an Assets Management Corporation to management
government investments in the upstream industry, an Assets Management Company to take over
joint ventures—accounting for majority of oil production—and existing debt liabilities, and a
National Gas Company. This multiplicity risks (a) high administrative costs; (b) conflicts in
responsibility among the agencies involved and significant uncertainties on the allocation of inflows
(e.g., petroleum revenues); (c) increased potential for corruption or political bargaining; and (d) lack
of certainty for investors. In this context, streamlining the proposed institutional setup is desired.
6. Transparency and accountability provisions could be strengthened. The PIB recommends an
open, transparent and competitive bidding process for granting petroleum licenses and leases.
However, it also empowers the President to grant a license or lease without subjecting these powers
to the same transparency requirements, which is not in line with best practices. Allowing many of
the proposed institutions to accept gifts or grants, especially from the same industry they regulate
or operate in, is problematic and can create opportunities for rent seeking. The bill should also
require independent audits and disclosure of financial reports for the National Oil Company and
other companies/corporations to promote further transparency.
7. The government and the oil industry have very different views on pre-tax economics of
Nigerian oil projects and the effect of the PIB on these. A process should be initiated to bridge
these technical gaps, including through detailed independent cost audit of existing projects,
technical review of industry’s development plans and projected costs by independent experts, and
expert advice on appropriate required rates of return for IOCs investments in Nigeria.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS1
Approved By
Seán Nolan and Martin
Mühleisen (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

Based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Nigeria
remains at a low risk of debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the case of the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. For the customized stress
test, which simulates a persistent oil price shock, all indicators deteriorate compared to the
baseline results, but generally remain within all of the country specific thresholds relevant for
Nigeria. The main finding of the DSA—Nigeria is at a low risk of debt distress—is the same
as that for the last DSA, published in July 2012. But the findings from the stress scenarios
also show that, without significant compensating policy measures, a prolonged negative oil
price shock or permanent real GDP growth shock could undermine the recent progress
made in achieving macroeconomic and debt sustainability. Nevertheless, given Nigeria’s
strong starting position, timely policy action should be able to avert future sustainability
problems. The assumptions used for this DSA are also broadly similar to those used in the
previous DSA, although with a slightly higher oil price and real GDP growth projected
throughout the baseline forecast period while incorporating estimated fiscal costs arising
from Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria’s (AMCON) bonds. The analysis is
complicated by the still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments data, and the
DSA does not incorporate debt of the state and local governments due to data limitations.

Prepared by the IMF and IDA staffs in collaboration with the Nigerian authorities. Debt data, sustainability

issues, and the new debt limit policy were discussed with the authorities in the course of the 2012 Article IV
consultation. This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint
Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, January 22, 2010 (available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 and http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40). The analysis
updates the 2011 DSA (IMF Country Report for Nigeria 12/194).

BACKGROUND
1. The previous DSA for Nigeria was undertaken as part of the 2011 Article IV consultation
and published in July 2012.2 Following the final phase of Nigeria’s Paris Club Agreement in 2006,
which led to an $18 billion reduction in Nigeria’s external debt, external public debt is projected to
total US$6.5 billion, or 2.4 percent of GDP, at end-2012.3 Approximately $5.3 billion of that total
external debt stock is multilateral debt, of which about 87 percent is owed to IDA. The breakdown
for external debt by main creditor is as follows:

consolidated central government level. Data on state and local governments’ borrowing are
currently not available. While sub-national borrowing is currently limited and tightly regulated, there

is scope for State Governments to expand their exposure to domestic creditors. Public debt data
analysis is also complicated by a multiplicity of off budget funds. Figures for Nigeria’s debt stock do
not include debts contracted by public enterprises.

A. Macroeconomic Assumptions
3. The assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2012–32 underlying this DSA are as follows:
• Average GDP growth of 7 percent over the period 2012–31 (somewhat below the average of
7.5 percent for 2009–2011) reflecting buoyant growth of non-oil GDP of around 7.5 percent
(on the basis of continued structural reform efforts) and modest growth of oil and gas GDP of
1.7 percent.
• A recovery in capital inflows, including in foreign direct investment to the oil sector, which will
be sensitive to political developments and the outcome of the Petroleum Industry Bill. In line with
the latest WEO projections, the analysis assumes a Nigerian oil price of US$110.1 per barrel in 2012,
moderating to US$93.1 per barrel by 2017, and then staying at US$90.7 per barrel thereafter. Crude
oil production per day is assumed to gradually increase from 2.4 million barrels in 2012 to 3 million
barrels in 2021 and then staying at that level thereafter. As a result, oil exports will hover in the
range of US$83½ - 88 billion throughout the projection period.
• A consolidated government non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) would decline from36 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2011 to around 20 percent of non-oil GDP in 2017. It would continue to decline
gradually thereafter.4 This is broadly consistent with the medium-term projections outlined in the
government’s medium-term fiscal strategy for 2013-15. Such a stance would also be consistent with
what staff assesses is needed to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability while preserving oil and gas
wealth for future generations. In addition, it is assumed that the oil-price-based fiscal rule continues
to be applied, with a budget oil price assumed to be on average around 20 percent below the
projected oil price.5
• After strong export growth during 2010–12 driven by a recovery of oil prices, exports are
projected to stagnate during 2013–17 because of easing oil prices, while imports are projected to
grow strongly reflecting a buoyant domestic demand growth. As a result, the current account

4

The DSA is based on the projections on Brent crude prices assumed in the December 2012 WEO updates. Nigerian
oil price is projected by using the past relations between the Nigerian oil prices and Brent oil prices.
5

The government is assumed to resist pressures to loosen the current fiscal policy stance and to establish a medium
and long-term sustainable fiscal position. The long-term sustainable fiscal position is calculated on the basis of a
constant consumption of oil wealth in real terms. This implies a decline in the consumption of oil wealth (the non-oil
primary deficit) as a percent of non-oil GDP over time. Oil reserves are sufficient to sustain oil production at or above
current levels throughout the projection period. The discount in the budget oil price relative to the actual oil price
and prudent expenditure policy provides for overall surpluses and an accumulation in financial assets throughout.

balance would decline to about ½ percent of GDP by 2017. After that, it would hover around zero
until 2032: growth in non-oil exports will partially offset the declining oil exports in the medium
term.
• Euro bond issuance of US$1.1 billion in 2013 to finance infrastructure investments (including gas
pipelines).
• Drawing on the infrastructure loans from China in the amount of about US$450 million during
2013–17.6
• As for the contingent liabilities from AMCON bonds, a total of N607 billion is assumed to
materialize as ultimate fiscal cost for the federal government in 2022 (equivalent to 0.5 percent of
GDP), which implies that public debt path increases by this amount and stays flat through 2032.7
4. At the time of the 2011 DSA, Nigeria’s external public debt was projected to total $6.3
billion, or 2.5 percent of GDP, at end-2011, while domestic public debt was projected to reach
15.6 percent of GDP at end-2011. It turned out that external debt totaled 2.4 percent of GDP,
while domestic public debt was 14.9 percent of GDP. The assumptions made in the 2011 DSA have
proven broadly accurate. However, the current account in 2011 was considerably weaker than
forecast in the previous DSA and it is likely that the current account surplus in 2012 will fall
significantly short of the last DSA forecast. The weaker-than-projected current account position in
2011 was largely due to higher-than-projected imports. The fiscal stance in 2011 turned out to
somewhat better than anticipated because of revenue over performance. The fiscal stance is
projected to have improved significantly in 2012 due to restraint in recurrent spending. Overall
growth in 2011–12 was broadly in line with that projected at the time of the 2011 DSA. Finally,
global oil prices were slightly higher in 2011–12 than had been forecast at the time of the previous
DSA.
5. It is important to note two issues with external sector data for Nigeria that complicate the
debt sustainability analysis. First, there are still large errors and omissions in the presentation of
the balance of payments statistics, which may reflect an underestimation of current account debit
transactions, and which leads to the observed large residuals in the DSA presentation. There is also a
break in the balance of payments series between 2005 and 2006, where the authorities’ data is used
for the first time. Given the change in methodology to estimates the imports in 2010, there is
another break in the balance of payments data between 2009 and 2010.

6

The loans from China would be for 20 years with a 2.5 percent interest rate.

7

The estimated fiscal cost under the baseline scenario is computed as the AMCON borrowing (about N3.2 trillion as
of end-November 2012) net of the expected asset recovery (about 42%) and contribution from the sinking fund
(raised by 0.5% levy on banks’ assets and CBN contributions).

4

NIGERIA

B. External Sustainability8
Baseline
6. In the baseline scenario, the nominal external debt burden is projected to increase for the
next five years but decline gradually thereafter (Figure 1 and Table1). The external debt to GDP
ratio would rise from 2.4 percent in 2011 to 4.3 percent in 2017, reflecting external borrowing to
finance scaled-up public investment during the next five years. Then it falls gradually and it will
decline to 0.5 percent by 2032. The debt service to exports and the debt service to revenue ratios
also decline gradually after reaching peak in 2017. All debt and debt service indicators remain well
below their respective threshold levels throughout the projection period.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
7. Standardized stress tests were carried out (Figure 1 and Table2). Under the most extreme
case (i.e., the export shock), (i) the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio is not likely to exceed 10 percent of
GDP throughout the projection period; and (ii) the PV of debt-to-exports ratio reaches a peak of
around 35 percent, far below its indicative debt burden threshold of 150 percent.
8. A country-specific alternative scenario was also examined. This scenario is designed to
illustrate the impact on the external accounts and the debt dynamics of a prolonged oil price shock
(in light of Nigeria’s high dependency on oil, as well as the high level of oil prices projected over the
medium term).9 The impact of the oil price shock on the external accounts is calibrated such that
the oil price is lower than the baseline by 30 percent during 2013–17. All indicators worsen
considerably from the baseline under this country-specific scenario but remain within the
country-specific thresholds relevant for Nigeria, with the exception of the PV of the debt-to-exports
ratio, which exceeds in one year (2017).

8

The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external debt sustainability
which is guided by indicative, country-specific, debt burden thresholds based on the relative strength of a country’s
policies and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.5 (medium performer), which is the three year average of the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant country-specific thresholds are a PV of
debt to GDP of 40 percent, a PV of debt to exports of 150 percent, and a debt service to exports ratio of 20 percent.
9

This country-specific scenario provides only partial equilibrium perspective: it looks only at the impacts on current
account balance and external debt dynamics arising from the severe oil price shocks but its impacts on the GDP and
fiscal accounts are not analyzed. To analyze the debt dynamics under general equilibrium perspective, the Staff
Report analyzes debt dynamics under an alternative scenario which assumes a more complete adverse scenario:
lower GDP and worse fiscal balance compared with the baseline for several years arising from negative oil price
shocks caused by prolonged slow growth in advanced economies.

C. Fiscal Sustainability
9. Consolidated government gross debt outstanding is estimated at 17¾ percent of GDP at
end-2012, and is projected to decline steadily over the long run. The current maturity structure
of domestic debt is favorable, with the short-term debt accounting for slightly less than 30 percent
of total debt. Under the baseline scenario (Figure 2 and Table 3), consolidated government debt to
GDP ratio would first increase marginally to 18 percent by 2014 and then only gradually decline to
16½ percent in 2017, because the projected level of fiscal surpluses during the period is not large
enough to achieve more aggressive debt reduction while simultaneously accumulating the
projected amount of assets in the Excess Crude Account (ECA)/Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF)
(Table 2 in the accompanying staff report). Net debt, i.e., gross debt less the assets in the ECA/SWF,
is also projected to decline from 13 percent of GDP at end-2012 towards 9½ percent by 2017. In
ensuing years, the gross public debt to GDP ratio gradually declines. As for the contingent liabilities
from AMCON bonds over the medium-term, a total of N607 billion (equivalent to 0.5 percent of
GDP) is assumed to materialize as ultimate fiscal cost for the federal government in 2022, which
implies that the domestic debt stock jumps up by this amount and then stays flat throughout 2032,
translating into a smoothly declining path from 9¾ percent of GDP in 2022 towards around
3 percent of GDP by 2032. This is largely due to the continued efforts of fiscal consolidation at the
general government level and sustained growth assumed under the baseline scenario.
10. The standardized stress tests underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust to the
economic environment. In particular, the present value of public debt to GDP ratio would creep up
to 26 percent throughout the projection period under a permanently lower real GDP growth
scenario, as fiscal balance in each year would worsen significantly compared with the baseline
scenario. 10 With oil prices stabilizing over the medium term, public debt dynamics would become
more susceptible to negative economic growth shock. In such an adverse scenario, fiscal policy will
need to adjust by about 1 percent of GDP each year to bring the public debt stock path to the same
path under the baseline (Figure 2 and Table 4).

D. Conclusion
12 Nigeria is at low risk of external debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust throughout the projection period.
However, the findings from the stress scenarios also show that, without significant compensating
policy measures, a prolonged oil price shock or deterioration in the growth could undermine the

10

Under the alternative scenario in the Staff Report, which assumes lower GDP and worse fiscal balance compared
with the baseline for several years as a result of negative oil price shocks caused by prolonged slow growth in
advanced economies, the public debt to GDP ratio would rise to around 19½ percent of GDP by 2015.

recent progress made in achieving macroeconomic and public debt sustainability. Nonetheless,
given Nigeria’s strong financial starting position, timely policy action should be able to avert future
sustainability problems.
Authorities Views
13. The authorities were in agreement with the staff’s main conclusions. The staff’s finding of
low external debt risk was consistent with their view. They agreed that timely policy adjustments
would be necessary in the event of a prolonged adverse oil price or economic growth shock.

Includes public and publicly guaranteed external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to
maintain an exchange rate fundamentally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility
and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. In recent years it has maintained an
exchange rate band vis-à-vis the US dollar and has recently allowed adjustment of the band’s
mid-point in response to market forces. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is also other
managed arrangement. In spite of some stability of the Naira-US dollar exchange rate, the nominal

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

effective exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in recent years. The CBN publishes information
on its interventions through auctions on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank
market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that
the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% around the
central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime.
XI.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was subject to
a full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that expired on
October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed on
November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial
reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.

consultation was concluded on February 11, 2011.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 30, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data
deficiencies—in particular inadequate information on subnational public finances, and large errors
and omissions in the balance of payments—continue to hamper policy design and monitoring.
The Statistics Act passed in 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) as the
main coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements, including
better information sharing between data producing and collecting agencies. Nevertheless, a number
of problems continue to prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, in particular,
lack of good source data and insufficient computerization.
National accounts: Statistical methods used to derive production-based GDP have been improved
through the development of more comprehensive estimates for a number of individual industries,
although a number of statistical challenges remain. As reported in IMF Country Report No. 8/64,
revisions to the national accounts published in late-2007 led to some apparent discontinuities in
the series for non-oil GDP, and in particular agricultural output in 2002 and 2004, which complicates
analysis of historical economic activity. Work is ongoing to conduct a new agricultural census, which
should lead to improvements in the measurement of agricultural production—a key sector accounting
for over half non-oil GDP—which is currently estimated on the basis of outdated survey information.
Basic statistics are extensively available for the compilation of national accounts, but their quality is
not always satisfactory due to high non-response rates and inaccuracy of reported data. The reliance
on the consumer price index to construct the constant price GDP series leads to weaknesses.
The introduction of additional indices, such as a producer price index, would facilitate more accurate
estimation of the constant price measure. The base year for the national accounts (1990) is in urgent
need of updating given the significant chances to the structure of the economy since then, and the
authorities have recently requested Fund Technical Assistance (TA) in this regard. Recent TA has
advised on implementing supply and use tables for the compilation of GDP, in accord with
international standards. A work plan has been agreed with the NBS to update the base year of
national accounts during 2013.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural
price data, is available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to November 2009=100,
using the 2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97 survey-based
expenditure weights.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are opaque and complicated not only by the federal
structure but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds. The most pressing shortcomings are related
to inadequate data coverage, particularly of the subnational governments which comprise almost
one-half of total government expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the
subnational fiscal accounts which makes it difficult for it to play a stabilizing role by targeting
a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this issue have been stymied by constitutional
restrictions. Although a recent STA TA Evaluation mission found that the CBN has gathered

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

NIGERIA

a substantial amount of data on state and local governments, these data are yet to be processed and
are subject to further technical assistance. To facilitate the timely preparation of a consolidated set of
fiscal accounts, governments at all levels need to use budget classification, chart of accounts, and
accounting systems that will allow consistent classifications of the data. There is also a need to
formalize the publication of government accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis and to increase
coverage to also report on the operations of parastatals.

Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation
of monetary statistics. Earlier problems with the CBN accounting framework and IT issues, which had
contributed to significant distortions in reported monetary data, have now been resolved. There is
a need for a clearer measure of commercial banks’ foreign assets and liabilities that captures both
their on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The definition of the other depository corporations (ODCs)
sector should also be extended beyond commercial banks to include all deposit-taking nonbank
financial institutions, such as microfinance banks and primary mortgage institutions.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including
both core and a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN.
The CBN is currently working to methodologically strengthen the estimation of FSIs and is also more
closely supervising banks to ensure accurate disclosure practices.

Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s
balance of payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have
expanded the range and improved the quality of data sources used to compile the balance of
payments statistics.
There are however still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which complicate the
assessment of external sustainability. It will be important, therefore, to further strengthen the
measurement of the balance of payments and the international investment position. There is a need
for improved validation of transactions reported by banks, measurement of transactions outside the
banking system, appropriate treatment of transactions of enterprises in free trade zone as residents
of the Nigerian territory, and improved coverage of estimates of the external assets and liabilities of
the banking sector. The DFID/GDDS Phase III Module, launched in 2010 to cover a five-year period,
carries on the previous project work and is assisting the country to improve their source data by
collecting additional data on the cross-border private capital flows and stocks.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) is currently working, in tight collaboration with the CBN, to extend the
coverage of their database to include private sector liabilities and foreign investment in domestically
issued debt securities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Seán Nolan and Martin Mühleisen

Since the issuance of the staff report, staff have received revised data that point to a
slight decline in the overall poverty rate from 2004, a conclusion that contrasts with
the slight increase in poverty levels identified in previously published data. The
National Bureau of Statistics of Nigeria, with the support of the World Bank and other
development partners, has calculated new poverty statistics based on extensive
surveys of Nigerian households in both 2003–2004 and 2009–2010. On this basis,
they now estimate that the headcount poverty rate fell from 64.2 percent in 2004 to
62.6 percent in 2010, while, on an adult equivalency basis, the rate declined from
48.3 percent to 46 percent.
This new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 28, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria
On February 6, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance has been broadly positive over the past year. Real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth is projected to have decelerated slightly to 6.3 percent, reflecting the
effects of the nationwide strike in early 2012, floods in the fourth quarter of 2012, and continued
security problems in the north. Annual inflation increased from 10.3 percent (end-of-period) in
2011 to 12.3 percent in 2012, owing mainly to the adjustment of administrative prices of fuel and
electricity; large increases in import tariffs on rice and wheat; and the impact of floods in Q3.
The external position has strengthened and international reserves rose from US$32.6 billion at
end-2011 to US$44 billion at end-2012 (5½ months of prospective imports), driven by sustained
high oil prices, stricter administration of the gasoline subsidy regime, and strong portfolio
inflows.
The fiscal policy stance was tightened in 2012 and fiscal buffers are being rebuilt. The non-oil
primary deficit of the consolidated government is estimated to have narrowed from about 36
percent of non-oil GDP in 2011 to 30.5 percent in 2012, mainly due to expenditure restraint.
Monetary policy remained tight in 2012 in response to inflationary pressures. The central bank

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

kept its policy rate unchanged during the year but raised the cash reserve requirement for
banks from 8 percent to 12 percent and lowered allowable open foreign exchange position for
banks. Financial soundness indicators point to continued improvements in the health of the
banking system.
In 2013, growth is expected to recover to above 7 percent. Inflation is projected to decline below
10 percent, supported by the tight monetary policy stance and ongoing fiscal consolidation. The
key downside risks are a large drop in world oil prices; and slow progress in building consensus
around key fiscal reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for prudent macroeconomic policies that have underpinned a strong economic
performance in recent years. Looking ahead, Directors agreed that widespread unemployment
and poverty remain key challenges for policymakers, and called for renewed efforts to make
economic growth more broad-based and inclusive.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy of consolidating the fiscal position while opening up
policy space for needed investment in infrastructure and human capital. To this end, they
underscored the need to improve tax administration, better prioritize public expenditure,
strengthen public financial management, and improve the fiscal framework. In particular, they
encouraged the authorities to reduce poorly-targeted fuel subsidies, adopt a rule to set the
reference oil price in the budget, and fully operationalize the Sovereign Wealth Fund as soon as
possible. Efforts to mobilize public support for these reforms should be intensified.
Directors considered the current tight monetary stance to be consistent with the authorities’
objective of reducing inflation to single digits. They also took note of the staff’s assessment that
the exchange rate in real effective terms is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Directors commended the authorities’ success in restoring financial stability after the 2009
banking crisis. In light of this achievement, they recommended winding down the operations of
the asset management company to curb moral hazard and fiscal risks. Directors welcomed the
central bank’s commitment to address supervisory and regulatory gaps identified in the
Financial Stability Assessment Update, particularly the need to strengthen cross-border
supervision and the regime against money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors concurred that wide-ranging reforms are key to make growth more inclusive. They
agreed on the importance of supporting sectors with high employment potential, not through
protectionist measures or tax incentives but rather with initiatives to improve governance, the
investment climate, and competiveness. Directors welcomed reforms underway in the energy

3
sector, and looked forward to an early passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill which would boost
investment, government revenue, and fiscal transparency. They also encouraged the authorities
to promote market-based access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director for Nigeria
February 6, 2013
We welcome staff’s comprehensive assessment of Nigeria’s macroeconomic and policy
environment in 2012 and the outlook. My Nigerian authorities are quite appreciative of the
mission’s constructive engagement, and acknowledgement of measures and policies
implemented so far to put Nigeria on a sustainable growth path. The various concerns raised
particularly on the oil-price based fiscal rule and the Excess Crude Account/Sovereign
Wealth Fund are well noted and the authorities are cautiously addressing them given the
complex fiscal federalism in operation, and the constitutional provisions. The good news is
that the government actions are beginning to bear fruit and more progress is expected in the
coming years given the authorities unwavering commitment to the implementation of the
Transformation Agenda.
Economic Conditions in 2012 and Outlook
Strong growth underpinned by consistent macroeconomic policies and favorable
international fuel prices continued in 2012. In spite of the initial slowdown in the first quarter
of the year on account of the negative impact of partial fuel subsidy removal, the economy
grew by 6.6 per cent during the year. A tight monetary policy and a broadly prudent fiscal
policy ensured that inflation pressures arising partly from adjustments in the energy and
import tariffs, heightened domestic liquidity situation, and flooding were kept under control.
The year-on-year average headline inflation stood at 12.24 per cent, while that of core and
food inflation were 13.87 and 11.32 percent respectively. The financial system has stabilized
with continuous improvement in basic financial indicators while the Nigerian Stock
Exchange has made a bullish come-back amidst significant gains in 2012. Accretion to
external reserves continued to improve with an end year figure of about US$44billion
compared with US$33 billion at end 2011.
Overall, the medium-term outlook remains broadly positive on account of the authorities’
perseverance with the implementation of the reform program, and notwithstanding the
downside risks to the economy posed by the uncertain external economic environment
including a possible fall in international oil prices, and domestic security challenges. These
risks are well understood by the authorities and allowance has been made for them in the
fiscal plan as indicated in the 2013-2015 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP).
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are resolute with prudent fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation which began with
the 2011 budget and registered significant gains in 2012 would be sustained in 2013 and
beyond. A combination of improved non-oil revenue mobilization and public expenditure
rationalization is expected to help build fiscal buffers. Steps have been initiated to increase
revenues by blocking leakages from various sources, improving corporate tax collection, and
boosting internally generated revenue. On the expenditure side, the focus is on freeing

resources from recurrent expenditure toward capital spending. This is to be achieved through
reduction in overhead spending, elimination of waste, inefficiency, corruption, and
duplication. Limiting the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP and restraint on public
borrowing are other important measures.
The authorities are also intensifying efforts to improve on public financial management. To
this end, a Treasury Single Account is being established to better manage cash balances,
reduce corruption and inefficiency in the allocation of resources. The Government Integrated
Financial Management Information System has also been introduced to make the process of
budget preparation and execution more efficient and transparent.
Oil-Price Based Fiscal Rule
The Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) 2007 provides for the adoption of oil-price based fiscal
rule although no specific oil price benchmark is stipulated. In line with this provision, the
fiscal authorities often adopt a cautious oil price benchmark based on the model of 10-year
and 5-year moving averages with some adjustments in the preparation of the budget. The
expectation is that revenues in excess of the benchmark price will be set aside in the Excess
Crude Account (ECA)/Sovereign Wealth Fund which by the existing fiscal arrangement
belongs to the federal(central) and sub-national governments. However, the Parliament, in
approving the MTEF/FSP and the federal budget, often adjusts upward the oil price
benchmark based on the argument that there is little sense in keeping the oil price benchmark
very low and at the same time running fiscal deficits and stepping up public borrowing. Subnational governments on their part often argue that they cannot be coerced into the ECA
arrangement since the constitution provides that all monies in the Federation Account (ECA
inclusive) belong to all levels of government and must be shared on an agreed revenue
sharing formula. Thus a sustainable oil-price based fiscal rule has to start with consensus
building between the federal and sub-national governments on the one hand, and between the
Executive arm of the federal government and the Parliament on the other. The authorities are
fully aware of this and are intensifying efforts to arrive at a common ground - inclusive
consensus. Once this is done, enactment/amendment of relevant laws to enforce an oil-based
fiscal rule including adoption of best international practices would be easy.
Subsidy
One major challenge facing the fiscal authorities is eliminating the huge fuel subsidy (which
is currently funded from the ECA) in order to free resources for enhanced social and
productive public investment. Attempts at this in early 2012 was vehemently resisted leading
to only partial removal of the subsidy and the proceeds invested in viable capital projects and
provision of safety nets for the poor and vulnerable groups under the Subsidy Reinvestment
and Empowerment Program (SURE-P). The authorities then resorted to a review of the fuel
subsidy scheme to enhance greater transparency and accountability. While the ultimate goal
of government is to completely eliminate the fuel subsidy, the authorities are currently
intensifying consensus building processes through communication and consultation with
major stakeholders, improving the local petroleum refining capacity to reduce imports of

2

petroleum products, and successful execution of projects under the SURE-P. In the interim,
budgetary provisions would continue to be made for the subsidy.
Monetary Policy
Price and exchange rate stability remain the focus of the monetary authorities. In response to
the heightened inflationary pressures, the monetary authorities maintained tight monetary
policy stance using appropriate mix of policy instruments in 2012. This policy stance is
expected to continue, as the recent decision of the Monetary Policy Committee indicates,
until the near term inflation trajectory becomes clearer. The ultimate goal is to achieve single
digit inflation. On exchange rate, the authorities have demonstrated strong preference for
stability with necessary adjustments to align it to economic fundamentals. So far the existing
exchange rate management polices and instruments have achieved the desired objectives and
there is no urgent need for a change.
Financial Stability
With the domestic financial sector crisis now over, the attention of the authorities has turned
to strengthening the financial system and repositioning it to play a greater role in the
transformation of the economy. It is in this sense that the authorities sought an independent
external assessment of the financial system to determine additional measures needed. The
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update was conducted in September, 2012 and
the report -The Financial Sector Stability Assessment Report - confirms the recovery and
relative stability of the banking system. The authorities’ value the FSAP recommendations
some of which have reached advanced stages of implementation.
Going forward, the authorities will continue to strengthen the risk-based and cross border
supervision frameworks and ensure transparency in the operation of the financial system.
They are also strengthening the legal and institutional frameworks for financial sector
regulation and crisis resolution, particularly the Financial Stability Committee within the
central bank, Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC), and the
Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). The authorities are assiduously
working on the appropriate exit strategy for AMCON bearing in mind the potential fiscal and
moral hazard risks. They are also seriously addressing the AML/CFT deficiencies. Already
the relevant laws on money laundering and terrorism financing are in place.
Structural reforms
The authorities view steadfast implementation of structural reforms encapsulated in the
transformation agenda as the most sensible way to diversify the economy and alleviate
poverty. The focus is on developing a viable value chain within the agricultural sector,
entertainment industry, non-oil minerals, and real estate as well as improvement in power,
road and port infrastructure, education, and health. Equally important is enhancement of
credit access for agriculture and small and medium scale enterprises.

Power Sector
Remarkable achievements have been recorded in the power sector. Power supply in many
parts of the country has improved significantly while sustained efforts at rehabilitation of
existing power infrastructure yielded up to 1000 megawatts of additional electricity in 2012.
The completion of all projects under the National Integrated Power Project later in the year is
expected to add additional 1055 megawatts. This is complemented by enhanced efforts to
improve gas supply to the power generating companies as well as upgrading of the
transmission and distribution infrastructures. The cost-recovery energy tariff structure is
already in place. More importantly, the authorities are in the final stages of the privatization
of the generating and distribution companies created from the unbundling of the state-owned
Power Holding Company of Nigeria. The successful handing over of these companies to the
preferred bidders slated for the second quarter of 2013 will further improve the power supply
situation.
Agriculture
Agriculture is regarded as a veritable tool for job creation and poverty alleviation. The
authorities’ target is to create 3.5 million jobs in this sector by 2015. Detailed programs of
action have been developed for the major crops with significant export potentials such as
rice, cassava, sorghum, oil palm, cocoa, and cotton. Implementation of these programs is
progressing steadily. This is complemented by a targeted subsidized fertilizer scheme and an
agricultural credit insurance scheme.
Oil and gas sector
The key to this sector’s reform is the speedy passage of the revised Petroleum Industry Bill
now before the parliament. There is a consensus in the parliament to give it expedited
attention this year. The government committee charged with the responsibility of ensuring
quick passage of the Bill is actively engaging the parliament and other stakeholders. On the
divergence of views related to the fiscal regime, the authorities consider it as normal
especially as it involves reining in more revenue for the government. The resistance of the
major players in the oil industry is very much expected. The authorities do not see immediate
need for contracting “internationally-renowned (and independent) oil experts” to advise on
the cost structure informing the fiscal regime as there is no convincing evidence that the
committee that prepared the Bill did not do so. The authorities are confident that the gray
areas in the Bill will be resolved in the interest of all stakeholders.
Conclusion
In the past year, my Nigerian authorities have recorded milestone achievements in the
implementation of structural reforms and in ensuring macroeconomic stability under a
volatile external environment. This has resulted in strong growth although unemployment
and poverty reduction remain major challenges. Given the authorities’ unswerving
commitment to the implementation of the structural reforms, these challenges would be
adequately addressed in the medium to long term. Meanwhile, continuous investment in
4

priority areas for job creation and inclusive growth particularly on roads, ports, railways, and
airport infrastructure upgrades as well as human capital development including health care
and education remain the cornerstone of government polices going forward. My authorities
gratefully acknowledge the encouragement received from the Fund through technical
assistance and policy advice.
