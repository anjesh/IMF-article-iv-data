STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 8, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. After three decades of remarkable growth, the economy has been slowing. Much of the
slowdown has been structural, reflecting the natural convergence process and waning dividends
from past reforms; weak global growth has also contributed. Moreover, since the global financial
crisis, growth has relied too much on investment and credit, which is not sustainable and has
created rising vulnerabilities. Growth was 7.7 percent in 2013, and is expected to slow to around
7½ percent this year and decline further over the medium term.
Focus. The pattern of growth since the global financial crisis is not sustainable and has resulted in
rising vulnerabilities. The discussions focused on assessing the risks posed by the continued
build-up of vulnerabilities; reforms to unleash new, sustainable engines of growth and reduce
vulnerabilities; and how to best manage aggregate demand in this context, as growth is slowing
yet risks are still rising. A key takeaway is that to secure a safer development path,
accommodative policies need to be carefully unwound, accompanied by decisive
implementation of the announced reform agenda to promote rebalancing. The result will be
somewhat slower but safer growth in the near term, with the significant long-run benefit of
securing more inclusive, environment-friendly, and sustainable growth.
Risks. Credit and ‘shadow banking,’ local government finances, and the corporate sector—
particularly real estate—are the key, and interlinked, areas of rising vulnerability. In the near term,
the risk of a hard landing is still considered low as the government has the capacity to combat
potential shocks. However, without a change in the pattern of growth, the hard-landing risk
continues to rise and is assessed to be medium-likely over the medium term.
Reform agenda. The authorities have announced a comprehensive and ambitious blueprint of
reforms. Successful implementation should achieve the desired transformation of the economy,
but will also be challenging.
Demand management. Reining in credit growth, local government borrowing, and investment
will address the risks, but also slow growth. Macro support should be calibrated to allow needed
adjustments to take place, while preventing growth from slowing too much.
Scenarios and spillovers. With faster adjustment and reform implementation, growth will be
somewhat lower in the near term, with moderate spillovers for trading partners. However, in the
medium term, income and consumption will both be higher—a result that is good for China and
good for the global economy.

SETTING
A. Background
1.
Decades of rapid growth are a testament to China’s success in implementing reforms.
Since the start of economic liberalization in the early 1980s, China has grown at a rate of almost
10 percent per year, translating into higher living standards and raising over 600 million people out
of poverty. This success was built on waves of major reforms, and frequent adjustment of policies in
line with evolving conditions. With economic, social and environmental challenges rising, the need
for another round of reforms has become ever more urgent. The new government leadership, which
came to power early last year, has stated a strong commitment to reinvigorate the effort to
transform the economy with a broad and ambitious reform agenda.
2.
The announced reform agenda is broadly consistent with past Fund advice. The key
message from the last few Article IV consultations was that a comprehensive package of reforms was
needed to secure more balanced and sustainable growth. The reform blueprint announced after last
autumn’s closely-watched Third Plenum is a comprehensive package that includes the type of
financial, fiscal, external, and social security reforms that were recommended in previous
consultations (Appendix I). As would be expected from such an over-arching document, in many
areas the blueprint is fairly general. However, this has not been followed up with details on the
specific reforms or timetables other than the broad goal to implement the agenda by 2020. Recent
measures that are in line with past advice include a widening of the exchange rate band, progress on
interest rate liberalization, strengthened financial sector regulation and supervision, and efforts to
rein in local government borrowing. Appendix II updates progress with regards to the key
recommendations from the 2011 FSAP.

financing (a broad measure of credit), slower
investment growth, and a correction in real estate activity. Despite this, consumption and the labor
market have held up well. The authorities have taken a number of measures in the past few months
to support activity, including targeted cuts in Required Reserve Ratios (RRRs), tax relief for SMEs,
moral suasion on home mortgages, and accelerated fiscal and infrastructure spending. Looking
ahead, the near-term growth outlook for China remains to an important extent a function of the
government’s targets. For 2015, the staff’s baseline scenario projects growth to moderate to around
7 percent, assuming continued efforts to rein in vulnerabilities and steady, if slow, implementation of
reforms. In particular, a further slowing of investment, especially in real estate, would be only partly
offset by stronger external demand from the continuing global recovery.
5.
Inflation has been stable. Nonfood price
inflation, a proxy for core, has remained around
 percent. Although headline CPI inflation has been
somewhat more bouncy, this reflects volatility in
food prices largely related to agricultural supply
shocks. Producer prices, however, have been
declining for over two years reflecting excess
capacity and weak external demand. Inflation is
projected to be around 2 percent this year,
assuming no significant shocks to food prices.

Although credit growth is still rapid, it
has decelerated considerably. Total social
financing (TSF)—a broad measure of credit covering
bank lending, funding from shadow banking, and
equity—rose from 130 percent of GDP in 2008 to
207 percent of GDP in early 2014. However, growth
in TSF decelerated from 22 percent in May 2013 to
16 percent in May 2014 (Figure 2). This coincided
with a series of steps to strengthen regulation and
supervision, especially of shadow banking, and a
rise in interbank interest rates in the second half of

last year. Additional steps were taken in April and May of this year, mainly targeted at reining in
interbank activity as a channel for funding shadow banking. While it is too early to gauge the full
impact of these measures, trust financing has slowed considerably and activity appears to be shifting
back to conventional bank loans as well as corporate bonds. Much of last year’s rise in interbank
interest rates was unwound earlier this year, though rates remain modestly higher than April 2013.

(Appendix III). The augmented deficit—which is the
broadest measure and indicates the impact of fiscal policy on aggregate demand—rose in 2013,
indicative of a supportive fiscal stance. Augmented net borrowing—which treats land sale proceeds
“above-the-line” and better measures debt creating flows—paints a similar picture and rose to
7.4 percent of GDP in 2013. This pushed augmented debt to 54 percent of GDP in 2013, up from
50 percent of GDP in 2012. A comprehensive audit conducted by the National Audit Office (NAO)
found that government debt was close to 40 percent of GDP in 2012, which is lower than augmented
debt mainly because the NAO excluded LGFV liabilities that under GFSM 2001 do not count as
government debt, such as debts that LGFVs would likely be able to service themselves. The
authorities, however, have not published a time series of government debt or data on deficits that
are consistent with the NAO definition of government. In the absence of such data, the augmented
debt (except for those years that NAO debt data are available) and balance data provide a useful
complement to general government data. The actual deficit, consistent with the NAO definition of
debt, is probably somewhere between the augmented and general government estimates, varying
year-to-year depending on how much of LGFV activity is commercial.

in the first quarter—on top of US$ 430 billion for
last year (Figure 4). In late February, the renminbi started to depreciate against the U.S. dollar in what
was widely considered to be a deliberate move by the PBC to make the carry-trade less attractive
and break perceptions that renminbi appreciation was a one way-bet. Subsequently, market
dynamics changed as non-FDI flows reversed direction and intervention appears to have fallen
sharply. Moreover, in contrast to the usual pattern over the last several years, the renminbi has been
closing mostly on the weaker side of the daily trading band.
10.
Authorities’ view. The authorities were confident that this year’s target of around
7½ percent growth would be achieved. They broadly agreed with staff’s inflation forecasts. The
authorities emphasized that the fiscal position remained strong, as reflected in the official figures
and confirmed by the NAO audit, and prompt actions have been taken to address potential risks.
Staff's estimates following the Fund's widely adopted methodology of the Government Finance
Statistics could provide complementary analysis of the fiscal developments in China. The use of
augmented fiscal estimates, the coverage of which differs from that of the general government
position as defined in the Government Finance Statistics, could easily cause confusion and
misreading. Thus the augmented fiscal data should not be used, especially as the staff estimates
were imprecise (due to key simplifying assumptions) and included items that should be excluded
from the fiscal accounts (such as commercial activity by LGFVs). In particular, considering land sales
as a financing item has led to significant exaggeration of fiscal deficit.
11.
On domestic rebalancing, the authorities pointed to strong growth of services relative
to manufacturing and rapid increases in urban and rural household incomes. The authorities
also pointed to the slowdown of investment growth and lower contribution of investment to GDP
over the last few years, compared to 2009/10 when the priority was to boost domestic demand in
response to the Global Financial Crisis. They were confident that the reforms in the Third-Plenum
blueprint would support the desired rebalancing to a more consumer-based economy. Regarding
intervention, they noted that the change in reserve assets (the staff intervention measure) also
includes the income on China’s international reserves.

RISKS AND BUFFERS
12.
Although efforts have begun to address them, vulnerabilities are still rising, reflecting years
of reliance on credit and investment to fuel growth. Real estate, in particular, is posing a growing
challenge as it has become a major engine of growth yet is also in need of adjustment. The authorities still
have sufficient buffers to prevent a sharp growth slowdown in the near term, essentially by using public
resources and state influence. However, repeated reliance on these buffers without addressing the
underlying sources of risk and changing the growth model would further exacerbate vulnerabilities and
reduce future growth prospects. In particular, continued efforts to sustain growth through additional credit
and investment would vitiate the recent steps taken to rein in vulnerabilities (particularly in the area of
shadow banking activities and local government finances). As a result, the risk of disorderly adjustment
would continue to rise, especially as the size and complexity of the financial system are rising fast.

A. Domestic Vulnerabilities
13.
A web of vulnerabilities exists across key sectors of the economy. To finance rapid investment,
firms and LGFVs have borrowed from both banks and shadow banks. This has resulted in rising corporate
and local government indebtedness, which is the flip side of the large increase in TSF since 2008. Many
strands of the web, moreover, run through the real estate sector. Banks and shadow banks are exposed to
real estate directly through credit to developers and household mortgages, and indirectly through the use
of real estate as collateral for other loans. Local government spending is also linked to the real estate
sector, directly through land sales revenue and indirectly through the tax revenue generated by real estate
related activity. Given these interconnections, a major shock to any part of the web would reverberate
throughout the whole, creating a negative feedback loop that could considerably amplify the original
shock. For example, a real estate shock would reduce growth directly (mainly through lower investment)
and indirectly through the knock-on effect to related sectors and the impact on local government finances.
The ensuing slowdown would hurt the ability of firms to repay loans, resulting in rising NPLs that would
constrain banks’ ability to lend and, in turn, lead to another round of less investment, lower growth, and
worsening asset quality.


Real estate (Box 1). Real estate has been a significant engine of the economy, but it has shown
growing signs of imbalances and activity has softened in 2014. The challenge is to allow for the
necessary correction while preventing an excessively sharp slowdown. The contribution of real estate
and construction to growth has been rising; last year, it accounted directly for 12.8 percent of value
added, and about 33 percent if upstream and downstream sectors are included. Residential real estate
is marked by substantial regional differentiation. Large cities have enjoyed favorable demand
conditions—reflecting both underlying and speculative demand—and prices show signs of
overvaluation relative to fundamentals, despite measures aimed at restricting speculative demand. In
contrast, many smaller cities have experienced oversupply as local governments promoted large-scale
development to boost growth and used land sales to finance local government spending. Supply
seems to have outpaced demand in many areas as evidenced by muted price increases and rising
inventories. The commercial real estate market appears to be in oversupply in both smaller and bigger
cities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



Corporate sector (Box 2). Consistent with strong growth in TSF and investment, corporate debt
has risen significantly, particularly in sectors which contributed most to post-crisis growth (mainly
real estate and related industries). Data on the entire universe of the corporate sector are not
available, but total debt of listed firms has increased by 10 percentage points of GDP since
2007 (to 35 percent of GDP), with about half of the increase coming from real estate and
construction sectors. Reflecting regional differences in the property market, the financial
situation of real estate companies varies, with big developers in large cities performing better
than smaller companies in lower-tier cities. In aggregate, listed real estate and construction firms
account for about 25 percent of total listed-firm liabilities, and most of this is held by a relatively
small number of highly-leveraged firms (about 80 percent of total liabilities in listed real estate
and construction firms are held by about 60 firms with liabilities more than three times of equity).
There has also been a substantial increase in leverage among SOEs (including those operating in
sectors with overcapacity), who enjoy privileged access to financing on the back of implicit state
guarantees.

peers, indicative of market concerns about bank balance sheets and the outlook for the sector.

Shadow banking (Box 4). The authorities have taken important steps to contain shadow
banking activity, but it remains a source of risk. Shadow banking emerged as an important
source of funding for sectors involved in the post-crisis stimulus (real estate, local government
infrastructure projects, and SOEs). It became the fastest-growing segment of the financial sector,
reflecting in large part regulatory arbitrage as on-balance sheet bank lending has been
constrained by financial safeguards (such as capital requirements and loan-to-deposit ratios) and
the ceiling on deposit interest rates. Given weaker regulations and the lack of transparency,
shadow banking could represent the weak tail of credit distribution. A significant portion of
credit appears to be going to SOEs and LGFVs, limiting perceived risks to the extent that such
assets are likely to benefit from government support. Moreover, shadow banking investment
products have been offered or distributed by banks, strengthening the perception of implicit
guarantees (in particular on deposit-like products for retail investors). Together with returns well
above the statutory ceiling on deposit rates, this has attracted significant funding to the sector,
often without due regard for the quality of underlying assets.

B. Domestic Risk Assessment
14.
Notwithstanding the rise in vulnerabilities, an abrupt adjustment in the near term is
unlikely, given China’s policy buffers. Cross-country evidence suggests that credit booms of a
similar size often led to sharp corrections (Box 5). However, in China the government still has the
capacity to absorb shocks and prevent the kind of loss of confidence or sudden stop that have
triggered major problems in other countries—such as a deposit run, freezing-up of the interbank
market, collapse of the real estate market, or capital flight. Total public debt is relatively low; public
sector assets are large (including foreign exchange reserves); domestic savings are high and foreign
debt exposures low; capital controls limit the risk of capital flight; and the government retains
substantial levers to control economic and financial activity. For these reasons, the probability of a
hard-landing in the near term is low. At the same time, repeated use of this policy space—in
particular, through credit-financed investment stimulus—risks compounding the underlying
vulnerabilities.
15.
Thus, without a change in the pattern of growth, the likelihood of a shock triggering
financial disruption and/or a sharp slowdown will continue to rise. Overreliance on credit and
capital accumulation to support growth would further weaken balance sheets and reduce investment
efficiency. This would ultimately lead to a slowdown in growth, and put further pressure on corporate
profits and the financial system. The more vulnerabilities accumulate, the more likely it is that a shock
could trigger a negative feedback loop. Thus, although the near-term risk of a hard landing is low, it
increases to medium over a medium-term perspective.
16.
Authorities’ views. There was consensus that the current pattern of growth was
unsustainable, and that structural reforms were critical to unleash new engines of growth. The
authorities recognized the importance of containing risks and were confident that vulnerabilities
were well under control with the countervailing measures put in place, but would remain vigilant. On
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

the financial side, they considered the rapid growth in trust, WMP, and corporate bond activity as
important shifts toward more market-based intermediation. They acknowledged that this process
involved risks, but viewed these as manageable, especially after recent steps to improve supervisory
oversight. While reported NPLs had been rising in some industries, they remained low and Chinese
banks had some of the highest capital and provisioning ratios in the world. The authorities continued
to monitor closely the real estate market, and would fine-tune policies as necessary to ensure the
stable development of the market, including for low-income housing. At the same time, they
acknowledged that rapid growth had helped mask some of the problems in the past, but with
growth slowing, they were being especially vigilant, particularly with respect to risks in the fiscal and
financial sectors. Local government debt had become a pressing issue in some jurisdictions, but was
being addressed by further strengthening of local debt management, including the creation of a
monitoring system to contain risks. Overall, the authorities emphasized that banks and other
financial institutions appeared comfortable with their exposures and the underlying health of
projects they had financed.

C. External Risks
17.
External shocks would impact China mainly through the trade channel. Spillovers from
potential financial market volatility in the course of exit from UMP in advanced economies (AEs), or
from a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies, would have the
strongest repercussions for China’s economy. In both cases the main impact would be through lower
export demand, with some knock-on effects for corporate profits, employment, and domestic
demand. If this or other external shocks were to slow near-term growth too sharply, on-budget fiscal
stimulus should be used in a manner that supports rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.
The Risk Assessment Matrix (Appendix IV) summarizes the main external and domestic risks.
18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities remained concerned about the impact of continued slow
growth in major AEs, which was having adverse spillovers for growth in China and the rest of the
world. They also regard a slowdown in emerging markets as an important risk, given the contribution
to China’s export growth from this source. They considered turbulence related to monetary policy
normalization in advanced economies as less of a direct risk for China. However, it could indirectly
impact China through the effect on other economies, especially emerging markets.

SUSTAINING GROWTH AND MANAGING RISKS
A. Transition to a New Growth Model
19.
Implementation of the reform blueprint will move the economy to a more inclusive,
environment-friendly, and sustainable growth path. The aim is to use resources more efficiently and
unleash new sources of productivity growth, in a way that better protects the environment and ensures
that growing prosperity is widely shared. Key principles include giving the market a more decisive role,
eliminating distortions, and strengthening governance and institutions. While the blueprint is
comprehensive, it has not been followed up with details on the timing and specifics of the reforms. The
discussions focused on the issues that staff considered to be the priorities. Staff urged the authorities to
implement the priority reforms quickly and as a package, noting interdependencies, in particular, among
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

the financial sector, SOE, exchange rate, and local government reforms.

Financial sector, SOE, and monetary policies
20.
Financial sector reforms will help safeguard financial stability and improve the
allocation of credit. Widespread implicit guarantees—of savers, intermediaries, and borrowers—
and the cap on deposit rates distort the pricing of risk and borrowing costs, contributing to the
misallocation of credit and inefficient investment. Introducing deposit insurance is important to
define the perimeter of state guarantees for investors (and thus clarifying what lies outside this
perimeter). Removing implicit guarantees also requires greater tolerance of corporate defaults and
bankruptcies, including of SOEs. With lending rates now liberalized and more savings vehicles in the
market, conditions are ripe for the next step in deposit rate liberalization. Options include increasing
upward flexibility or allowing higher rates for some types of deposits.
21.
SOE reforms are important in their own right, and a key complement to financial sector
reforms. The aim is to ‘level the playing field’ and generally allow markets rather than the state to
allocate resources. Needed reforms include opening up to full and fair competition activities
currently reserved to SOEs, properly pricing finance and other factor inputs, requiring adequate
dividend payments to the budget, and imposing hard budget constraints. The latter means that
those SOEs that cannot compete successfully on a level playing field should exit. This is critical for
the government’s strategy for SOE reforms—as long as SOEs are perceived to benefit from an
implicit backing of the state, they will have preferential access to financing that will continue to tilt
the playing field, distort competition, and misallocate resources. Opening up the service sector—in
areas such as education, health, finance, telecom, and logistics—to more competition will also be key
for generating the productivity gains needed to fuel growth and for boosting household income, as
services tend to be more labor intensive than industry.
22.
As part of the move to a more market-based economy, the transition to a new
monetary policy framework should continue. Regardless of the ultimate framework that China
adopts, it is becoming increasingly important to use interest rates as the primary instrument of
monetary policy given the growth of shadow banking and planned deposit rate liberalization. This
will require establishing a policy interest rate, such as the overnight or seven-day interbank repo rate.
As an interim step, the volatility of these short-dated interbank rates should be reduced by
introducing reserve averaging, improving communication with the market, and creating an interest
rate corridor. Improving the functioning of standing liquidity facilities, to ensure that all qualified
banks can directly and automatically access them at a predetermined price, will provide a ceiling for
the corridor and also help strengthen liquidity management.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that financial sector reforms were critical, and
highlighted the progress already made in this area. They planned to introduce deposit insurance in
the near future and advance deposit rate liberalization as circumstances allowed. They also agreed
that removing implicit guarantees, pervasive throughout the financial and corporate landscape, was
key. This saw moral hazard as distorting the allocation of credit and investment, posing a risk to the
success of financial liberalization which rested critically on hard budget constraints. Linked to this,
the authorities explained that their strategy for SOE reforms included leveling the playing field and
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

opening up to more competition, with the exception of some strategic sectors. Regarding the
monetary policy framework, they agreed on the importance of relying more on interest rates over
time. They welcomed the joint IMF-PBC conference that was held on this topic in March (see:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2014/pbc/).

Fiscal and other reforms
24.
Improving fiscal management, especially of local government finances, will help
contain risks and better allocate resources. The blueprint highlights improving local government
finances as a priority. This includes better aligning local revenue with expenditure responsibilities as
well as strengthening oversight and management of local government borrowing. The plan to put in
place a new framework to limit local borrowing, improve reporting, and establish an early warning
system should be implemented as soon as possible. In this context, the authorities envisage
selectively ‘opening the front door’ while ‘closing the back door’ to municipal borrowing, with a
recent pilot allowing some local governments to borrow directly from the market, under
strengthened rules for creditworthiness, accounting, and transparency. Improving the fiscal
framework is a priority for the medium term, especially strengthening budget processes and
adopting a medium-term fiscal plan.

speculative real estate activity, efficiently raise
revenue, and improve progressivity. China’s revenue from real estate taxation is within the range of
other countries; however, it comes almost entirely from transaction-related taxes and fees. Thus,
there may be scope to offset some of the impact of introducing a property tax by reducing these
transaction taxes and fees. The combined income tax and social contribution system is fairly
regressive. Currently, social contributions raise nearly five times more revenue than the personal
income tax, suggesting scope to rebalance toward PIT and make the combined system more
progressive.
26.
Social security reform has the potential to boost consumption and address inequality.
On the expenditure side, further strengthening the pension and health insurance systems—including
by improving and expanding coverage—would have macrobenefits such as reducing precautionary
household savings. Social contribution rates, which are high and very regressive, should also be
reduced as they distort the labor market, make growth less inclusive, and favor informal over formal
employment. These reforms should be done in a way that ensures the sustainability of the social
security system, including through parametric changes to the pension system and transferring the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

welfare and legacy components to the budget. The resulting costs to the consolidated general
government will need to be offset by revenue gains from the improvements in the tax system
(described above) and cuts in lower-priority spending. Staff analysis shows that such reforms are
consistent with securing sustainable public finances (Box 6). Together with household registration (hukou)
and rural land reforms, strengthening the social security system will make a significant contribution to
elevating living standards, improving the labor market, and boosting labor income.
27.
Rationalizing the use of natural resources will promote more environment-friendly
growth. Options include adjusting prices, including through better calibration of excise and other taxes
(such as a carbon tax on coal, fuel, and gas) to capture the cost of externalities, strengthening emission
taxes, and strict enforcement of environmental regulations and incentives to use greener technologies.
China already has a broad set of environmental laws and regulations, whose strict enforcement would be
major progress in protecting the environment (Box 7).
28.
Gradual further opening up the capital account is part of the reform agenda. Capital
account liberalization is listed as one of the key reforms in the Third-Plenum blueprint and RMB
internationalization is advancing (Box 8). The approach could include further expanding the list of
domestic and international investors qualified to engage in capital account transactions under existing
quotas, and gradually increasing these quotas. More immediately, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone
established in 2013 liberalized certain restrictions for residents and financial institutions in the Zone:
allowing them to set up accounts with higher capital account convertibility, easing controls on outward
investments including in securities and derivatives and restricting inward FDI only by an announced
‘negative list.’ The pilot is designed to ‘test-drive’ liberalization and administrative simplification in a more
narrow setting, and to apply the lessons learned as liberalization is broadened progressively. Staff
welcomed the goal of capital account liberalization as a key objective of the Third-Plenum blueprint,
noting that it had to be carefully sequenced with other reforms, in particular, in the financial, SOE and
fiscal sectors and exchange rate flexibility.
29.
Further improvements in data will help economic analysis and policymaking. Staff
encouraged the authorities to graduate from the General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and participate in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey (CPIS). In the macroeconomic area, priorities include improving fiscal data, both timeliness and
coverage; quarterly and annual national accounts especially expenditure data and labor market statistics.
Data issues are discussed in more depth in the Informational Annex.
30.
Authorities’ views. Fiscal reforms are central to the authorities’ reform plans. The welcomed the
ongoing technical cooperation with FAD on improving the fiscal framework. They agreed that improving
management of local government finances was a priority and were confident that their announced
strategy would achieve this. Regarding the property tax, the authorities were studying the experience in
the pilot areas, which helped in preparing legislation. They agreed that there was room to better
calibrate the PIT and SSC to address inequality, but noted the current PIT schedule was already
progressive. They added that SSC would be reduced at an appropriate time and pace, while stressing that
any reforms to benefits and contributions had to take into account the importance of securing the longterm sustainability of the system. They agreed that an environment tax would help address externalities
from pollution. They considered that appropriate targets and measures were in place to reduce air, water,
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

and soil pollution, following the State Council’s approval of the amendments to the Environment
Protection Law in April. Regarding data, the authorities were actively considering subscription to SDDS
and have been working with STA to conduct technical preparations.

External assessment, exchange rate policy, and rebalancing
31.
The external position is moderately stronger compared with the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Box 9). On that basis, the renminbi is
assessed as being moderately undervalued. In terms of the External Balance Assessment (EBA)
model, China’s policy gaps (policies different from desired ones, contributing to a moderately
stronger external position) stem mainly from intervention, capital controls, and health spending. The
pace of reserve accumulation slowed significantly in 2012, but picked up again in 2013 against the
backdrop of large capital inflows induced by interest rate differentials, the relatively high real return
of capital, and expectations of continued RMB appreciation. Reserves are above the range suggested
by the Fund’s metric, rendering further accumulation unnecessary from a reserve adequacy
perspective.
32.
A flexible, market-determined exchange rate is an important part of the reform
agenda. A market-determined exchange rate—in which there is no sustained, large, and asymmetric
intervention—is key for sustained rebalancing and as a shock absorber as the capital account is
progressively liberalized. Moreover, given the rapid growth in offshore renminbi markets and
growing opportunities for financial arbitrage, it is also becoming increasingly important for
maintaining an independent monetary policy. The recent doubling of the daily trading band is a
welcome step forward. Looking ahead, the goal should be to allow greater flexibility and reduce
intervention, which could be achieved by further widening the band and ensuring the central parity
better reflects market conditions.
33.
Sustained rebalancing will depend on successful implementation of the reform agenda.
Implementation of the blueprint would help close the policy gaps identified in the EBA model by
moving to a more flexible, market-determined exchange rate (reducing intervention); opening the
capital account; and strengthening the social security system. Therefore, as reforms are implemented,
the external position should reach equilibrium. As regards domestic rebalancing, the package of
reforms will increase the share of consumption in GDP, with a corresponding decline in investment.
Consumption will rise, for example, as social security reforms decrease household saving; the
opening-up of the service sector spawns more labor intensive growth that boosts household
incomes; and fiscal reforms and currency appreciation support higher household spending.
34.
Authorities’ views. The authorities disagreed with the assessment that the real exchange
rate was moderately undervalued and considered that it was close to equilibrium. They reiterated
their previous concerns and strong reservations on EBA, and emphasized the importance of
evenhandedness. In particular, they considered that the assessment failed to account for the impact
of advanced economy monetary policies on global financial flows and emerging market economies,
the continued narrowing of China’s current account surplus, two-way fluctuations of the exchange
rate, substantial appreciation of REER, and the movements of other currencies (such as the U.S.
dollar). On the current account, they expected a flat or declining surplus over time as they considered
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

that the services deficit would likely continue to rise while the goods surplus would not increase
significantly. On the exchange rate, they remained committed to moving toward greater flexibility
and avoiding regular intervention. They reiterated that unconventional monetary policy in advanced
economies was slowing progress in this regard. They agreed that external and domestic rebalancing
would derive from successful implementation of the gamut of economic reforms in the Third-Plenum
blueprint, and added that ongoing urbanization (with a target urbanization rate of 60 percent by
2020) would contribute to elevating living standards, improving the labor market, and boosting labor
income.

B. Addressing Vulnerabilities and Managing Demand
35.
The challenge for demand management is to allow the necessary adjustments in the
economy to proceed, while at the same time preventing too sharp a slowdown in growth.
Structural reforms will boost growth and help address vulnerabilities, but additional measures are
also required. In particular, a reduction in off-budget spending, further reining in credit growth, and
slower investment growth are required to contain risks. The drag on activity from these policies is
bound to be felt right away, while the growth payoff from structural reforms will be down the road.
Finding the right mix of reducing vulnerabilities and maintaining growth will be an ongoing
challenge. For this year, the staff argued that the authorities’ should accept somewhat slower growth
and deploy a stimulus only if growth were set to slow significantly below their target. At this point,
such a stimulus does not appear to be warranted.
36.
Quantifying the right speed for the

suggested a target range of 6½–7 percent as
consistent with the goal of transitioning to a safer and more sustainable growth path. In setting the
range, consideration should be given to the following:
Source: IMF staff estimates and calculations.



Reforms are needed to sustain even the lower potential growth rate. China’s potential
growth has been falling in line with the pattern observed in other fast-growing Asian economies.
Achieving this growth path over the medium term, however, will depend on the success in
implementing structural reforms to unleash new sources of productivity growth.



Containing vulnerabilities likely implies somewhat lower near-term growth. Reducing
unsustainable investment demand will affect key sectors, such as real estate (where adjustment
has already started) and others with overcapacity. This will have a direct effect on economic
activity, but also indirect effects as lower aggregate demand spills over to rest of the economy.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



Policies will need to allow for correction in inefficient and overcapacity sectors. Macro
support—if needed to prevent a sharp drop in demand and buy time for labor and capital to
move to more efficient sectors—should be consistent with the reform agenda.

37.
Fiscal adjustment should ensure that government debt is on a sustainable path. This
could largely be achieved by reining in local-government off-budget borrowing, which is a near-term
priority and is consistent with other planned fiscal reforms (see Box 6). Consolidation in the
augmented balance of about 1 percent of GDP a year on average over the next five years would put
augmented debt on a declining path. The exact pace of adjustment each year should be calibrated to
avoid an excessive slowdown—taking into account the growth impact of structural reforms and
efforts to reduce vulnerabilities. If needed, fiscal support should preferably be deployed on-budget
with measures aimed at protecting the vulnerable and advancing reform. Options include reducing
social contributions, strengthening the social safety net, central government support for hukou
reform, and priority infrastructure projects.
38.
Ensuring financial stability will require continued reduction in overall credit growth
and improving its allocation. TSF growth has slowed considerably since early-2013. The recent
steps to strengthen supervision and regulation should help rein in shadow banking and shift activity
to better-regulated formal banks (especially by prohibiting reliance of shadow banking on interbank
market transactions). The measures are in the right direction, though continued vigilance is needed
to ensure their effectiveness and to guard against the market finding new ways to circumvent the
regulations. Further strengthening regulation and supervision remains a priority, particularly by
ensuring a swift implementation of the already adopted measures. Ongoing financial sector reforms,
such as liberalizing deposit rates and removing implicit guarantees, will also reduce credit growth
and improve its allocation. In particular, average lending rate will likely increase and borrowing costs
will rise for many SOEs benefitting from implicit guarantees, shifting lending to dynamic private firms
that are currently rationed out of the formal credit market (yet able to afford higher interest rates
given the value of their underlying projects).

interest rates. Higher interbank rates in the second
half of last year likely contributed to the slowing of TSF growth, although the extent is hard to assess
in light of ongoing structural reforms and uncertainties about the evolving transmission mechanism.
If TSF growth does not continue to slow, liquidity conditions should be tightened by gradually
pushing interbank interest rates back up. However, this alone will not be sufficient to manage credit
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

growth in the present environment, especially as many SOE borrowers may not be interest rate-sensitive.
Therefore, macroprudential tools should also continue to be deployed.
40.
In the real estate sector, the challenge is to prevent a further build-up of risks, while
avoiding a disorderly correction in the market. An adjustment in the market is needed and in line with
the recommended slowing of credit growth. At the same time, preventing a sharp correction is important.
Policies will have to vary by locality, but could include selective unwinding of demand control measures
and building social housing. Care must be taken, however, to find the right mix of allowing adjustment to
take place and supporting the market if necessary. Over time, the underlying pressure on real estate to
expand should abate as (i) financial market reforms and capital account liberalization provide more
investment alternatives; and (ii) reform of local government finances reduces incentives for real estate
development as a source of revenues.
41.
Authorities’ views. While the authorities agreed that a major stimulus was not needed at this
juncture, they emphasized that they were committed to achieving this year’s growth target. On fiscal
adjustment, they stressed the importance of controlling risks from local government borrowing and
highlighted that this was flagged as a priority for 2014 in last December’s Annual Economic Work
Conference. The authorities emphasized progress in improving financial sector regulation and
supervision, especially the recent steps to improve the functioning of the interbank market which should
help contain risks from off-balance sheet and nonbank intermediation. On real estate, they viewed the
long-run dynamics of the market to be healthy, and considered a near-term correction manageable.

SCENARIOS AND SPILLOVERS
42.
Fast implementation of reforms would have substantial benefits in terms of boosting living
standards and reducing risks. Staff prepared three scenarios (Box 11) to illustrate the costs and benefits
of pursuing reforms at various speed and intensity.


Fast reform. In a scenario with fast implementation of reforms growth would be somewhat slower in
the near term. However, compared to alternative scenarios with slower or no reforms, income and
consumption per capita would be higher by 2019. Debt is falling and credit growth is likely to be
slower, leading to a faster reduction of vulnerabilities and eliminating the risk of a sharper slowdown.



Baseline (medium scenario). The staff baseline, which is an intermediate scenario, assumes that the
Third-Plenum reforms are implemented, but largely in the latter part of this decade. As a result, the
economy would remain on a more risky trajectory in the near term. Growth remains dependent on
investment, and fiscal adjustment is more gradual and back-loaded, with debt stabilizing around
current levels.



No reform. This scenario combines little or no implementation of reforms with continued reliance on
investment to support growth. The unsustainable gains in growth in the short-term come at a steep
cost of foregone growth over the medium term. Activity would have to rely increasingly on public
and quasi-public investment; the augmented fiscal balance would increase further, putting the
augmented debt ratio on an increasing trajectory; and rapid credit growth would continue, further
increasing leverage. Ultimately growth would drop, initially because of the declining efficiency of

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

investment and lower TFP growth compared to the reform scenario. Over time, the probability of
vulnerabilities coming to the surface—leading to a sharp slowdown in growth—would increase, as
reflected in the widening projection range.
43.
The fast-reform scenario balances the goal of securing long-term growth, supporting
activity in the near term, and reducing vulnerabilities. The growth payoff from reforms is projected to
be relatively fast, while the impact of the initial slowdown on the labor market is cushioned by reforms
supporting labor-intensive activities in the services sector (the flexibility of China’s labor market will
facilitate the reallocation process). Regarding debt dynamics, staff analysis shows that the risk of
unsustainable dynamics is high in the ‘no-reform’ scenario and, even with China’s substantial cushion,
debt is not robust to shocks in the intermediate (baseline) scenario, pointing to persistent vulnerabilities
(see Appendix V).

Authorities’ Views. The authorities agreed that deepening reforms will be critical for
transitioning the economy to a more sustainable growth level. While implementation could be
challenging, they remained committed to the reform blueprint, noting that China had a strong track
record with reforms over the last three decades. They added that implementation would not necessarily
slow growth, since reforms would unleash productivity gains that would boost growth.

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Last year’s Third-Plenum reform blueprint marked the start of a new chapter in China’s
development. Successful implementation of reforms will ensure that China can achieve the fastest

sustainable growth going forward and continue to converge toward high-income status. The policy
support deployed since 2008/09 in response to the GFC boosted domestic demand, which successfully
sustained growth, provided a welcome lift to the global economy, and helped reduce external imbalances.
However, five years of strong growth in capital spending and credit has resulted in declining investment
efficiency and a significant buildup of debt. As recognized in the authorities’ blueprint, the challenge now
is to shift gears, reduce the vulnerabilities accumulated since the GFC and transition to a sustainable
growth model, while at the same time avoiding too steep of a slowdown in activity.
47.
Growth in 2014 is expected to be in line with the authorities’ target. Domestic demand
growth has been moderating, reflecting slower investment growth and a correction in real estate activity,
partly in response to measures taken by the authorities to rein in credit growth and address financial
market vulnerabilities. As activity slowed, the authorities have taken several measures to support growth,
targeted at priority areas. As a result, staff projects annual growth this year around the authorities’ target of
around 7½ percent. Consumption and the labor market are holding up well, and the global recovery is
expected to support external demand going forward. Inflation is expected to remain well below the
authorities’ target of 3 percent.
48.
Vulnerabilities, however, continue rising. The post-GFC period has been marked by a large
expansion in credit and investment. However, investment efficiency has been declining, casting doubt
about the quality of assets underlying the build-up of debt. In particular, there are signs that important
parts of the real estate market, a key driver of growth, are over supplied even though prices have yet to
adjust significantly. Moreover, the vulnerabilities in the financial, fiscal, corporate, and real estate sectors
are interconnected, so a shock in any one sector could be amplified through a negative feedback loop.
However, if a shock were to occur that threatens to trigger a disorderly adjustment, the authorities have
policy buffers to prevent a sharp slowdown in growth. Therefore, the probability of a hard landing in the
near term is low. However, repeated reliance on these buffers without addressing the underlying
vulnerabilities and changing the growth model compounds the risk of an eventual sharp slowdown and
financial disruption, especially as the size and complexity of the financial system are rising fast.
49.
Implementation of the authorities’ reform blueprint will secure higher-quality, sustainable
growth. Giving the market a more decisive role, eliminating distortions, and strengthening institutions will
result in a more efficient use of resources, faster productivity growth, and rising living standards across the
income spectrum. Priorities include:


Financial sector reforms to support the real economy by better allocating savings and investment. This
includes strengthened regulation and supervision, deposit rate liberalization, increasing reliance on
interest rates as an instrument of monetary policy, and elimination of the widespread implicit
guarantees across the financial and corporate landscape.



Fiscal and social security reforms to strengthen public finances, boost consumption, and foster more
inclusive and green growth. This includes reordering local government finances by better aligning local
revenue with expenditure responsibilities, with strengthened oversight and management of local
government borrowing; reducing social security contributions, which are high and regressive; and
improving pension and health benefits. To ensure sustainability of public finances, this should be

combined with parametric reforms to the social security system, shifting the welfare and legacy parts
of the pensions to the budget, improvements in the tax system, and cuts in lower-priority spending.


Further progress toward a more flexible, market determined exchange rate with no sustained, large, and
asymmetric intervention. This will support domestic and external rebalancing, and is becoming
increasingly important for China to have an independent monetary policy.



SOE reforms to level the playing field between private and public sectors, by opening up more sectors,
especially services, to competition; rationalize resource and financing costs; increase dividend
payments to the budget; and harden budget constraints.

50.
Reforms will support sustained external and domestic rebalancing. While external
imbalances have been reduced considerably since the global financial crisis, the external position is still
moderately stronger compared with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. On the domestic side, continued rapid investment growth underscores the priority of
rebalancing toward more consumption. Successful implementation of the reform blueprint—including a
more flexible exchange rate regime—will support the desired shift away from investment toward
consumption, and further reduction in the current account surplus as aggregate savings fall by more than
investment.
51.
Demand management needs to focus on reducing vulnerabilities while preventing growth
from slowing too much. In particular, a reduction in off-budget spending, further slowdown of credit
growth, and less investment growth are required to contain risks. The drag on activity from these policies is
likely to be felt immediately, while the full growth payoff from structural reforms will take more time.
Finding the right mix of reducing vulnerabilities and maintaining adequate growth will be an ongoing
challenge. Vulnerabilities, however, have risen to the point that containing them is a priority and, therefore,
stimulus should only be deployed if growth risks slowing significantly below this year’s target. Although
stimulus does not appear warranted at present, if it were to become necessary, then fiscal policy should be
the first line of defense, preferably deployed on-budget with measures aimed at protecting the vulnerable
and advancing reform.
52.
Staff commends the authorities for initiating bold economic reforms to secure a more
sustainable, inclusive, and environmentally-friendly growth in China. The challenge is to implement
the reforms, carefully yet with determination, and not to return to over-reliance on policy buffers as soon
as the unavoidable cost of reforms begins to show. Macropolicies will need to be calibrated to avoid too
sharp a slowdown, but not at the cost of adding to vulnerabilities and the risk of falling into a low-growth
pattern. Growth expectations should be guided by the principle of achieving the highest sustainable
growth: this means a focus on the needed reform policies, and accepting growth outcomes within a range
that is likely to be somewhat below the current pace. The benefits will include much higher income in the
future as the reforms unleash new sources of sustainable growth. A result that would be good for China
and good for the global economy.
53.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard 12-month

cycle.

Box 1. Real Estate: Impact of a Market Correction
The real estate market appears to be undergoing a correction. While a slowing of investment and construction would
have a significant impact on growth, an orderly adjustment is factored into the staff’s baseline scenario.

activity in China. Ahuja and Myrvoda (2012) estimate that a
reduction in real estate investment by 10 percent could reduce GDP growth by about 1 percentage point.

2012

Recent data suggest that several regions are in oversupply. Residential real estate inventories have increased
sharply in Tier III and IV cities, as well as in the industrial Northeast (including Shenyang and Changchun) and parts
of the Coast (including Hangzhou, Dalian, Fuzhou and Wenzhou). Commercial real estate, meanwhile, appears to be
in oversupply across most regions. In terms of residential price dynamics, Tier II and Tier III/IV cities have performed
the weakest, with prices in the latter group falling on month-on-month basis recently. The hardest-hit geographical
areas include the industrial Northeast and the Coast. However, developers seem reluctant to cut prices because it
may lead new buyers to stay on the sidelines and cause problems with those that bought earlier at higher prices.
Distortions weigh heavily on the property market. On the supply-side, the market is distorted by local
governments’ reliance on land sales to finance spending. This helps explain the over-supply in many Tier III/IV cities.
On the demand side, the market is prone to speculation since housing is an attractive investment given low deposit
rates, a lack of alternative financial assets, capital account restrictions, and a history of robust capital gains. This helps
explains why, especially in top-tier cities, prices appear to be overvalued and price-to-income ratios remain high—
even though, thanks to rapid income growth, affordability indicators have generally been improving.
Real estate appears to have entered a downturn. As of May, average residential price growth started to turn
slightly negative, and there were declines in transactions (10 percent) and new starts (12 percent). Real growth in
investment has fallen from almost 20 percent in 2012 and 2013 to around 10 percent by May. While the previous
downturns, such as 2008 and 2012, were driven by policies to cool the market, the current one has come without a
direct tightening of real estate policies and appears driven by overcapacity and concerns about future capital gains.
An orderly correction in real estate should be manageable. The staff baseline assumes that real estate
investment slows to around 5 percent in 2014, stalls in 2015, and gradually recovers thereafter. It takes into
consideration low leverage of homeowners, underlying housing demand fundamentals, and government ability to
support developers if needed and take other measures (such as removing purchase and lending restrictions, and
accelerate infrastructure and social housing construction). On the other hand, risk of large drop in final (investor)
demand has increased even if underlying, medium-term home ownership demand is sound. If the market were to
undergo a sharper correction—with new starts declining by, say, 30 percent for the year (compared to 20 percent
year-to-date), which implies a -3½ percent year-on-year growth in residential investment—then GDP growth would
likely be around ¾ percentage point lower than in the baseline (in the absence of offsetting measures).

Box 2. Corporate Leverage in China
Staff analyzes listed-firm level data, which appear broadly to mirror China’s overall corporate sector. While the level
of corporate debt has increased, most firms have healthy leverage and interest rate coverage ratios. The build-up of
debt is concentrated in a “fat tail” of highly leveraged large firms mostly in real estate and construction. Overall risk
remains manageable given its concentration, which highlights the importance of the real estate sector.
Debt accumulation. Overall corporate debt has increased from 92 percent of GDP (average 2003–07) to about
110 percent of GDP in 2013. The level is among the highest in the region. Among listed companies (which hold
about 30 percent of GDP in debt), a significant part of the increase in corporate debt after the global financial
crisis concentrated in a few large firms in real estate and construction.
Leverage ratio. While private companies, with the exception of real estate and construction companies, have
been deleveraging since 2007, SOEs’ leverage ratios has edged up. Real estate and construction companies,
especially the SOEs, however, have increased their leverage

Profitability. Private firms’ profitability in listed firms
peaked in 2007 and has fallen since, in line with the slowing
economy. Profitability of SOEs, however, has remained
stagnant over the last decade. The profitability of
low-leveraged firms exceeded that of high-leveraged firms
by a margin of 2‒2½ percentage points, but the margin
narrowed significantly in the past year.

Fat tail of highly leveraged companies. The buildup of
leverage is concentrated in a ‘fat tail’ of firms. The top
50 firms of some 2000 firms accounted for nearly half of the
total liabilities of listed firms, a rise of over 20 percentage
points of total corporate liabilities over the last decade.
Most of the increase was in the real estate and construction
sector where about 80 percent of total liabilities of the
sector belong to about 60 firms with leverage ratios higher
than 300 percent. Highly leveraged local SOEs in mining and
utilities also increased their borrowing significantly.

Sources: WIND; and IMF staff estimates.

Sensitivity to shocks. Private firms’ interest coverage ratios are less sensitive than SOEs’ to a change in interest
rates. Real estate and construction firms, however, are more sensitive to a rise in interest rate given the high level
of debt. Firms with strong links to the real estate sector are most sensitive to a real estate sector downturn,
including those oversupply sectors such as construction materials.
Overall assessment. While total debt level has increased, the corporate sector on average has deleveraged over
the years, and risk appears manageable given its concentration. The level and concentration of risk highlights the
importance of the real estate sector, and the need for focused efforts to deal with excess leverage areas and
companies, including well-managed exits where appropriate.

Box 3. Local Government Finances
Local governments were at the front lines of the post-GFC stimulus, supporting activity through a
considerable rise in investment. Such investment, which has generally been financed off-budget through
LGFVs, has remained large and, unless rationalized going forward, would put increasing strains on local
government finances and pose risks to financial stability and growth.
During the post-GFC period, local government investement provided significant support the
economy. Data for 2009 to 2013 suggest that growth in provincial LGFV liabilities was significantly
1
correlated with provincial investment growth, especially in the central and western regions. This
underscores the role of LGFVs in supporting activity on the one hand, but also in exacerbating the reliance
on credit and investment as an engine of growth. Such investment spending was usually financed
off-budget, either through LGFVs (in order to circumvent borrowing restrictions) or land sales.
Local governments have continued to borrow at an unsustainable pace. Augmented net borrowing,
which includes off-budget borrowing by LGFVs (but treats land sales “above-the-line”), has remained high
and rose to 7½ percent of GDP in 2013. Based on provincial audit results, in 2013 outstanding provincial
debt was equivalent on average to nearly 70 percent of consolidated fiscal revenue or around 23 percent
of provincial GDP. Adding government guaranteed and contingent liabilities would push the average to
about 33 percent of provincial GDP, and over 60 percent of GDP in some provinces—a high level given
the small revenue base. The debt burden is often higher for those provinces that rely more on off-budget
LGFV activity to support growth, heightening risks to debt dynamics.
Local government finances are exposed to a correction in the real estate market. Many local
governments rely on net revenue from land sales to finance large public infrastructure investment.
Though provincial-level land sales are not available, aggregate gross land sale revenue was sizeable at
about 7 percent of GDP in 2013 (net land sale revenue was 2½–3 percent of GDP after accounting for
expenses related to city construction, land development, and compensation for relocation). Land sales
could slow considerably if real estate development cools. In addition, tax revenues could also shrink in
face of a real estate slowdown. Excluding land sales, tax revenue from real estate and related sectors was
about one-fifth of tax revenue in some provinces.
At the moment, risks appear manageable, although the system of local borrowing is
nontransparent, making the assessment difficult. The snapshot of local government debt and
contingent liabilities in last year’s NAO report suggests that China’s public sector still retains significant
fiscal space. However, despite good social and commercial returns on some of the investments, many
provinces and localities rely excessively on LGFVs to support growth. The overall trend in local
government finances is unsustainable and needs to change, also because linkages to financial system and
real estate sector are increasingly complex and potentially difficult to manage. Regular data updates and
more information about forward spending commitments (for example, through PPP type arrangements)
are needed to assess evolving risks.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1

The weaker relationship between growth in fixed asset investment and LGFV activity in coastal regions possibly
reflects the fact that a larger share of coastal LGFVs operate on a commercial basis, engaging in noninvestment
activities.

Box 4. Rapid Growth in Shadow Banking and Internet Finance
“Shadow banking” has increased rapidly, contributing to the strong growth in credit (TSF) and posing new types of risks to the
financial system. On the positive side, it marks a move toward more market-based instruments and represents, de facto, a
liberalization of pricing and allocation of credit in the economy. However, it also reflects regulatory arbitrage, allowing
intermediation to side-step prudential safeguards.
Shadow banking. Market analysts often define shadow banking in China as TSF less bank loans (and a small amount of
equity-like items). It is comprised of trust loans, bankers acceptances, entrusted loans (corporate-to-corporate lending
administered by a bank), and interbank corporate bonds (see Figure 2). As such, it includes direct credit extension by banks
off-balance sheet and by nonbank financial institutions, especially trust companies and securities firms. After bank lending
conditions were tightened following the 2009–10 credit boom, the shadow banking system took off. By March 2014, the
stock of shadow banking had risen to nearly 53 percent of GDP, with annual growth rates averaging around 30 percent
during 2012-13. China’s shadow banking activities typically involve direct lending to the real sector and are often closely
tied to commercial banks. For example, trusts rely on banks for funding, banks are also allowed to hold controlling shares in
trust companies, and entrusted loans also are administered by banks.
Internet financing. Since mid-2013, internet-based money market funds have experienced exponential growth, albeit from
a low base (as of Q1:2014, they were the equivalent of about 0.5 percent of total bank deposits). The growth reflects low
transaction costs, access to a large network of potential customers, and the ability of small investors to acquire new financial
products. However, it also benefitted from interest rate and regulatory arbitrage. Currently, close to 100 percent of the funds
are reinvested in the banking sector either in the form of nonstandardized certificates of deposit (so-called agreement
deposits) or via the interbank market (bonds and repos), limiting systemic risk, but as competition in the sector increases,
money market funds are likely to invest in riskier assets, including in commercial paper.
Risks. Wealth management products (WMPs)—deposit-like instruments used to fund parts of shadow banking—have
grown rapidly and risen to over 10 percent of GDP. Notwithstanding safeguards such as minimum investment thresholds
and risk disclosures, investors may believe that WMPs are implicitly guaranteed. As such, even though in principle the risk is
transfered to the investor, in practice many investors are unlikely to undertake adequate due diligence on the underlying
assets in the WMP. Moreover, losses on fixed-income WMPs are almost unheard of, exacerbating this risk. Shadow banking
assets, including those funded by WMPs, may be of lower quality (such as claims on highly leveraged LGFVs or real estate
firms). Shadow banking also involves maturity transformation, using lengthened intermediation chains that run through the
interbank market. This reliance on short maturities to fund lending for long-term projects could contribute to spikes in
liquidity demand and volatility in the interbank market. On the positive side, although China’s shadow banking system is
neither simple in structure nor transparent, it is not dominated by complex derivatives and massive leverage.
Regulation. The authorities have strengthened regulation of shadow banks, including tightening regulation of nonstandard
credit products, forbidding trusts from funding cash payouts on maturing products with the proceeds from new WMP sales,
and restricting ways to fund off-balance sheet credit through the interbank market. Although parts of internet financing is
regulated by various agencies, the rapid growth warrants more comprehensive and coordinated regulation.
Finding the right balance. Financial innovation is benefiting both savers and investors, but the rapid growth also poses
challenges for (i) investors to assess the risk of the products they are buying, especially given the rarity of defaults;
(ii) regulators and supervisors to keep up with the pace of innovation; and (iii) policymakers, as traditional measures of
monetary and credit aggregates become less reliable. The authorities’ intention to liberalize interest rates, strengthen
regulation and supervision (including of shadow banking), and use more market-based instruments to control credit will
reduce the incentive for shadow banking activities.

also illustrate the risk, as most of them led to a recession, banking crisis, or both.

‘adjusted TSF’ which, aside from some components of
nonbank credit, also subtracts credit to the public sector (mainly LGFVs) that is included in the augmented
fiscal debt. This avoids double-counting LGFV debt as both private and public sector, and provides a clearer
picture of credit flowing to the private sector.
Credit boom: deviation from gap. Dell’Ariccia, Igan, and Laeven (2012) find the deviation in percentage
points of credit-to-GDP from trend (“credit gap”) to be a good predictor of a financial crisis. 1 They used

past five years, China’s TSF stock increased by 73 percent of GDP,2 while adjusted TSF and bank credit to
nonfinancial sector increased by around 30 percent of GDP. Looking at a sample covering 43 countries over
50 years, staff identified only four episodes that experienced a similar scale of credit growth as China’s
recent TSF growth. Within three years following the boom period, all four countries had a banking crisis.
With a lower threshold of a 30-percent-of-GDP increase in credit over five years, there are 48 episodes of
credit boom, half of which were followed by banking crises.

Box 6. Fiscal Options: Reducing the Deficit and Promoting Inclusive Growth
A menu of fiscal measures could be used to reduce the augmented deficit, by around 5 percent of GDP over the
medium term (as recommended by staff), while at the same time increasing social spending and fostering more
inclusive growth.
Revenue measures
Extending VAT to servcies. In 2013, revenue from the VAT and business operation tax was 8.1 percent of GDP.
If the VAT was extended to services (replacing the business operation tax) at the current standard rate of
17 percent rate on goods—as opposed to the 6 or11 percent being applied to some services—revenue would
likely go up by over 2 percent of GDP. Given the benefits of minimizing the use of exemptions and multiple
rates, a case could be made for using a single VAT rate for all goods and services. For example, applying a
single VAT rate of around 13-14 percent for all goods and services would likely raise an additional ½–1 percent
of GDP in revenue.
Personal income tax (PIT) and social security contributions (SSC). The PIT currently raises only 1 percent of
GDP in revenue, which is low by international standards. While it already embeds a strong progressive schedule,
the top marginal rates apply only to very high income brackets. Applying the top marginal rates to more
households, combined with stronger enforcement and compliance, would increase revenue while also
mitigating inequality. In addition, a broader reform could reduce the highly regressive SSC. Bringing PIT revenue
closer to international levels would leave scope to reduce SSC for low income groups, and still raise an
additional 2–3 percent of GDP in revenue.
Recurrent property tax. While the share of tax revenue from property is not low by international standards,
China differs in that such revenue is mostly levied on transations. A gradual shift towards a recurrent property
tax would yield higher and more stable revenue. For example, bringing the level close to the OECD average
could raise additional revenue of 1‒1½ percent of GDP.
Environmental tax and fees. China collected
around 1½ percent of GDP in 2011 in
environmental taxes and fees (mostly fees and
penalties). An additional 1 percent of GDP could
be raised by moving up to the advanced
economy average. Also, switching from fees to
taxes could help better protect the
environment.

Expenditure measures
Less reliance on public investment. Public investment and infrastructure spending (including by LGFVs) could
be reduced by about 5–6 percentage points of GDP over the medium term, returning it to roughly the same
level that prevailed before the GFC.
Increase in social spending. A reform scenario in China 20301 proposed to increase public expenditures by
7‒8 percent of GDP by 2030, including the effect of population aging (demographic changes are discussed in
more detail in Box 4 of the previous year’s staff report) 1 percent of GDP for education; 2–3 percent of GDP for
healthcare; and 3–4 percent of GDP to fully finance the basic old-age pension and meet the legacy costs of
current obligations. If done gradually, social expenditure could reach 15–16 percent of GDP by 2020, which is
around the average for middle income countries.

Collection of environmental taxes and fees is low.
While China levies a variety of resource and vehicle
taxes and pollution fees, total collection is low
compared to OECD countries and only a fraction of
the levels required to fully internalize the costs of
climate change, local pollution, and congestion
externalities. The Third-Plenum blueprint calls for the
prices of water, oil, natural gas and electricity to be
deregulated. However, taxes and other market
mechanisms should be used as well to ensure prices
reflect the full cost of externalities from energy and
resource use.

Source: OECD; and IMF staff calculations.

Several tax policy instruments are available to complement the government’s current reform
agenda.
Carbon tax. An upstream tax on fossil fuels based on carbon emission rates could be considered. A tax
imposed at the pollution’s point of entry in the economy (such as coal mine, energy plants, petroleum
refineries) would reduce the number of agents to tax and thereby reduce the administrative burden. It
would also build off the administrative structures already in place for China’s resource taxes. A carbon tax
levied upstream would also provide the necessary incentives for emission-reducing behavior throughout
the economy since energy prices would increase uniformly across all sectors of activity.
Tax on local air pollutants: The current pollution levies on SO2 and NOx emissions and small
particulates could also be significantly increased, and their legal status upgraded to full fledge taxes. This
would facilitate enforcement and would ensure they provide the necessary incentives to reduce emission
levels as their current rates are only a fraction of estimated health costs of local pollution.
Fuel taxes: Excise duties on gasoline and other petroleum products could be further increased to cover
the negative externalities associated with greenhouse gas emissions, local pollution, congestion and
accidents. To cover these costs, the effective tax rate on gasoline could increase from its current level of
40¢ per liter to roughly 55¢ per liter. This would be comparable to other countries’ current tax levels on
gasoline and significantly lower than Japan (75¢ per liter) and South Korea (85¢ per liter).
Vehicle taxes: China’s current sales taxes on vehicles are based on engine capacity. While this provides a
reasonable proxy for the environmental damage caused by cars, an alternative would be to use a
graduated system based on vehicles’ emissions level. This could take the form of an ad valorem excise tax
on vehicle value to meet revenue objectives and revenue neutral ‘feebate’ on emission rates to promote
environmental objectives. This feebate structure would impose an additional fee on cars that are more
polluting than some predetermined reference threshold and provide a rebate for cars that generate less
emissions than the threshold.

Box 9. External Assessment
Staff’s assessment is that the external position is moderately stronger compared with the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
Recent balance of payments developments. The current account surplus fell to 1.9 percent of GDP in
2013 from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2012, on account of larger service and income account deficits while the
trade surplus remained broadly unchanged. A significant part of the increased service deficit was driven by
strong growth in outbound tourism spending. The current account surplus is projected to worsen slightly in
2014, and to increase to around 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. This is about 1 percent of GDP
lower than projected at the time of the last external assessment, largely due to a revised outlook for the
services account in light of recent developments. The average REER appreciated by 6 percent, similar to the
2012 appreciation. By May 2014, the REER was at about the same level as its 2013 average.
Foreign assets and liabilities. Gross foreign assets, at 65 percent of GDP at end-2013, are dominated by
foreign reserves (42 percent of GDP), while gross liabilities, at 43 percent of GDP, mainly represent FDI
liabilities (26 percent of GDP). The net IIP ratio (21 percent of GDP) has declined since the global financial
crisis in light of the smaller current account surpluses, valuation changes, and still-fast growth of GDP. Given
the large net IIP, international investment vulnerabilities are low.
FX intervention and reserves level. The pace of reserve accumulation slowed significantly in 2012, but
picked up again in 2013 against the backdrop of large capital inflows induced by interest rate differentials,
the relatively high real return of capital, and expectations of continued RMB appreciation. Further
accumulation is unnecessary from a reserve adequacy perspective.
Estimate of Current Account and REER Gaps (EBA)



Current account gap. The External Balance Assessment (EBA) current account balance approach
estimates that China’s 2013 surplus, adjusted for cyclical factors, is 1.6 percent of GDP above the level
consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies (compared with 1.8 percent of GDP in last year’s
EBA). The gap is mainly attributed to a lower-than-desired level of social spending and excess reserve
accumulation. Accounting for uncertainty about the cyclical adjustment adds a range of +/-1 percent to
the point estimate, which implies a current account gap of about 1‒3 percent of GDP.



REER gap. The current account gap translates to
Real Effective Exchange Rate
(2000=100)
an undervaluation of the REER of about 4-12

125
percent (applying the same trade elasticities as
in the 2013 EBA). The EBA REER regression
115
points to undervaluation of 12 percent (similar
to last year’s EBA). On balance, recent
105
developments and available quantitative
estimates suggest that the renminbi remains
95
moderately undervalued, by 5‒10 percent,
relative to a level consistent with fundamentals

and desired policies. The REER appreciation has

been consistent with changing underlying
fundamentals (especially faster productivity growth than in trading partners), but not sufficient to
eliminate a moderate undervaluation.

Box 10. Potential Growth and Output Gap1
There is strong evidence that potential growth has slowed. Going forward, how fast the economy can grow will
depend on reforms, especially those to boost productivity. The estimates of a small negative output gap do not call
for a policy stimulus, but instead point to the need for domestic rebalancing to contain vulnerabilities.
Potential growth has declined. Several estimation methods

China: Potential growth decomposition

point to a slowdown in potential growth to around

16

7½ percent. A cross-country convergence regression,

14

moreover, suggests that this would be in line with the

12

convergence path of fast-growing Asian economies.
The slowdown and future path of potential GDP are
determined in large part by productivity growth.
Estimates using a production function indicate that the
slowdown in potential GDP largely comes from lower
productivity growth (investment becomes less efficient).

Continuing along a fast convergence path will require boosting productivity growth, which points to the
importance of structural reforms.
The estimates suggest a small negative output gap, but stimulus to close it is not warranted in China’s
case. Univariate filters or multivariate filters that link the output gap to inflation generally find a small negative
gap. However, adding information about capacity utilization to the multivariate filters yield different results. A
time series on capacity utilization is not available and the results are sensitive to the measure used. Measuring
capacity utilization by diffusion indices points to a small negative gap, while the gap derived from extrapolating
sector-specific capacity utilization—showing much more overcapacity—is large. This variation in the results
highlights the degree of uncertainty, but on balance the smaller output gap seems more consistent with the
dynamics of broad price indices (CPI and GDP deflator). However, such economy-wide measures of the gap
hide differences between sectors: (i) several sectors (such as mining, steel, cement, and glass) suffer from
overcapacity, with excess supply pushing down producer prices (PPI); (ii) other manufacturing sectors are more
efficient, with productivity growth supporting low inflation, solid profits, and growing wages (suggesting little
slack in the labor market); and (ii) the service sector expands steadily, with higher inflation reflecting strong
demand and wage growth.
Including financial-cycle information highlights vulnerabilities in the structure of demand and the need
for domestic rebalancing. Borio (2013) argues that while growth may be considered sustainable if it is
consistent with low and stable inflation, in reality it may be on an unsustainable path when financial imbalances
are building up. Including credit growth in the estimates for China yields a large positive output gap. This result,
combined with the sectoral pattern discussed above, illustrates the potential imbalances between supply and
demand. Credit-driven investment has increased economy-wide capacity without generating new sustainable
sources of demand other than the investment itself, which cannot continue given growing inefficiencies and
high leverage. Solving this requires rebalancing toward a more consumer-based growth model. One where
rising household income—fueled by strong growth in the more labor-intensive service sector, supported by
reforms—generates sustainable growth in demand for consumption, including for more services.

Box 11. Giving Credit for China’s Slowdown—The Third-Plenum Reform Blueprint1
Reforms would put growth on a sounder footing with higher per capita income and consumption over the
medium term, benefitting China and the global economy.
Three scenarios. The staff’s baseline scenario, which assumes gradual implementation of reforms, is compared
to scenarios of “fast reform” and “no reform.” The baseline and fast reform scenarios include:



Financial sector reforms include accelerating deposit rate liberalization, establishing a formal deposit
insurance system, and strengthening financial supervision and resolution framework. These would
encourage a better pricing of risk (increasing average cost of credit) and redirect credits to more efficient
uses.



Fiscal reforms include a gradual unwinding of borrowing from LGFVs, improving coverage and portability
of basic pensions and health insurance, strengthening social safety nets, and more efficient and
redistributive taxes. These measues (see Box 6 for details) would reduce investment, creating room to
increase social spending for a gradual reduction of the augmented deficit by about 5 percentage points of
GDP over the medium term. They would also gradually reduce the household saving rate due to a lower
incentive for precautionary saving.



Structural reforms. Opening up markets, and SOE and resource pricing reforms would shift resources to
the more efficient private sector, lifting economy-wide productivity. Urbanization through hukou reforms
would increase the participation rate and also help raise productivity. Previous research (IMF 2013)
suggests that these reforms would bring productivity gains of 1½–2 percentage points.



Exchange rate reforms include widening the trading band and allowing the currency to move more in line
with market forces. Together with other reform measures these would contribute to continued domestic
and external rebalancing, by reducing the savings rate by more than the targeted reduction of the
investement/GDP ratio.

The “fast reform” scenario assumes that financial, exchange rate and structural reforms are implemented
promptly, and fiscal reforms are phased in over a two-year lag (this compares to about five-year lag for reforms
in the baseline).
“Fast reform”. Fast implementation would slow China’s growth in the near-term (by about ½ percentage
point, largely due to faster fiscal adjustment and higher interest rates), but the long-run income is much higher
and private consumption grows faster. With less LGFV borrowing, augmented debt is falling and credit growth
is likely to be slower, leading to a faster reduction of vulnerabilities. The fast implementation would also
generate sizeable benefits to the global economy. Simulation suggests that global growth could increase by
0.2 percentage points over the medium term, although growth may be slower in the near term, reflecting the
upfront cost of reforms and steps to reduce vulnerabilities.
“No reform”. Without reforms, growth would be weaker (as productivity growth slows and investment
becomes increasingly inefficient) and the likelihood of a sharp slowdown in the future higher, with knock-on
effects to the global economy. Repeated reliance on credit and government intervention to prop up growth
without reforms would boost near-term growth, but reduce future growth and exacerbate vulnerabilities,
increasing the risk of a disorderly adjustment, stalling the convergence process, and adversely affecting the
global economy. This would map into annual growth of less than 4 percent by 2030, with considerable risk of
an even sharper slowdown.

Appendix III. China: Augmented Fiscal Data1
This Appendix describes the method for estimating the augmented fiscal data, which expand the perimeter of
government to include off-budget activity and local government financing vehicles (LGFVs). The estimates
have been updated to incorporate information from the latest budget and NAO audit. The revised
augmented net lending/borrowing widened in 2013, in part due to expansion of off-budget quasi-fiscal
activity, and augmented debt reached 54 percent of GDP. In addition, the general government fiscal data
have also been revised to incorporate previously excluded items.

A. Revised Estimate on Augmented Balance and Debt
1. General government fiscal data have been revised from previous staff reports. Specifically,
three previously excluded items—social security funds, government managed funds (which
include off-budget spending that are regularly reported), and the state-administered SOE funds.
It also updates the estimate of augmented fiscal data, which were introduced in the last Article IV staff
2
report. The revisions generally show a somewhat smaller historical augmented deficit, but the deficit
for 2013 is somewhat higher than previously forecast. The revised augmented debt reconciles
remaining differences on general government debt with official audits in 2011 and 2013.
2. The revision uses two-step approach to estimate the augmented deficit.
i.

Estimate consolidated general government. This approach estimates the general government
balance. Starting with the authorities’ definition of national government budgetary balance, the
estimate adds (i) transfers to and from stabilization funds; (ii) state-administered SOE funds and
social security contributions and expenses (about 1¼–1½ percent of GDP per year after 2008);
(iii) off-budget spending by local governments—estimated by net local government bonds issued
by the central government on their behalf, and net land sale proceeds (net of acquisition cost)
available for local governments to use aside from budget spending (about 3 percent of GDP).
Relative to the authorities’ definition (a deficit of 2 percent of GDP as of end-2013), the consolidated
general government net borrowing (excluding the financing by net land sale revenue) indicates a
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP as of end-2013 (Table 1)—reflecting the fact that the funds not
included in the budget often show a surplus.

ii.

Add off-budget fiscal activity of LGFVs and local governments that is not financed by government
bonds. To arrive at the augmented measure, the consolidated general government balance is
adjusted with the off-budget LGFV infrastructure spending and spending by local governments
through other means of market financing (e.g., trust loans). The adjustment is large, at
about 6½ percent of GDP per year since 2010, bringing the augmented net lending/borrowing
to -7½ percent of GDP as of end-2013.

Prepared by W. Raphael Lam (APD) and Philippe Wingender (FAD).

2

Augmented fiscal data expand the perimeter of government to include local government financing vehicles and

other off-budget activity. See IMF Country Report No. 13/211 and IMF Working Paper No.14/4, ‘Fiscal Vulnerabilities
and Risks from Local Government Finance in China’.

3. The augmented debt estimate incorporates the findings of the recent NAO audit. Augmented
debt covers central and local government liabilities and quasi-fiscal activity by LGFVs, but excludes the
debt issued for China Railway Corporation (about 3 percent of GDP).3 The local government debt is
estimated by each financing component (such as bonds issued by central government on their behalf,
LGFV corporate bonds, bank loans, trust products, and other financing sources), taking into account
details available in the 2013 NAO report (see Section C). The estimate of land sale revenue and
acquisition cost—a key component in local government finance—has been revised and is based on
data in previous budget speeches.

The augmented debt expands the perimeter of general government to include off-budget activity and borrowings
by local government financing vehicles. The NAO, however, reported government obligations into three groups:
explicit debt, government-guaranteed obligations, and liabilities that the government may incur. Based on historic
data, the NAO reported that around 14 percent of government guaranteed debt and 19 percent of liabilities the
government may incur would eventually become government obligations. Under the GFS system, a contingent
liability that does not result in transactions or other economic flows is not recorded unless the event or condition
referred to actually occurs. Contingent liabilities, however, can be reported as memorandum items.

The revised estimates of augment fiscal data are similar to the previous ones.



Augmented net lending/borrowing. The overall trend looks similar to previous estimates,
including the stimulus in 2008–09 and the deterioration due to ‘quasi-fiscal’ activity beginning
2012. For years before 2010, the revised estimates show a deficit that is smaller by 1–1½ percent
of GDP each year between 2000 and 2010. Nonetheless, the augmented net borrowing appears
to have widened in 2013, unlike the forecast in last year’s staff report (Figure 1).



Augmented debt. The trend again looks similar to previous estimate, with a rapid rise since 2008.
The augmented debt is now closer to the NAO audit of total explicit government debt
(text table), guaranteed debt, and other liabilities the government may incur. It rose to
54 percent of GDP as of end-2013, including explicit debt and other debt incurred by LGFVs.

5.
Staff estimates of the augmented debt essentially is the same concept in the NAO audit of
total debt (the sum of (i) explicit government debt; (ii) government guaranteed debt, and (iii) liabilities
that the government may be obliged to repay). The total debt in all three categories was 53.5 percent of
GDP as of end-2012, which was close to last year’s Staff Report estimate of 46.2 percent of GDP as of
end-2012 (IMF 2013).4 The main differences are:


Unlike staff, the NAO included debt by China Railway Corporations (about 3.2 percent of GDP)
and debt issued for bank recapitalization (around 4 percent of GDP) in the central government
debt. Adjusting for these, the augmented debt estimate was very close to NAO audit total debt.
Staff’s revised estimate of the augmented debt in 2012 is now 50.3 percent of GDP because staff
estimate excludes the debt by the China Railway Corporation (see text table).



The NAO audit considered only part of the guaranteed debt and the liabilities that the
government may be obliged to pay to be included in general government debt. They applied a
fraction (19.1 percent of guaranteed debt and 14.6 percent of the liabilities that the government
may be obliged to repay) of those debt as government debt, based on the historical data.

As a result, the government debt according to the NAO audit was 39.4 percent of GDP in 2012.
Applying a similar method on the augmented debt would suggest that staff estimate of general
government debt is 37.4 percent of GDP. The lower figure in staff estimate relative to the NAO audit
is due to the exclusion of debt by China Railway Corporation.

B. LGFVs: Government Units or Nonfinancial Public Corporations?
6.
The augmented concept is an attempt to expand the perimeter of general government
beyond what the authorities currently use. A large portion of the recent increase in infrastructure
spending has been financed off-budget through borrowing by LGFVs. Many of these are registered
legally as corporations. The crucial question is whether to classify these LGFVs as part of the general
government or as nonfinancial public corporations. Nonfinancial public corporations, while part of
the broader public sector, would generally not be included in government statistics. Moreover, some
LGFVs could be considered as part of the financial (as opposed to nonfinancial) public sector.
7.
Under the 2001 GFS Manual, the key to classify a unit as a corporation is not its legal status
but rather its characteristics of producing goods and services for the market and being able to generate
profits. Corporations, as opposed to government units, are defined as entities that (i) are a source of profit
or other financial gain for their owners; and (ii) produce goods and services for the market at economically
significant prices.5
8.
For China, LGFVs appear to be a distinct type of entity with typically fiscal objectives in
contrast to other state-owned enterprise (SOEs) that generally function on a commercial basis.


In many cases, the local government directly or indirectly shares the LGFVs debt servicing
responsibilities and sometimes subsidizes their losses. Some LGFV debts were implicitly, if not
explicitly, guaranteed by local governments and LGFVs could also collateralize their borrowing with
land or other assets, either owned by the LGFV itself, pledged by the local government, or provided

5

Economically significant prices are prices that have a significant effect on the amounts that producers are willing to
supply and on the amounts purchasers wish to buy. Prices set on administrative, social, or political grounds that do
not cover capital and other costs would not be considered economically significant. For details, see 2001 GFS Manual.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by another entity.


Projects financed by LGFVs may have nominal source of revenue, such as road tolls or usage fees for a
water treatment facility, but quite often not enough to meet future debt servicing needs. And,
important for classification purposes, LGFVs are typically established for the sole purpose of
infrastructure spending and are therefore distinguishable from local state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
that provide a broader set of goods and services mostly on a commercial basis.

9.
Augmented fiscal data should serve as a complement and not a substitute for general
government data. While some LGFVs may operate on a primarily commercial basis, and should thus be
excluded from government, it is also likely that some SOEs are carrying-out quasi-fiscal activity. The
authorities have recently reclassified LGFVs into categories based on their revenue-generating capacity
and level of dependence on government subsidies. This information could be used in the future to further
refine the boundaries of General Government by classifying LGFVs that operate on a commercial basis as
SOEs and others as part of general government.

C. Technical Details on Augmented Estimates:
Fiscal Balance
10.
Difference in the on-budget balance between authorities and staff estimates on general
government deficit:
The staff estimate of the general government balance makes several adjustments to the authorities’
budgetary balance. First, the staff estimate includes the surplus/deficit of the social security and stateadministered SOE funds. The estimate also differs in to the treatment of the stabilization fund. The
authorities do not include the stabilization fund as part of the general government but instead treat
transfers to/out of the fund as revenue and expenditure. The stabilization fund works analogously to a
government bank account, in which the government makes yearly deposits and withdrawals. In line with
the Government Finance Statistics practices, the stabilization fund is part of the general government,
recording cash transactions ‘below the line’. Off-budget local government spending is also estimated from
changes in local government bonds issued by the central government and net proceeds from land sales.
The staff general government balance takes out the financing from net land sale revenues. Finally, other
small adjustments explained below complement the staff estimate of general government balance.
a) Social security funds. Data are available for national government starting from 2008. The fund
has maintained a surplus each year, with the amount around RMB 590 billion for 2013. Inclusion
improves the general government balance.
b) State-administered SOE funds. Data are available for national government starting from 2010.
The fund has maintained a surplus each year of around RMB200 billion. Inclusion slightly
improves the general government balance.
c) Off-budget local government spending is estimated from net change in local government bonds
outstanding. These may be issued on a discretionary basis approved by the State Council. The
amount that central government bonds issued on behalf of local governments is not part of
central government debt and therefore also adds to local government debt. The net issuance is
included as financing towards the general government balance, while the outstanding amount
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

counts towards local government debt. The amount is fairly small at around 1 percent of GDP.
d) Net proceeds from land sales—the portion used to finance current and infrastructure
spending—is included in the general government balance calculation. The amount is obtained
by subtracting the acquisition cost, compensation to farmers, and land development from the
gross land sale proceeds. Data are available from Soufun, Ministry of Finance, and previous
budget speeches. The net proceeds are treated as financing, not revenue, since it is analogous
to privatization proceeds. This also includes the small net surplus/deficit under other funds, such
as government-managed funds (GMFs). As part of the financing, it is excluded in the general
government balance.
e) Other adjustments such as balance carried forward in local government funds, and redemption
of local government bonds included in the expenditures are cash transactions ‘below the line.’
Construction of Augmented Net Lending/Borrowing and Fiscal Balance
11.
The augmented deficit adds off-budget fiscal activity of LGFVs and local governments
through other means of market financing. The augmented net lending/borrowing counts the proceeds
from net land sales revenue “above-the-line.”
12.
Major components of market financing of local government. This refers to the
borrowing by local government entities from commercial banks, trust companies, financing
institutions other than securities firms and insurance companies, and corporate bond market related
to the LGFVs.
a) Beginning in 2009–10, local governments expanded market borrowing through the use of
LGFVs. They are legally distinct entities, often receiving public credit enhancement, that engage
in long-term infrastructure projects. Some LGFV debts were informally guaranteed by local
governments, often the local governments are perceived to stand behind the LGFVs if needed.
Those borrowings could be collateralized. Our estimate assumes that all LGFV debt warrants
inclusion in the augmented deficit and debt, given most LGFVs do not necessarily operate on a
primarily commercial basis. Local-government owned SOEs are not included. Corporate bonds
are derived from the WIND database and NAO estimates, which provides data on gross amount
and maturity dates of corporate bonds issued by LGFVs.
b) Bank loans accounts for over half of total local government debt by 2013, down from near
80 percent by 2010, equivalent to RMB 10 trillion. Market financing by bank loans on local
government is estimated to be around 30–40 percent (based on historical data) of the change in
medium- and long-term loans for domestic use. It is about 1–1.5 trillion between 2010 and 2013.
c) Trust finance amounted to RMB 1.4 trillion based on the NAO 2013 estimates. For other years,
the amount is estimated by the trust amount of infrastructure projects (amounted to RMB
2.6 trillion by end 2013) available from China Trustee Association after 2010, as well as applying
the growth rate of the trust loans outstanding under the total social financing.
d) Other market financing options are available mostly beginning 2010. The NAO 2013 provided
details on these alternative financing sources, including build-to-transfer, credit and wage
payable, lease financing, financing from securities firms and insurance (other than those listed

above). Data between 2010 and 2012 are assumed to following the same aggregate growth rate
of other market financing components (a) to (d).

Fiscal Debt
13.

Debt data are based on public sources or cumulated financing flows.



Central government debt is readily available from official sources. It includes the government
debt issued by the Ministry of Finance, and the debt incurred for asset management companies
and bank recapitalization. We exclude the debt of China Railway Corporation.



For the augmented debt, the NAO audits (2010 and 2013) provided the starting point. Data for
previous and subsequent years are then calculated based on the financing assumptions
described above. Differences with the NAO total liabilities of government (explicit debt,
guaranteed government liabilities, and liabilities that the government may incur) are minor.

Impact and Policy Response

High
Surges in global financial market volatility, triggered by geopolitical
tensions or revised market expectations on UMP exit in the United States
or emerging market fundamentals. Volatility might be exacerbated by
reduction in risk appetite, and the balance sheet effect will vary with the
extent of leverage. The adverse effect would be more pronounced should
higher rates not be associated with stronger growth in the US.

Medium
Main impact would be through lower export demand. GDP growth
would slow relative to baseline by close to ½–¾ percentage points.

High
Lower-than-anticipated growth and persistently low inflation in advanced
economies due to a failure to fully address legacies of the financial crisis
would lead to secular stagnation, and potentially complicate efforts on
rebalancing and restoring fiscal sustainability. For emerging economies,
lower trend growth arising from misallocation of investment and
incomplete structural reforms could affect confidence, FDI flows, and
eventually lead to a permanent reduction of growth.

High
External trade would be affected due to slower recovery of global
demand. Capacity utilization rates in export sectors would decline,
leading to a fall in profitability, rising unemployment, and
diminished ability to service corporate debt. Deterioration in banks’
asset quality, together with tighter financing conditions, would
further slow investment and growth.

Medium
Though the fiscal outlook is different in the United States, Euro-area, and
Japan, bond market stress in these economies would materialize through
an increased sovereign risk premium, and higher government bond yields
in the medium-term. Such developments could undermine the recovery of
private domestic demand, lead to a weakening of financial fragmentation
and credit transmission, and have severe global financial market
repercussions. The sovereign risk premium could increase by 200 bps (April
2013 WEO scenario).
Medium
New sources of supply, such as shale gas and a ramping up of production
in some emerging economies may generate global excess capacity, while
global demand remains weak.

High
Main impact would be through lower export demand, driven by a
sharp loss of market confidence and delaying the global recovery.

Policy response: If growth were to slow too sharply, on-budget fiscal
stimulus should be used in a manner that supports rebalancing and helps
protect vulnerable groups.

Policy response: Advance structural reforms to accelerate the
transition towards greener, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. If
growth were to slow too sharply, on-budget fiscal stimulus should be used
in a manner that supports rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable
groups.

Policy response: If near-term growth were to slow too sharply, then onbudget fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports
rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.

Medium
A sustained decline of commodities prices over a period of several
years could benefit China against the background of rising demand
various commodities, which could help offset part of the adverse
effect from rising resource and factor prices under the third-plenum
reforms (WEO April 2014).
Policy response: Advance structural reforms to accelerate the
transition towards a greener, more inclusive, and sustainable growth.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Likelihood (Over next one to five years)
Low
Notwithstanding the rise in vulnerabilities, an abrupt adjustment in
the near term is unlikely, given China’s policy buffers. Cross-country
evidence suggests that credit booms of a similar size often led to
sharp corrections (Box 5). However, in China the government still has
the capacity to absorb shocks and prevent the kind of loss of
confidence or sudden stop that have triggered major problems in
other countries—such as a deposit run, freezing-up of the interbank
market, collapse of the real estate market, or capital flight. Total
public debt is relatively low; public sector assets are large (including
foreign exchange reserves); domestic savings are high and foreign
debt exposures low; capital controls limit the risk of capital flight; and
the government retains substantial levers to control economic and
financial activity.

Impact and Policy Response
High
If a shock were to occur that threatens to trigger a disorderly adjustment, the
authorities have the policy space and levers to act quickly to prevent it from
leading to a sharp slowdown in growth.

Medium

High

Without a change in the pattern of growth, the likelihood of a shock
triggering financial disruption and/or a sharp slowdown will continue
to rise. Overreliance on credit and capital accumulation to support
growth would further weaken balance sheets and reduce investment
efficiency. This would ultimately lead to a slowdown in growth, and
put further pressure on corporate profits and the financial system. The
more vulnerabilities accumulate, the more likely it is that a shock
could trigger a negative feedback loop. Thus, although the near-term
risk of a hard landing is low, it increases to medium over a mediumterm perspective.

While buffers could still be used in the case of a hard landing, growth could
remain low for a protracted period of time given stretched private and public
sector balance sheets.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Appendix V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Staff performed public debt sustainability analyses for both general government debt and augmented
debt, which represent the lower and upper bound of fiscal obligations. While China’s general
government debt remains low and sustainable, augmented debt is on a slight upward trajectory in the
baseline. Augmented debt is sensitive to fiscal balance and contingent liability shocks, but the risk of
debt distress is low given China’s favorable debt profile. The sensitivity underscores the importance of
reform to reduce fiscal risks and to generate a more sustainable growth path.
China’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is based on the following assumptions:


Public debt coverage. Two definitions of government debt and deficits are used. General
government debt includes central government debt and local government bond. Augmented
debt adds other types of local government debt, including off-budget borrowing by LGFVs via
bank loans, bonds, and trust loans. Augmented deficit is the flow counterpart of augmented
debt. Augmented debt and deficit should be seen as the upper bound of government fiscal
position as it includes both the explicit and contingent part of general government debt (see
further explanation of the coverage in Appendix III).



Macroeconomic assumptions:





In the baseline, growth is forecasted at 7.4 percent in 2014 and medium-term growth
gradually declines to 6.3 percent by 2019. Inflation is projected at 2 percent in 2014 and
gradually rises to 3 percent in the medium term. The projection assumes a gradual and back
loaded implementation of reforms.



The “no reform” scenario assumes little to no reforms and continued accommodative
policies, especially through local government spending and rapid credit growth to boost
near term growth. Growth remains around 7.2–7.4 percent in 2014–2016, but drops to 5.9 by
2019 as the growth strategy runs out of steam. The scenario is consistent with the no reform
scenario in the main text of the staff report.

Fiscal assumptions:


Fiscal balance assumptions. In the baseline, the general government deficit1 is projected to
narrow slightly in line with the authorities’ gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. The
augmented deficit is also projected to decline from 10.1 percent of GDP to 8.2 percent of
GDP by 2019. The decline is driven by the reduction in local government expenditure to GDP
ratio due to: (i) lower expenditure financed by net land sales; and (ii) the authorities’ reforms
to limit local government borrowing, which kicks in towards the end of the projection
period. In the no reform scenario, however, general government deficit is projected to

1

The general government deficit refers to net lending/borrowing, which is the consolidated government balance,
including the budgetary balance, surpluses on government-managed funds, accounting adjustment for the
stabilization fund, and social security funds.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

increase to 4 percent of GDP by 2019, and the augmented deficit to widen to 11.6 percent
by 2019, as the public sector continues to increase spending to boost growth.


Local government financing. While many local governments have relied on net revenue from
land sales and LGFV borrowing to finance their investment, the DSA assumes that future
financing needs will be met by bond issuance, in line with the authorities’ intention. Three
bond types are assumed: (i) central government bonds; (ii) local government bonds, and
(iii) a separate bond to repay existing local government debt according to amortization
scheme in the NAO 2013 report.



Interest rates and amortization. The interest rate for central government bonds is assumed
to follow the historical pattern. However, for local government bonds, it is expected to
gradually rise over the medium term, reflecting a higher risk premium and more
market-based interest rates. The rate for the last type of bond is assumed to be between the
other two rates. Amortization is assumed to follow the 2013 NAO report with 55 percent of
local government debt maturing by the end of 2014, and the rest spread over the next few
years.

In the baseline, China’s general government debt is on a declining path, but augmented
debt continues to rise.


Projected general government consolidation under the baseline implies declining gross
financing needs. As a result, debt will fall to around 15 percent of GDP in 2019.



Augmented debt, however, rises to 66 percent of GDP in 2019 from 54 percent of GDP in
2013. Even with the favorable interest rate-growth differential, the debt rises given that large
deficits persist to 2019 under the assumption that government measures to contain local
government borrowing are not in place until the end of the projection period.

China faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but is vulnerable
to fiscal balance and contingent liability shocks, especially under the no reform scenario.


General government debt remains relatively low and on a declining path for all shocks
except for the contingent liability one in the no reform scenario. A contingent liability shock
will result in a sharp increase in debt level from below 20 percent of GDP in 2013 to
37 percent of GDP in 2015.2 Over the medium term, the debt-to-GDP ratio will gradually
moderate as the impact of shocks fades away. While debt would only rise to about
20 percent of GDP in the no reform scenario, if a contingent liability shock is also included,
debt would rise to about 40 percent of GDP in 2019. While the debt level is manageable, the
authorities would have to deal with a sudden surge of gross financing needs, which would
be sensitive to market financing condition.

2

A one-time increase in noninterest expenditures, equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets, leads to a
real GDP growth shock, with growth reduced by 1 standard deviation for two consecutive years; unchanged
revenue-to-GDP ratio; worsening in the primary balance that leads to higher interest rate; and lower inflation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

72



Augmented debt, however, is more sensitive to a primary balance or contingent liability
shock. A scenario that keeps the primary balance constant would increase debt to
72 percent by 2019. A contingent liability shock, however, would push dept to around
80 percent of GDP in two years, increasing to almost 90 percent by 2019. A contingent
liability shock, for example, could be a bank recapitalization or financial system bailout. In
the no reform scenario, which features a growing primary deficit and lower medium-term
growth, augmented debt would rise to around 76 percent of GDP by 2019. If a contingent
liability shock is also incorporated in the alternative scenario in 2018, augmented debt will
rise to nearly 100 percent of GDP in 2019.



China’s debt profile is favorable as most of the public debt is financed through a captive
domestic investor base, and the small external debt is mostly from official creditors. In
addition, China has ample foreign exchange reserves to meet any external financing needs.

Change in gross public sector debt

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
6/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
7/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 6 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
8/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 6 as ae(1+r).
9/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.

Exchange Arrangements:
China’s exchange rate regime has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since June 21, 2010.
De jure classification of the exchange rate is managed floating. On July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank
of China (PBC) announced that the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be
revalued upward by about 2.1 percent (from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange rate
regime would move to a managed float in which renminbi’s value is set with reference to a basket of
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

currencies. The stated intention of the Chinese authorities was to increase the flexibility of the
renminbi’s exchange rate. The authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in the
reference basket and their relative weight. The PBC indicated that it would adjust the exchange rate
trading band as necessary to reflect market developments and financial and economic conditions.
Under the new regime, the band around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the
renminbi was kept at ± 0.3 percent around the central parity published by the PBC while the trade
prices of the non-U.S. dollar currencies against the renminbi were allowed to move within a certain
band announced by PBC, which was initially set at ±1.5 percent and increased to ±3 percent in
September 2005. In August 2005, the governor of PBC revealed that U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen,
and Korean won were the main currencies included in the basket; and U.K. pound, the Thai baht, and
the Russian ruble were among other currencies included in the basket. In May 2007, the band
around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the renminbi was widened to ± 0.5 percent.
After maintaining the renminbi closely linked to the U.S. dollar between July 2008 and June 2010,
the PBC announced on June 19, 2010 a return to the managed floating exchange rate regime
prevailing prior the global financial crisis with the exchange rate allowed to move up to 0.5 percent
from a central parity rate to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. Further, on April 14, 2012,
the PBC announced a widening of the renminbi’s trading band against the U.S. dollar in the
interbank foreign exchange market. As of today, the band has been widened to 2 percent, allowing
daily fluctuations relative to the central parity rate. The trading prices for the renminbi against the
euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on the one hand and against the ringgit and the
ruble on the other hand float within a 3 percent and a 5 percent range of the day’s middle exchange
rates of the renminbi against these currencies, respectively.
On January 4, 2006, over-the-counter (OTC) trading of spot foreign exchange was introduced with
15 banks initially designated as market makers. The number of market makers has since risen
to 31 with all the banks approved as spot market makers, and 27 approved as forward and swap
trading market makers. The centralized spot foreign exchange trading system (CFETS) remains
operative, but its central parity rate (renminbi against the U.S. dollar) is now based on a weighted
average of CFETS and OTC transactions. Under the new system, CFETS first inquires prices from all
market makers before the opening of the market on each business day, exclude the highest and
lowest offers, and then calculates the weighted average of the remaining prices in the sample as the
central parity for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar for the day. The weights for the market makers,
which remain undisclosed, are determined by the CFETS using various factors, including the
transaction volumes of the respective market makers in the market. The method for determining is
as follows: The CFETS determines the middle rate for the renminbi against the ringgit, yen, and the
ruble similarly. The middle exchange rates of the renminbi against the euro and Hong Kong dollar,
and pound sterling, respectively, are determined through cross rates by the CFETS based on the
day’s foreign exchange middle rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and the exchange rates
for the U.S. dollar against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on international
foreign exchange markets.
China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation requirements on proceeds from exports

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

and from invisible transactions and current transfers. Starting on August 13, 2007, all enterprises
(domestic institutions) having foreign exchange revenue from current operations may keep foreign
exchange receipts according to their operational needs in their current foreign exchange accounts.
With SAFE approval or registration, domestic institutions may open foreign exchange capital
accounts and retain foreign exchange revenues from capital transactions. Domestic institutions that
had no current foreign exchange revenue may purchase foreign exchange for imports in advance
based on documentary proof of the payment and deposit the funds into their foreign exchange
accounts. Individuals may, also open foreign exchange savings accounts and deposit foreign
exchange purchased in accordance with the relevant regulations. There are no measures currently in
force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. However,
China has notified measures to the Fund, pursuant to procedures under the Executive Board
Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to measures imposed solely for national or international security
reasons.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. Effective on July 1, 2006, quotas
on foreign exchange purchases for foreign direct investment (FDI) were abolished, and domestic
investors were allowed to purchase foreign exchange to finance pre-FDI activities. Since
December 1, 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) have been allowed to invest
domestically in A shares, subject to certain restrictions, and all nonresidents have been allowed to
purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The overall
investment limit for QFIIs was US$80 billion in 2012. As of the end of 2012, a cumulative total of
207 QFIIs had been approved, with a total investment limit of US$37.443 billion. The Qualified
Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme was introduced in 2004, and measures have since
been taken to promote its development. Since May 1, 2006, residents can freely purchase up to
US$20,000 foreign exchange and this limit was raised to US$50,000 in September 2006. Above this
amount, purchases require relevant documents. In May 2007, the QDII scheme was expanded to
allow qualified banks to invest retail funds in foreign equities. Effective July 5, 2007 the China
Securities and Regulatory Commission extended QDII to securities and fund-management
companies. The firms have to meet certain capital and other requirements. From April 2006,
qualified insurance companies were also allowed to invest their own foreign exchange externally
under the QDII scheme up to 15 percent of their total assets. QDIIs may also invest in foreign
derivative instruments.
The use of renminbi in international transactions has been expanded. In 2010, international financial
institutions were approved to raise funds domestically in renminbi for use offshore. Since August
2011, trade transactions between all provinces and cities in the Mainland with other countries may
be settled in renminbi. Since August 17, 2010, eligible foreign institutions may invest in the
interbank bond market in renminbi. The eligible institutions include foreign banks engaged in
cross-border trade settlements in renminbi, the Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR region renminbi
clearing banks, and foreign central banks and monetary authorities. These investments are subject
to limits, but there is no minimum holding period. Starting from January 6, 2011, resident
enterprises in 20 provinces and cities in the Mainland may use renminbi for outward FDI in those
countries which accept such settlement. In December 2011, a new pilot scheme was announced to

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

allow up to RMB20 billion in portfolio flows into the securities markets (through a renminbi
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme), and in October, rules were published to allow
overseas firms to invest renminbi raised offshore in the Mainland as foreign direct investment. Since
2012 all residents and non-residents can use RMB for FDI. Under the expanded RMB qualified
foreign institutional investors (RQFII) scheme, Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese financial
institutions, as well as financial institutions registered and operated in Hong Kong SAR, may invest in
domestic securities markets using RMB proceeds raised overseas. Hong Kong-based banks may
provide yuan loans to companies based in the Qianhai District of Shenzhen, with limits on the size of
the loan. RMB internationalization has advanced further in 2013-14. RMB clearing banks were
established in Singapore, Taiwan Province of China, Luxembourg, Australia, and the UK. Germany is
also expected to establish RMB clearing banks soon. Average daily RMB turnover in Hong Kong SAR
was about USD 50 billion in 2013, one of the highest among emerging market currencies.
External borrowing remains subject to permission by the respective authority except for FFEs which
may borrow abroad within the difference between the enterprise’s total investment and registered
capital. Lending abroad generally requires approval, but domestic associated enterprises of
multinational corporations may directly lend to offshore associated enterprises.
Article IV Consultation:
China is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The 2013 Article IV mission was concluded on
May 29, 2013 and the staff report was published on July 17, 2013.
Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance provided from 2000 through May 2014 is summarized in Annex V.
Resident Representative:
The resident representative office in Beijing was opened in October 1991. Mr. Alfred Schipke is the
Senior Resident Representative and Mr. Waikei Raphael Lam is the Deputy Resident Representative.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of June 18, 2014)
1.
The IMF China Resident Representatives (Messrs. Schipke and Syed) held discussions
with the World Bank team (Ms. Goh, lead Economist for China, and Mr. Smits) in June 2014 to
exchange views on key areas of reform to ensure sustainable medium-term growth in China, minimize
risks, and improve the inclusiveness of growth. The teams discussed their agendas for 2014-15. The last
such meeting was held during May 2013 in Beijing.
2.
The teams agreed the focus of reform in China should be on shifting growth to a more
balanced and sustainable path, along the line of the Third Plenum reform blueprint. Reforms
should aim at preventing further buildup of risks stemming from rapid credit growth and quasi-fiscal
spending, and move the economy to a more inclusive, environment-friendly, and sustainable growth
path. Giving the market a more decisive role, eliminating distortions, and strengthening institutions
will result in a more efficient use of resources, faster productivity growth, and rising living standards
across the income spectrum.
3.

Based on this assessment, teams identified the following reform areas as macro-critical:



Financial sector reforms. Further progress in financial sector reform is central to containing risks
and boosting growth by facilitating better allocation of resources. Widespread implicit
guarantees—of savers, intermediaries, and borrowers—and the cap on deposit rates distort the
pricing of risk and borrowing costs, resulting in misallocation of credit and inefficient
investment. Key measures in this area include deposit interest rate liberalization, stepped-up
supervision and regulation of the financial system, overhaul of the system of resolving failed financial
institutions, and the introduction of deposit insurance.



Fiscal reforms. Off-budget spending, in infrastructure but also in other areas, undertaken by localgovernment owned entities have led to a significant buildup of debt. Bringing these projects onbudget and strengthening control over public financial management will help control fiscal risks.
Improving the fiscal framework is a priority for the medium term, including strengthening budget
processes, data transparency, local government finances, and medium-term budget planning. Tax
reforms—many of them planned and some already partly in place or in pilot form—will promote
more efficient and inclusive growth. These reforms include extending the VAT to services,
improving the progressivity of the personal income tax, and implementing a property tax.



Reform of social safety nets. Further strengthening the pension and health insurance
systems—including by improving and expanding coverage—would have macro-benefits such as
reducing precautionary household savings. Addressing coverage issues in the Chinese health
system would further reduce incentives to save, and help develop China’s service sector. These
reforms should be done in a way that ensures the sustainability of the social security system,
including through parametric changes to the pension system and transferring the welfare and
legacy components to the budget.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



SOE reform. Reforms include opening up to full and fair competition activities currently
reserved to SOEs, properly pricing finance and other factor inputs, requiring adequate dividend
payments to the budget, and imposing hard budget constraints. Opening up the service sector
to more competition will also be critical for generating the productivity gains necessary to fuel
growth and for boosting household income, as services tend to be more labor intensive than
industry.



Green growth. Air pollution, water quality and supply, and issues such as desertification,
dependence on coal, and degradation of grasslands have social, health, and economic effects.
Underpricing of energy and inadequate consequences for pollution have worsened these effects
while contributing to China’s dependence on industry. Raising these factor costs to capture the cost
of externalities and investing in renewable energy will make growth more sustainable and inclusive.



Infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure has been a key driver of the Chinese economy,
particularly during the slowdown around the Global Financial Crisis. However, the rapid pace of
investment has in some cases left communities behind, and in other cases has led to excessive
investment in projects with relatively low social or financial returns. Filling in the gaps of investment
in social projects will make growth more inclusive while improving the overall social and financial
efficiency of infrastructure investment. Measures to improve the process of approving new
infrastructure projects will ensure that investments are focused in areas of the highest social return.

4.

The teams agreed to the following division of labor.



Financial sector reforms. The Bank is working with the authorities on the development of a
financial sector reform strategy. The Fund will continue to follow up on the recommendations of the
2011 FSAP and provide technical assistance to the Chinese authorities as needed.



Fiscal reforms. The Bank will continue its work with the Shanghai municipal government to transfer
technical assistance on Medium Term Expenditure Framework and debt sustainability analyses. The
Bank will also continue its work on expenditure and revenue policies and on fiscal management in
the context of its urbanization study, completed earlier in 2014. The Fund will continue its technical
cooperation on strengthening the fiscal framework and streamlining budgetary preparation. The
Fund will also continue to discuss the near- and medium-term implications of China’s fiscal stance
and policy choices on the broader economy as well as implications for global spillovers.



Social safety nets. The Bank will continue to work with the Chinese authorities on both parametric
and structural reforms to the Chinese pension system, with a view toward ensuring that the system
protects the most vulnerable, ensures a fair return on savings for all participants, and is financially
sustainable in the long term. The Fund will look at issues related to the balance between social
contributions and other revenue sources, as well as how social safety nets fit into the overall fiscal
and macroeconomic policy framework.



Green growth. The Bank’s focus on climate change and renewable energy in China will continue to
emphasize cutting-edge renewable energy technologies, scale-up of energy conservation and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

investments in energy efficiency, and green building policies (for heat and energy efficiency).
Engagements with a climate change focus will extend to expansion of distribution of electricity from
natural gas generation, analysis of carbon capture and storage potential, and development of carbon
markets. The Fund will continue to discuss options to capture the cost of externalities through the
use of fiscal policy such as better calibration of excise and other taxes. It is ready to provide
assistance on shifting the pricing and taxation of energy, and discussing the growth and fiscal
implications of such a shift.
5.

Teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macroeconomic structural
reform areas, as milestones are reached and at least on a semiannual basis.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic policies
and prospects in the context of the Article IV consultation and staff visits, and at least semiannually.

The following table lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs for June 2014–June 2015.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) partnership with the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
has grown in many ways since the PRC became a member of AsDB in March 1986. The PRC is AsDB’s
second largest shareholder among regional members and the third largest overall, as well as an
important middle-income country client. By the end of 2013, the PRC’s cumulative borrowing from
AsDB reached $27.8 billion with 204 loans for public sector projects. Of the total public sector loans,
52.7 percent was allocated to the transport sector, followed by agriculture and natural resources
(11.3 percent) and water and other municipal infrastructure services (11.3 percent), energy (11.0
percent), industry and trade (2.6 percent), finance (2.2 percent), and multisector (9.0 percent). Over
the past 26 years, AsDB has helped finance 37 private sector projects in the PRC totaling
$4.06 billion.
2.
AsDB also funds Technical Assistance for the PRC. By the end of 2013, AsDB had provided a
total of $419.1 million in grants for 727 technical assistance projects, consisting of $132.5 million for
preparing projects and $286.6 million for policy advice and capacity development.
3.
Overall, the PRC has demonstrated strong capabilities in implementing projects. The good
performance shows the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design,
implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for
development projects, particularly those proposed for external financing. Loan disbursement and
contract award performance is good.
4.
The PRC has demonstrated its strong partnership with AsDB by contributing to the Asian
Development Fund, establishing the $20 million PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation
Fund (the PRC Fund), and replenishing another $20 million to the PRC Fund. The PRC Fund—the first
fund established in AsDB by a developing member country—providing technical assistance projects
to support subregional cooperation initiatives, particularly Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) programs.
5.
The Asian Development Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011–15 was endorsed by
AsDB Board of Directors in May 2012. The CPS 2011–2015 is aligned with the priorities of the PRC’s
12th Five-Year Plan 2011–15 that intersect with those of AsDB’s long-term Strategy 2020, particularly
the redoubling of efforts to promote socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development.
The CPS reflects the PRC’s changing circumstances as a rapidly growing middle-income country with
increasing emphasis on innovation and value addition and South-South cooperation to underpin the
evolving AsDB-PRC partnership. The CPS is built on three strategic pillars: (i) inclusive growth,
(ii) environmentally sustainable growth, and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. It identifies

four priority sectors for country operations during the CPS period: (i) energy, (ii) natural resources
and agriculture, (iii) transport, and (iv) urban development. The sector selection reflects AsDB’s
comparative strengths and expertise through its longstanding operations in these sectors.
6.
Projected public sector lending in 2014–2016 will total about $4.13 billion, of which
32 percent will support the transport sector; 27 percent for agriculture, rural development, and
natural resource management; 30 percent for urban development, water supply, and sanitation
improvement; and 11 percent for the energy sector. Over 90 percent of the projects are located in the
western, central and north-eastern regions in line with the CPS’s priorities of promoting inclusive
growth and environmentally sustainable growth.
AsDB’s technical assistance will complement the lending program to improve the sector policy
environment, support governance and capacity development, and strengthen the knowledge base
and innovative features of lending operations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts and government finance statistics. Progress has been made in
meeting the SDDS standard, as most of data requirements are observed although several data
categories are compiled but not disseminated in accordance to the SDDS standard (for instance, the
GDP is compiled on a cumulative and not a discrete basis). Some planned improvements include
strengthening the data dissemination by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), and revising the
reporting codes and classification of BOP transactions to Balance of Payments Manual 6 by the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). For a fuller discussion planned improvements see
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/GDDS/SummaryReport.aspx?ctycode=CHN&catcode=s1)
Real Sector Statistics
2.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) compiles and disseminates annual GDP by activity in
current and constant prices (2010) and quarterly estimates of GDP. Both the annual accounts and
quarterly accounts are based on the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). The techniques
for deriving volume measures of GDP are not sound and need to be improved. GDP by expenditure
is compiled at current and constant prices, but the constant price estimates are not published. Data
on the levels of expenditure components of real GDP are not available on a quarterly basis.
Nevertheless, the NBS has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national
accounts data, the most important being improving the exhaustiveness of the GDP estimates by
activity. Further improvements are intended for both the annual and quarterly accounts, however, no
target dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of
the private sector, presents new problems for data collection and compilation. The ability to change
the data collection systems is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system.
3.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment indices are compiled with
the corresponding month of the previous year as a base period but, no chain-linked time series are
produced. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series.
4.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not comprehensive, and
are only available on a quarterly basis.
5.
In January 2001, the NBS began to publish a Laspeyres price index that provides a time
series for each January to December (with January each year = 100). This more accurately reflects
consumer spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food
declined). The number of survey items has been expanded to at least 600 for small cities and
counties and more for large and medium-size cities (e.g., 1800 for Beijing). The most recent weights
of the major CPI components were provided to the staff in 2006.

Government Finance Statistics
6.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude
spending associated with official external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary
funds are only provided annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains poor, mainly
because data are not classified by economic type. The authorities have indicated an intention to
begin collecting these data and to develop accrual based measures of fiscal performance over the
medium term while also strengthening the compilation of cash based GFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
7.
In recent years, improvements have been made in monetary and financial statistics.
However, the monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims on the
government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side. The reported net
foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate valuation effects and interest earnings
on foreign reserves. The PBC has also ceased to report separate data on central government
deposits in its balance sheet since April 2005 because the MOF no longer distinguishes between
central and other government deposit accounts. This change has led to breaks in data series of
monetary base and monetary aggregates.
8.
The April 2012 monetary and financial statistics mission made several recommendations for
improvements in monetary data compilation, leading to the PBC’s implementation of the
standardized report forms (SRFs). However, monetary data reporting in SRFs has not initiated by the
authorities due to ongoing issues related to instrument and sectoral classifications.
9.
The April 2012 monetary and financial statistics mission also discussed with the authorities
the possibility of expanding the data scope of FSIs to include encouraged FSIs for deposit-takers.
The authorities indicated that the work on the compilation of the encouraged FSI data is at an early
stage and, furthermore, they are working on adopting the Basel III at this stage and agreed to
consider the mission’s recommendations after the developmental work is completed for collecting
data under the Basel III.
External Sector Statistics
10.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The authorities continue their efforts to improve the coverage
of direct investment transactions in the balance of payments (BOP) and IIP statistics, and progress is
being made in developing these statistics. Since the International Transactions Reporting System is
the major data source for balance of payments (BOP) statistics, in order to ensure its smooth
operation, regular training programs for staff in the provincial offices of SAFE have been
recommended. In 2011, China commenced participation in the Coordinated Direct Investment
Survey (CDIS).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

11.
Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need to
strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation. In 2010, China started submitting total and
public external debt data for the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, a notable step
forward.

Data Standards and Quality
12.

China has participated in the General Data Dissemination System since April 2002, and the

metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) are regularly
updated.

Data Reporting to STA for Publications
13.
Despite improvements in reporting a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable
historical data are not available. Reporting of data to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag.
Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price,
industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS have improved substantially. No
long-term time series are available for the consumer and producer price indexes and industrial
production; rather the comparison is made each period with the same period of the previous year.
However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on wages, trade
volumes, or prices/unit values.
14.
China has reported general government cash-based budget data for 2003–09 following the
GFSM 2001 methodology for publication in the 2011 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
However, these data are limited, with no data provided on government transactions in expense,
assets, and liabilities. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and
grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure by
function is largely aligned with international best practice.
15.
Owing to source data issues, the authorities have not yet been able to report a GFSM 2001
Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the budgetary central government accounts on a
subannual basis. As a result, there are no fiscal data for China on the Principal Global Indicators
website.
16.
For reporting monetary data to the Fund, the authorities have not begun using SRFs.
Monetary data continue to be reported using the old format.
17.
The FSIs data currently posted on IMF’s website are available only for core indicators and on
an annual basis with data beginning from 2010. The April 2012 mission encouraged the authorities
to compile and report the FSI data with quarterly periodicity. The authorities agreed with the
improved periodicity for their FSI data, but indicated that they would prefer to move to semi-annual
reporting prior to compiling the quarterly data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

18.
The authorities have resumed reporting data on international reserves for publication in the
IFS. However, the monthly time series are now submitted every three months, instead of every
month. With regards to BOP and IIP data, the authorities started submitting quarterly data to STA
for publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOP data are available on
a quarterly basis starting in 2010 and IIP starting in 2011). Additionally, China participates in the
CDIS and data on inward investments are available for 2009 and 2010.
Data Dissemination to the Public
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing
and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector
indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series
(e.g., unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time
series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner.
Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are
published nine months or more after the end of the year. Nevertheless, in the case of BOP and
quarterly external debt data disseminated in QEDS, time lag is around four to seven months.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the People’s Republic of China
July 25, 2014

1.
This statement summarizes data releases since the staff report was finalized. The information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Real GDP growth was 7.5 percent (y/y) in the second quarter, up slightly from 7.4 percent in
Q1 and broadly in line with staff’s forecast. The contribution to growth from net exports turned
positive reflecting improving demand from U.S. and European markets. Investment also rose in Q2,
from a weak first quarter, similar to the pattern of recent years. Overall, growth in 2014 is on track
toward the authorities target of ‘around 7½ percent’, and staff’s growth forecast remains unchanged at

3.
Many high-frequency indicators point to a pickup in growth momentum in May-June,
although the property sector is still facing headwinds. Growth in value added of industry ticked up in
June, and that of fixed asset investment stabilized after declining steadily since last year. Retail sales growth
held up above 10 percent (y/y) and imports rose by 5½ percent, indicative of stabilizing domestic demand;
exports increased by 7 percent, after much weaker figures in early 2014. After decelerating for more than a
year, overall credit growth (‘total social financing’) increased in June, reflecting growth in both on-balance
sheet bank loans and ‘shadow banking’ activities. Growth in housing starts and sales, however, remained
negative, housing prices showed second straight decline for the first time since early 2012, and housing
investment growth is down sharply from last year.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with
the People’s Republic of China
On July 25, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the People’s Republic of China.
China’s economy is expected to grow at around 7½ percent this year. Domestic demand has been
moderating, reflecting slower investment and rising risks of a deeper adjustment in real estate
activity. However, measures taken by the authorities to support growth are expected to bring it in
line with the annual target of around 7½ percent. Consumption and the labor market are holding
up well, and the global recovery is expected to support activity going forward. Inflation is
forecast to remain below 3 percent.
Fiscal policy has been accommodative, with stimulus mainly through off-budget spending at the
local-government level. As of end-2013, general government debt is estimated to have risen to
close to 40 percent of GDP. Although credit growth is still rapid, it has decelerated considerably.
Growth in total social financing—a broad measure of funding to the private sector—decelerated
from 22 percent in May 2013 to 16 percent in May 2014. This coincided with a series of steps to
strengthen regulation and supervision—especially relating to shadow banking—and a rise in
interbank interest rates in the second half of last year, although much of it was subsequently
unwound earlier this year.
External imbalances have fallen, with the current account surplus declining to 1.9 percent of
GDP last year. The adjustment reflects the past Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
appreciation, weak global demand, worsening of terms of trade, and strong domestic investment.
On domestic rebalancing, while investment was the largest contributor to growth in 2013,
consumption growth has been robust, urban household income has been growing faster than
GDP, and the share of services in output and employment has been rising.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that heavy reliance on capital spending and credit has sustained rapid
growth, helped reduce external imbalances, and provided a welcome lift to the global economy.
However, declining efficiency of investment, a significant buildup of debt, income inequality
and environmental costs are threatening growth prospects. The challenge is to shift gears, reduce
the vulnerabilities that have built up, and transition to a more sustainable growth path. In this
regard, Directors welcomed China’s Third-Plenum reform blueprint and agreed that the
implementation of these reforms will help China achieve more balanced and inclusive growth.
Directors underscored the importance of strengthening the financial sector to safeguard stability
and improve the allocation of credit. Key reforms include further strengthening regulation and
supervision, freeing up bank deposit interest rates, increasing reliance on interest rates as an
instrument of monetary policy, and eliminating implicit guarantees across the financial and
corporate landscape. Directors also emphasized the need to reform state-owned enterprises with
the aim of leveling the playing field between the private and public sectors. This can be achieved
by opening up more sectors—particularly services—to competition, improving resource
allocation and financing, increasing dividend payments to the budget, and hardening budget
constraints.
Directors agreed that fiscal and social security reforms are needed to strengthen public finances,
boost consumption, and foster more inclusive growth. Key reforms include reordering local
government finances by better aligning local revenues with expenditure responsibilities and
strengthening the management of local government borrowing; reducing social security
contributions; and continuing to improve pension and health benefits. To ensure the
sustainability of public finances, this should be combined with reforms to the social security
system, shifting the legacy and welfare parts of pensions to the budget, improvements in the tax
system, and cuts to lower-priority spending.
Directors considered that demand management should focus on reducing vulnerabilities while
preventing growth from slowing too much. In particular, cutting off-budget spending, further
reining in credit expansion, and containing investment growth would help mitigate risks, but
would also affect growth. Nevertheless, Directors agreed that vulnerabilities have risen to the
point that containing them is a priority and broad-based stimulus should only be deployed if
growth risks slowing significantly below the authorities’ target. If such stimulus becomes
necessary, it should be applied through fiscal policy, on-budget, with measures aimed at
protecting the vulnerable and advancing reforms. Regarding the growth target for 2015, while
most Directors concurred that a range of 6½ to 7 percent would be consistent with the goal of
transitioning to a safer and more sustainable growth path, a few other Directors considered a
lower target more appropriate.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Taking note of the staff’s assessment that the renminbi remains moderately undervalued,
Directors agreed that a successful implementation of the reform blueprint will support continued
domestic and external rebalancing. Directors supported the authorities’ policy of moving toward
a more flexible, market-determined exchange rate, with no sustained, large, and asymmetric
intervention, which will allow greater degrees of freedom to monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to enhance data quality and encouraged them to make
further progress in this area, including by subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS).

Statement by Tao Zhang
Executive Director for the People’s Republic of China
July 25, 2014
On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank staff for their candid and thoughtful dialogue
held during the Article IV mission. I would also like to express my authorities’ appreciation of this
annual consultation with the Fund, which has been helpful in promoting a deeper understanding
of the issues facing the Chinese economy.
Notwithstanding strong external and domestic headwinds, the Chinese economy continued to
register solid growth, healthy labor market conditions, and subdued inflationary pressure, thanks
to the support of a stable monetary environment and the targeted easing measures
implemented. The banking sector also remains in good shape, and the financial supervisory and
regulatory framework—including oversight of off-balance sheet and interbank and nonbank
financing—has been strengthened further to ward off potential risks. Meanwhile, fiscal
indebtedness remains at a moderate level, with local fiscal disciplines tightened, while
differentiated policies, such as the housing mortgage policy, are enforced to safeguard the
stability of the real estate market. Overall, the Chinese economy is on track to meet the
7.5 percent growth target this year, and my authorities will continue to implement
macroeconomic policies in a forward-looking, targeted, and coordinated manner to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability.
At the same time, the Chinese economy continues to make progress on its structural adjustment
and reform agenda. Manifesting a rebalancing in the economy, the role of private consumption
and the tertiary sector in the economy continued to strengthen, while the current account
surplus remained subdued. Meanwhile, notable progress has been made in deepening reforms
along the lines of the Third Plenum reform blueprint, so as to give the market a decisive role in
resource allocation. By striking a fine balance between stabilizing growth, on one hand, and
adjusting the economic structure and promoting reforms, on the other, my authorities are
confident that the Chinese economy will be able to settle on a more sustainable and balanced
growth path, thus continuing to contribute to regional as well as global economic and financial
stability.
Recent economic developments
The macroeconomic environment remains stable. After experiencing some moderation amidst
the uncertain external environment, economic activities have stabilized recently on the back of
targeted supportive measures. In particular, real GDP growth picked up to 7.5 percent in Q2 from
7.4 percent in Q1, while growth in retail sales, industrial value-added, and infrastructure
investment strengthened respectively to 12.3, 8.9, and 25.7 percent from 12.0, 8.7, and
22.5 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, urban labor conditions continue to hold up well,
with demand for labor staying firm and the unemployment rate remaining stable. Looking ahead,

2
the purchasing managers’ index, particularly that for the service sector, indicated that the
Chinese economy will continue to grow at a stable pace in the near term. That said, my
authorities are vigilant to the downward pressures facing the economy, and will stand ready to
deploy targeted measures to support growth and the labor market as appropriate.
Inflationary pressures remain mild, with the year-on-year CPI inflation rate moderating to
2.3 percent in the first half of this year from 2.6 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, the producer price
inflation rate continued to stay in the negative territory, reflecting stable international
commodity prices and overcapacity in certain industries. While inflation has stayed subdued, my
authorities are vigilant to the price pressures stemming from agricultural products and rentals, as
well as from resource pricing reform. Thus, my authorities will continue to guide inflation
expectations so as to stabilize CPI inflation in 2014 at a rate of around 3.5 percent.
Fiscal policy
My authorities maintain a proactive fiscal policy stance in order to promote stable and inclusive
growth. Social spending continues to be prioritized, with spending on education, social security
employment, medical treatment, and health all registering robust growth in the first half of this
year, so as to improve social welfare and sustain the decline in income inequality. For 2014 as a
whole, my authorities set the budget deficit at about 2.1 percent of GDP, the same as the actual
deficit in 2013, and agree with staff that a major stimulus is not warranted.
Notwithstanding the pickup in local government indebtedness in recent years, my authorities’
comprehensive audit indicated that the overall government debt level remained controllable at
about 40 percent of GDP in mid-2013. In particular, the debt level remains comparatively
moderate, and debts were incurred mainly to support infrastructure and social welfare spending.
More importantly, the interest rate-growth differential and the government asset position of
China remain very favorable.
In view of the increased prominence of the activities of local government financing vehicles
(LGFVs) since the global financial crisis, my authorities have made devoted efforts in publishing
comprehensive data on local government indebtedness consistent with international standards.
Meanwhile, staff’s augmented estimates are subject to a high degree of imprecision, as staff had
made many simplifying assumptions—such as the inclusion of debt obligations of LGFV for
commercially viable ventures, which are neither part of government debt nor contingent
liabilities, into the estimates—so as to compile a time series of local government finance. Thus,
staff’s augmented estimates cannot reflect accurately the latest fiscal position and stance of
China, and could pose the risk of market misperceptions.
Having said all that, my authorities agree that local fiscal disciplines have to be tightened, and
have implemented a wide range of measures to improve the transparency and the sustainability
of local indebtedness, including: (1) changing the performance assessment criteria of local

3
governments; (2) enhancing private sector participation in infrastructure investment;
(3) incorporating local government debt in the budgetary process; and (4) implementing a trial
program to allow 10 local governments to issue their own bonds.
Going forward, my authorities will endeavor to establish an early warning system and adopt a
medium-term fiscal plan, in order to strengthen fiscal management. My authorities will also
continue to pursue fiscal reform in accordance with the Third Plenum blueprint, including better
aligning responsibilities between the central and local governments, and undertaking tax reform.
In this regard, my authorities aim to complete the value-added tax reform by the end of 2015,
and will steadily push forward reforms in other areas of taxation.
Monetary policy
Monetary conditions remain stable under a prudent monetary policy stance, with growth in M2
and RMB loans fluctuating at around 14.0 percent for most of the time since December 2013.
With strong policy efforts on improving the credit structure and achieving social and
development objectives, growth in lending to the rural sector and small and micro enterprises
both outpaced that of total lending, whereas growth in medium- and long-term lending to
industries with overcapacity declined. Meanwhile, the share of bank loan, bond, and equity
financing in total social financing has picked up, while interbank liquidity conditions have
remained largely stable, thanks to continued policy efforts on promoting direct financing,
tightening supervision of nonbank and interbank financings, and strengthening liquidity
management.
With strong determination to maintain a stable monetary and financial environment, my
authorities will continue to adjust credit and macroprudential policies to ensure reasonable
growth in money, credit, and social financing. In this regard, my authorities will recalibrate the
housing mortgage policy and other prudential measures as necessary which, together with the
ongoing urbanization and hukou reform, should help facilitate an orderly adjustment in the real
estate market. Meanwhile, my authorities will continue to monitor liquidity conditions closely and
conduct liquidity operations as needed, so as to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity.
While maintaining stable monetary conditions, my authorities continue to push forward marketbased interest rate reform. Lending rates are now fully liberalized, while caps on small amount
foreign currency deposit rates have recently been lifted in Shanghai, marking another step in
deposit rate liberalization. A self-regulatory pricing mechanism was established to ensure
discipline in pricing market interest rates, while the loan prime rate centralized quote and release
mechanism and the issuance and trading of interbank certificates of deposit were launched to
provide market-based references for pricing credit products and Shibor rates. My authorities will
build on the progress achieved to set up an effective market interest rate system and improve
the monetary policy framework and its transmission mechanisms.

4
Financial sector
The banking sector continues to perform well, registering sound capital level, stable return,
subdued nonperforming loan ratio, strong loan-loss provisioning, and—according to the latest
stress-testing results conducted by the CBRC—high resilience to adverse credit and
macroeconomic shocks. Meanwhile, regulatory prudence has been exercised to ensure
reasonable growth in nonbank financing to enhance market-based financial intermediation. In
this connection, my authorities would like to point out that staff’s assessment of shadow banking
has relied on the definition used by some market analysts, which is too broad and is not
consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s definition. Much of the shadow banking activities,
as analyzed by staff, involves little leverage and is placed under close supervision.
While the financial sector remains firm, my authorities continue to act preemptively to safeguard
financial stability. In this regard, a joint ministerial conference on financial regulatory
coordination was set up to provide a regular rule-based platform to promote coordination, while
new rules were issued to further tighten oversight of trust, wealth management products, and
interbank business. Credit risks of lending to local government financing platforms, the real
estate sector, and the overcapacity industry have also been monitored closely.
At the same time, my authorities continue to make progress on aligning the regulatory
framework with international standards. For instance, the overall capital regulatory regime was
assessed by the Basel Committee to be compliant with the Basel III capital requirements, while
the disclosure requirements for systemically important banks were enhanced. Financial reforms
also continue to proceed, as manifested by the proposed establishment of five privately-owned
banks to facilitate innovation and competition, and the permission to issue preferred stocks by
eligible listed and nonlisted companies to promote direct financing.
Going forward, my authorities will endeavor to establish a crisis management and resolution
framework, including setting up a deposit insurance scheme. These, coupled with the interest
rate reform and ongoing efforts to reduce moral hazard and implicit guarantees of financial
products, will help shift activity back to banks’ balance sheets and safeguard financial stability.
My authorities will also strengthen the oversight of internet financing to ensure that the industry
develops in a healthy and sustainable way to promote financial inclusion and innovation.
Meanwhile, my authorities will continue the reform in financial institutions (i.e., commercial banks,
policy banks, and asset management companies), while promoting capital market development
under the guidelines released in May—including the registration reform of the new share
offering system—so as to enhance the role of the market in allocating financial resources, thus
better serving the real economy.
External sector
The current account surplus narrowed further from 2.6 percent in 2012 to 2.0 percent of GDP in

5
2013, and further to 0.3 percent of GDP in the first quarter of this year, as structural changes
continue to proceed. Thanks to strong income growth, service imports continued to grow at a
vibrant pace, dragging the service trade balance alongside. Growth in good exports did not
register the same degree of resilience as growth in goods imports, in part reflecting the
increasing share of final consumption goods in total goods imports. Meanwhile, the RMB
exchange rate has become increasingly flexible, as more reform measures are in place. The daily
trading band of the RMB/USD exchange rate was widened further in March, leading to more
two-way movements as well as more divergent expectations of the rate since then. Banks have
also recently been permitted for the first time to set the RMB/USD exchange rate freely in overthe-counter transactions, so as to further strengthen the market-driven nature of the rate.
Looking ahead, the current account surplus is expected to remain moderate over the medium
term amidst robust income growth and rising demand for services, and my authorities will
continue to expedite reform of the exchange rate formation mechanism, in order to allow market
forces to play the decisive role in driving the two-way movement in the exchange rate.
Regarding the external sector assessment results, my authorities continue to have strong
concerns about the reliability and the soundness of the External Balance Assessment (EBA)
methodology, given: (1) the arbitrariness and the lack of transparency in the setting of norms of
policy and structural variables; (2) the continued presence of sizable unidentified factors in the
estimated current account gaps in many countries; and (3) the inadequate consideration of the
global implications of systemic economies’ monetary policies. Thus, we urge staff to strengthen
their efforts on improving the EBA methodology.
Capital account convertibility and cross-border use of the RMB continue to develop, with
investment quotas under the QDII, QFII, and RQFII schemes expanded, rules governing foreign
exchange transactions of multinational firms eased, and the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone and
the Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connectivity Mechanism established. My authorities will
accelerate the pace of capital account convertibility while, at the same time, monitoring crossborder capital flows closely against the backdrop of a volatile global monetary environment.
Structural reforms
Reflecting the continuation of structural rebalancing in the Chinese economy, the size of the
tertiary industry has exceeded that of the secondary industry since 2013. Meanwhile, labor
income growth—including growth in per capita disposable income of urban household, per
capita net income of rural household, and average monthly income of migrant workers—has
been vibrant. Against such backdrop, the share of private consumption in GDP has continued to
pick up over the past few years, with the growth contribution of final consumption expenditure
surpassing that of gross capital formation during the first half of this year.
Substantial progress has been made in implementing reforms in other areas covered in the Third
Plenum blueprint. Seeing the importance of urbanization and hukou reform in driving growth

6
and promoting welfare, my authorities have set out a comprehensive urbanization plan which
aims—in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner—to: (1) boost the urbanization
ratios; (2) enhance social benefits, including the coverage of social housing, pension, and health
in urban populations; and (3) implement hukou reform with reference to local circumstances.
Plans on reforming medical care and integrating rural and urban pension schemes have also
been announced. Meanwhile, my authorities have set up plans and measures to reduce energy
consumption, carbon dioxide emission, and air pollution, and have amended the Environmental
Protection Law in order to safeguard environmental sustainability. On the other hand, the onechild policy was eased in a number of provinces to counter the demographic pressure, while pilot
programs of judicial reform—including the establishment of special intellectual property rights
courts—have been approved to reform the court system and promote innovation. State-owned
enterprise (SOE) reform also proceeds steadily to promote fair competition, with the dividend
requirement for SOE enhanced, and some divestments of SOE made. By promoting structural
adjustment and pushing forward reforms while—at the same time—supporting growth stability,
my authorities are confident that China will transit smoothly to a sustainable, strong, and
balanced growth path, thus contributing to regional and global monetary and financial stability.
Finally, my authorities will continue to enhance data standards in China, including revising the
methodology of compiling GDP data in accordance with the System of National Accounts 2008,
and actively considering the subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standards and have
been working with STA to conduct technical preparation.
