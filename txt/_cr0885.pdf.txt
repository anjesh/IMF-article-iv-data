EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The Swazi economy has continued to register sluggish economic activity even as rising
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenue contributed to a large fiscal surplus
and accumulation of international reserves. Growth has averaged just over 2 percent in the
past six years as Swaziland struggles with drought, low productivity, erosion of preferential
treatment for sugar and textile exports, and mounting social challenges. SACU revenues
contributed to a record fiscal surplus in 2006/07, improved external accounts, and an increase in
international reserves to over three months of imports.

•

The authorities concurred with the staff that the medium-term outlook is subject to
several risks and adjustment is required to restore fiscal sustainability. Risks include
uncertainty about future SACU revenue, continued erosion of trade preferences, and
vulnerabilities from the unregulated nonbank institutions. A 6 percent of GDP increase in
expenditure in 2007/08 (with a parallel increase in the non-SACU fiscal deficit) is cause for
serious concern and, unless reversed, this expansionary fiscal path could undermine
macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Given the expected decline of SACU revenue
after 2010, the authorities should use the opportunity to reduce expenditures while improving
their quality.

•

To underscore the need for adjustment, staff proposed the use of the non-SACU fiscal
balance when assessing fiscal performance. The analysis helps put in context the current
overall fiscal surpluses and underscores domestic revenue efforts. Consequently, staff proposed
adjustments comprising revenue measures, expenditure cuts and reorientation, as well as
enhanced fiscal management.

•

Assessments of the real exchange rate and the current account suggest no immediate
threat to external stability. However, structural reforms and fiscal adjustment are needed to
maintain sufficient international reserves and support the peg under the CMA. Furthermore, the
authorities should transfer all government’s offshore deposits to the Central Bank’s balance
sheet.

•

The unchecked growth of insufficiently regulated saving and credit cooperatives poses
risks to the financial system. Prompt actions are required to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the nonbank financial sector.

•

Staff welcomes the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action
Program, and recommends that it be embedded within a fiscal framework that is consistent
with a prudent fiscal stance.

•

Further efforts are needed to improve the quality and timeliness of data to facilitate policy
formulation and monitoring.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The Swazi economy remains stagnant, registering very small gains in real per capita
GDP. Real GDP growth has slowed from an annual average of 3.6 percent in the 1990s to just over
190
2 percent in the past six years compared to an

Swaziland’s main exports, textile and sugar,
combined with declining competitiveness have

Years of persistently low growth has led to
stubbornly high poverty and unemployment. This 2

situation is made worse by the high prevalence of

HIV/AIDS, absenteeism from the labor force, and

low productivity. Swaziland continues to suffer
from recurrent droughts, which further exacerbate
the humanitarian situation and hamper growth (Figure 1).

Swaziland remains a constitutional monarchy. A new constitution took effect in
February 2006 and parliamentary elections are planned to take place in 2008, under the traditional
tinkhundla system—a grass roots system of local governments and chiefdoms. Political parties are
still not permitted, and cabinet members are appointed by the king.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
After a small rebound to 2.8 percent in 2006, real GDP growth is estimated to have
slowed to 2.3 percent because of drought and forest fires. Swaziland’s inflation rate typically
closely follows that of South Africa, but is estimated to have increased to an annual average of
8.3 percent in 2007 reflecting rising food and oil prices. Since June 2006, the Central Bank of
Swaziland (CBS) has increased its discount rate by 350 basis points to 11 percent in line with the
South Africa Reserve Bank, and issued securities to help reduce excess liquidity.

Rising SACU revenue contributed to a large fiscal surplus and accumulation of
international reserves. In 2006/07, SACU revenues rose by 9 percent of GDP to a record level of
27.5 percent of GDP. At the same time, spending fell short of budgeted amounts, because of the
nonapplication of the voluntary early retirement scheme for public servants and lower payments to
government’s pension fund; the overall fiscal surplus reached 10 percent of GDP.1 Despite stronger

import growth, the external current account deficit narrowed in 2007, owing to stronger demand for
Swaziland’s major export, soft drink concentrate, the extension of the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA), which benefited exports of textiles,2 and large SACU transfers.
International reserves recovered to an estimated 3.4 months of imports at end-2007 (Figure 2).
6.
The authorities have implemented some measures since the 2006 Article IV consultation,
but made limited progress on civil service reform. Budgetary control has improved, which has
yielded some results in controlling the fiscal arrears. Improvement of the public procurement system
has also started with assistance from Crown Agents, while the UNDP and the World Bank are
assisting in strengthening public financial management, including the revision of the Public Financial
Management Bill. The Revenue Authority Bill has been enacted, but the privatization program is
progressing slowly. Stalled civil service reform and—despite the ‘zero-growth’ policy—rising
employment and higher wage demands resulted in an escalation of the wage bill during the last four
years, which is among the highest in Africa.

Broad money has expanded sharply during the past two years, reflecting the rise in net
foreign assets. While credit to the government has declined, due to the surpluses arising from SACU
receipts, growth in lending to the private sector slowed only moderately from 22 percent in 2006 to
19 percent in 2007. Interest rates have risen in line with developments in South Africa, but the spread
between the lending and deposit rate increased to 4.2 percent.
8.
Banking soundness indicators are generally positive, but the deposit-taking Savings and
Credit Cooperative (SCCO) sector remains without effective supervision.3 Banks are well
capitalized, liquid and profitable with low nonperforming loans (Table 4). However, one bank
continues to have high nonperforming loans and face difficulties meeting compliance requirements.

Countries can only benefit from sourcing fabric from third countries through 2012.

See Selected Issues Paper. During the last few years, the SCCO sector has grown rapidly with over 40,000 members,
and deposits accounting for 10 percent of the banking system deposit (2 percent of GDP).

A few major SCCOs also face severe financial difficulties. Nevertheless, notable progress
has been made in establishing a framework for regulation and supervision of insurance and
pension funds.4 The new regulations require that all insurance and pension funds increase
their holdings of domestic assets from 10 to 30 percent of total assets in the next three years.
III. THE MEDIUM-TERM AND RISKS TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
9.
On current policies, medium-term prospects are not encouraging. Growth is
expected to average 2 percent in the medium term. Although supported by moderate activity
in the services sector and some improvement in manufacturing, growth prospects are also
seriously constrained by a weak investment climate and high cost of doing business,
recurrent droughts, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, inflation is expected to moderate
somewhat as food prices slowly return to normal. The continuation of higher SACU revenues
would contain the external current account deficit to around 2 percent of GDP through 2010.
10.

The medium-term outlook is subject to several risks:

•

SACU revenues are unlikely to remain high after 2010, putting fiscal
sustainability at risk. The downside risks include: (i) a call by South Africa to revisit
the revenue-sharing formula, resulting in possibly lower SACU shares for member
countries; (ii) the possible transformation of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) into a customs union by 2010, with possibly lower shares to
existing SACU members; and (iii) a slow down in South Africa’s economic growth and
the reduction in common external tariff rates due to trade liberalization. Hence, the
decline in SACU revenue may be even greater than that shown in the baseline;

•

The financial sector faces vulnerabilities. Continued weaknesses in one of the banks
as well as emerging vulnerabilities from the fast growth of insufficiently regulated
nonbank financial institutions pose significant risks to the financial sector; and

•

The external environment may also deteriorate further. Erosion of trade
preferences, particularly for sugar and textiles as well as increasing trade liberalization
could all adversely impact prospects in the external sector (see Selected Issues Paper).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

11.
Against the background of slow growth and significant medium-term risks,
discussions focused on preserving fiscal sustainability to ensure macroeconomic
stability; external stability and exchange rate policy; financial sector vulnerability; and
policies to reinvigorate private sector led growth.
4

These include: establishment of Insurance and Pension Funds Registrar’s Office; opening up of these markets
to foreign competition; and passage in December of the Insurance Regulations and Pension Fund Regulations.

11
A. Fiscal Sustainability and Reforms
12.
Staff expressed concern that increased SACU revenues have facilitated a sharp
fiscal expansion that could undermine macroeconomic stability in the medium term. In
2007/08 expenditures are budgeted to rise 6 percent of GDP to a record level of 37.6 of GDP,
with a parallel rise in the non-SACU fiscal deficit. Although this includes increased food
assistance in the wake of widespread drought and forest fires, staff noted that the bulk of the
expansion, funded by high SACU revenues, reflects a one percent of GDP increase in the
wage bill and higher capital spending. While noting that some spending could not be delayed
at this stage, the authorities indicated that capital expenditures may not be executed in full.
The medium-term budget policy through 2010/11 remains largely expansionary. Without
offsetting expenditure cuts to allow for additional spending on education, and agriculture and
health, staff estimates that total expenditures would rise to a record high of over 39 percent,
while the wage bill rises to over 15 percent of GDP. Even allowing for some expected
improvements in domestic revenue collections, the projected decline of SACU revenues
would result in a budget deterioration to a deficit of almost 7 percent of GDP by 2012/13.
13.
The staff discussed the usefulness of targeting a non-SACU fiscal balance when
assessing the fiscal performance. Concurring with staff’s assessment of the likely decline in
SACU revenues beyond 2010/11, the authorities welcomed the supplementary fiscal analysis
that helps put in context the current overall fiscal surpluses.5 The non-SACU deficit also
allows more focus on domestic revenue efforts while providing an anchor for fiscal savings
to help smooth-out expenditure over the long term. During 1996/97-2004/05, the non-SACU
fiscal deficit averaged about 16 percent of GDP based on SACU revenues of 13 percent of
GDP, but widened to 17.4 percent of GDP in

A proposed fiscal reform scenario targets a non-SACU deficit of 16 percent of
GDP based on ‘more normal’ SACU revenue of about 13 percent of GDP.6 The required
adjustment implied by this scenario could be attained by the phased implementation of a
package of revenue and spending measures, while still increasing pro-poor and HIV/AIDS
expenditures. This would also allow for fiscal surpluses that would be used to repay debt,
leading to a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The low debt level gives flexibility to the
authorities, if needed, to provide additional social spending through debt financing. These
measures, together with structural reforms, could gradually raise GDP growth to 3–4 percent
over the medium term (see Box 1). The authorities were generally receptive to staff’s
proposed adjustments, but also indicated that any expenditure cuts could be challenging
given this year’s election and the recent large fiscal surplus.

Strengthened public financial management is also needed to improve the quality
of spending. A new computerized commitment system is helping to reduce arrears
accumulation. However, not all expenditure items are linked with this system and some
manual payments orders remain, making the budgetary control process cumbersome. A good
start is being made in improving the procurement system. Staff welcomes the government’s
intention to strengthen the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and public finance
management. To support the transparency effort, the government should disseminate budget
and outturn information in addition to the fiscal policy statement.

At 16 percent of GDP, the non-SACU fiscal deficit did not create an unsustainable debt burden while allowing
for maintaining sufficient international reserves.

Box 1. Key Measures to Restore Fiscal Sustainability
In anticipation of SACU revenue decline after 2010/11 that would threaten fiscal sustainability, staff proposed the
following measures.
Revenue measures

Expenditure measures

Establish a large taxpayer unit by mid-2008 (0.01-0.3
percent of GDP).

Restore budget credibility, avoid supplementary budget and
eliminate unbudgeted expenditures and arrears

Implement the Revenue-Authority bill, and introduce
VAT within the following two years (0.1-1.5 percent of
GDP).

Strengthen expenditure management and procurement
system (0.3 – 0.9 percent of GDP).

Simplify the tax structure by eliminating some taxes that
are not productive and use staff resources to focus on
higher yield taxes.

Implement the voluntary exit retirement scheme, reallocate
resources to high priority sectors, and freeze hiring (0.8 – 1.8
percent of GDP).
Prioritize expenditures to support pro-poor and productive
projects.
Reduce excessive transportation and foreign travel (0.1 – 0.3
percent of GDP).
Accelerate implementation of privatization programs and
approve all pending bills (0.1 – 1.1 percent of GDP).
Reduce subsidies and transfers particularly through
improving the operations of the Central Transport
Administration (1.5 percent of GDP).

Source: Staff estimates

The revenue impact of these measures would be small initially but would increase to 2 percent of GDP by 2012/13.
Expenditure measures could realize savings of 6 percent of GDP by 2012/13. These measures together with
structural reforms aimed at facilitating private sector initiatives could generate GDP growth of 3-4 percent over the
medium term.

B. External Stability and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to maintain sufficient international
reserves to safeguard external stability that is underpinned by a prudent fiscal policy.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ policy of rebuilding international reserves through saving
some of the SACU windfalls. The authorities reconfirmed their intention to maintain reserves
of at least three months of imports.
18.
In light of the government’s holding of some SACU savings offshore, the staff
recommended that all government foreign deposits should be transferred to the CBS,
consistent with the constitution. During 2007 international reserves reached US$637
million of which US$102 million (about 16 percent of total international reserves) was held
offshore by the government. The staff expressed concerns about the absence of a proper
investment strategy to safeguard these assets against undue risks and urged their transfer to
the CBS balance sheet. The authorities were receptive to this recommendation.
19.
An updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows Swaziland has very low
debt levels, but these could rise significantly if the fiscal situation deteriorates (Tables 7
and 8). Since 2002, total public sector debt has declined, reflecting in part, an exchange rate
appreciation between 2003 and 2006, and limited new borrowing. Based on current fiscal
trends, particularly with respect to high SACU revenues, debt levels are expected to continue
to trend downwards, at least to 2010, reaching 11.4 percent of GDP. However, following the
expected decline in SACU revenues after 2010, the debt-to-GDP ratio will quickly rise to
20.5 percent by 2013.
20.
Assessments of the real exchange rate and the current account suggest no
immediate threat to external stability provided that necessary structural reforms and
fiscal policies are implemented to support the peg under the CMA. Staff analysis
suggests either no misalignment, or mild overvaluation of the real exchange rate (Box 2).
Staff shared the authorities’ view that the current exchange rate system should be maintained.
It facilitates capital and current transactions with South Africa, Swaziland’s most important
economic partner. Under the CMA, movements in the real effective exchange rate are largely
exogenously determined, and responsibility for macroeconomic stability rests squarely with
fiscal policy and pursuit of competitiveness through structural reforms.
21.
Prudent macroeconomic policies need to be complemented with competitivenessenhancing reforms to reduce the cost of doing business, and improve the quality of public
institutions. Impediments to investment include a lack of transparency; poor administrative
coordination; low labor productivity; and concerns of corruption.7 Key reforms should

15
include skills-training, increased labor-market flexibility; simplifying business licensing
procedures; improving infrastructures; and increasing land productivity. The authorities plan
to appoint a Commissioner to head the anticorruption agency by early 2008.
Box 2. Assessing Swaziland’s Real Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Swaziland’s current account is largely influenced by factors outside the country’s control. These
include SACU transfers, brand loyalty for Swaziland’s major export (soft drink concentrates) and
preferential trade arrangements (EU and AGOA) for exports of sugar and textiles.
However, appreciation of the rand,
130
Swaziland's Current Account (Percent of

South Africa's REER (2000=100, LHS)
120
fundamentals, could adversely affect
Swaziland’s competitiveness. Between
110
2002 and 2005 the rand appreciated by
65 percent in nominal terms and
100
Swaziland’s REER appreciated by
Swaziland's REER (2000=100, LHS)
30 percent. Although mitigated by
90
preferential trade arrangements, these
80
sizable appreciations lowered growth of
sugar exports, while the depreciation in
70
2006 has boosted sugar exports. On the
other hand, exports of textiles have
60
stagnated and declined in 2006 despite the
depreciation, with factory closures and loss of almost 50 percent of the workforce since 2004.

Against this background, various CGER and non-CGER approaches are used to assess the level of the
REER and sustainability of the current account.
The external sustainability approach (ES) under the baseline scenario indicates that the current account
norm (a deficit of 1.8 percent GDP)—the current account balance that would stabilize the ratio of net
international investment position (NIIP) to GDP at the 2006 level—would be stronger than the projected
current account deficit in 2012 (3.8 percent of GDP), suggesting an overvaluation.
Stabilizing the NIIP (under the ES approach) at a level prior to the large SACU windfalls since 2002,
consistent with an underlying current account that is purged of SACU windfalls, will result in a much
weaker current account norm (a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP). Since this is identical to the projected
current account in 2012 under the baseline scenario, it suggests no misalignment of the exchange rate.
However, if the current account deteriorates faster than projected under the baseline scenario, the external
position becomes unsustainable, consistent with the sensitivity tests in the external DSA (Figure 7).
The absolute version of the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach suggests that the lilangeni’s REER was
undervalued by some 65 percent in 2006, but with a margin of error larger than this undervaluation.
However, structural measures of competitiveness indicate that Swaziland has a weak competitiveness
position in a number of areas (Figure 4).

C. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities and Financial Deepening
22.
The authorities have taken a number of steps to address bank compliance, but agreed
that unsupervised SCCOs pose significant risks to the financial system. A recent on-site
inspection prompted the CBS to require that the problem bank hire a new auditor to undertake a
system audit by end-2007 and propose remedial actions. The entire board of directors of the bank has
also been replaced. Furthermore, the government owned bank, SwaziBank, is on a list for fast track
privatization and the bank is looking for a strategic partner to develop its retail business. Staff
recommends that prior to privatization, SwaziBank’s development and commercial banking activities
be separated, and the former combined with the operations of other government-owned development
finance institutions. The authorities indicated that they will assess the feasibility of this proposal
particularly given that these institutions have other shareholders.
23.
Progress in supervision of SCCOs has been hampered by continued capacity constraints
at the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives (MoAC), the supervisory agency for SCCOs,
as well as a legal impasse that prevents the CBS from taking over the supervision of the
SCCOs. In the meantime, the public are aware that a few of the SCCOs are in serious financial
difficulties, which could undermine confidence in the sector.8 Upon resolution of the legal impasse,
MCM is ready to provide further TA.
24.
The staff noted that although prudential indicators are generally positive, the continued
strong growth and concentration of credit calls for close scrutiny of banks’ loan portfolios. The
staff expressed its concerns over the banking sector exposure to sugar-related industry (70 percent of
loans) in light of the declining preferential treatment for the sector and rising interest rates. The
authorities explained that banks are in compliance with exposure limits, and are closely monitoring
these practices. Furthermore, the CBS is tightening loan provisioning requirements.
25.
Further risks to the financial sector stem from the delayed enactment of some important
financial sector legislation. The staff urged the authorities to expedite the passage of the Securities
bill (1993); the Financial Services and Regulatory Authority bill (FSRA, 2003) that aims to supervise
the consolidated nonbank financial institutions; and the National Clearing and Settlement Systems
bill 2004.

8

As of end-2006, these SCCOs hold deposits of about 4 percent of commercial banks’ deposits (1 percent of GDP) and
involve about 20,000 members or half of the total membership.

D. Fostering Growth Acceleration and Poverty Reduction
26.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiative to address poverty through the implementation
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Program (PRSAP), and efforts at addressing
food security (Box 3). In addition, staff stressed the need to accelerate growth through structural
reform measures (see paragraph 21). The authorities concurred with staff’s view that the on-going
development of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP)—a strategy for implementation of the
PRSAP—should be consistent with the Medium-Term Budget Policy, and eventually the MTEF.
Given frequent droughts and declining land productivity, staff welcomed efforts at improving yields
through various irrigation programs, and improving the distribution of food. The authorities’ draft
Comprehensive Agricultural Strategy also allows for specific implementation plans and schedules for
addressing the food security situation.
27.
HIV/AIDS remains a major challenge to overcoming poverty. In this context, the recent
award of $81 million (or 3 percent of GDP) by the Global Fund to the National Emergency Response
Council on HIV/AIDS (NERCHA) to help fight aids is welcome. Staff noted that government’s
commitment to take over full funding of jobs in the health sector beyond 2012 when the funding is
fully exhausted again underlines the importance of attaining fiscal savings elsewhere and developing
an MTEF. Additional assistance from the World Bank and donors to fight this and other diseases is
welcome.
Box 3. The PRSAP
The PRSAP, approved by the cabinet in September 2007, represents the first such strategy since the
establishment of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Task Force in 2000. It has been the outcome of a wide
consultative process with strategies and specific actions for poverty reduction for the next 10 years. The
goal is to reduce poverty by more than 50 percent by 2015 and absolutely eradicate it by 2022.
It is based on six pillars:
•

Macroeconomic stability and accelerated economic growth based on broad participation;

•

Empowering the poor to generate income and reduce inequalities;

•

Fair distribution of the benefits of growth through fiscal policy;

•

Human capital development;

•

Improving the quality of life for the poor; and

•

Improving governance and strengthening institutions.

Detailed policies and actions are specified under each pillar. However, the costing exercise is on going
under the ERP. To support the implementation of the PRSAP, the authorities plan to increase the
budgetary allocation by an additional 3 to 7 percent of expenditure to the health, agriculture, and
education sectors.

20
E. Technical Assistance and Addressing Weaknesses in Statistics
28.
Swaziland has received a significant amount of technical assistance (TA) in all areas of
the Fund’s expertise, but the implementation of TA recommendations is uneven reflecting both
capacity limitations and unclear commitment to effective use of TA. Progress has been made in bank
supervision, the regulatory framework for the insurance and pension funds, reserve management, and
the payment system. However, implementation of recommendations in revenue administration,
nonbank financial supervision, and AML/CFT have been delayed. Much remains to be done with
regards to national accounts, balance of payments, and trade statistics.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Swaziland’s economic performance has continued to lag behind the gains in most lower
middle income countries. Adverse developments, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a loss of trade
preferences and recurrent droughts, have contributed to slow growth and increasing poverty.
However, the current high levels of SACU revenue provide a window of opportunity to accelerate
overdue reforms and address impediments to higher growth.
30.
Fiscal policy should be geared to safeguarding priority spending and fiscal sustainability
given an expected decline in SACU revenues after 2010. Hence, a focus on the deficit excluding
SACU revenues, coupled with a prudent assessment of the risk to these revenues over the medium
term, highlights the nature of adjustment needed to ensure fiscal sustainability while smoothing
expenditure over the longer term. The recent enactment of the Revenue Authority bill is a welcome
step in enhancing domestic revenue collection. The authorities should also improve revenue
administration and introduce the VAT, which could yield significant resources in time to substitute
for the anticipated decline in SACU revenues.
31.
However, the burden of the required fiscal adjustment falls primarily on spending
reductions. In this context, the sharp increase in expenditure (mirrored by a 6 percent of GDP
increase in the non-SACU fiscal deficit) in 2007/08 is of serious concern and needs to be reversed
over the medium term. In addition, steps need to be taken to increase pro-poor spending and improve
the productivity of expenditure. Welcome steps to improve budget management through expenditure
monitoring should be supported by more vigorous implementation of the recommendations of the
World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review and strengthening the MTEF to enhance planning and
budget credibility. The authorities need to produce tangible results in civil service reform strategy,
approved in 2005, and reduce excessive expenditures on such items as travel and transportation, and
unproductive transfers. Faster privatization will also provide additional fiscal space for addressing the
much needed social programs while helping to improve the environment for private sector
development.
32.
Staff commends the authorities’ effort in rebuilding international reserves to support
the confidence in the peg. However, the recent build up of government deposits in banks outside
Swaziland is a cause for concern. The staff therefore urges the authorities to transfer management of
all government foreign deposits to the CBS, as mandated by the constitution.

21
33.
The staff considers that the lilangeni’s peg to the rand has served the country well. The
fixed exchange rate is underpinned by close economic integration with South Africa. An exchange
rate assessment suggests either no misalignment or a mild overvaluation. However, maintenance of
current policies will weaken Swaziland’s net external position, thus threatening the peg. As such, a
medium-term policy for fiscal sustainability needs to be accompanied by structural reforms to
strengthen competitiveness and support the peg under the CMA.
34.
To improve competitiveness, the authorities should accelerate structural reforms and
measures to improve the investment climate and reduce the cost of doing business. Key
measures include operationalizing the anticorruption commission; reducing labor market rigidities;
simplifying business licensing requirements and procedures; and land reform that would help
increase agricultural productivity.
35.
Staff supports the authorities’ effort to press for more timely compliance of all banks
with prudential regulations and improve the supervision of SCCOs. In view of high
nonperforming loans of the one bank, staff welcomes the system audit of the bank’s accounts and
further remedial actions. The rapid growth of the SCCOs, the severe financial difficulties of some,
and recent increases in interest rates pose serious risks to the financial system. The authorities should
therefore quickly resolve the legal impasse that has prevented the CBS from taking over the
supervision of the SCCOs, and secure passage of the FSRA bill.
36.
Staff welcomes progress in development of a framework for insurance and pension
funds. However, the authorities should exercise caution in enforcing the domestic investment
requirement as it could unduly expose investors to risk of low or negative returns due to lack of
profitable domestic investment opportunities. The passage of the Securities bill will further deepen
domestic capital markets, adding momentum to continuing reforms in the area of insurance and
pension funds.
37.
The authorities’ poverty reduction growth strategy and accelerated efforts at addressing
the HIV/AIDS epidemic and food security are welcome. To enhance economic growth and sustain
it, however, greater efforts are needed to ensure that the PRSAP is costed out within a MTEF that
ensures macroeconomic stability.
38.
Further efforts are needed to improve the quality and timeliness of data to better
facilitate policy formulation and monitoring.
39.

SACU: Southern African Customs Union. SACU transfers in the current account does not reflect the true level of SACU revenue because of the particula
treatment of those transfers in the accounts where the authorities make an estimate based on the level of imports and adjust in 'other investment' to refle

For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6
Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2
The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and

The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4
The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

II. SWAZILAND: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 2007)

Since 1962, the World Bank has financed projects in Swaziland in several areas including
roads, power, water supply, industrial development, agriculture, education and urban
development. Cumulative commitments to date amount to $105 million for twelve IBRD
loans and $8 million for two IDA credits.
World Bank’s engagement in Swaziland over the last decade has been fairly limited with
only a single loan for an Urban Development Project (US$29 million) which closed in
March 2005, achieving its development objectives despite long preparation and
implementation delays. Recent assistance has focused on providing policy advice and
conducting a range of economic and sector work (ESW). Some recent key pieces of work
have included a Public Expenditure Review and Basic Education Review in 2006,
Investment Climate Assessment in 2007 and support to fight against HIV/AIDS through an
Institutional Development Grant. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to
strengthen public expenditure management and macro-economic analysis and has recently
launch a Post-Basic Education and Training Sector Study. Finally, the Bank manages Cities
Alliance fund for slum upgrading and housing finance activities.
In view of increased interest from the authorities to partner with the Bank Group, the Bank is
currently preparing an Interim Strategy that will mark the first country strategy for Swaziland
since 1994. The Interim Strategy will provide a framework for Bank’s activities in Swaziland
focusing on three strategic areas: (i) Fighting HIV/AIDS; (ii) Improving governance; and
(iii) Increasing competition. To implement the strategy the Bank will use a combination of
instruments including IBRD loans, grants, ESW and technical assistance. The two proposed
IBRD loans are a follow-on to the Urban Development Project—a Local Government project
($20 million, Board in Q4 FY08)— and an HIV/AIDS operation (FY09) where the Bank is
looking for ways to soften the IBRD terms, possibly through a blending arrangement. The
proposed Interim Strategy will cover a period of 24 months and will be presented to the
Board of Executive Director towards the end of March 2008.
IFC: The committed portfolio in Swaziland amounts to $5.32 million with three operations in
manufacturing. IFC’s top client is Swazi Paper with $4.15 million.
MIGA: MIGA has one project in Swaziland which involves the construction and operation of
electricity transmission lines that will interconnect South Africa, Swaziland, and
Mozambique. This is MIGA's first project in Swaziland, for which it has provided coverage
to South African investors against the risks of expropriation and war and civil disturbance.
As of October 2007, MIGA’s gross exposure was $36.7 million.

7
III. SWAZILAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, staff’s analysis was
affected by shortcomings in certain areas, including national accounts and external sector.
The authorities provide available data to the Fund with a lag of 1 to 2 months, except for the
national accounts and international trade data, which are reported irregularly.
GDDS metadata for Swaziland were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on February 11, 2003. The metadata for all sectors except the financial sector were
updated in October 2005. Swaziland has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the
development of its national statistical system and participates in the GDDS Project for
Anglophone African Countries. Under this project (funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID), Swaziland is participating in the national accounts and
the monetary and financial statistics modules with the Fund, and in the labor statistics and
agricultural statistics with the World Bank.
Real sector data
STA GDDS missions have resulted in significant improvements in the national accounts.
Current and constant price (base=2000) GDP estimates are now available from both the
production and expenditure approaches. Unfortunately, these new estimates have not yet
been published, as there are still some shortcomings concerning the treatment of SACU
revenue. For national accounts data, AFR missions rely on estimates provided by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO). The authorities are planning the first labor force survey with support
from the World Bank/GDDS project.
Prices
The consumer price index (CPI) was significantly revised in May 2007. The dissemination of
the new consumer price index is a significant milestone for the CSO with technical assistance
provided in the context of the GDDS initiative. Four new geographical indices, as well as a
national index, with updated market basket weights, are now available. These new consumer
price indices incorporate improvements in compilation methodology, market basket
coverage, flexibility for introducing new pricing outlets and new varieties of products, and
enhanced processing capabilities. Monthly consumer price data are published by the CSO
with a one-month lag. For International Financial Statistics (IFS) purposes, the consumer
price index is reported at the national level for the all-income group.
Government finance statistics
Fiscal data are provided to AFR staff only during missions and/or following budget
announcements. The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) reports fiscal data on central
government operations to STA for publication in IFS and the GFS Yearbook on an irregular
basis and with significant lags–the latest data are for 2003. Data on transactions in financial
assets and liabilities are not reported. A June 2003 mission reviewed GFS compilation and
introduced the GFSM 2001 framework. An October 2003 mission made recommendations to

8
improve the coverage, classification and consistency of fiscal statistics. A June GFS 2004
mission further developed the bridge tables and derivation tables used to compile GFS,
assisted in the reconciliation of the fiscal and monetary accounts, and made
recommendations concerning these topics, as well as extra budgetary accounts, the MOF
Economic Classification Spreadsheet, budget classification, and data dissemination.
Monetary statistics
The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to
STA regularly, although the timeliness of data could be improved. The 2006 MFS mission
noted that substantial improvements were achieved, particularly in the data for the CBS. In
contrast, the mission found that, even though some progress had been made in the reporting
of data of other depository corporations (ODCs), quality problems remained. The majority of
the ODCs reported various degrees of difficulty in providing accurate data to the CBS. The
mission recommended that the CBS arrange regular meetings with the ODCs to promote
improved classification and sectorization. Furthermore, the institutional coverage of the
depository corporations’ survey is limited, as it covers only the CBS and the commercial
banks. Recently the CBS has started to include the Swaziland Building Society into the
monetary data backdated to December 2006. The credit and savings cooperatives,
representing about 12 percent and 8 percent of the deposits of the commercial banks,
respectively, are still outside the deposit corporations survey. A recent MFS mission
discussed the proper treatment of pension funds and insurance companies in the financial
survey.
Balance of payments statistics
The CSO publishes data on foreign trade on a quarterly basis, but the lack of sufficient
computer resources results in long lags in the production of trade data, especially regarding
imports. AFR missions use trade data provided by the CBS. The CBS publishes balance of
payments statistics on a half-yearly and annual basis. It now adheres to a methodology
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Shortcomings in the
timeliness and availability of data need to be addressed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
the Kingdom of Swaziland
On February 6, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Swaziland.1

Background
The Swazi economy remains stagnant. Real GDP growth has averaged just over 2 percent in
the past six years. Per capita GDP growth is lagging behind other members of the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU), and low and lower-middle income countries. The slow pace of
economic reforms has worsened the investment climate, and the erosion of preferential
treatment for Swaziland’s exports of textile and sugar, combined with declining competitiveness
and weak institutional capacity have further contributed to the weakened output performance.
Years of persistently low growth have led to stubbornly high poverty, inequality and
unemployment, and Swaziland has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
High SACU revenue contributed to a record fiscal surplus and accumulation of international
reserves to 3.4 months of imports. Despite stronger import growth, the external current account
deficit narrowed in 2007, owing to stronger demand for Swaziland’s major export, soft drink
concentrate, the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which benefited
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
exports of textiles, and higher SACU transfers. Inflation has risen sharply since 2006 reflecting
rising food and oil prices.
Broad money has expanded sharply during the past two years, mainly reflecting the rise in net
foreign assets of the banking system. While credit to the government has declined, due to the
surpluses arising from SACU receipts, growth in lending to the private sector slowed only
moderately from 22 percent in 2006 to 19 percent in 2007.
The outlook is subject to several risks arising out of the uncertainty surrounding SACU
revenues, the external environment and emerging financial sector vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed concern that Swaziland’s economic growth continues to lag
behind that of most other lower middle income countries. Directors recognized that the
HIV/AIDS epidemic, the erosion of trade preferences, and recurrent droughts, have adversely
affected economic performance. Against this challenging background, Directors encouraged the
authorities to use the window of opportunity provided by the current high levels of revenues
from the SACU to accelerate reforms aimed at securing macroeconomic stability and
addressing impediments to higher growth and poverty reduction.
Directors emphasized the need to ensure fiscal sustainability and safeguard priority spending
given the expected decline in SACU revenues after 2010. They recommended that in setting
fiscal policy, the authorities focus on a measure of the fiscal deficit that excludes SACU
revenues, as this would help to highlight the scale of the needed adjustment and smooth
expenditure over the longer term.
Directors considered that the burden of the fiscal adjustment would have to fall primarily on
spending, and in this context, expressed concern about the sharp increase in expenditures in
2007/08. Directors stressed the importance of civil service reform and reorienting spending to
priority areas. They also noted that privatization of enterprises that are currently a burden on the
budget could provide additional fiscal space for much-needed social programs, while improving
the environment for private sector development. Directors welcomed the ongoing effort to
improve expenditure monitoring and strengthen the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework,
which would enhance budget planning and transparency, and protect pro-growth and pro-poor
spending. They encouraged the authorities to implement the recommendations of the World
Bank’s public expenditure review. Directors recommended that expenditure savings be
complemented, over time, by improvements in revenue administration and the implementation
of a package of revenue measures, including the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT).
Directors agreed that Swaziland’s monetary and exchange rate regime has served the country
well. The fixed rate of the lilangeni to the South African rand under the Common Monetary Area
is underpinned by close economic integration with South Africa. To safeguard Swaziland’s net

3
external position and the currency peg, Directors stressed the need to supplement the mediumterm policy for fiscal sustainability with structural reforms to improve the business environment
and strengthen competitiveness.
Directors commended the authorities’ effort in rebuilding international reserves to support
confidence in the peg. Noting the recent buildup of government deposits in banks outside
Swaziland, they advised the transfer of all government foreign currency deposits to the Central
Bank of Swaziland.
Directors welcomed the progress made in strengthening commercial bank supervision, while
encouraging continued efforts to ensure timely compliance by all banks with prudential
regulations. Directors noted the importance of strengthening supervision of the savings and
credit cooperative sector, which has been growing rapidly. Timely passage of pending
legislation aimed at improving supervision of the financial system would be important in this
connection.
Directors commended the authorities for the steps taken to develop a framework for insurance
and pension funds. At the same time, they advised the authorities to exercise caution in
enforcing the domestic investment requirement, as it could expose investors to the risk of low or
negative returns due to the limited number of domestic investment opportunities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy and action program (PRSAP),
and their accelerated efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic and food security situation.
They stressed that effective implementation would require greater efforts to ensure that the
PRSAP is consistent with a medium-term expenditure framework that supports macroeconomic
stability, and perseverance with growth-enhancing and employment-creating reforms. Directors
noted that, to address the challenges ahead, Swaziland would need international support, which
should be grounded on decisive action on policy reform by the authorities.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for the Kingdom of Swaziland
and Rachel Gesami, Advisor to Executive Director
February 6, 2008
1.
I thank staff for their productive dialogue with the Swazi authorities and the balanced
set of papers, which outline opportunities and challenges facing Swaziland, and provide
helpful policy recommendations. The Swaziland authorities appreciate continued Fund
engagement and thank the IMF Executive Board and Management for policy advice extended
over the years and the continued support for their efforts to overcome the many challenges
facing their economy.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
Swaziland’s economic performance has been positive in several areas, but overall
achievements are behind the gains made in most lower middle-income countries. A modest
rebound in growth of 2.8 percent in 2006 has been difficult to sustain because of several
external constraints, including unfavorable weather conditions and limited export outlets for
sugar and textiles. Inflation rate, estimated to have increased to an annual average rate of 8.3
percent in 2007, reflecting rising food and oil prices, has been curtailed by the Central Bank
of Swaziland (CBS) through increase in its discount rate and issuance of securities to reduce
excess liquidity and lessen demand pressures on the general price level. Credit to government
declined, while lending to the private sector slowed only moderately as interest rates rose in
line with developments in South Africa, with the spread between lending and deposit rates
increasing. Banking soundness indicators have been positive, while banks are generally well
capitalized, liquid and profitable, with low nonperforming loans. Savings and Credit
Cooperative (SCCO) sector had not been effectively supervised, but the monetary authority
is strengthening supervision. Increased SACU revenues contributed to a record fiscal surplus
in 2006/07; external accounts improved, while official international reserves rose to a level
that could cover three months of imports.
3.
Swaziland has been facing difficulties attracting foreign direct investments most of
which has gone to more competitive destinations within the region. These adverse factors and
insufficient economic growth have aggravated the unemployment situation and poverty. The
classification of Swaziland as a middle-income country adds yet another dimension that has
contributed to depriving the country of concessional resources to fight HIV/AIDS and reduce
poverty.
4.
The challenges not withstanding, the authorities have embarked on reforms outlined
in their Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Program (PRSAP) aimed at enhancing robust
economic growth to levels comparable to those experienced by other countries in the region.
They are fully aware that the process of reform implementation requires resoluteness on their
part. To this end, they are committed to seeing the reforms through with a view to alleviating
poverty, sustaining the fight against HIV/AIDS pandemic, creating employment, tackling the

2
food security problem, ensuring sound public expenditure management and diversification of
revenue sources. The current high levels of SACU revenue also provide a window of
opportunity to accelerate overdue reforms and address impediments to higher growth.
Fiscal Developments
5.
The authorities recognize the importance of pursuing a prudent fiscal policy,
supported by structural reforms, as the main instrument to restoring macroeconomic stability
and engendering sustained economic growth. Increased fiscal outlays in 2007/2008 have
been made to address the problems of HIV/AIDS pandemic, worsening social indicators, and
deepening poverty. In order to get value for expenditures incurred, the budget process has reestablished expenditure controls and fiscal sustainability through the introduction of a
computerized commitment system, improvement of the procurement system and support of
the reform of public enterprises. High SACU revenues also provide a window of opportunity
to undertake much needed fiscal reforms.
6.
The authorities plan to focus on reducing the fiscal deficit excluding SACU revenues,
and on assessment of likely revenues flows over the medium term. This approach would help
the adjustment needed to ensure fiscal sustainability and smoothen expenditure over the
longer term. The Revenue Authority Bill is expected to facilitate improvements in revenue
collection. The authorities also intend to improve revenue administration and introduce the
VAT to sustain revenue yields in view of anticipated decline in SACU revenues.
7.
The authorities are committed to implementing civil service reforms, including
reduction in the wage bill, starting with voluntary retirement program, elimination of arrears,
and reduction of overall recurrent expenditure. They however, are aware of strains involved
in implementation of the proposed civil service reform, such as the dilemma of right sizing
the civil service in a relatively weak economic environment, with high unemployment. The
authorities had initially offered a voluntary separation package to civil servants who were
over 55 years of age, but the response had been very disappointing. Of particular concern is
how to develop the appropriate safety nets to mitigate the adverse effects of the envisaged
civil service rightsizing. Adequate social safety nets, to accommodate the vulnerable groups,
are to be provided for in carrying out the reform.
8.
The authorities consider that in order to enhance sustainable economic growth,
greater efforts are needed to ensure that the PRSAP is costed within a MTEF in a manner that
ensures macroeconomic stability. They recognize the increasing challenges, especially in the
medium to long term, of meeting the health needs of its youthful population. In an effort to
revitalize the health sector, they have embarked on a comprehensive review of the health
sector budget to incorporate new challenges and begin a process of zero-based budgeting.
This effort is being supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), and includes
developing a strategic plan for the entire health sector, undertaking a service mapping
exercise for the sector, and strengthening the legislative framework and health management
systems. The authorities seek further international support to implement this ambitious health
sector reform program and to effectively deal with the emergence of new diseases.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Developments
9.
The monetary authority remains committed to strengthening and maintaining a
healthy financial sector. In this regard, the Central Bank of Swaziland is pressing for more
timely compliance of all banks with prudential regulations, improvement of the supervision
of Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCOs), and securing of passage of the Financial
Services and Regulatory Authority Bill. In addition, the authority is reviewing its legal
structure and modernizing its operations with Fund support in a number of areas, including
improving reserve management, dealing with anti-money laundering and strengthening
banking supervision.
10.
Banking soundness indicators are positive, while banks are well capitalized, liquid
and profitable, with low nonperforming loans. However, the government-owned Swazi Bank
continues to have high nonperforming loans and faces difficulties meeting compliance
requirements. A few major SCCOs also face severe financial difficulties. Nevertheless,
notable progress has been made in establishing a framework for regulation and supervision of
banks and insurance and pension funds. The authority has introduced new regulations that
require all insurance and pension funds to increase their holdings of domestic assets from 10
to 30 percent of total assets in the next three years. The authority continues to foster
cooperation and monetary integration at the regional level and remains fully committed to the
ideals of the Common Monetary Area as a means to anchor price stability and promote
economic growth in the country. It recognizes the need to strengthen its obligation to the
exchange rate peg through steady accumulation of international reserves. The Central Bank
of Swaziland, supported by the government, has continued to focus on further promoting
financial sector soundness and exchange rate stability by increasing the country’s
international reserve position.
Structural Issues
11.
The authorities acknowledge the need to significantly improve the investment climate
and enhance competitiveness, through acceleration of structural reforms and reduction of the
cost of doing business. Other measures receiving attention include operationalizing the
anticorruption commission; reducing labor market rigidities; simplifying business licensing
requirements and procedures; and carrying out land reform that would help increase
agricultural productivity. Recent changes in the global trading regime for textiles and sugar
have undermined smaller and less competitive economies like Swaziland by reducing their
market share and contributing to higher unemployment. Nevertheless, the authorities believe
that the continued harmonious industrial climate, the country’s good infrastructure, and
proximity to markets, and a relatively well-educated labor force, augurs well for future
investment inflows. They are committed to improving the business environment further.
12.
The process of transforming the economy will be anchored on implementing a
number of structural reforms, perseverance with sound macroeconomic management,
improvement of competitiveness and development and implementation of a new set of
investment incentives that are budget neutral. This effort will be bolstered by the attraction of
foreign investors, while developing an indigenous entrepreneurial class of Small and Medium

4
Sized Entrepreneurs (SMEs). The government is committed to supporting this effort through
clearing of domestic arrears and expediting payments to private sector suppliers of goods and
services. The government together with its SACU counterparts, continues to pursue an
aggressive bilateral trade negotiations agenda to achieve this goal.
Conclusion
13. The Swazi authorities face difficult challenges and have embarked on a strong reform
effort to revive economic growth. They count on the international community and their
cooperating partners to assist them in dealing with the multiplicity of problems that seek to
undermine the country’s achievement of its MDGs. The continued classification of the
country as a middle-income country based only on GDP per capita and ignoring the poor
social indicators facing the majority of the population, has continued to undermine the
authority’s efforts to source concessional resources to finance social reforms. The country
has all the social indicators of a poor developing country, with more than two thirds of the
Population living below the poverty line. HIV/AIDS continues to ravage the country and this,
together with the worsening incidence of poverty, is causing untold harm to the future
economic growth prospects of the country.
