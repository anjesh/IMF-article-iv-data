UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 5, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Economic prospects. Nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is projected to increase from 2.1 percent
in 2010 to 3.3 percent in 2011, led by strong tourism, logistics, and trade in Dubai; and large
public investment spending in Abu Dhabi. Nevertheless, the real estate overhang and shortterm refinancing needs from overleveraged Government-Related Entities (GREs) weigh on the
near-term outlook. Despite higher international food prices, the CPI inflation rate is expected
to remain moderate at 4.5 percent, as rents continue to decline.
Risks to the outlook. The unfolding turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa poses
downside risks. The re-pricing of risk in the region could result in more difficult financial
market conditions. On the positive side, there are indications that the United Arab Emirates
(U.A.E.) may benefit from increased tourism and investments looking for diversification within
the region. Higher oil prices are also benefiting the U.A.E. as a hydrocarbon exporter, though
if sustained, they may affect the recovery if demand from Asia falls.
Supporting the recovery in the short term. Given the still fragile economic recovery,
macroeconomic policies in 2011 should support domestic demand and respond to potential
economic spillovers from the unfolding events in the region. The government should adopt a
neutral fiscal stance in 2011, and expand spending in case the regional unrest starts affecting
the economy. The central bank should be prepared to provide liquidity if the re-pricing of risk
in the region were to trigger a reversal of the recent bank deposit inflows.
Mitigating the risks posed by quasi-sovereign entities. GREs have contributed
significantly to U.A.E.’s economic growth. Nevertheless, the recent bailouts, the size of
Dubai’s GRE debt, and the significant short- and medium-term roll-over needs call for
containing the risks posed by these entities. This entails better governance, as well as
assessing, monitoring, reporting, and disclosing GRE contingent liabilities in government
accounts. Containing GRE borrowing is key for fiscal sustainability at the emirate level.
Securing financial stability. The banking sector remains resilient to shocks, thanks to high
capital and strong earnings. Although nonperforming loans have doubled since the crisis,
banks have increased provisioning. In light of the ongoing restructuring of Dubai GREs, the
central bank should continue to ensure that banks provision adequately, monitor the
performance of restructured loans, and encourage banks to retain more earnings to handle
potential risks in the medium term.
Managing the economy over the cycle. The recent boom-bust underscores the need for
strong demand management over the economic cycle. Under a pegged exchange rate regime,
this requires mutually-supportive countercyclical fiscal and macroprudential policies; and the
federal structure of the U.A.E. makes close coordination between the various governments
imperative.
Improving the statistical framework. With data availability underpinning good policymaking, more progress is needed for timely compilation and dissemination of key statistics.

Dubai Debt Restructuring
Box 1
Prior to Dubai World’s (DW) standstill
announcement on November 25, 2009, the
government of Dubai had put in place a
structure to support its GREs. In July 2009, it
established the Dubai Financial Support Fund
(DFSF), to provide financial assistance to GREs of
strategic importance. The DFSF is managing the
US$20 billion bond program subscribed 50 percent
by the central bank and 50 percent by Abu Dhabi.
Following the standstill announcement, the
government of Dubai enacted a special insolvency
regime for DW and its Nakheel subsidiary
specialized in real estate development.
The first debt restructuring of DW was
completed in 7 months. On March 25, 2010, DW
submitted a restructuring plan to creditors. On
September 9, 2010, most creditors had agreed on
the terms, and on October 27, 2010, DW
announced full support of its creditors. The
restructuring plan covered US$24.9 billion of debt,
of which US$14.4 billion was owed to some
90 domestic and foreign banks and the remaining
US$10.5 billion to the government of Dubai.
Banks provided maturity extensions and
interest reductions, and the government of
Dubai converted its loans into equity. The
US$14.4 billion debt was divided into two tranches:
a US$4.4 billion tranche with a 5 year maturity and
1 percent interest and a US$10.0 billion tranche
with an 8-year maturity and 1 percent interest paid
each year. An additional payment of 1.5 to
2.5 percent will be made upon maturity and the
Government of Dubai will offer a guarantee of
between US$1 billion and 4 billion. As for the
government, acting through the DFSF, it would
convert its US$10.5 billion share of claims into
equity through the DFSF. In addition, the DFSF
committed to provide new funds up to
US$1.5 billion to DW for the company’s working
capital and interest payments.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Separately, the government (again, through
the DFSF) would provide US$8 billion new
equity to Nakheel and convert its existing
US$1.2 billion debt into equity. Trade creditors
and suppliers will be paid off with a combination of
40 percent cash and 60 percent publicly traded
debt security with a 10 percent annual interest rate.
The outstanding Nakheel bonds will be paid off in
full and on time. The remaining bank creditors will
receive principal and accrued interest through a
maturity extension at commercial rates. The
government would own Nakheel directly, instead of
through DW, to protect DW’s non-real estate
assets.
Following DW, Dubai Holding (DH) has also
been in discussions with banks to restructure
debt. In July 2010, Dubai Holding Commercial
Operations Group (DHCOG) secured a two-month
extension on a US$555 million loan, which was
later rescheduled further through year-end. Lately,
press reports have indicated that DHCOG reached
an agreement with banks to convert the revolving
debt into a 5-year loan. In November 2010, Dubai
Group (DG) with participations in financial services
firms in Dubai and abroad, missed two scheduled
loan payments worth US$1.8 billion and started
restructuring its US$6.2 billion liabilities. In
December 2010, Dubai International Capital (DIC)
agreed with bank creditors to restructure
US$2.5 billion worth of bank loans: US$2 billion
would be extended to 2016 at 2 percent;
US$500 million would be extended to 2014 at an
unchanged interest rate.

Real Estate Market Developments
Box 2
Dubai’s real estate market has seen one of the
largest price corrections in the world. Following
a dramatic run-up in prices, the Dubai real-estate
market dropped sharply in the fall of 2008, both in
activity and prices. By early 2009, the number of
transactions was one fourth of the summer 2008
peak, while prices had fallen by some 50 percent.

Abu Dhabi’s real estate has also fallen, but
fared better than Dubai’s. This is largely due to
the real estate boom in Abu Dhabi lagging behind
Dubai’s, and investors’ confidence in Abu Dhabi’s
long-term growth potential. While both commercial
and residential segments suffered heavy losses in
Dubai, the slowdown in Abu Dhabi is concentrated
in the residential market, although flexible payment
plans and more competitive finance rates offered
by banks helped cushion the impact. Facing
competitive pressures from the drop

in housing prices in Dubai, residential prices in Abu
Dhabi have also fallen by almost 50 percent.
However, commercial real estate is proving more
resilient.
The real estate market faces a prolonged road
to recovery. On the downside, recovery prospects
are undermined by uncertainty about the economy,
large existing and prospective oversupply, and tight
mortgage lending conditions, particularly in Dubai.
The surplus of residential properties reportedly
exceeds 30 percent, and inventory is projected to
stay high as more supply (15 percent of the current
stock)—from projects initiated before the crisis—is
expected in the next two years. Potential buyers
continue to find it difficult to secure mortgages, as
banks remain focused on repairing their balance
sheets. Some upside may come from higher oil prices
and turmoil elsewhere in the region.

The reduction in availability of trade finance and
payments schemes would be the main channel
through which the sanctions could affect trade
with Iran. The sanctions do not target the types of
goods that make up the bulk of the trade between the
two countries. However, the financial restrictions
imposed by these sanctions are making U.A.E. banks
reluctant to take on transactions involving Iranian banks
or companies. This complicates and increases costs of
securing trade finance, executing payments, and
obtaining insurance for trading companies, and thus
hurts trade with Iran.
Preliminary data suggests that the latest sanctions
approved in June 2010 led to a reduction in trade.
Iran accounts for a little more than 6 percent of total
and 12 percent of nonhydrocarbon exports of the
U.A.E., and is the second largest destination of U.A.E.
exports after India. A salient feature of this trade is that
re-exports of goods account for more than 90 percent
of exports to Iran. Dubai’s total trade with Iran in the
third quarter of 2010 declined by 15 percent compared
to the same period of 2009, as Iran’s share in re-exports
from Dubai fell to 13 percent, from 18 percent in 2009.
However, reflecting strong trade in the first half
of 2010, the value of trade in the first nine months
of 2010 remained broadly unchanged compared to the
same period of 2009.
Staff’s calculations suggest that a 30-percent fall
in exports to Iran would reduce the U.A.E. GDP by
0.2 percent. Such a decline in exports would represent

POLICY THEME#2
STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY'S RESILIENCE
As the recovery firms up, policies should progressively shift focus towards strengthening the economy’s
resilience. Dubai’s debt restructuring and its fiscal and financial implications, the sizeable GRE roll-over
needs over the medium term, and growing GRE borrowings in other emirates call for close monitoring
of the risks posed by these entities, and strengthening the resilience of the financial sector. The recent
boom-bust experience of the U.A.E. underscores the need for strong macroeconomic management
over the cycle. Under a pegged exchange rate regime, this requires mutually-supportive countercyclical
fiscal and macroprudential policies and close coordination across the federal and emirate governments.

(Figure 7). With an estimated US$60 billion of debt
due in 2011–12, the U.A.E. faces short-term roll-over
risk that needs to be managed carefully. Moreover,
with the restructuring of Dubai GREs, a significant
amount of Dubai debt will mature in the medium
term (2014–15). The overhang in the real estate
sector means that these risks can affect the sovereign
balance sheet as contingent liabilities may materialize,
affect banks holding GRE debt, and have broader
implications for capital markets through higher cost of
borrowing and bailouts.

22.

In the short term, completing GRE debt

restructuring and cleaning their balance sheets
should be a priority. The ongoing restructuring will
likely result in better financing conditions. Throughout
the process, due regard should be accorded to
ensuring the viability of these entities through writingoff impaired assets and operational restructuring.
Increased transparency regarding the government
strategy on refinancing GRE liabilities would also help
improve investor confidence. In this context, the
government should clarify and communicate the

debt,
including
guarantees, increased from 1.6 percent of Dubai GDP
in 2007 to 10.3 percent in 2008 and 34 percent as of
end-2010. This was mainly due to the bailout of
GREs.
Government debt data underestimate Dubai’s
total public sector debt by omitting quasisovereign contingent liabilities. While variable
financial conditions suggest that not all GREs should
pose a fiscal risk, most entities operating in the real
estate sector are continuing to register weak
performance, and thus may fall in this category.
Assuming that the debt of these entities is a
contingent liability for the government, at least
US$11 billion of contingent risk can be foreseen for
the government of Dubai by end-2016, with more
than 70 percent of these liabilities coming due
in 2011–12. This would raise the total debt-to-GDP
ratio to 47.4 percent in 2012, compared to
34.6 percent for the government alone.

Dubai’s government debt is estimated to increase to
41 percent of GDP by the end of 2016. In the
absence of fiscal consolidation (i.e., without policy
change compared to 2005–09), however, it is
projected to reach 53 percent by 2016. Furthermore,
including the potential contingent liabilities as
estimated above and with the baseline profile for
fiscal adjustment, the total debt-to-GDP ratio would
increase to 54.3 percent by the end of 2016, and to
62.5 percent without fiscal consolidation.

Labor Market Issues
Similar to other GCC countries, the U.A.E. labor
market is segmented between national and
foreign workers. According to the latest official
survey results, the average unemployment rate
stood at 4.2 percent in 2009. Unemployment
among U.A.E. nationals, however, was 14 percent,
compared to 2.8 percent among expatriate
workers, and has doubled since 2000. Nevertheless,
there are no official data on the number of
unemployed; estimates range between 10,000 and
40,000 persons
Unemployment among U.A.E. nationals is
higher among the youth and concentrated in
the northern emirates. The unemployment rate
among nationals aged 20-24 is estimated at
23.9 percent in 2009; it is higher in rural areas
compared to urban areas—18.6 percent versus
11.5 percent; and the northern emirates have, on
average, higher unemployment rates, and account
for about 80 percent of unemployment among
nationals. At 28.1 percent, unemployment among
women is also higher than for men (7.8 percent).

code of ethics and productivity. Although this is an
important point of attraction for private firms in
creating new jobs, nationals do not appear to be in
a position to take advantage. One structural factor
is the skills gap. For example, foreign professionals
have attained, on average, 4 more years of formal
education than nationals.
High reservation wages, reflecting better
wages in the public sector and other sources
of income, discourage nationals to seek
employment
in
the
private
sector.
Consequently, around 90 percent of nationals are
employed in the public sector; and the preference
for public sector jobs has resulted in frictional
unemployment among nationals.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment
Estimates from CGER-type methodologies for exchange rate assessment indicate that the U.A.E. dirham
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.

The real exchange rate depreciated by

confidence band—a norm of 8.3 percent of GDP

10.2 percent since the first quarter of 2009,

compared to the actual surplus of 7.7 percent of

moving broadly in line with fundamentals.

10.2 percent from the peak in March 2009 until

The underpinning of the external sustainability

approach is that the sustainability of the current

(NPV) of all future hydrocarbon and investment
income be equal to the NPV of imports of goods and
services net of nonhydrocarbon exports. Subject to this
constraint, the government would choose a path for
imports, and hence a current account norm, that
would support intergenerational equity—and some
precautionary savings in view of volatile oil prices—
through an appropriate pace of accumulation of net
foreign assets.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 25, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are substantial shortcomings
on the accounts of government-related corporations. In particular, data on GRE debt and contingent
liabilities to the government are not available. The federal and individual emirates’ agencies have
improved the availability and quality of the statistics, but more progress is needed. The adoption of
the Federal Statistics Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) are important steps in establishing a statistical system at the federal level.
While the Law expressly requires all agencies and local statistical centers to provide data as required
by the NBS, its success will depend on implementing arrangements, staffing, funding and training,
as well as political commitment.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled
annually with a lag of around 18 months and only current price expenditure estimates are available.
Some progress has been made in improving the source data but further work is needed to improve
updating procedures, and quarterly indicators are not available.
Price statistics: Following technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department, the Ministry of
Economy started publishing a monthly CPI since January 2008. However, price indexes and GDP
deflators need further harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2008, six of the seven emirates and the federal government
have received technical support in the compilation of fiscal data on a consolidated basis, using the
GFSM 2001 format and 2008 as a base year. The authorities, however, are yet to adopt the action
plan to establish a fiscal reporting system for the production of the GFS in a regular and timely
manner. Since reporting of data by the emirates is voluntary, an institutional arrangement will need
to be established to ensure adequate data provision. This consolidation should complement
initiatives to establish debt management units at both the emirate and federal levels.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has recently shifted the responsibility for compiling and
disseminating monetary data to the Banking Supervision and Examination Department, in order to
improve the timeliness of data to monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some
monthly aggregates and FSIs are already published on a monthly basis the Banking Supervision and
Examination Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000 and the published data do not follow
the recommended methodology.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as
the data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not
published or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive Balance of Payments
and IIP is however within the reach of the U.A.E. if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of
Economy strengthen their capacity and receive appropriate support at the high level. The authorities
have indicated their interest in IMF technical assistance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
United Arab Emirates
On April 21, 2001, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting.1
Background
The economic recovery in the U.A.E. is gaining strength, supported by a favorable global
environment but subject to increased regional uncertainty. Real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is
projected to accelerate to 3.3 percent in 2011 from 2.1 percent in 2010, reflecting stronger
tourism, logistics, and trade in the emirate of Dubai; and large public investment spending in the
emirate of Abu Dhabi, including through Government-Related Entities (GREs). Higher oil prices
are also contributing to a marked improvement in the fiscal and external positions. Despite
higher international food prices, the CPI inflation rate is expected to remain moderate at
4.5 percent, as property rents continue to decline. At 4.2 percent, the U.A.E’s unemployment
rate is low, though unemployment among nationals remains high (at 14 percent), and
concentrated in the northern emirates.
The Dubai World (DW) debt restructuring was completed, but other GREs entered in
restructuring negotiations. Nevertheless, the successful restructuring of DW’s debt improved
market confidence, allowing top-grade Dubai issuers to regain market access. However, Dubai
spreads remain high reflecting the risks posed by further potential debt restructuring needs.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Many Dubai GREs initiated DW-style debt restructuring talks with banks, while Abu Dhabi
stepped up its support to some GREs.
The banking sector has high capital buffers—including from the government—and remained
profitable in 2010, but nonperforming loans have doubled since the crisis. The Central Bank of
the U.A.E. (CBU) has made important progress in strengthening its financial stability analysis,
revamping the regulatory framework, and developing macroprudential policies, with the view to
improve bank risk management practices.
Risks to the recovery remain, including from possible economic spillovers of regional events. In
particular, the current re-pricing of geopolitical risk in the region could lead to more challenging
market conditions, which may put pressure on the entities that need to roll over external
borrowing. The excess supply of property in Dubai, and the uncertainty regarding the scale of
oversupply in the emirate, will continue to weigh on growth in the U.A.E. At more than
100 percent of GDP, Dubai’s GRE debt is large and roll-over needs are expected to l remain
substantial for the medium term, posing continued fiscal and financial risks to the U.A.E. overall.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The U.A.E. economy is recovering in an increasingly uncertain regional environment. Benefiting
from high oil prices and strong demand from traditional trading partners, nonhydrocarbon GDP
growth is projected to accelerate from 2.1 percent in 2010 to 3.3 percent in 2011. The real
estate overhang and short-term refinancing needs from overleveraged GREs continue to weigh
on the near-term outlook. Downside risks to the recovery relate to possible economic spillovers
of regional events, including the re-pricing of risk.
In light of the still fragile recovery, short-term policies should focus on supporting domestic
demand, and adjust to the economic spillovers from the unfolding regional events. An overall
neutral fiscal policy stance following last year’s fiscal contraction would support the economic
recovery, while Dubai should consolidate. To ensure efficiency of spending, the government
should undertake cost-benefit analyses and implement the projects that have high economic
return. While the central bank will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance, it should
also stand ready to provide liquidity to the market in case the re-pricing of risk in the region
triggers a reversal of the recent deposit inflows to the banking sector.
The authorities’ response to the unfolding events in the region is appropriate. Improved
infrastructure in the northern emirates will help raise the standards of living in these areas. Staff
also advises the authorities to consider replacing the subsidies on water and electricity with
explicit cash transfers to lower-income households. The authorities’ active labor market policies

3
will help create jobs for nationals, and should be complemented by strengthening the skills mix.
Given the concentration of unemployment in the northern Emirates, the government could also
consider locating some of its agencies/entities in the North to create further employment
opportunities for nationals in these areas.
The exchange rate is broadly aligned with fundamentals, and the dollar peg continues to serve
as an effective nominal anchor for the economy.
Mitigating GRE risks should remain a policy priority. In the short term, the authorities should
complete the restructuring of GRE debt, ensure the viability of these entities through writing-off
impaired assets, and communicate their strategy on GRE debt refinancing. Going forward,
limiting overall GRE borrowing by emirate, developing a GRE risk management framework, and
reporting contingent liabilities arising from GREs in the fiscal accounts will help reduce GRE
risks. GRE governance also needs to be improved, including by clarifying ownership,
government support strategy, and delineating commercial and noncommercial operations
carried by the GREs. Finally, better information disclosure about GRE financial accounts would
improve investor confidence and ultimately translate into lower funding costs.
The CBU should continue to prepare the banking system for further possible deterioration in
asset quality and future risks. The central bank has taken a number of steps that would help
improve the resilience of the banking sector to future shocks. Given the likelihood of further
increase in NPLs, the central bank should continue to ensure that banks provision adequately,
while monitoring the performance of restructured loans. Higher capital charges on risky GREs,
and continued retained earnings by banks would also limit the potential financial risks posed by
the GREs.
The recent boom-bust underscores the need for strong demand management over the cycle.
Under a pegged exchange rate regime, this requires mutually-supportive countercyclical fiscal
and macroprudential policies, and the federal structure of the U.A.E. makes a close coordination
between various governments imperative. Staff is encouraged by the authorities’ decision to
deepen further the intergovernmental cooperation, including the CBU.
Developing the domestic capital markets will reduce U.A.E.’s dependency on external markets.
In this context, given the limited scope for federal securities in the short term, the authorities
should explore stable funding from non-traditional sources, such as term deposits from
government sources.
The progress made by the NBS in establishing macroeconomic statistics and the ministry of
finance in preparing consolidated fiscal accounts is an important step towards developing
statistical capacity. However, further efforts are needed for the timely compilation and
dissemination of key statistics, including on national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal
accounts. This will also require harmonization of methodologies across emirates. Staff

4
encourages the authorities to move ahead with further developing the capacity to produce
leading indicators and to collect and disseminate data on U.A.E.’s International Investment
Position.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
