2010 Article IV Consultation and First Review of the Arrangement Under the
Exogenous Shocks Facility
(In consultation with the Finance, Legal, Monetary and Capital Markets,
and Strategy, Policy, and Review Departments)
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Dominique Desruelle
May 26, 2010

Relations with the Fund: The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2008.
Ethiopia made a drawing under the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks
Facility (ESF) in February 2009. The Executive Board approved a 14-month arrangement under
the high-access component of the ESF in the amount of SDR 153.76 million (115 percent of
quota) in August 2009.
Program performance through December 2009 was satisfactory. SDR 40.11 million (30 percent
of quota) will become available upon completion of this review. In the attached letter of intent
and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the authorities review program
implementation and outline their policies for the remainder of 2009/10 and 2010/11.
Discussions: The 2010 Article IV consultation and the first review under the ESF arrangement
were held in Addis Ababa on March 11–24, 2010, and at the IMF head quarters on
April 23–27, 2010. The mission met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Minister of Finance and
Economic Development Sufian Ahmed, National Bank Governor Teklewold Atnafu, other senior
officials, and representatives of the donor community and civil society. The mission team
comprised Messrs. Mathieu (head), Honda, Kinoshita (all AFR), and Thomas (SPR); Mr. Singh,
resident representative, assisted. Ms. Teferra (Mr. Itam’s office) participated in all key meetings.
Staff collaborated closely with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and local
representatives of the donor community.
Exchange Regime: The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a crawl-like

arrangement. The authorities describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float with
no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Ethiopia is still under the Article XIV regime
and maintains several exchange restrictions that are not consistent with Article VIII
(see Information Annex I).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Progress has been made in restoring economic stability, while maintaining strong growth.
Pressures on prices and international reserves have receded. Overall consumer price index (CPI)
inflation declined sharply to the single digits, mainly because food prices reversed. Helped by
strong donor inflows and financing from the Fund, international reserves recovered to just over
2 months of imports at end-2009. GDP growth is estimated to ease to 7 percent in 2009/10,
nevertheless showing resilience to the global economic crisis.
The Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF)-supported program is on track. All of the quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for end-December 2009 were met. The structural
measures covered by benchmarks were also implemented, with progress made to raise tax
revenues, monitor borrowing by public enterprises, and prepare the National Bank of Ethiopia
(NBE) to actively manage monetary liquidity.
The budget has been managed prudently, with enhanced revenue collection efforts. General
government revenue rose strongly, and expenditure was constrained in the first half of 2009/10,
resulting in a repayment of domestic financing. For 2009/10 as a whole, the deficit will be
reduced and domestic financing will be half the original program target. Going forward,
sustained stronger revenue efforts are needed to relieve the domestic financing pressures on
inflation and the financial system.
Monetary developments mirror progress made in fiscal policy. Reserve money growth has
been sharply reduced in 2009/10 on low financing needs of the government. As a result, excess
liquidity in the banking system has declined. However, interest rates remain negative in real
terms. Bank credit to the private sector grew strongly on the room created by less government
financing, but has been constrained by credit ceilings imposed by the NBE since early 2009.
The structural reform agenda for 2010 focuses on implementing the tax reform strategy;
reversing the demonetization trend by raising interest rates and containing reserve money,
including through active liquidity management; and strengthening national account statistics.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on adjusting policies to reverse the
demonetization trend and to foster sustained growth while reducing vulnerability to shocks.
Staff recommended urgent steps to raise nominal interest rates, maintain lower reserve money
growth, foster monetary policy independence, and enhance financial sector supervision to ensure
financial stability. A stepped-up tax collection effort is important to support these objectives.
With the sharp fall in inflation and significant nominal exchange rate adjustment, there is no
clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment. The authorities broadly agreed with the analysis
and are committed to improved liquidity management and achieving interest rates that are
positive in real terms. Staff also suggested a further accumulation of external reserves and
exchange regime liberalization, which the authorities are yet to embrace.
An updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) finds Ethiopia in the low risk range of
public external debt distress.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
For the past six years, the economy has enjoyed strong growth, largely owing to
government-led development policies—with an emphasis on public investment,
commercialization of agriculture, and nonfarm private sector developments. After a significant
drought-related contraction in 2002/03, growth rebounded at an annual average rate of
11.2 percent for 2003/04–2008/09—significantly above the average of 6.3 percent realized in
Sub-Saharan Africa (Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). The pace of growth also far exceeds the
minimum growth target of 7 percent in the Program for Accelerated and Sustainable
Development (PASDEP), and Ethiopia is making significant progress in all areas of the
Millennium Development Goals (Table 7). Although initially led by agriculture, the growth has
been broad-based, with a rising contribution from the service sectors and industry, resulting in
export diversification.

Ethiopia has seen strong growth in recent
years…

…initially led by agriculture, but
increasingly by services.

During this period, pressures on macroeconomic balances, particularly prices and
international reserves, heightened. These pressures largely stem from (i) high domestic
demand, which exceeded the supply capacity of the economy, and (ii) exogenous shocks during
2008–09, with commodity price surges and the global recession. Inflation rose to 64 percent in
the twelve months to July 2008 with food prices rising 92 percent. International reserves fell to
one month of imports at end-October 2008. Since late 2008, the authorities have forcefully
implemented macroeconomic adjustment policies supported by the arrangements under the ESF,
and against a difficult external environment. The global recession has constrained export growth,
but the impact on aggregate output has been modest given the central role of subsistence
agriculture (Figures 3 and 4).

The Ethiopian authorities have been generally responsive to the policy
recommendations from the 2008 Article IV consultation. The authorities adequately
implemented adjustment measures, through tightening of fiscal and monetary policies, enhanced
flexibility of the exchange rate, and the pass-through of international fuel prices to retail prices.
In structural areas (e.g., fostering a deeper foreign exchange market, increasing competition in
the banking system), however, only modest progress has been made thus far.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
4.
Pressures on prices and international reserves eased in 2009. Inflation plunged to
7.1 percent, mainly because food prices reversed; nonfood inflation remained in double digits
(Figures 5 and 6). Although progress has been made in reducing macroeconomic imbalances,
inflation has been rising in recent months and non-food inflation remains near 20 percent.

To help rebuild international reserves and improve external competitiveness, the
authorities made another exchange rate adjustment (a 5 percent devaluation) on
January 31, 2010 (Figures 10 and 11). This adjustment, together with previous ones in 2009,
and the recent disinflation have brought down the real effective exchange rate to a level close to
the equilibrium rate suggested by various methodologies (see paragraph 9). 1, 2

Program implementation is on track (MEFP; paragraphs 2–6). All quantitative
performance criteria (PCs) and indicative targets for end-December 2009 were met
(MEFP, Table 1), as were all structural benchmarks (MEFP, Table 2).


The overall fiscal balance during July-December 2009 indicates stronger revenue
collection than programmed, reflecting administrative efforts (including collection of
outstanding tax arrears) and the delayed impact of previous high inflation on income
taxes (Table 2). On the expenditure side, while maintaining pro-poor spending, other
recurrent outlays were contained. As a result, domestic financing was negative during
July‒December 2009 and the target for the year as a whole has been reduced to
0.7 percent of GDP, about half the targeted amount under the program (Text Table). The



The authorities are implementing a tax reform strategy. The strategy draws
significantly on the recommendations of Fund technical assistance on tax policy and
administration (Box 1). Specifically, the efficiency of tax collection will be improved by
(i) transferring the collections of direct (business and personal income taxes) and indirect
taxes (VAT and excise duty) from Addis Ababa City to the Ethiopian Revenues and
Customs Authority (ERCA), and (ii) reviewing of all exemptions for economic need.



Although annual reserve money growth has declined sharply, excess liquidity
remains in the system and bank-by-bank credit ceilings introduced in early 2009
remain in effect (Table 3). Reserve money growth declined to 16 percent in December,
and further in early 2010, reflecting the government’s repayment of the NBE’s advances,
(Figure 12). A system to control reserve money liquidity is being developed, but is not
yet operational. Despite excess liquidity, demand for Treasury bills has declined, as rates
remain highly negative in real terms (Figure 13).



Ethiopia has been resilient to the ongoing global crisis because remittances have
remained stable in 2009/10, FDI has risen 20 percent, and imports are lower
(Table 4). The shocks that led to the ESF arrangement request were mainly on large
projected declines in remittances and in FDI. As a result, external borrowing, especially
on non concessional terms was much lower than expected.

Reserve money growth declined on restrained
financing needs of the government.

An update safeguards assessment of the NBE was completed in December 2009
(MEFP, paragraph 17). It identified issues related to the oversight of the external and internal
audit functions, and controls over monetary data reporting. In response, the NBE established a
functional Audit Committee and set up an independent review of monetary data submitted for
program monitoring purposes by the NBE’s internal auditors. Over the medium-term, further

10
efforts are called for to address other safeguard risks, through enhancing Audit Committee
oversight of the external audit mechanism and strengthening the NBE’s independence
concerning the potential scope for unlimited financing of the government and unrealized profit
distribution mechanisms. In its response to the assessment, the NBE noted that it had the right to
reject any demand for government financing if deemed necessary to maintain macroeconomic
stability.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Policies for the Remainder of 2009/10 and 2010/11
8.
Key objectives for the rest of FY2009/10 and for FY2010/11 (MEFP, paragraphs 7–8)
are to maintain strong GDP growth of 7–8 percent, contain overall inflation to 8–10 percent;
and raise international reserves to US$1.9 billion, equivalent to 2.1 months of import coverage
by end-June 2010 and 2.3 months by end-June 2011, respectively.3 The authorities—while
aiming at real GDP growth of about 10 percent in both years—have agreed to maintain a
conservative growth assumption for program purposes and are committed to addressing
statistical shortcomings in the national accounts (Box 2).


The general government budget for 2010/11 envisages some easing from the tight
fiscal balance this year (MEFP, paragraph 10). Tax revenues should rise by about
0.5 percent of GDP, with further implementation of the tax reform strategy, although
nontax revenues are expected to decline by 1.2 percent of GDP.4 On the expenditure side,
capital outlays would rise while recurrent outlays are maintained in relation to GDP. The
budget deficit is set to rise from 2.1 percent to 3.4 percent of GDP, financed by a mix of
external and domestic borrowing. Staff would have preferred a somewhat tighter fiscal
stance for 2010/11 than proposed by the authorities to support the monetization effort.
The increase in the overall deficit reflects lower nontax revenue, from exceptional levels
over the past few years and higher public infrastructure investment. The authorities
argued strongly that they should reinforce their emphasis on pro-poor and pro-growth
public investment outlays. The fiscal stance is also compatible with maintaining the low
risk outlook of the DSA. If aid inflows or revenues exceed budgetary projections, the
authorities intend to reduce domestic borrowing levels commensurately to support the
inflation reduction objective.



Monetary policy will support a remonetization of the economy
(MEFP; paragraph 12). The NBE intends to introduce active liquidity management, in
line with maintaining lower reserve money growth to achieve low inflation, with a view

3

The projected reserve level is inclusive of the general and special allocations of SDRs (which amount to about
US$180 million, equivalent to 0.2 months of import cover).

11
to phasing out the credit ceilings by end-2010. This will require allowing T-bill rates to
rise. Staff views the policy response as appropriate and urged determined
implementation, to address the adverse consequences of bank credit ceilings on the
demand for money and financial deepening and recommended adoption of reserve money
as the nominal anchor. For 2010/11, broad money is projected to grow by 22 percent,
slightly higher than nominal GDP growth (taking into account prospective monetization).
Even after somewhat higher public sector borrowing and the foreign reserve
accumulation, growth in credit to the private sector would rise by about 25 percent, a
significant increase in real terms.
B. Macroeconomic Policy Challenges
9.
Discussions focused on how Ethiopia could sustain high growth, improve resilience
to shocks, while further reducing macroeconomic risks and imbalances. Macroeconomic
and financial policies should urgently promote monetization and financial deepening. The risk
of exogenous shocks is high, given that, for the last decades, Ethiopia has experienced recurring
adverse shocks every 5–7 years, stemming from droughts, terms of trade reversals (including
high international commodity prices), and most recently the global recession
(Figures 14 and 15). Although Ethiopia has made considerable strides in diversifying goods
exports and has strong prospects in transportation and electricity exports, it remains highly
dependent on primary industry, the level of exports is low, and financial intermediation is
severely underdeveloped. Economic resilience would be improved by a strong tax effort, higher
domestic savings and investment, and steps to reinforce competitiveness. More generally, an
acceleration of the pace of the structural reform agenda would be beneficial. World Bank staff
indicate that while modest progress is being made on structural reforms, an increase in the
momentum is expected under PASDEP II.
For the last three decades, Ethiopia has
been hit by droughts in every 5–7 years.

Monetization and financial
deepening (Box 3). The
demonetization of the economy is a
major cause of concern (Figure 16).
Several factors have contributed to
demonetization over the last several
years, such as significantly negative
real interest rates, high reserve money
growth; bank-by-bank credit ceilings,
introduced to contain inflation; and lack
of competition among banks. Staff
analysis emphasized the dangers to
financial stability and the lost growth
from continued demonetization. The
authorities concurred with the need to
promote monetization and decided to
step up their efforts to contain reserve
money growth and lower inflation
through active liquidity management,
thus raising T-bill real rates (Figure 17).
The authorities are committed to
achieving real positive interest rates,
which staff believes is urgently needed
to both reverse demonetization and
further reduce macroeconomic
imbalances.

A significant demonetization trend is a
major concern.



Stepping up revenue efforts to create
more fiscal space and substitute for
domestic financing (MEFP, paragraph 10). The comprehensive tax reform strategy was
finalized in February 2010, based on recent Fund technical assistance. Tax collection is
expected to improve significantly by consolidating tax collection, reviewing current
exemptions and exemption approval procedures, and increasing resources for the audit
and enforcement over large tax payers.



Strengthening debt management to ensure public debt remains at low risk
(MEFP, paragraphs 11 and 14). Public sector domestic borrowing will continue to at
about 3 percent of GDP in the coming years. In line with the assumptions of the DSA the
program allows for US$1 billion (3.2 percent of GDP) in the contracting of new
nonconcessional borrowing through end-2010–11. Subsequently, new nonconcessional
borrowing is projected to decline. Although Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress has been
lowered on account of the inclusion of private transfers (see the accompanying DSA),
Ethiopia’s debt management capacity is low and lagging behind other countries in the
region. However, the adoption of new financial administration regulations is a positive
step. Going forward, maintenance of the favorable risk outlook requires continued

13
emphasis on strengthening debt management capacity by closely monitoring the debts of
the largest public enterprises and assessing potential contingent liabilities.


Enhancing competitiveness (MEFP, paragraph 13). Adjustments to the nominal
exchange rate and the recent disinflation have brought the real effective exchange rate to
a level close to that suggested by various analytical methodologies (Box 4). However, a
continued premium on the parallel market, combined with low external reserve levels
suggest caution in assessing whether the exchange rate is at the appropriate level. Reserve
coverage is projected to remain low, especially given the agricultural dependence of
exports. While remaining vigilant to ensure that the nominal exchange rate is adjusted to
avoid overvaluation in real terms, structural reforms to enhance competitiveness over the
medium-term are critical. Exchange regime liberalization would benefit the economy
through improved access for the private sector, increased confidence in the rate, and
reduced economic losses from an active dual exchange market. The privatization program
should be carried forward along with implementation of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) external tariff and improvements to the investment
climate.



Maintaining financial sector soundness: The recent rapid expansion of private banks in
an environment of negative real interest rates, declining inflation, and tightening liquidity
conditions highlights the importance of strengthened financial sector supervision and
regulation. Although financial sector soundness indicators do not point to immediate
concerns, continued close scrutiny by supervisors, especially of the dominant government
owned Commercial bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and the new private banks will be important
(Table 6). 5 A slowdown of economic growth, the reduction of excess liquidity in the
system, and the recent real estate boom could pose risks that need to be closely monitored.
Oversight of the financial system is expected to be strengthened with technical
assistances on risk-based supervision provided by East AFRITAC. Staff continues to
believe that a Financial Assessment Stability Program (FSAP) evaluation would be
beneficial. The recent passage of AML/CFT legislation is an important step forward.6

10.
The authorities concurred with the importance of these reforms, except for the
increase in the foreign reserves cushion and liberalization of the exchange regime. Ethiopia
is targeting international reserves at 10 weeks of imports. In view of repeated large shocks,
however, a larger foreign exchange reserve cushion—three months of imports at the
minimum—would be advisable. In addition, over time, sustained export growth and import
substitution will require vigorous implementation of productivity enhancing structural policies,
including raising agricultural productivity, financial sector competitiveness, and improvements
5

The number of commercial banks increased from eight (2 state-owned and 6 private) in mid-2006 to 14 in
May 2010. Financial soundness indicators generally point to a well-capitalized and profitable banking sector
(Table 6).

The Anti Money Laundering Bill was passed in late 2009, and a Financial Intelligence Centre has been established.

14
in the business climate to raise low private investment rates. The authorities indicated their
willingness and ability to move the nominal exchange rate to ensure external competitiveness
against the need to maintain higher reserves levels.
C. Medium-Term Outlook
11. The discussions focused on two medium-term scenarios: (i) baseline scenario, in line
with the short-term policies as agreed under the ESF-supported program; and (ii) reform
policies (with stepped-up reforms described above) to highlight the benefits of further policy
reforms.


Baseline scenario: This scenario with status quo policies would broadly maintain
macroeconomic balances but leave the economy vulnerable to shocks. The scenario
envisages: (a) public sector domestic financing unchanged from current year levels
(around 3 percent of GDP); (b) implementation of tax reform strategy; (c) reserve money
growth maintained in single digits (year-on-year); and (d) gradual exchange rate
adjustment in line with inflation differentials. Under this scenario, growth may reach
6–7 percent a year, but, with modest progress in tax reform, resources to finance pro-poor
spending may not be boosted significantly. Official international reserves would not
reach 2½ months of imports and remain vulnerable to shocks.



Stepped-up reform scenario: Reform policy scenario would combine adjustment
policies with stepped-up reforms (enhanced tax reform efforts and reaching real positive
interest rates sooner) and further exchange rate adjustments (Box 4). Based on the abovementioned policy reforms, staff projections indicate that the medium-term economic
outlook for Ethiopia is favorable. Real GDP growth would average about 7½ percent a
year for 20010/11–2014/15, in part under the impact of a monetization of the economy,
with private sector credit growing faster, and inflation targeted to stay at 3–5 percent.
Based on real exchange rate depreciation over the next two years and structural reforms
supporting private development, gradual replenishment of gross official international
reserves would bring import coverage to three months by 2014/15 (Table 5). While the
domestic debt ratio is slightly lower in the reform scenario on account of higher nominal
GDP, the external debt ratio is higher because of the effects of the exchange rate
depreciation.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING, FINANCING, AND RISKS

12.
The program PCs and benchmarks have been updated and modified
(MEFP, paragraph 16). Revised quantitative performance criteria for July 7, 2010 are proposed
along with new benchmarks for end-September (MEFP, Table 1). The revised criteria at endJune on the NDA of the NBE and on domestic financing of the budget reflect the expected
tighter budget outturn for 2009/10 and the tighter monetary profile. The structural benchmarks
table has also been extended with three new items that reflect the structural priorities in the

15
period ahead, namely on the need to mark progress on tax reform, the introduction of active
liquidity management, and the need to improve the national accounts data for macroeconomic
management (MEFP, Table 2 and paragraph 15).
13.
The program remains fully financed. Program access phasing remains unchanged.
Ethiopia should not have any difficulty meeting its obligations to the Fund (Tables 8 and 9).
14.
The risks to the ESF-supported program stem from low external reserves levels, in
the face of potential external shocks; from domestic supply shocks reflecting Ethiopia’s
dependence on rain-fed agriculture; and from the potential impact of continued demonetization
on inflation and macro stability should program reforms on the monetary policy side not be
energetically pursued.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
15.
Ethiopia has been successfully implementing policies to reduce inflation and
rebuild external reserves as agreed in the ESF-supported program. Public sector domestic
borrowing has been reduced significantly in 2009/10 and the nominal exchange rate has been
adjusted to improve competitiveness. The negative impact of the global recession has not been
as severe as expected, which has allowed for over performance on the external targets. Staff
welcomes the sharp reduction in inflation in 2009, reflecting reduced reserve money growth,
made possible by lower domestic financing of the budget, and aided by external factors. Further
necessary progress on core inflation will require relatively greater effort in controlling domestic
liquidity.
16.
Real growth has continued strong, under the impulse of government investment
spending on social and physical infrastructure. The budget has appropriately focused on
poverty reduction and infrastructure expenditure since the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Initiative (HIPC) completion point. To sustain this growth trend, and further diversify the
economy, staff encourages the authorities to adopt policies to promote the monetization and
financial deepening of the economy while creating more room for private sector activity to
leverage the large public investment outlays on infrastructure. Attention should focus on the
business climate, particularly regarding private sector access to foreign exchange and credit, to
stimulate private investment, and sustain the high economic and export growth of recent years.
17.
The nominal exchange rate adjustments of 2009/10 have helped bring the exchange
rate broadly back in line with equilibrium and improved external competitiveness.
However, a liberalization of the exchange regime would benefit the economy through improved
access and confidence in the foreign exchange market and a unification of the official and
parallel markets would free up significant efficiency gains. Staff encouraged the authorities to
be vigilant to ensure the nominal exchange rate is managed to guard against overvaluation. The
authorities should also give sufficient weight to implementing structural reforms affecting the
investment climate, trade liberalization and privatization, to secure durable improvements in
competitiveness.

16
18.
Efforts to raise fiscal revenues, a key to lower fiscal financing needs from the
central bank, should be sustained. In addition to creating fiscal space, this would relieve
pressures on liquidity growth; support a further decline in inflation and a reversal of the
demonetization of the economy. Staff welcomes the adoption and initiation of an action plan on
tax reform, on the basis of Fund TA, to improve the revenue effort though strengthened
administration and policy reforms.
19.
Regarding monetary policy, reversal of the demonetization trend is needed
urgently. Staff encourages the authorities to significantly strengthen central bank and monetary
policy independence from the budget. Maintaining a low reserve money growth policy in
2010/11 is needed to sustain a low inflation environment and support the elimination of the
bank-by-bank credit ceilings. Introduction of active liquidity management would also help to
achieve positive real interest rates in the short run, and would support monetization, financial
deepening, and the mobilization of domestic savings. Allowing nominal interest rates to rise
would also help support a liberalization of the exchange regime. Staff welcomes the authorities’
commitments in this area and urges prompt and decisive action. Delay in effecting a reversal in
demonetization poses risks to financial stability and the ability of the financial sector to support
private sector led growth. Efforts are also needed to strengthen financial sector supervision and
regulation, particularly in view of the dominant role of the government-owned CBE and given
the sharp rise in the number of new private banks. Staff encourages the authorities to consider
the benefits of an FSAP evaluation.
20.
While public external debt has risen strongly in recent years, the updated DSA
suggests Ethiopia’s risk of debt distress has declined. The improvement reflects in part, the
consideration of Ethiopia’s large and stable inflow of remittances as adding to its capacity to
repay debt. Access to external resources (both concessional and non-concessional) has helped
relieve the financing constraint and can continue to do this given the DSA assessment. Staff
encourages the authorities to strengthen further public debt management capacity, particularly
regarding public enterprises to maintain this favorable risk outlook. Staff urges a de-emphasis of
domestic financing, especially to the extent that it is monetized.
21.
The data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring purposes, but statistical weaknesses persist, most notably with regard to the
national accounts. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to improving the quality of the
national accounts, with technical assistance from the Fund.
22.
Ethiopia has recently taken action to strengthen AML/CFT and to address the
issues raised in the safeguards assessment.
23.
Staff recommends completion of the first ESF review. The next Article IV
consultation would be held in accordance with the provisions of the Decision No. 12794 of
July 15, 2002, on consultation cycles.

17

Box 1: Ethiopia: Tax Reform Strategy
A comprehensive tax reform strategy was finalized in February 2010, based on recent technical
assistances from the Fund on tax policy and administration. The reform measures comprehensively
cover key recommendations from these TA and envisage swift implementation. Specifically, the
efficiency of tax collection is expected to be significantly improved by (i) transferring the collection of
direct (business and personal income taxes) and indirect taxes (VAT and excise duty) from Addis Ababa
City to the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority (ERCA), (ii) reviewing current exemptions
and exemption approval procedures, and (iii) increasing the Large Tax Payers Office (LTO) audit and
enforcement resources and capacity.

Some of the simpler administrative measures have already been implemented. In other areas, the
authorities are taking a cautious approach, by first conducting studies in relevant areas (e.g., corrective
measures for the investment incentives and its utilization), in order to ensure the government
accountability to the public.


A review of tax exemptions has started and will be completed by July 2010. Corrective actions
will be taken as needed.



Increasing the coverage of the cash register system—reducing leakages—has contributed to
higher VAT collection. With most large hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants all registered under
the system, the number of registers increased 1,330 at end-December 2009 to 2,130 at
end-February 2010.

For the effective implementation of these measures, the high-level forum between MoFED and
ERCA—established since mid-2009—is expected to play a key role. This forum takes place on
monthly basis, monitoring revenue performance and overseeing the implementation of the revenue
measures and the tax reform strategy.

18
Box 2: Ethiopia: National Accounts Statistics Action Plan
STA mission on national account statistics in March 2010 identified some compilation and estimation
deficiencies in the national accounts statistics. A corrective action plan (see below) has been formulated,
with a follow-up TA in the pipeline. Some of the weaknesses noted are not unique to Ethiopia. In fact, the
compilation system compares quite favorably with the systems of other countries in the region. However,
the compilation process should be kept under constant review so that weaknesses could be identified and
improvements incorporated into the system on an ongoing basis.

Box 3: Ethiopia: Monetary Policy Needs Reform to Promote Financial Intermediation
Ethiopia has experienced a worrying trend of demonetization in the last seven years. Financial
intermediation and monetization are a driving force for development and have associated with rapid
development success stories in Asia and elsewhere. The level of monetization is very low in Ethiopia.
Critically, monetization has been on a downward trend since 2002/03, and Ethiopia is falling behind
successful Asian countries at a similar stage of development and regional comparators (Figure 1).
Monetary policy is primarily responsible for this trend. Very high reserve money growth, which
in turn reflects unsterilized central bank financing of the budget at effectively zero interest rates, has
led to excess liquidity in the financial system. Inflation and low deposit rates (which do not respond
to inflation because of commercial banks’ excess liquidity) have resulted in highly negative real
interest rates, eroding the real value of deposits, discouraging savings, and dampened demand for
broad money (Figure 2). More recently, direct bank by bank credit control (which was introduced in
early 2009 as an administrative measure to curb inflation) has contributed to limited money growth
despite strong demand for credit.
Monetary policy needs to change to reverse the demonetization trend. Inflation would be difficult
to control if low T-bill rates and double digits reserve money growth fueled by central bank direct
financing of the budget continue. To stimulate money demand, interest rates would need to be raised
to positive levels in real terms and reserve money growth tightly controlled to maintain low inflation
while allowing for healthy growth of broad money and credit to support economic expansion. If
monetary policy can be reformed as described above, historical comparators (e.g., Korea in the mid
1960s) suggest a rapid and sustained remonetization can be achieved (Figures 3 and 4).

Box 4: Ethiopia: External Competitiveness and Exchange Rate Adjustments
The performance of Ethiopia’s exports
over the past decade has been strong in
US dollar terms but less so in relation to
GDP. Since 2003, exports of goods and
services have grown by about 19 percent
per annum in Ethiopia, exceeded by
Rwanda (21 percent), Uganda
(25 percent) and Zambia (25 percent)
among countries in the region
(Box Figure 5). In relation to GDP, the
ratio has remained stable in contrast to
rises in other countries; this phenomenon
is associated with denominator effects
since the economy has been growing
extremely rapidly. Ethiopia has made
considerable strides in diversifying its
goods export base (e.g., flowers and oil
seeds) but more progress is needed to
help boost reserve coverage and the
export to GDP ratio (Box Figure 6).
This requires some further movement in
the real exchange rate.

Between mid 2004 and end 2008, the
20
real effective exchange rate
appreciated by over 60 percent owing to
0
much higher inflation in Ethiopia than
in its trading partners. Inflation
pressures declined dramatically since
Coffee
Oilseeds
Leather and leather products
Chat
end 2008, and, combined with
Gold
Flowers
continued nominal depreciation, has led
Others
to sharp real exchange rate
depreciation. In the first quarter of 2010, the real exchange rate is about 7 percentage points higher than
the prediction based on an equilibrium exchange rate model (SM/08/209) but this difference is within
standard error margins.
On the other hand, reserve coverage continues to be low, projected to rise only to 2.3 months of imports
in 2009/10 and to remain at this level, indicating the need for a 10 percentage point real exchange rate
depreciation to secure a reserves target of 3 months of imports. This indicator is a variant on the macrobalance approach in which the objective is a specific reserve target rather than a medium term current
account level.
The third methodology for assessing the exchange rate level is based on stabilizing debt. The
accompanying debt sustainability analysis shows that Ethiopia is at low risk of debt distress and
therefore there is no need for an exchange rate adjustment to improve the debt outlook.

APPENDIX I
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
LETTER OF INTENT
April 28, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes
Ethiopia’s performance in the first half of 2009/10, policies for the remainder of 2009/10
and 2010/11. The government of Ethiopia has implemented the policies contained in the
economic and financial program supported by the 14-month arrangement under the HighAccess Component of the Exogenous Shock Facility (HAC-ESF), approved by the IMF
Executive Board on August 26, 2009.
2.
We request completion of the first review of the HAC-ESF arrangement and
disbursement of the second tranche of the arrangement equivalent to SDR 40.11 million
(30 percent of quota). All the quantitative performance criteria at end-December 2009 were
observed. The structural benchmarks were implemented.
3.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the objectives of the program, but we will take additional measures as needed to reach these
goals. We will consult with IMF staff on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the agreed IMF policies on
such consultation.
4.
The Government of Ethiopia authorizes the IMF to publish the contents of this letter,
and the attached MEFP and TMU, on its website after consideration of our request by the
Executive Board.
Sincerely yours,

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR 2010
April 28, 2010

I. INTRODUCTION
1.

This memorandum:
a. Reviews macroeconomic and financial performance under the program through
end-December 2009.
b. Updates the MEFP of August 7, 2009, detailing our policy commitments through
October 2010.
c. Describes macroeconomic and financial policies for the remainder of 2009/10 and
2010/11.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE PROGRAM THROUGH END-2009

2.
The key objective of our economic and financial program for 2009/10—to make
further progress on macroeconomic stability in the face of the difficult external
environment—has been met. Macroeconomic conditions continued to improve while broadbased growth momentum has been maintained. Overall CPI inflation decelerated to 7.1 percent
(end-period) at end-2009, but non-food inflation remains close to 19 percent. Thanks to strong
external assistance (including the SDR allocation and ESF disbursement), and weak import
growth, international reserves rose to 2.2 months of import cover. All quantitative targets set for
end-December 2009 were met, with margins (Table 1). The structural measures covered by
benchmarks were implemented (Table 2).
3.
Fiscal performance was well within program objectives. Overall general government
revenue rose strongly and expenditure was well below target in the first half of the fiscal year,
resulting in a repayment of domestic financing of Br 4.3 billion against an adjusted program
borrowing limit of Br 2.3 billion. The good revenue performance reflected the impact of strong
economic growth, administrative efforts, and the lagged effect of inflation. Net external
financing and grants were moderately below projections.

34
4.
Monetary policy was broadly consistent with the program objectives. Reserve
money growth was limited to 1 percent in the second half of 2009, against a program target of
1.9 percent on account of lower credit extension to government by the NBE and higher
government deposits in the banking system. On an annual basis, reserve money growth declined
markedly to 16 percent from about 30 percent at July 7, 2009. As a result, excess liquidity in the
banking system was significantly reduced. Interest rates remain negative in real terms, although
significantly improved. Broad money growth continued at about 20 percent. Bank credit to the
private sector grew 29 percent over the year on the room created by the government repayment,
but was constrained, on an exceptional basis, by credit ceilings imposed by the NBE in
early 2009, consistent with the intension of curbing inflationary pressures.
5.
Following a nominal depreciation of the Birr by about 10 percent in early
July 2009, the currency was gradually depreciated further by about 1.5 percent through
end-December. A further depreciation of 5 percent was effected in early 2010. These steps
were aimed at maintaining external competiveness. Since the beginning of 2009/10, there has
not been any contracting or guaranteeing of non concessional loans. No external payment
arrears have been incurred during the period.
6.
Our structural reform agenda is being implemented as agreed. A tax reform strategy
was adopted in January 2010—following technical assistance by the IMF, that aims at raising
revenue performance over the medium-term. A high level joint committee of the NBE and the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) staff has been monitoring
borrowing by the public enterprises from the domestic banking system. A liquidity forecasting
manual was prepared by the NBE, and initial liquidity forecasts have been prepared, but active
liquidity management has not yet been made operational.
III. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2009/10 AND 2010/11
7.
We remain committed to implementing the policies and meeting the quantitative
and structural reform objectives described in our previous MEFP. We are aiming at real
GDP growth of about 10 percent in 2009/10–10/11, but maintain the conservative assumption
for the purpose of the program of 7.0 percent in 2009/10 rising to 7.7 percent in 2010/11. We
aim to keep inflation in the single digits. The external current account deficit is expected to
widen on account of a sizable increase in capital goods imports associated with new aircraft
purchases and large hydro power investments. The gross official reserves coverage target at
end-June 2010 is 2.1 months of imports rising to 2.3 months by end 2010/11.
8.
The macroeconomic priority for the remainder of 2009/10 and 2010/11 is to contain
inflation. This will require limited domestic financing of the budget, consistent with the
intention to contain reserve money growth, while rebuilding of official external reserves. This
effort also requires move towards positive real interest rates. The vigorous implementation of
tax reforms aims to raise the fiscal revenue effort in order to reduce domestic financing of the
budget. Sustained levels of concessional external financial assistance remain critical to our
development needs.

35
Fiscal policy for the remained of 2009/10
9.
The stronger revenue performance will be mostly saved so that domestic financing
for the year will be about 2.8 billion birr (0.7 percent of GDP as against an original
program target of 5.8 billion birr i.e., less than one-half the original program target). The
overall deficit, including grants, is projected at 8.8 billion birr (2.3 percent of GDP). We have
begun implementing the tax reform strategy, which will raise tax revenue to 10.5 percent of
GDP. We will maintain our careful prioritization of public expenditures, protecting povertyreducing spending and strategic capital projects. The tax reform includes the reduction of
exemptions, the consolidation of revenue administrations, a review and costing of investment
incentives, and a standardization of some rates.
The 2010/11 Budget
10.
The 2010/11 budget aims at maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, while continuing
our strong investment in physical and social infrastructure. In support of our efforts to
contain inflation, domestic financing is targeted at 7.0 billion birr (1.6 percent of GDP), of
which at most 5 billion birr would be taken from the NBE, 1 billion birr from commercial banks
and the remaining 1 billion from non-bank sources. This level of government financing would
allow for adequate private sector credit. The tax reform measures are expected to raise general
government tax revenue to 11.0 percent of GDP. This is a somewhat cautious revenue forecast,
recognizing the uncertainties on the exact impact of the reform effort. In this light, we intend to
save the bulk of any domestic revenues or external financial support over and above the budget
projections. Expenditure growth will be contained at 18 percent with recurrent expenditure
maintained at 9.2 percent of GDP and capital expenditure rising to 11.2 percent of GDP. The
overall deficit, excluding grants, is targeted at 7.0 percent of GDP.

Public sector
11.
We will continue to monitor closely the domestic borrowing of the public
enterprises and agencies. An inter agency committee is now monitoring enterprise borrowing
on a monthly basis. The limit on the aggregate domestic financing of public enterprises and
agencies is maintained at 6.5 billion birr (1.6 percent of GDP) in 2009/10. For 2010/11, the
indicative limit is set at 7.2 billion birr or 1.6 percent of GDP. We believe this target is
consistent with overall credit and money growth that allows for sufficient credit expansion to
the private sector and avoids a build-up of excess demand pressures on the economy. Domestic

36
fuel prices have been adjusted monthly since October 2008 with prices set somewhat higher
than import costs to enable the Oil Stabilization Fund to repay its accumulated debt to the
banking system.
Monetary policy
12.
The monetary policy objective is to reduce inflationary pressures further, while
allowing sufficient credit to the economy. To support this objective, we will start to raise
interest rates on treasury bills beginning in July 2010, consistent with an objective of achieving
positive interest rates in real terms. Monetary policy aims to absorb the persistent excess
liquidity in the system, with the objective of abolishing the exceptional bank-by-bank credit
ceilings in 2010. The timing of the removal of the credit ceilings and the profile of monetary
policy in 2010/11 will be determined at the time of the second program review mission. Reserve
money growth will be contained at 10.3 percent at July 7, 2010, and at 10–12 percent during
2010/11. This will require active liquidity management by the NBE starting in June 2010, using
available instruments. Broad money is projected to grow by 18 percent at July 7, 2010, and by
22.0 percent in 2010/11, on continued strong deposit growth and credit demand from the private
sector. We will also strengthen our oversight of the financial system.
Action

Timing



June 2010

Exchange rate and external policy
13.
The government is committed to adjusting the nominal exchange rate in order to
preserve external competitiveness and to continue to gradually rebuild official external
reserves. For 2010/11, a further rebuilding of net external reserves of US$212 million to
2.3 months of imports is targeted. Recent exchange rate adjustments have brought Ethiopia’s
real effective exchange rate close to the level broadly consistent with external equilibrium. We
have not introduced, nor will we introduce, any new, or intensify any existing, exchange
restrictions.
14.
Avoiding an unsustainable accumulation of public external debt is a key objective
of the government economic policy. The government is committed to maintaining effective
oversight over the evolution of public sector external debt, including that incurred by the public
enterprises. While conventional debt sustainability analysis provides a broadly reassuring
assessment of Ethiopia’s debt burden, we will continue to keep debt levels under close review
and we will make every effort to ensure that new borrowing are contracted on non-concessional
terms and that large foreign-financed projects are subject to rigorous economic appraisals before
being approved.

37
IV. NATIONAL STATISTICS
15.
We are committed to improving the quality of macroeconomic statistics, in
particular the compilation methodologies and institutional arrangements for the national
accounts. We will adopt an action plan to strengthen national accounts statistics by
August 2010 and are seeking additional technical support from the IMF Statistics department
and other relevant external statistical agencies.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING AND SAFEGUARDS
16.
The updated quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks for the remainder
of 2010 are set out in Table 1, and are defined in the attached technical memorandum of
understanding. The structural benchmarks are set out in Table 2. Government officials will meet
regularly with the IMF’s resident representative to review the progress made in the
implementation of the program. The second and final program review will be completed by
October 2010 and be based on economic performance through July 7, 2010. It will focus on
progress in implementing the structural benchmarks in Table 2.
17.
The 2001 safeguards assessment was updated in December 2009 and identified some
issues relating to the oversight of the external and internal audit functions. In response, the NBE
has established a functional Audit Committee and set up an independent review of monetary
data submitted for program monitoring purposes by the NBE’s internal auditors.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Washington, D.C., April 28, 2010
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Ethiopian authorities and
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, for the program supported by the high-access
component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF), as well as the mechanisms to monitor
the program and related reporting requirements. To monitor the evolution of the economy
during the program period, the Ethiopian authorities will provide the data listed in each
section below to the African Department of the IMF, in accordance with the indicated
timing (summarized in Section IV.C.). The financial criteria will be monitored on the basis
of the methodological classification of monetary and financial data that exists as of
July 7, 2009.
2.
For program purposes, the public sector consists of the general government
(comprising the federal and regional governments) and public enterprises.
3.
For program purposes, public enterprises refer to those entities under the term of
“public enterprises” in the monetary survey provided by the National Bank of Ethiopia
(NBE).
4.
The quantitative targets for end-December 2009 and July 7, 2010 constitute
performance criteria, and those at end-September, 2009 and end-March 2010 are
quantitative benchmarks.
5.
The program exchange rate of the Ethiopian birr to the U.S. dollar is set according to
a quarterly projection path for end March 2009/10 through end-December 2010/11
(Table 2). The corresponding cross exchange rates and program gold price for the duration
of the program are provided in Table 1, which are the prevailing rates as of March 19, 2010.

II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS: DEFINITIONS AND
REPORTING STANDARDS
A. Floor for Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the NBE
6.
Definition. The NFA of the NBE are defined as the difference between gross foreign
reserve assets and all foreign reserve liabilities of the NBE, including debts to the IMF and
other long- and short-term liabilities of the NBE to nonresidents. For purposes of the
program, foreign reserve assets shall be defined as monetary gold, holdings of SDRs, the
reserve position in the IMF, and NBE holdings of foreign exchange in convertible
currencies. Any such assets shall only be included as foreign reserve assets if they are under
the effective control of, and readily available to, the NBE. For the program purposes, part of
the NBE’s customary gross foreign reserve assets such as, capital participation in IFIs (e.g.,
Afrix-import-export, IDA, IFC, ADB and IBRD) and securities in other international
institutions, any assets in nonconvertible currencies, commodity gold and holdings of other
precious metals other than monetary gold, encumbered foreign reserve assets, and foreign
reserve assets pledged as collateral for loans and derivative contracts will be excluded from
NFA calculation. Foreign reserve liabilities include any foreign currency denominated
short-term loans or deposit (with a maturity of up to and including one year); NBE liabilities
to residents and nonresidents associated with swaps (including any portion of the NBE gold
that is collateralized) and forward contracts; IMF purchases; and loans contracted by the
NBE from international capital markets, banks or other financial institutions located abroad,
and foreign governments, irrespective of their maturity. Foreign reserve liabilities also
include foreign-currency-denominated domestic liabilities of the NBE. For calculating the
criteria, foreign reserve assets and liabilities shall be valued at the exchange rates shown in
Table 1. It is understood that the SDR allocation that was disbursed at end-August 2009/10
has no impact on the NFA of the NBE.
7.
Reporting. Data on gross foreign reserve assets and foreign reserve liabilities of the
NBE by major currencies of denomination (such as US$, Euro, GBP, Can$, SDR) will be
transmitted to the African Department of the IMF on a monthly basis within 30 days of the
end of each month. The NBE will also report the breakdown between liquid and
unencumbered gross foreign reserve assets and those foreign reserve assets that are pledged,
swapped, or encumbered.
B. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the NBE
8.
Definition. The NDA of the NBE are defined to include net credit to the
government, credit to enterprises and individuals, claims on banks, and other items net
(see the monetary survey), but exclude foreign currency valuation adjustments. NDA is
computed as the difference between reserve money and the program definition of NFA. The
foreign currency valuation adjustment is estimated in Birr as the difference between the

42
NFA of NBE when computed using fixed program exchange rates (Table 1) and the
prevailing exchange rate.
9.
Reporting. The monthly balance sheets of the NBE will be transmitted to the
African Department of the IMF within six weeks of the end of each month.
C. Limit on the Net Domestic Financing of the General Government
10.
Definition. The net domestic financing of the general government is defined as the
sum of (i) the change in the net stock of claims of domestic banks and non-banks on the
general government and (ii) any pending overdue bills. Net domestic bank claims consist of
NBE and domestic commercial bank claims on the general government, including treasury
bills and other general government liabilities, net of general government deposits with the
NBE and domestic commercial banks. Non-bank claims comprise treasury bills, bonds, and
other general government paper placed with non-bank institutions or with the public. For
calculating the criteria, the bonds issued by regional housing agencies for condominium
projects shall be excluded.
11.
Reporting. Data on domestic financing (bank and non-bank) of the general
government (including treasury bills and government bonds held by the nonbank public)
will be transmitted on a monthly basis, within six weeks of the end of each month, except
for the data on regional governments, which will be furnished within twelve weeks after the
end of each quarter. Reporting on domestic and external arrears (i.e., overdue bills) will be
monthly, within six weeks of the end of each month.
D. Ceiling on Net Domestic Credit to Public Enterprises
12.
Definition. The net domestic credit to public enterprises is defined as the change in
the net stock of domestic bank and non-bank claims on public enterprises. Net bank claims
on public enterprises consist of NBE and domestic commercial bank claims, including those
of Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), on public enterprises, including loans, bonds, and
other liabilities, net of public enterprise deposits with domestic commercial banks (demand,
saving and fixed deposits). Nonbank claims comprise loans, bonds, and other debt papers
placed with nonbank institutions or with the public. For calculating the criteria, the bonds
issued by regional housing agencies for condominium projects, and the loans extended by
the DBE to public enterprises shall be included. Changes in local investment shares by
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Construction and Business Bank (CBB), and DBE in
nonbank public enterprises shall also be included.
13.
Reporting. Data on credit (bank and nonbank) to public enterprises (with reference
to ETC, EEPCo, ESL, Oil Stabilization Fund, and housing agencies) and the loan and
investment outstanding of DBE by sector will be transmitted on a monthly basis, within six
weeks of the end of each month.

43
E. Ceiling on External Payment Arrears
14.
Definition. External payment arrears are defined as debt service obligations incurred
directly or guaranteed by the public sector to non-residents that have not been paid at the
time they are falling due, as specified in contractual agreements, except on debt subject to
rescheduling or restructuring. The program requires that no new external arrears be
accumulated at any time under the arrangement.
15.
Reporting. The accounting of nonreschedulable external arrears by creditor (if any),
with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within four weeks of the
end of each month. This accounting would include, separately, arrears owed by the federal
government and other public sector entities; and arrears owed to Paris Club creditors and
non-Paris Club creditors. Data on the arrears that creditors have agreed to reschedule shall
be provided separately.
F. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt
16.
Definition. External debt limits apply to the contracting or guaranteeing by the
public sector of new nonconcessional borrowing with nonresidents. External debt includes
debt as defined in Executive Board Decision No. 12274, point 9, as revised on
August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)). Excluded from this limit are short-term
import credits and long-term financing operations of Ethiopian Airlines.7 Also excluded
from this performance criterion are credits extended by the IMF and government counter
guarantees on project loans from both the World Bank and AfDB.
17.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal
value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting
the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.8 The discount rates used for
this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt with
a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of
debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month
average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins for
differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for
7

Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) debt is excluded from the non-concessional debt limit, because, although owned by
the government, it is run on commercial terms. It has managerial independence, it borrows externally without a
government guarantee, it publishes annual audited reports and makes sizeable profits (6 percent net profit
margin)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140) (Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt) adopted August 3, 1979, as amended by Executive Board Decision
No. 11096-(95/100) adopted October 25, 1995, and as amended on August 24, 2000
Point No. 9
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary
ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. However, arrears arising from the failure to make
payment at the time of delivery of assets or services are not debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2010
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Dominique Desruelle and Michael Atingi Ego (IMF) and
Sudhir Shetty and Sudarshan Gooptu (IDA)
May 26, 2010
Based on the joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability framework for low-income countries,
Ethiopia’s debt distress rating has fallen to low risk. The introduction of gross workers’ remittances as
a source of enhanced repayment capacity and the resilience of the Ethiopian economy to the global
economic crisis have contributed to this improvement. Notwithstanding this development, the debt
ratio continues to rise and liquidity risks are prevalent, underscoring the need to closely monitor
borrowing of the largest public enterprises, develop an integrated debt strategy for the entire public
sector, and invigorate structural reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and stimulate
growth of exports.
I. BACKGROUND AND KEY FINDINGS
1.
The last Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) undertaken in July 2009 concluded that
Ethiopia was at moderate risk of debt distress.1 Ethiopia reached its Heavily Indebted Poor Country
Initiative completion point in 2004 and benefited from debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative in 2006. Subsequently, due to higher borrowing by public enterprises, the external public and
publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt ratio rose to 14 percent of GDP at end 2008/09.2,3 Ethiopia’s current
level of external PPG debt is largely concessional and is held equally between multilateral and bilateral

1

IMF Country Report No. 09/96.

2

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

3

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with Algeria,
Bulgaria, India, Italy, Czechoslovakia and FR Yugoslavia, which account for over 4.4 percent of the debt stock in 2008/09.
Agreements regarding Russian debts (US$161.2 million) are at an advanced stage of negotiation and, thus, excluded from
this DSA. However, progress has stalled on arrears (US$240.4 million) with Libya and therefore HIPC terms are assumed.

50
creditors, with the share of non-Paris Club creditors (mostly from China and India) quite prominent at
almost 40 percent of total debt. The share of commercial creditors is very small.4
2.
The current DSA differs from earlier DSAs for Ethiopia in that it explicitly takes
account of gross workers’ remittances and this lowers Ethiopia’s debt distress risk from
moderate to low. Although the rapid rise in the financing of the public enterprises is projected to
raise the present value (PV) of debt to exports to 133 percent in 2010/11, close to the original
threshold, the peak is considerably below the adjusted threshold when the PV of debt is expressed in
terms of exports and workers’ remittances.5 The threshold for the PV of debt to exports and workers’
remittances is marginally breached under three stress tests (for export growth, non-debt creating
flows, and a combination of shocks) but the breach is just for two years at most. As a result the risk
classification of Ethiopia switches from moderate to low. The threshold based on the PV of debt-toexports ratio is also breached under three stress tests, but these breaches are reversed within 10 years
which is one of the conditions required for using remittance flows in the debt sustainability
assessment.6
3.
Relative to last year’s projections, the peak in the profile of the PV of debt is lower by about
6 percentage points, mainly because of slightly lower borrowing and interest costs. The profile of debt
service is lower than last year’s projections because large borrowings of the telecom company were
found to have a two year grace period for interest (Table 1).
II. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The macroeconomic framework over the medium term is comparable to the one
presented in the last DSA (Box 1). While the export growth in goods is weaker, growth in service
exports is expected to be stronger on account of increased export of electricity and higher investment
by the national airline, with the net effect having minimal impact on the external current account.
Given that both private and official external flows held up well during the recent global crisis, FDI
and official transfers are projected to be up slightly compared to recent years.

4

Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) debt is excluded from general government debt, because, although owned by the government, it
is run on commercial terms. It has managerial independence, it borrows externally without a government guarantee,
publishes annual audited reports, and makes sizeable profits (6 percent net profit margin).
5

Based on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score, Ethiopia is classified as a medium performer.
The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40 and 250 for the PV of debt to exports, GDP and
revenue respectively; debt service thresholds are 20 and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively. In the scenarios
that include workers’ remittances, the thresholds have been revised downward by 10 percent so that the corresponding
threshold for PV of debt to exports and remittances is 135 percent and is 18 percent for debt service to exports and
remittances and the PV of debt to GDP and remittances is 36 percent.
6

Remittances are recorded through official and unofficial channels (the latter component is estimated using banking system
flows).Remittances can be used explicitly in the DSA analysis as they are large and stable source of income for Ethiopia
and the breaches under the analysis excluding remittances are not protracted (SM/10/16).

51
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline without Remittances
5.
Under the baseline scenario, public and publicly guaranteed external debt will rise over
the next few years, but will remain below the various thresholds. In particular, the PV of debt to
exports is projected to rise by about 32 percentage points to 119 percent in 2009/10 and to rise further
next year to peak at 133 percent. Part of this increase is associated with the reduction in the discount
rate from 5 percent to 4 percent in this DSA. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio has a similar hump-shaped
profile to the debt-to-export ratio, although peaks slightly later in 2012/13 at about 18¾ percent of
GDP. The debt service ratio remains below the threshold of 20 percent of exports, but is projected to
rise rapidly over the next few years as a large fraction of public enterprises borrowing in recent years
has been on non-concessional terms. Over the next few years, the public external debt ratio is
projected to peak at about 23½ percent of GDP in 2014/15 with a change in composition since the
large public enterprise investments are mainly sourced from bilateral creditors (China, France, Italy,
and India).
6.
Under the historical scenario, the debt burden indicators are lower than under the
baseline scenario in the short term but rise above those of the baseline scenario over time. The
PV of debt to exports peaks at the value of 119 percent in 2009/10 before dipping considerably during
the forecast period. The profile of the PV of debt to GDP ratio is quite different, falling initially but
then growing over time to reach almost 27 percent of GDP by 2029/30. The reason for the different
profile in the baseline is that the projected non-interest current account deficit is considerably lower
than the historical average.
B. Sensitivity Tests
7.
Three stress tests breach the indicative threshold for the PV of debt to exports over the
forecast horizon. If export growth is slower than the historical average by 1 standard deviation, the
debt ratio peaks at 233 percent in 2011/12. Also, if the net non-debt creating flows (FDI and current
transfers) are lower than the historical average by one standard deviation, the PV of debt to export
ratio peaks at 197 percent in 2011/12. The combination of various ½ standard deviation shocks also
breaches the threshold. But because all three breaches are reversed within 10 years, Ethiopia meets the
new guideline that allows the use of the remittance flows in the debt sustainability assessment.

52

Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to fall to 7 percent in 2009/10, rising to 7¾ percent over the medium term and remain
within the 7–8 percent range in the long-run. This assessment assumes continued good harvests supporting agriculture,
increased activity in services and industry and strong growth dividend from the large infrastructure projects being built
by the public enterprises. In terms of factors of production, the long-term growth rate is based on a contribution of
2 percent output growth from labor, 3 percent output growth from capital, and a total factor productivity increase
corresponding to almost 3 percent output growth per annum. The TFP assumption is based on the recent historical
experience. The inflation rate is projected to remain in single digit in response to cautious monetary policies
combined with the assumption of moderate commodity price increases in the global market. Inflation rate in the longrun is assumed to be around 6 percent. The fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to rise from 0.9 percent in
2008/09 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and stabilize at this level to facilitate priority spending. The fiscal anchor is
an assumption of domestic financing of 1½ percent of GDP per annum.
The current account deficit (before official transfers) is projected to deteriorate to 13 percent of GDP in 2009/10
before improving to average out at 7 percent of GDP over the long term. The improvement is based on faster export
than import growth (see below). Exports of goods are projected to rebound to 16 percent growth in 2009/10, in sync
with the strong recovery in global trade and recovery from weakness in 2008/09. Over the medium term, exports
maintain healthy levels, led by coffee, oil seeds, pulses, flowers, garments and leather products. Export prices are
projected to weaken, growing at an annual rate of 1 percent, with volumes rising to 10 percent per annum. Exports of
services are projected to grow at a faster rate (over 20 percent per annum) as the investments in the airline and
electricity sectors begin to pay financial dividends in terms of export receipts The airline is projected to invest
US$3–4 billion over the next few years and triple its revenue. In addition, once the Gibe III dam is operational, annual
export receipts of US$400 million are projected from neighboring countries. Imports of goods and services have
slowed down from 32 percent growth in 2007/08 to 12 percent in 2009/10 and projected to level off at an annual
average rate of 10 percent once the impact of recent 40 percent plus devaluation takes hold.
In spite of the global slowdown, workers’ remittances remain flat in dollar terms in 2009/10 and at about 8½ percent
of GDP thereafter. Given the strong resilience of FDI during recent global economic crisis, foreign direct investment
is projected to rise this year by over ½ percent to 3½ percent of GDP and further to 4 percent of GDP by 2012/13
through continued improvements in the investment climate7.
Official transfers rise to 5¼ percent of GDP in 2009/10 and remain at this level. Loan financing on concessional
terms is projected at 1¾ percent of GDP in 2009/10 with sizeable increases in 2010/11 and 2011/12, associated with
increased concessional financing of hydro power. Subsequently, the concessional loan ratio reverts to historical levels.
Loan financing for public enterprises at non-concessional rates is projected to average about 2 percent of GDP per
annum over the next few years. In particular, the DSA includes the assumption that US$1 billion in new nonconcessional financing will be contracted by end 2010/11 to finance the purchase of ships and the Gibe dam. Over the
long term, non-concessional financing falls to ½ percent of GDP, and this contributes to a rising share of total
borrowing needs so the grant element of new borrowing falls.
The reserves coverage remains at low levels for the next few years and then dips to almost 2 months of imports by
2018/19 on account of the large debt repayments during this period. After this payment hump, the reserve coverage
gradually rises to 4 months of imports by 2029/30.

C. Baseline and Sensitivity Tests with Remittances
8.
Under the baseline scenario with remittances, public and publicly guaranteed external
debt rises during the next few years, but remains considerably below the corresponding
threshold. The PV of debt to exports and remittances is projected to peak at 89 percent in 2011/12,
compared to a threshold of 135 percent. The debt service ratio with respect to exports and remittances
remains below the threshold of 18 percent of exports and remittances, but is projected to rise to about
6 percent over the next few years as a large fraction of new public enterprises borrowing is repaid.
9.
Three stress tests breach the indicative threshold for the PV of debt to exports and
remittances over the forecast horizon. These stress tests include export growth slower than the
historical average by one standard deviation, net non-debt creating flows (FDI and current transfers)
that are assumed lower than the historical average by one standard deviation and a combination of
shocks. However, in all three cases the PV of debt to exports and workers’ remittances only breaches
the threshold for a maximum of two years (the scenario that combines various shocks).
10.
The debt profile is very sensitive to assumptions about export growth. The baseline
scenario for the export shock includes Ethiopia’s drought experience in 2001/02. Since then, exports
have grown persistently fast and no significant drought has reemerged. If we assume a structural
break in export performance since 2001/02 and use a 7-year average for the historical export growth, a
one standard deviation shock to the 7-year historical export growth rate over two years would raise
export growth to 12 percent (relative to a negative growth rate in two consecutive years under the
baseline stress test) and lower the PV of debt to exports and remittances to about 104 percent in

54
2011/12, safely below the threshold. However, even with this stronger export performance, the
threshold is breached once under the combined stress test.
11.
In sum, Ethiopia’s debt risk has been revised from a moderate to low risk rating. Various
reasons support this changes: (i) threshold breaches without using gross workers' remittances are not
protracted (i.e., less than 10 years); (ii) all baseline and stress tests that include workers’ remittances
are well below the thresholds in all but one debt burden indicator, namely debt-to-exports plus
remittances; (iii) threshold breaches under the latter only occur in three instances and for a maximum
of two years; and (iv) the shocks are financed using a significant amount of non-concessional
financing, which means that the debt trajectory after the stress represents an upper bound.
D. Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
12.
Under the baseline, public domestic debt in terms of GDP will continue to decline.
Despite significant borrowing by some of the largest public enterprises in 2009/10, domestic
financing of the general government has been contained 0.7 percent of GDP.8 Moreover, financing
needs for some infrastructure developments (for example, electric power generation) by public
enterprises have subsided. Consequently, public sector domestic debt is projected to decline to
21 percent of GDP by end 2009/10, down by about 1 percentage points from a year ago.
13.
With the increase in external debt, Ethiopia’s public debt burden (including domestic
debt) is expected to increase slightly, before trending down over the projected period. The
domestic debt profile is based on two assumptions: (i) domestic financing will be maintained at
1.0–1.5 percent of GDP per year, and (ii) annual T-bill yields will gradually increase to positive levels
in real terms. While rising in the short-run, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at about
37 percent in 2010/11 and then gradually decline to 22 percent over the long term (Figure 2). The PV
of debt to revenue ratio is projected to reach 195 percent by 2010/11 and then fall below 134 percent
after 2021/22.
14.
Some stress tests show that the PV of debt to GDP will reach to a maximum of 57 percent
of GDP during the projected period. If the real GDP growth slows down by 1 standard deviation
from historical average for two years, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed 40 percent in the
next few years before trending down during the projected period. A temporary shock to primary
balances (historical average minus one standard deviation in 2011/12) would raise the debt ratio to
44 percent in 2011/12. Furthermore, with real GDP growth and primary deficits at historical levels,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase gradually, exceeding 50 percent, over the projected period. The
PV of debt-to-revenue ratio would follow a similar path. These results highlight the importance of
maintaining the growth momentum while continuing with adjustment efforts to correct the
macroeconomic imbalances.

8

With good revenue performance, domestic financing target for 2009/10 has been reduced by 50 percent from the amount
envisaged under the original budget.

55
IV. CONCLUSION
15.
Ethiopia’s debt distress level has been lowered to a low risk rating through the use of a
new metric for debt sustainability that includes gross workers’ remittances as an important
source of debt service financing. Using this metric, no stress test breaches the indicative threshold
for the PV of debt to exports and workers’ remittances over the forecast horizon for more than two
years, compared to considerably longer stress test breaches for the standard analysis that excludes
workers’ remittances. Notwithstanding this fact, the debt ratio has risen rapidly in recent years and is
projected to continue to do so, underlining the importance for Ethiopia to keep a close tab on debt
vulnerabilities and make utmost efforts to secure grant and concessional financing for its ambitious
public enterprise investment plans. Moreover, while solvency risks appear remote, liquidity risks
remain prevalent as indicated by the low reserve coverage ratio over the next ten years. Going
forward, continued emphasis should be placed on strengthening debt management capacity by closely
monitoring the debts of the largest public enterprises, assessing potential contingent liabilities and
undertaking some kind of a debt management and performance assessment exercise. Finally, the
increase in FDI flows in the midst of the global slowdown is welcome and there is considerable scope
to attract more FDI flows and increase export potential by undertaking structural reforms that will
reduce liquidity risks going forward.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Ethiopian authorities; and IMF and World Bank staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX.

Safeguards Assessment

An update safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was completed in
December 2009 in connection with Ethiopia’s ESF-RAC approved on January 23, 2009. The
assessment found that, since the previous assessment in 2001, the NBE has implemented
some improvements to the safeguards framework but that several initiatives were a work-inprogress and substantial gaps remained. Financial transparency has improved through the
publication of independently audited financial statements, and internal audit capacity has
been strengthened. In response to the assessment’s recommendations, action has been taken
to commence Audit Committee (AC) oversight, and introduce controls and independent
reviews over program data reporting to the Fund. The authorities are also in the process of
addressing remaining safeguards issues relating to enhancing AC oversight of the external
audit mechanism, further strengthening of reserve management capacity, and introducing
bank-wide risk management practices. Going forward, the NBE Law will need to be
strengthened with regard to independence of the central bank and the potential scope for
unlimited financing of the government.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a crawl-like arrangement, in light of the
recent market developments. The authorities describe their exchange rate regime as a
managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The pace of the
depreciation, however, has been stable. Furthermore, the NBE supplies foreign exchange to
the market based on plans established at the beginning of each fiscal year that took into
account estimates of likely supply and demand. The transaction-weighted average interbank
market exchange rate on April 29, 2010, was Br 13.4510 = US$1.
Ethiopia currently maintains four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which relate to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation
of dividend and other investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legal external
loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits by
commercial banks; and (d) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to
obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain unapproved.
The staff is assessing whether a general finance and economic cooperation agreement signed
between the government of Ethiopia and China in 2006 gives rise to exchange restrictions
under Article VIII.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on July 14, 2008
(SM/08/208). Ethiopia will follow Article IV consultation cycles for program countries.

ANNEX III
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of May 2010)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provided to the Fund are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring
purposes. Despite recent progress, there are some shortcomings in real, fiscal, and balance of
payments statistics.
National Accounts: Shortcomings in the source data and compilation practices affect the
accuracy and reliability of the statistics. The GDP estimates are heavily dependent on
benchmark data that are outdated and therefore, may not reflect current economic activity.
Further, the techniques used to compile the estimates for construction, distribution, and some
other services activities do not conform to international best practice. While some progress
has been made in compiling estimates of GDP by final expenditure, there remain substantial
shortcomings, particularly in the estimation of private consumption and fixed capital
formation. The statistical discrepancies between the estimates by expenditure categories and
output remain large.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements, general government fiscal statistics
continue to be affected by shortcomings. Timely data on the consolidated operations of local
governments is unavailable. Significant discrepancies between data on the domestic and foreign
financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts continue to complicate assessment of fiscal
developments. Ensuring the integrity of consolidated budget reporting in a timely fashion will be a
continuing task.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics are broadly adequate for analytical purposes, although
there is a need for the NBE to resume data submissions based on the SRF and IMD framework. For
policy purposes, however, ensuring data collection and reporting in a timely manner continues to be
critical.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data still require improvements on coverage, valuation,
timing, and classification of transactions. These include long delays in the collection of trade and
tourist arrival data and poor data on capital flows.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

Ethiopia participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were
partially updated in early 2008. Ethiopia
participates in the GDDS project for capacity
building in statistics in Anglophone Africa
(2006–09) including macro-economic and
financial statistics and socio-demographic
statistics.

No Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) has been completed.

Press Release No. 10/238
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 11, 2010

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Ethiopia’s ESF Arrangement and
Approves US$58.7 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today the first review
of Ethiopia’s economic performance under the 14-month arrangement under the high-access
component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The Executive Board decision was taken on
a lapse of time basis1. The approval will enable Ethiopia to draw SDR 40.11 million (about
US$58.7 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 113.65 million
(about US$166.2 million).
Ethiopia has been successfully implementing policies to reduce inflation and rebuild external
reserves as agreed in the ESF-supported program. At end-2009, consumer price inflation had
declined sharply to the single digits and international reserves recovered to just over 2 months of
imports, helped by strong donor inflows and financing from the IMF. Overall, the negative
impact of the global recession has not been as severe as expected. GDP growth is projected to
ease to 7 percent in 2009/10. All of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
for end-December 2009 were met. The structural measures covered by the Fund-supported
program were also implemented.
The second ESF review is expected to be considered this fall.
The ESF arrangement for Ethiopia was approved by the Executive Board on August 26, 2009
(see Press Release No. 09/289) to help Ethiopia deal with the effects of the global recession on
its balance of payments.

1

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedures when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.
