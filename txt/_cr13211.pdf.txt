PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 27, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Overview. China’s economic performance over the past three decades has been remarkable, a testament to
its ability to implement necessary but difficult reforms. Continued success now requires another round of
decisive measures—in line with the new leadership’s expressed intention to re-energize the reform effort.
Outlook and risks. Staff expect the economy to grow by 7¾ percent this year, although with downside risks
from both external and domestic uncertainties. Since the global crisis, a mix of investment, credit, and fiscal
stimulus has underpinned activity. This pattern of growth is not sustainable and is raising vulnerabilities.
While China still has significant buffers to weather shocks, the margins of safety are diminishing.
Policies. To secure more balanced and sustainable growth, a package of reforms is needed to contain
the growing risks while transitioning the economy to a more consumer-based, inclusive, and
environmentally-friendly growth path.


In the near term, a priority is to rein in broader credit growth and prevent a further build up of risks in
the financial sector. Only if growth were to slow too sharply below the authorities’ target, on-budget
fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable
groups.



Accelerated financial sector reforms are needed to secure a safe transition to a market-based financial
system. This will combine allowing greater room for market forces (such as liberalizing interest rates in
the ‘traditional’ banking industry) with strengthened oversight, governance, and investor accountability.
While this will lead to higher borrowing costs for many firms, it is critical to reduce the large-scale
regulatory arbitrage and moral hazard evident in the current system, and to improve the allocation of
credit essential to future growth and sound finance.



The post-2008 expansion in quasi-fiscal activity needs to be gradually unwound. Key reforms to this end
should include a comprehensive revamp of local government finances, increasing SOE dividend
payments to the budget, and continuing tax reforms allowing, inter alia, a shift in the tax burden away
from regressive social contributions.



A more market-based exchange rate, with reduced intervention, will facilitate further adjustment in the
renminbi which staff assess as moderately undervalued against a broad-basket of currencies.



A range of other structural reforms will support rebalancing and help unleash new sources of growth,
such as opening markets to more competition, reforming resource prices, and gradually liberalizing the
capital account.

Benefits. With a successful transition, China will grow at a healthy pace for years to come. Activity may be
somewhat slower, a tradeoff worth making for the benefit of much higher income in the medium to long
run—a growth trajectory that will also be good for the global economy.

SETTING: OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
Context. Three decades of rapid economic growth and much reduced poverty are a
testament to China’s success in implementing reforms. For the past few years, the difficult policy
challenge has been to sustain activity in the face of adverse global conditions while achieving a
smooth transition to a more consumer-based, inclusive, and sustainable growth path. While there
has been unequivocal success on the first front—growth in China has been a solid anchor for the
world economy in recent years—progress with rebalancing has been limited and is becoming
increasingly urgent. Encouragingly, the new government—in office since March 2013—has
announced a clear commitment to re-energizing the reform effort toward more balanced and
environmentally friendly growth. Details are expected to be fleshed out in the coming months. Swift
and steadfast implementation of the reform agenda will be critical to maintaining China’s strong
track record of economic development.

spending and retail sales showing more resilience
than exports and private nonresidential investment (Figure 1). Overall, the risks to the near-term
outlook have moved more to the downside, as the expected rebound in the second half of the year
may not materialize if, for example, external demand for China’s exports remains subdued and/or the
weaker activity in recent months spills over into investment and consumer demand going forward.
On the upside, credit growth has traditionally been a leading indicator of economic activity, which
has also typically seen an upswing following a leadership transition as new local officials ramp up
investment spending.

In addition to “traditional“ bank credit, total social financing includes a range of other forms of credit, such as trust
products, corporate bonds, and equity financing.

Balance of Payments. Last year, the surplus edged up to 2¼ percent of GDP, and it is
expected to remain broadly unchanged this year (Figure 2). After years of net inflows, the capital and
financial account posted a small net outflow in 2012, reflecting changed exchange rate expectations
and a rise in global risk aversion. However, data through May 2013 indicate a resumption in net
capital inflows. Purchase of foreign exchange reserves has also increased and amounted to
US$157 billion in the first quarter of this year, compared to US$97 billion during all of 2012.
5.
Authorities’ views. The authorities saw the Chinese economy on a broadly stable—albeit
lower—growth path, with inflation well contained. They were confident that growth would reach or
slightly exceed their 7½ percent target for 2013, and viewed the slowdown since 2011 as appropriate
and reflective of on-going structural changes in China as well as globally. They agreed that inflation
would remain subdued, as food price inflation was low.

contrast, in a scenario that assumes good progress on
rebalancing and continued moderate REER appreciation, China’s current account surplus would
decline to around 1 percent of GDP by 2018 (see rebalancing scenario below). This reduction
(compared with the increase in the baseline) would reflect mainly lower private savings, while
investment would also decline, albeit by less than savings.

Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized the progress in external rebalancing, which
they saw largely as the result of the structural (and thus lasting) changes in the Chinese economy
and the global environment. They were confident that a sizable rebound in the current account
surplus (in percent of GDP) was highly unlikely in the medium term, citing higher input costs, such as
for labor and from tighter environmental protections, which would rein in export growth. At the
same time, the services deficit would continue to rise as rebalancing shifts the economy toward
consumption. They considered the staff’s current account projections in the rebalancing scenario as
reasonable, but strongly disagreed with the baseline scenario that showed a 4 percent of GDP
surplus in 2018. They argued that the baseline continued to use unrealistic assumptions, including
about the REER, and did not give enough weight to ongoing and planned reforms.
9.
On domestic rebalancing, the authorities pointed to the inherent challenges in shifting the
structure of a large and diverse economy. Nevertheless, supply-side and geographic rebalancing had
moved forward: they pointed to the higher contribution to growth from real consumption than from
real gross fixed capital formation over the past two years, strong growth of services relative to
manufacturing, rapid increases in urban and rural household incomes, and growth in central and
western provinces outstripping that in the more affluent coastal provinces. They were confident that
continuing reforms would achieve the desired rebalancing to a more consumer-based economy.

C. Risks
10.
Domestic risks. China has maintained
robust growth since the global crisis, but the heavy
reliance on credit and investment to sustain
activity is raising vulnerabilities. The consequence
is a steady build-up of leverage that is eroding the
strength of financial sector, local government, and
corporate balance sheets. This is most apparent in
the continued rapid expansion in total social
financing. After years of remaining broadly
constant as a share of GDP, the stock of total social
financing has increased sharply since 2009 (rising
by 60 percent of GDP in just four years).

Financial system. While the development of nontraditional finance marks a shift to more
market-based intermediation, the migration of activity to less regulated parts of the system
poses risks to financial stability (Figure 4). The rapid growth in some areas, notably the trust
company and corporate bond sectors, raises questions about the adequacy of supervision and
regulation, quality of underwriting standards, and pricing of risk. Moreover, the proliferation in
alternative wealth management products (WMPs), managed by banks and securities companies,
raises concerns as the composition of underlying asset pools is often opaque, maturity
mismatches create liquidity risk, and investors perceive that most WMPs are implicitly
guaranteed. Recent regulatory tightening, if strictly implemented, will reduce some of these risks,
but does not fully address concerns about weak disclosure and moral hazard. Thus, WMPs and
Trust products could over time evolve into a systemic threat to financial stability, especially if a
sudden loss of confidence were to trigger a run. A related risk is that the boom in nontraditional
sources of credit will entail a worsening of

Local government finances. There is considerable off-budget and quasi-fiscal activity in China,
primarily at the local government level, which has been ratcheted up as a means of supporting
the economy during the global crisis. Faced with revenue sources that do not match expenditure
mandates and a general prohibition on borrowing, local governments have made recourse to

off-budget activity, including land sales, to help finance social and infrastructure spending. In
particular, borrowing by local government finance vehicles (LGFVs) has increased significantly
since 2009. Expanding the definition of government to include LGFVs and off-budget funds, staff
estimates that in 2012 “augmented” government debt was 45 percent of GDP and the
“augmented” fiscal deficit was around 10 percent of GDP (Box 1). Based on these augmented
government estimates, fiscal space is considerably more limited than headline data suggest. The
large augmented fiscal deficits also raise questions about local governments’ ability to continue
financing the current level of spending and service their debts, which has implications for
financial system asset quality and the potential need for central government support. While the
size of augmented government debt and overall government resources suggests that such
problems would still be manageable, further rapid growth of debts would raise the risk of a
disorderly adjustment in local government spending. This would drag down growth, with adverse
global spillovers, and potentially lead to disruptions in the provision of social spending since
most of education, health, and welfare spending is implemented by local governments.


Real estate. The real estate market remains an important source of growth and employment
(Figure 5). However, existing distortions make the market susceptible to large cyclical swings. On
the supply side, local governments’ reliance on land sales for financing and real estate
development for growth can lead to excess supply. On the demand side, the market is prone to
bubbles since housing represents a uniquely appealing investment opportunity given real
deposit interest rates that are close to zero, significant capital account restrictions, a history of
robust capital gains, and favorable tax treatment. The measures put in place to limit real estate
credit and speculative demand have helped, although price growth has picked-up again recently.
An expansion in social housing, meanwhile, has helped sustain investment and address the need
for low-cost housing. Over the medium term, however, real estate development will need to slow
to a more sustainable pace as the market matures, which will act as a drag to economic growth.
The challenge is to avoid excess supply or policy missteps that could trigger an abrupt
investment decline and/or a sharp price correction.

11.
Diminishing space. As of now, the authorities still have sufficient tools and fiscal space to
address potential shocks, which reduces the likelihood of significant macroeconomic instability in the
near term. However, maintaining rapid and unbalanced growth would further strain financial sector,
government, and corporate balance sheets. Failure to change course and accelerate reforms—as
assumed in the staff’s baseline scenario—would thus increase the risk of an accident or shock that
could trigger an adverse feedback loop. For example, financial distress would lead to a contraction in
credit, a fall in domestic demand, and lower growth, which would make it more difficult for highlyleveraged borrowers to grow out of their debt. The timing and coincidence of events that would
trigger such an adverse feedback loop are difficult to predict, and the staff’s baseline scenario
assumes that it would occur sometime after the initial five-year projection period.

Box 1. Debt and Deficits with a Broader Definition of Government
A significant amount of activity that is fiscal in nature, such as a majority of local government infrastructure spending,
is not included in China’s general government data. Since the financial crisis, such off-budget infrastructure spending
has become an important countercyclical tool. To better assess the contribution of fiscal policy to stabilizing output
and the concomitant rise in indebtedness, staff constructed augmented fiscal data by expanding the perimeter of
government to include off-budget infrastructure spending. The main findings are that the augmented fiscal debt has
risen to above 45 percent of GDP as the augmented fiscal deficit has been both much higher and more countercyclical
than the headline government deficit. Because of data gaps the augmented fiscal data estimates rely partly on
assumptions, and thus need to be read with caution and can only serve as a complement, not a substitute, to the
standard fiscal definitions used in China (see Appendix III).
Augmented fiscal debt. The augmented fiscal debt rises to above 45 percent of GDP in 2012. The staff estimate is
within in the range—though on the low-side—of estimates published by many academics and researchers. For
example, staff of the Development Research Center (DRC), the research wing and advisory body of the China’s State
Council, recently published a similar estimate.1
Augmented borrowing is general government net lending/borrowing plus the market financing of local
government infrastructure (such as LGFV borrowing through banks, bonds, and trusts) and net withdrawal of
government cash deposits, data on which are incomplete and filled in using staff estimates. This measure captures
transactions in financial liabilities—that is, debt creating flows and thus closely corresponds to the change in
augmented fiscal debt.
Augmented fiscal deficit is augmented net borrowing plus financing from land sales (net of costs such as land
development and compensation for relocation). Land sales are treated as a financing item akin to privatization, but
do not contribute to debt accumulation. This is an analytical concept well-suited to capturing the overall impact of
fiscal policy on aggregate demand. The augmented fiscal deficit increased sharply in 2009 and more modestly in
2012, underscoring how off-budget spending has contributed to stabilizing output.
Further considerations. Estimating the augmented fiscal data involves numerous assumptions and the uncertainty
around the estimates suggests some caution in interpreting the results. Nonetheless, it is clear that China has
considerably less fiscal space than indicated by conventional general government data. Moreover, the augmented
fiscal data only capture some aspects of fiscal risk and vulnerability. Additional sources of vulnerability include
possible contingent liabilities related to the financial sector, SOEs, and actuarial shortfalls in the pension system.
However, a comprehensive assessment would also include the government’s holding of financial and nonfinancial
assets, such as the China Investment Corporation, National Pension Fund, and the equity stake in SOEs.

12.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized the importance of containing risks and continuing
reforms to change the course of economic growth, but were confident that vulnerabilities were well
under control with the countervailing measures already put in place. On the financial side, they
considered the rapid growth in trust, WMP, and corporate bond activity as important shifts toward more
market-based intermediation. They acknowledged that this process involved risks, but viewed these as
manageable, especially as they were actively committed to improving supervisory oversight. While
reported NPLs had been rising in some industries, they remained low and Chinese banks had some of the
highest capital and provisioning ratios in the world. The authorities continued to closely monitor the real
estate market, and would fine-tune policies, as necessary, to ensure the stable development of the
market, including for low-income housing. At the same time, they acknowledged that rapid growth had
helped mask some of the problems in the past, but with growth slowing, they were being especially
vigilant, particularly with respect to risks in the fiscal and financial sectors.
13.
The authorities noted staff’s focus on the augmented fiscal data. They emphasized that the
staff’s estimates involved several simplifying assumptions, and, the actual augmented position could be
stronger. Moreover, they emphasized that some LGFVs generated operational revenue and would be able
to service part of their own debt and a significant portion of LGFV spending was for the acquisition of
fixed assets. Regarding land sales, they considered this to be a viable source of financing for many years
to come and questioned why it was included as a financing item in the augmented fiscal deficit, rather
than focusing on debt-creating net borrowing requirements. Nonetheless, they acknowledged that local
government debt had become a pressing issue in some jurisdictions, and they were thus considering
further strengthening of local debt management, including the creation of a monitoring system to
contain risks. Overall, they emphasized that banks appeared comfortable with their exposures and the
underlying health of projects they had financed. The authorities noted, however, that those projects
without cash flows would be transferred to the government budget.
14.
External risks. The main external risks to China are renewed financial distress in the euro area, a
protracted period of slower euro area growth, and the risks associated with unwinding of unconventional
monetary policy in major advanced economies (see Risk Assessment Matrix). Should any of these risks
materialize, the spillovers to China would be significant given its dependence on demand from the euro
area and the United States, which together account for around 30 percent of China’s exports. In addition,
a prolonged slowdown in advanced economies or a reappraisal of U.S. or Japanese sovereign risk could
have a strong negative impact on China. At the same time, continued reforms to the Chinese financial
and services sectors, as well as further exchange rate liberalization, would be part of a global package that
could lead to higher and more stable growth worldwide. A fuller discussion of these spillovers is
contained in the 2013 Spillover Report.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities remained concerned about the impact of continued slow
growth in major advanced economies (AE), which was depressing export growth in China and other
emerging market and developing economies. They also noted that unconventional monetary policy
(UMP) in several advanced economies created adverse spillovers and policy challenges elsewhere. Besides
the well-know channels of trade, capital flows, and exchange rates, these policies in their view created
significant uncertainties for investors and consumers worldwide. They also were concerned that UMP

risked allowing AE governments to continue postponing the necessary structural reforms critical to longterm growth.

POLICIES
A. The Challenge
16.
The challenge for China now is to accelerate its transition to a more balanced and sustainable
growth path, while maintaining adequate domestic growth and stability in a global environment that
is likely to remain difficult for some time. Successful transition will require a decisive new round of
reforms that will combine to unleash new sources of growth, address the growing risks in various
parts of the economy, and make growth more inclusive and environmentally sustainable (Box 2;
Figure 6; Box3). At a strategic level, the reform agenda will need to (1) give a greater role to market
forces through continued liberalization and reduced government involvement; (2) embed strong
governance in lower-level state or state-related economic institutions, especially banks, state-owned
enterprises, and local governments; and (3) boost household incomes and consumption. In terms of
economic policies, the agenda includes a broad set of fiscal, financial sector, exchange rate, and
other structural measures. Many of these reform directions and policy objectives have been outlined
in the authorities’ recent announcements; timely and focused implementation will be crucial for
success. The necessary focus on managing risks and structural change will likely entail somewhat
slower growth in the short run, but this is not a reason to delay as vulnerabilities are rising and, even
in the best of cases, the necessary restructuring of supply and demand will take time to implement.
Moreover, looming demographic changes (Box 4) add urgency to reforms that make growth less
dependent on factor accumulation, and more on productivity gains (Box 5).
17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized the challenges, and pointed out that the new
government had already announced a set of reforms for 2013 to address them. They emphasized
their intention to embark on a comprehensive reform agenda at all levels of government and to give
market forces the primary role in resource allocation, while strengthening the framework of
regulation, oversight, and incentives to ensure the proper functioning of markets. They also noted
their commitment to address the environmental challenges and to ensure that the benefits of growth
would be shared more equitably among all parts of society.

B. Demand Management
18.
Policy stance. Near-term policies should focus on containing the build-up of risks and
advancing the structural reform agenda, while providing support to activity if needed to prevent an
unduly sharp slowdown of growth. The rapid growth in total social financing needs to be reined in
through a coordinated effort that includes tighter supervision, prudential measures, and

Box 2. The Nexus between Inclusive Growth and Rebalancing1
Since its reform and opening up period, China has made remarkable strides in lifting people’s incomes and
reducing poverty (Figure 6). In 1981, nearly 85 percent of its population lived on less than $1.25 a day, the fifth
largest poverty incidence in the world. By 2008, this proportion had fallen to 13 percent, well below the
developing country average.
However, inequality has increased sharply. According to the World Bank, China’s Gini index increased from 0.29 in
1981 to over 0.42 in 2005, higher than in the United States. Notwithstanding a downtick since 2009, official
estimates report a Gini of over 0.47 in 2012. Many unofficial estimates are even higher.2 These data suggest that
China’s growth has been less inclusive than in most other developing regions, including Latin America and a
number of its Asian peers.
In many ways, inequality has been an inevitable by-product of China’s investment and export-led growth model.
The capital stock was largely utilized to support the growth of the manufacturing sector, increasingly to meet
export demand; wages were low in large part due to the large labor dividend; and the East coast developed first
for geographical reasons, benefitting from trade and FDI.
The unbalanced nature of growth has propagated income gaps based on skills, sectors, and geography. Between
Chinese households, the most important factors explaining income inequality are education, access to health
insurance, and labor market variables, including sector of employment and enterprise size. Across China’s
provinces, divergences in per capita incomes are driven by the relative level of urbanization, financial access,
reforms, and capital-intensity. Importantly, the public sector can play a role in dampening geographic disparities,
as it has done since the “Go-West” Policy of 2000. In addition, excess liquidity has exacerbated inequality in the
last decade, with the wealth gap from asset price inflation further differentiating the income of the rich from the
poor. This includes rising property prices, which also raise issues of affordability.
Based on these findings and international experiences, a number of policies could help broaden the benefits of
growth in China. These include prudent monetary policy, a fairer fiscal tax and expenditure system, higher public
spending on health and education, deregulation and reforms to increase competition, measures to raise labor
incomes and assist vulnerable workers, and better access to finance for both households and SMEs, including in
rural areas. These policies are also in line with recent recommendations by the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank.3
In fact, many of these measures are already being put in place by the authorities in an effort to rebalance the
economy. Indeed, the change in China’s growth model envisaged in the 12th Five Year Plan would go a long way
toward facilitating the needed reduction in inequality. The income distribution plan recently approved by the
State Council further identifies many supportive reforms, including minimum wage increases, improving the tax
system, and strengthening social security.

Box 3. China: The Environment and Planned Reforms
While China’s rapid economic development has been remarkable, it has also resulted in a notable deterioration in the
environment. The World Bank estimates China is home to 16 of the world's most polluted cities. Air pollution, water quality
and supply, and resources are pressing issues that have health, social, economic, and even global implications. This note
describes some of these challenges and the policy response.
Air quality. The Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning
estimated that environmental damage in 2010 cost the equivalent
of 3½ percent of GDP. China 2030 (2013) puts the cost higher
and well above other countries. In Beijing, the Air Quality Index
(AQI) and small particulates concentrations (PM2.5) often far
exceed international standards—and though Beijing attracts the
most media attention, it ranks ninth in the list of most polluted
cities in China. Since 2005, China has been the largest emitter of
greenhouse gases and emissions of sulfur dioxide exceed that of
the United States and European Union combined. The burning of
coal is the main source of air pollution, accounting for 19 percent,
while vehicle emissions contribute 6 percent.

Water. China faces the twin challenges of water shortage and
pollution. One-third of major river systems, 85 percent of lakes, and 57 percent of underground water in monitoring
sites are polluted. Nearly 300 million rural residents lack access to clean drinking water and some major rivers have
become too polluted to supply drinking water.
Natural resources. Nearly 70 percent of China’s energy consumption comes from coal, which is the biggest source of
manmade carbon dioxide emissions and poses the greatest threat to the climate. According to the OECD (2007).1
China’s energy consumption per unit of GDP is about 20 percent higher than the OECD average. Desertification is also a
problem, due in large part to overgrazing, and leads to the loss of about 5,800 square miles of grasslands every year. In
addition, 31 percent of national land area experiences soil erosion and 85 percent of the total grassland area is
degraded.
Policy response. The authorities have made improving the environment a priority. They have introduced measures to
reduce car emissions in some cities (by restricting use to alternate days) and planted trees to combat desertification. To
improve monitoring, the authorities have established a nationwide air and water quality monitoring network, which was
recently strengthened; set a new standard for air quality monitoring in 74 cities, and will extend it to 190 cities by the
end of the year; and report weekly water quality data from 131 monitor sites on the nation's major river systems.
Regulations aimed at raising environmental standards have been passed and enforcement efforts stepped up. However,
the OECD (2012) highlights that enforcement remains a key challenge because it is mainly delegated to local
governments that lack sufficient capacity; fines are too small to act as an effective deterrent; and criminal charges, while
possible, are difficult in practice and rarely used.2
Plans. The 12th Five-Year Plan for Environmental Protection (2011–15) sets out a blueprint with seven major targets to
achieve by 2015, with a special emphasis on improving water and air quality and protecting ecosystems. Progress
reports, including to the public, are due this year and 2015. The 12th Five Year Economic Plan also promotes
environmentally-friendly growth, as three out of seven priority industries are aimed at cleaner and more sustainable
growth. It also calls for advancement of environmental protection tax reform and improvement in waste disposal fees.
Resource tax reforms have been piloted in some regions since 2010 and, in 2011; taxes on crude oil and natural gas
were raised (and converted to an ad-valorem basis). A comprehensive environmental protection tax plan has been
submitted to the State Council this year, which covers water ,solid waste, emissions, and noise. Price signals could be
better used to promote the efficient allocation of resources and, more broadly, achieving the desired domestic
rebalancing would help reduce the strain on the environment by shifting activity away from manufacturing to the less
resource intensive and less polluting service sector.

Box 4. China’s Looming Demographic Changes
China is at the dawn of a demographic shift as the
economy will soon start to be weighed down by a
shrinking workforce and aging population. The workingage (15–64) population will start to fall in less than a
decade due to declining fertility, reflecting the one-child
policy. The cohort of 25‒39 year olds—the core industrial
workers—will shrink even faster, with implications for the
pattern of growth reliant on building new factories and
finding a ready supply of workers. The dependency ratio
(population younger than 15 and older than 64 as a share
of the working-age population), which declined for
decades, is projected to increase from 13½ percent in
2010 to around 30 percent by 2030.

These demographic changes imply that China will meet

decade.1 As the surplus labor dwindles, labor cost will rise,
which would affect prices, incomes, and corporate profits
in China and would have implications for trade,
employment, and price developments in key trading
partners. For China, this transformation makes it even
more important to switch from an extensive to an
intensive growth model.

Box 5. Toward Intensive Growth
Time is running out on the current model which has relied on extensive growth—factor accumulation
and relocation of labor from the countryside to factories. Without accelerating reform, vulnerabilities
will increase as will the probability that China’s convergence process stalls. Moving to high-income
status will require transitioning to a growth model that is more reliant on total factor productivity
(“intensive” growth).
Context. Growth has moderated, even as investment
has risen and reliance on credit has increased,
pointing to diminishing returns to the current model
(which has depended heavily on factor accumulation).
High investment has resulted in excess capacity and
the return on investment has continued to decline to
around 16 percent, down from 25 percent in the early
1990s.
An extension of the baseline scenario beyond
2018 illustrates the consequences of continuing the current growth model. The scenario
assumes a further build-up of excess capacity and misallocation of resources. With demographic
trends implying a decline in the labor force after 2015 and exhaustion of surplus labor around 2020,
the returns on investment would be progressively lower than envisaged, which would cause
bankruptcies and financial losses. China’s own and cross-country experience suggests that the
outcomes could be costly not just in terms of direct fiscal cost of clean-up, but also because the
financial losses and deleveraging would in turn generate an adverse feedback loop that hampers
employment and growth. The convergence process would stall, with the economy slowing to
around 4 percent, and GDP per capita would remain about a quarter of that of the United States
through 2030.

The transition from middle-to high-income status will be accompanied with slower growth. Average
TFP growth is likely to fall below its pre-crisis level, consistent with the typical slowdown in TFP growth most
countries go through during their transition from middle to high income. This, together with a declining labor
force and more moderate pace of investment, means average GDP growth could fall to around 6 percent
during 2013‒30 (down from a pre-crisis average GDP growth rate of 10 percent). At such a pace China’s per
capita GDP would be about 40 percent of that of the United States by 2030.

market discipline, which would lead to higher interest rates for many borrowers. These policies are
likely to dampen activity in the near term, but will do so in a way that supports the transition to a
more sustainable growth path. If growth were to slow too sharply below this year’s target, then onbudget fiscal stimulus could be used. Such stimulus, however, should focus on measures that
support domestic rebalancing, such as reductions in social contributions, subsidies to consumption,
or targeted social safety net spending. Using on-budget stimulus would improve transparency,
prevent a further build-up of risks in the financial sector, allow spending to be allocated more in line
with social and economic priorities, and lower financing costs by replacing more expensive
commercial financing with government debt.
19.
Authorities’ views. The authorities considered the current mix of prudent monetary and
proactive fiscal policy to be appropriate. They noted that growth, employment, and inflation were
progressing broadly as expected, and hence saw little need to alter the macroeconomic policy stance
at this point. If necessary, they agreed with the relative benefits of on-budget fiscal stimulus. While
growth in monetary aggregates this year had so far exceeded forecasts, the central bank would take
measures to ensure appropriate growth for money and credit. Policy fine-tuning would continue to
draw on a variety of measures, including open-market operations, macroprudential measures, and
window guidance.

Financial Sector
20.
Priorities. Accelerating financial sector reform is key for preventing a further build-up of risks
and tapping new sources of growth. The priorities are to:


liberalize interest rates, to allow market-pricing of deposits and lending by the banks and reduce
regulatory arbitrage;



strengthen regulation and supervisory oversight, especially in areas exhibiting rapid growth such
as trusts and wealth management products;



improve the institutional setting by introducing explicit deposit insurance, improving the
resolution framework for financial institutions, and removing the moral hazard stemming from
the perception that all interest-bearing assets are implicitly guaranteed; and



move to using interest rates as the primary tool of monetary policy (Box 6).

Addressing the moral hazard problem is especially critical. With China’s financial markets developing
rapidly, effective pricing of risk requires tolerance for occasional losses or haircuts on interestbearing financial instruments, such as corporate bonds or wealth management products without a
formal principal guarantee. Routinely shielding investors from such losses, by contrast, perpetuates
the perception of implicit guarantees and artificially depresses risk premia, and contributes to
excessive growth in credit and investment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Box 6. Priorities for Financial Sector Reform
Further steps toward a more commercially oriented financial system and market-based monetary policy
framework will improve the allocation of resources, facilitate internal rebalancing, and safeguard
financial stability. The priorities are:


Interest rate liberalization. Notable progress has already been made with interest rate
liberalization, including the greater flexibility introduced in mid-2012. As the next step, the
maximum deposit rate should be raised further, for example, by increasing the upward float to
30 percent to match the downward flexibility in lending rates. This will reduce regulatory arbitrage
that currently favors wealth management products over bank deposits.



Supervision and regulation. As financial reform progresses and interest rates are liberalized, close
monitoring and effective supervision of banks, particularly smaller institutions, are critical to guard
against the risk of destabilizing competition. At the same time, a continued upgrading in the
regulation and supervision of non-bank and off-balance sheet intermediation is needed to ensure
that risks are properly disclosed, institutions hold adequate buffers against potential losses,
markets operate transparently, and the pace of credit creation does not result in systemic risks. In
this regard, the recent steps to tighten the rules for banks’ wealth management products are
welcome.



Institutional setting. Introducing deposit insurance and improving the resolution framework as
soon as possible is key to allow for an orderly exit of weak or failing financial institutions. Similarly,
investors must be allowed to suffer principal losses on nonguaranteed products, including
corporate bonds and trust products, to promote risk-awareness and prevent the perception that all
financial investments are implicitly guaranteed.



Use interest rates as primary instrument of monetary policy. Given the increasing complexity
of the financial system, administrative controls on bank credit are losing effectiveness and should
be progressively replaced by money market interest rates as the primary tool of monetary policy.1
Specifically, the central bank should begin by establishing a stable short-term interest rate (sevenday or overnight interbank repo) as a precursor toward instituting a policy rate. The recent
introduction of the standing liquidity operations will over time facilitate this effort by reducing
interest rate volatility.

Progress also needs to continue in improving the commercial orientation of banks, with particular
emphasis on prudent credit allocation and timely recognition of problem loans. Strong risk
management and vigilant oversight by the authorities are indispensable for the success of financial
reform, and indeed for opening up the capital account without the risk of major domestic financial
instability or adverse spillovers.

21.
Reform and Stability. In many countries, financial liberalization was followed by an unintended
loosening of financial conditions that ultimately led to systemic financial distress.2 As the move to a more
market-based system accelerates, implementation needs to safeguard financial stability, including
through appropriately tight overall liquidity conditions and steps to reduce moral hazard to ensure that
banks do not engage in potentially destabilizing competition. Even so, there will likely be some financial
stress in individual firms and banks, which is normal (and necessary) in market-based systems.
Weaknesses will need to be monitored carefully and resolved transparently. It will also be important to
ensure adequate provisioning and transparent recognition of asset quality problems in the broader
financial system. At any rate, the risks of delay are prohibitive, as accelerated arbitrage from traditional
into new forms of intermediation, lack of proper pricing of risk, and continued ‘dual-track’ financial
development would escalate the imbalances and associated risks. The authorities have taken measures to
help contain risks, including in recent months, asking banks to monitor lending to certain sectors, control
lending to LGFVs and property developers, and tighten rules on WMPs. In addition, continued progress in
implementing the recommendations from the 2011 Financial Sector Stability Assessment would facilitate
the move to a more liberalized financial system (Appendix II).
22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities’ agreed with the thrust of the staff advice and are committed
to accelerating financial sector reform. A priority for this year is to make further progress on interest rate
liberalization and, as recently announced by the central bank, conditions are broadly in place to introduce
deposit insurance. The central bank intends to continue to gradually move toward greater reliance on
market-based methods for the implementation of monetary policy. Meanwhile, the various regulatory
agencies expressed their commitment to continue improving prudential oversight, with particular focus
on the rapidly growing nonbank finance.

Fiscal Policy
23.
Medium-term adjustment. The augmented fiscal deficit estimates indicate that fiscal policy—
especially local government off-budget and LGFV activity—has played a significant role in supporting
demand since the global crisis. As a result, the augmented fiscal position has deteriorated significantly.
Though the augmented debt is still at a manageable level (see Debt Sustainability Analysis: Tables 7–8),
the augmented government deficit should be gradually reduced to a more comfortable level. Staff’s
baseline assumes a gradual unwinding of stimulus through a decline in the budget deficit and reduction
in local government infrastructure spending (consistent with the retrenchment in 2010–11). Development
of a medium-term fiscal plan that outlines the path for government revenues, spending, deficits and
debts over a rolling (annually updated) multiyear horizon would facilitate adjustment. This should also
include all local government operations and thus help curb projects with low economic or social returns.
24.
Local government finances. To ensure China’s fiscal soundness, a top priority is to strengthen
the management, transparency, and overall governance framework of local government finances. One
element is ensuring that local governments have adequate resources to deliver the necessary social and
infrastructure spending, by aligning revenue responsibilities with expenditure mandates. Options to

achieve this include giving local governments more control over revenue items, adjusting revenue sharing
arrangements, and reducing expenditure mandates. Another challenge is to mitigate risk by
strengthening fiscal management. This can be achieved by: (i) establishing and enforcing an
institutional framework that limits government debt, contingent liabilities, and off-budget borrowing
(such as a fiscal responsibility law); (ii) integrating government and LGFV investment spending into
an overall public investment strategy; and (iii) improving data and transparency on off-budget fiscal
operations, fiscal risks, and contingent liabilities.

revenue—about 5 percent of GDP—than the
personal income tax (1 percent of GDP). Social contributions are mandatory for most urban workers,
though only around 85 percent contribute, whereas just 3 percent of workers pay income tax on
labor income. Shifting the tax burden away from regressive social contributions would help boost
consumption, reduce inequality, and facilitate rebalancing. Staff recommends that an initial step
toward lowering social contributions could be made now, while continuing with the needed
comprehensive social security reform to further improve coverage and ensure actuarial soundness.
The budget should compensate the social security funds for the lost revenue, while ensuring deficit
neutrality by taking offsetting fiscal measures that are more efficient, progressive, and supportive of
rebalancing. Moreover, a strong case could be made for shifting the legacy costs of pension reform
as well as the welfare components of the pension system to the budget. With offsetting budget
measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, this would make room for a significant reduction in social
contributions, which would cover only the insurance aspects of the system.

Other tax reforms. Other tax reforms that support rebalancing and promote efficiency
should continue to be implemented. These include replacing the specific business taxes with the
VAT, which will help broaden the tax base, minimize cascading, and reduce evasion. At the same
time, expanding the property tax pilot will help contain speculation in the real estate sector and
boost local government revenues (the pilot covers Chongqing and Shanghai and has a narrow
base—for example, in Shanghai existing homeowners were grandfathered and in a sample of new
purchases about 20 percent were subject to the property tax).
27.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were committed to ensuring medium-term fiscal
sustainability, and they agreed on the importance of strengthening the fiscal framework to
better manage local government finances. They favored allowing limited, transparent, and
well-regulated local government borrowing, and considered development of a municipal bond

market as part of the solution to the challenges facing local governments. They agreed with the
benefits of lowering social contributions, but were concerned about the cost and financial
implications for the social security system. They would consider the possibility as part of a
comprehensive social security reform. They were committed to continuing tax reforms, especially
replacing the specific business tax with the VAT. They were also considering other taxes that could be
well-suited to collection and control by local governments, including broadening the pilot property
tax program.

by reducing the need to sterilize reserve purchases,
facilitate further gradual capital account opening, and help ensure that investment decisions pay due
regard to exchange rate risk. A number of quantitative models and indicators are used to assess the
external position (Box 7). Overall, staff considers that the renminbi remains moderately undervalued
against a broad basket of currencies. Given the assessment of the renminbi as moderately
undervalued, greater flexibility is likely to result in some further real appreciation of the renminbi
over time, which will help with domestic rebalancing by making investment in nontradables more
attractive and boosting household purchasing power.
29.
Capital account. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to further open the capital account
(Box 8). A gradual liberalization will reinforce financial sector reform, improve the efficiency of
investment, and ease overheating pressures in the domestic property market by providing
opportunities for portfolio diversification. However, capital account opening must be carefully timed
and sequenced with other reforms, especially as regards the financial sector—which needs to be able
to effectively intermediate large and potentially volatile cross-border flows—and the exchange rate
regime—which needs to be flexible to serve as a shock absorber.
30.
Outward spillovers. Staff research suggests that capital account opening in China would
prompt sizable portfolio stock adjustments resulting in large gross flows in both directions. On
balance, this stock adjustment could initially result in net capital outflows as China’s large pool of
savings is diversified internationally (Box 9). Over the longer term, the direction and size of net

Staff’s assessment is that the external position appears moderately stronger and the currency moderately
undervalued compared with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
Recent balance of payments developments. The current
account surplus is projected to rise slightly this year and
further over the medium term to about 4 percent of GDP.
While capital flows turned negative in the second half of last
year, on the back of changed exchange rate expectations
(from one-way appreciation to more balanced
expectations), this has been reversed in recent months with
renewed inflows and appreciation pressures. Overall, these
developments suggest that the external position has
remained broadly unchanged over the past year.

International reserves and NFA. Reserve accumulation in the second half of 2012 was around zero, a
significant change from a decade of large increases. In recent months, however, the pace of reserve
accumulation has picked up again, and China’s reserves continue to be considerably above all standard metrics.
With large net foreign assets (around 30 percent of GDP) China’s international investment position
vulnerabilities are low.
External Balance Assessment (EBA)


In this year’s EBA, the methodology has been refined, some data revised, and the assessment period shifted
to 2012 from 2011. The current account balance approach estimates that China’s 2012 current account
surplus, adjusted for cyclical factors, is 1.8 percent of GDP above the level consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies (compared with 2.6 percent of GDP in last year’s EBA). Consistent with the approach in
last year’s ESR (which applied some rounding and a range of +/- 1 percent to the current account point
estimate reflecting uncertainty about the output gap), this implies a current account gap of about
1‒3 percent of GDP—equivalent to RMB undervaluation of about 4–12 percent.



The 2013 EBA’s REER approach indicates that the renminbi is 17 percent weaker than consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policies. However, the EBA estimate for China’s REER is surrounded by large
uncertainty, with the unexplained residual accounting for 8 percentage points of the estimated
undervaluation.



Estimates using CGER methodology indicate an undervaluation of 15 percent for the current account
approach, and an overvaluation of 7 percent for the REER approach. The external sustainability approach
indicates the renminbi is 9 percent below the level consistent with unchanged NFA.

On balance, recent developments and available quantitative estimates suggest that the renminbi remains
moderately undervalued by 5-10 percent relative to a level consistent with fundamentals and desired policies.

Other investment. Foreign borrowing is subject to a ceiling (for short-term borrowing) or approval
requirements (for long-term borrowing), but lending abroad by banks and affiliated companies is
largely unrestricted. The holding of cross-border accounts requires SAFE approval.

Despite pervasive capital controls, capital flows
have been considerable. While portfolio flows
remain well below those of other emerging markets,
other investment flows—both assets and liabilities—
are on par with economies that have more open
capital accounts. In particular, inflows and outflows of
short-term borrowing have each been on the order of
10 percent of GDP (though largely offsetting).

Box 9. Potential Spillovers from Capital Account Liberalization in China
Approaches. Two complementary approaches are used to provide some indications for possible capital flows
resulting from capital account liberalization in China: (i) the experience during episodes of capital account liberalization
in advanced or emerging economies since the 1970s, and (ii) a cross-country regression analysis of bilateral portfolio
exposures.
Historical precedents. Past episodes of capital account liberalization were followed by sharp increases in gross
international assets but ambiguous changes in net capital flows. Kaminsky and Schmukler (2003) date capital account
liberalization episodes in about 20 advanced and emerging markets since the 1970s.1 In the five years following capital
account liberalization, gross foreign assets on average increased by 19 percent of GDP. The increase in net capital flows
depended on many factors: the global and domestic business cycle, growth prospects, and—importantly for the
comparison with China—the interaction with financial sector liberalization. When capital account opening took place
soon after financial sector liberalization, then the net inflows in portfolio and other investment were smaller and often
negative. Net capital inflows in portfolio and other investment did not respond significantly to capital account
liberalization in the two countries in the sample (U.S. and Japan) in which financial sector liberalization was only
undertaken later.

Cross-country regression. A panel regression for all global bilateral portfolio exposures is estimated based on the
model in Forbes (2010),2 focusing on portfolio equity and debt assets (the most restricted capital flows into and out of
China). The results suggest that capital controls in the source country of international assets significantly restrict the
buildup of international portfolio assets. In the extreme, and assuming no offsetting changes in the macrofinancial
environment, the regression coefficients suggest that full capital account liberalization in China could prompt a one-off
adjustment—although likely phased over several years—in the stock of Chinese resident assets held abroad of up to
25 percent of GDP and in the stock of nonresident assets in

capital flows with an open capital account will depend on fundamental drivers such as real interest
rates, saving, and growth prospects, which generally point to net capital flows toward fast-growing
developing and emerging market economies like China.
31.
Authorities’ views. Regarding the external sector assessment, the authorities continued to
express strong reservations about the quantitative models. They considered that the exchange rate
was close to its equilibrium value. The authorities remain committed to moving to a more marketbased exchange rate, including a further widening of the exchange rate band. They noted that with
trend reserve accumulation having declined, recent intervention is an anomaly triggered in part by
unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies. Regarding capital account liberalization,
they emphasized that liberalization would continue at a measured pace consistent with fostering
domestic stability and avoiding disruptions to external markets.

Other Structural Reforms
32.
A wide range of additional reforms will support the transformation to more balanced,
inclusive, and sustainable growth. These include:


Opening markets. Many markets are considered strategic and still largely reserved for big SOEs.
These include many service sector and upstream industries, which has an impact throughout the
supply chain. Allowing more domestic and foreign competition in these sectors will help
generate the total factor productivity gains needed to sustain growth.3 Moreover, these sectors
are often labor-intensive, and making them more competitive will help boost household income.



Resource pricing. The progress already made in raising resource prices is welcome, but more
needs to be done. Raising factor input costs (such as energy, land, and water), including through
taxation, will help rationalize investment, especially in energy-intensive sectors, and help protect
the environment.4 Moreover, stronger enforcement of environmental regulations—and higher
fines as existing ones often provide little deterrent—will promote more environmentally friendly
development.



SOE dividends. The SOE sector in China is highly profitable (mainly due to large profits in
industries where entry and competition is limited), yet only a fraction of profits are transferred to
the budget. In 2011, central government SOEs earned profits of RMB 913 billion, but paid only
RMB 77 billion in dividends, of which just RMB 4 billion went to the budget (0.4 percent of
profits). Instead, most of the profits are used to finance investment, as the opportunity cost of
these funds is extremely low; transferred among subsidiaries of state holding companies
(dividends are paid on the basis of holding company net profits); or held as retained earnings.
Increasing the dividends SOEs pay to the budget will rationalize investment, improve financial
discipline, and provide welcome additional fiscal revenue.

Data. Staff welcomes the progress that has been made in recent years in improving statistics.
China, however, remains one of only two G-20 members that do not subscribe to the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and participate in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
(CPIS). Staff encourages the authorities to graduate from the General Data Dissemination Standards
(GDDS) to the SDDS and participate in the CPIS as soon as possible.
34.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that they plan to improve further the pricing of
natural resources. Over the near term, the pricing of electricity, oil and other raw materials will be
moved toward a more market-determined basis. On SOE dividends, the authorities noted that
collections were already high, especially for banks, but allowed that there was room for improvement
in the area of holding companies and subsidiaries. On data provision, the authorities will continue to
explore ways to collaborate with the Fund.

The Dividends of Reform, at Home and Globally
35.
Sustainable Growth. The current growth model is showing diminishing returns and needs to
adapt (Box 6). Reforms are urgent and intended by the authorities. This is critical to avoid a sharp
correction later on, and to lift China onto a new growth path. The package of reforms described
above will likely entail slower growth than projected in the staff baseline scenario as the economy
adjusts to the new path (see rebalancing scenario in Table 6). However, this is a tradeoff worth
making, because it comes with the benefit of more durable and sustainable long-term growth and
higher consumption. The result will be an economy that distributes prosperity more broadly, better
protects the environment, and delivers substantially higher living standards.
36.
Spillovers. Ensuring better-quality and sustainable growth in China will undoubtedly benefit
the rest of the world. The benefits are likely to materialize over the medium to long term as payoffs
from reforms materialize. In particular, stronger demand from China will generally support trading
partners’ exports. At the same time, ensuring stable and sustainable growth in China will reduce tail
risks and provide further support to global growth. In the short to medium term, the spillovers to the
global economy from slower growth in China can be mitigated if the rest of world, especially the
most systemic economies, implements the fiscal, financial, and structural policies needed in their own
economies. Implementing reforms in a global and coordinated manner will reduce the likelihood of
downside risks and lift global output significantly over the long term.
37.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the thrust of the staff analysis on the impact
of rebalancing. It was important, they added, that the global community understand that reform in
China would entail somewhat slower growth than in the past, but with the benefit of sustained
income gains over the medium to long run—an outcome that would provide lasting benefits to the
global economy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Overview. A history of bold economic reforms has helped China generate three decades of
rapid growth and lift more than 500 million citizens out of poverty. Since the global crisis, the

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

resilience of China’s economy has also provided a welcome boost to global demand, and substantial
progress has been made with external rebalancing as the current account surplus has been sharply
reduced. However, China's pattern of growth has become too reliant on investment and an
unsustainable surge in credit, resulting in rising domestic vulnerabilities. Thus, the transformation of
the economy is not complete, and continued success now requires a decisive new round of reforms.
The Chinese authorities have announced the broad direction of economic reforms as well as policy
priorities for 2013 that are intended to rebalance growth and reduce risks. Turning these plans into
specific policies and actions that are successfully implemented will achieve the goal of transitioning
to a more balanced and sustainable growth path that relies more on consumption, is more inclusive,
and better safeguards the environment.
39.
Outlook and risks. This year, China’s economy is projected to maintain growth around
7¾ percent, with downside risks; inflation is expected to remain subdued. From the external side, the
risk of slower global growth or renewed stress in world financial markets continues to weigh on the
outlook. On the domestic front, vulnerabilities have increased in the financial, government, and real
estate sector sectors. Rapid financial innovation is compounding the risks, as more lightly regulated
entities account for a growing share of new lending, while implicit guarantees on all interest-bearing
assets undercut market discipline. While China has the resources and capacity to maintain stability
even in the face of an adverse shock, the margins of safety are narrowing. Continuing down this path
leaves China vulnerable to the risk of a sharp downturn in growth, with significant adverse spillovers
to the rest of the world.
40.
Balancing reforms and near-term growth. The near-term challenge is to contain the
build-up of risks and advance structural reforms. Activity has become too reliant on an unsustainable
growth in total social financing and investment, especially local government infrastructure spending.
It is necessary, therefore, to rein in broad credit growth, as the threat to financial stability dominates
the short-term benefit of shoring-up growth. If growth were to slow too much below the authorities’
7½ percent target, then on-budget fiscal stimulus should be used to support activity, with an
emphasis on measures that support rebalancing and protect vulnerable households.
41.
Monetary and financial policies. A more commercially-oriented and liberalized financial
system is critical to prevent a further build-up of risks, foster a more efficient allocation of
investment, and boost household capital income. The priorities are to liberalize interest rates;
strengthen regulation and supervisory oversight; establish a robust and transparent framework for
resolving bad debts and troubled financial institutions; and move to using interest rates as the
primary tool of monetary policy. Ensuring the effective pricing of risk is essential, and requires
resolving the moral hazard problem rooted in the perception of widespread implicit guarantees.
Interest rates will need to play an increasingly stronger role in managing monetary conditions,
especially with more intermediation taking place outside traditional bank lending. In transitioning to
a more market-based financial system, care should be taken to safeguard financial stability.
42.
Fiscal policy. Off-budget and quasi-fiscal activity, especially at the local government level,
has played a significant role in supporting demand since the global financial crisis. This support
should be gradually unwound over the medium term. Containing the risks from rising local

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

government debts while protecting priority social and infrastructure spending requires strengthening
the management, transparency, and overall governance framework of local government finances.
Shifting the tax burden away from regressive social contributions to more progressive and efficient
forms of taxation would help boost consumption, reduce inequality, and promote rebalancing.
43.
External sector. As in the past, the staff’s assessment of China’s external position and
exchange rate uses a broad range of inputs, including recent developments in the external accounts,
medium-term balance of payments projections, and quantitative models of the current account and
the real effective exchange rate. Overall, staff assess the external position as moderately stronger and
the currency moderately undervalued compared with the level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. A more market-based exchange rate system, with
reduced intervention, would support rebalancing by allowing the renminbi to appreciate over time.
44.
Structural reforms. A range of additional reforms will help strengthening governance,
liberalizing the economy, and rebalancing domestic demand. A gradual opening of the capital
account, appropriately sequenced with financial sector and exchange rate reforms, will support other
aspects of the reform agenda. Other priorities include opening markets to more domestic and
foreign competition, especially service sectors and upstream industries currently reserved for SOEs;
raising resource prices and taxes, which will help rationalize investment and protect the environment;
and increasing the dividends SOEs pay to the budget.
45.
Reform dividends. Accelerating the reform process is critical to lift China onto a new growth
path and avoid a sharp correction later on. The package of reforms described above will likely entail
a moderate slowdown in growth as the economy adjusts to the new path. However, this is a tradeoff
worth making, because it comes with the benefit of more durable and sustainable long-term growth.
The result will be an economy that distributes prosperity broadly, better protects the environment,
and delivers substantially higher living standards. Moreover, the benefits would spread beyond China
and help foster robust and sustainable global growth.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Protracted period

European growth

market stress

Likelihood (Over next one to five years)
Medium
Financial stress in the euro area could re-emerge and bank-sovereign-real
economy links could re-intensify as a result of stalled or incomplete delivery of
policy commitments at the national or euro area level (e.g., Banking Union), or
adverse developments in some peripheral countries. The consequences would
include further financial fragmentation and continued impairment of credit
transmission, strains in cost of market access of peripheral sovereigns and
negative shocks to growth that could lead to a protracted period of slow growth
in the medium *term.
High
The adverse impact of public and private sector debt and deleveraging on the
real economy may be larger than currently expected, leaving large output gaps
and potentially spurring debt-deflation dynamics. Financial market
fragmentation becomes entrenched. Structural reforms are delayed,
unemployment remains high, and investment subdued, reducing potential
output. Core economies weaken due to trade links and confidence effects,
reducing growth in the euro area to around ¼ percent over the medium-term.
(spring 2013 WEO scenario).

Impact and Policy Response
Medium
Main impact would be through lower export demand. GDP growth
would slow relative to baseline by close to ¾ percentage points.
Policy response: If growth were to slow too sharply below the authorities’
target, on-budget fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports
rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.

High
Capacity utilization rates in export sectors would decline, leading to a
fall in profitability, rising unemployment, and diminished ability to
service corporate debt. Bank asset quality would deteriorate and
tighter financing conditions would further slow investment and
growth.
Policy response: Advance structural reforms to accelerate the transition
to domestic consumption-based growth.

Medium
Though the fiscal outlook is different in the United States and Japan, bond
market stress in both countries would materialize through an increased
sovereign risk premium, and higher government bond yields in the mediumterm. Such developments could undermine the recovery of private domestic
demand and have severe global financial market repercussions. The sovereign
risk premium could increase by 200 bp (spring 2013 WEO scenario).
High
Mispricing of risk assets followed by a broad-based correction in valuations. High
asset valuations and low volatility may increasingly reflect excessive risk-taking
and divergence from fundamentals (of particular concern is possible mispricing
of credit risk). If confidence cracks, market reversal could be material, with high
volatility.

High
Main impact would be through lower export demand.

Side effects from exit modalities. Market volatility and higher-than-expected
increases in long-term rates could occur as a result of changes in monetary
policy stances and operations, and would be compounded by policy mistakes
(tightening too early or too late). In the worst case, this could lead to a sudden
fall in asset prices and sharp reversal of capital flows, stalling the global
economic recovery.

Policy response: If growth were to slow too sharply below the authorities’
target, on-budget fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports
rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.

Policy response: If growth were to slow too sharply below the authorities’
target, on-budget fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports
rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.
Medium
The fallout from a large asset price correction would depress demand
for Chinese exports, hurting economic growth. Financial linkages
would also be significant, as rising risk aversion could hurt inflows,
while financial market volatility would complicate progressive financial
liberalization in China (e.g., capital account liberalization).

Low
The authorities’ array of macro-control measures to cool the real estate
market and promote affordable housing have been largely successful in
moderating the market, but the focus on administrative/control does not
address the underlying propensity to real estate boom-bust cycles and
carries the risk that policies either underperform or overshoot.

High
Employment in construction and related sectors would fall. Domestic demand,
including consumption, would decline. Financial losses and deteriorating asset
quality would restrict subsequent credit growth and investment. This would
lower China's imports from the rest of the world.

The combination of slower growth, higher investment, and the growing

Medium
Investment could continue to outstrip both external and domestic
demand, leading to a further build-up of excess capacity and
increased misallocation of resources.

Low
Local governments’ large quasi-fiscal and off-budget activities raise
questions about their ability to service their debts, with implications for
financial system asset quality, and to finance continued spending at
current levels.

Policy response: Removal of distortions that create excessive real estate
investment and hold back demand for housing in urban areas, acceleration of
social housing, and greater reliance on price based instruments of monetary
control. Ensure that bank lending standards and risk management practices
are sound, while continuing to deploy countervailing macroprudential
measures (such as lower loan-to-value ratios).

Policy response: Accelerate financial reform. Elements include: further interest
rate liberalization, stronger regulation including of off-balance sheet and
nonbank financial products, proper development of capital markets and
nonbank channels of intermediation, and ultimately capital account
liberalization.
Medium
Bank balance sheets would worsen, constricting credit growth and investment.
Policy response: Revamp intergovernmental fiscal relations, improve
monitoring and control of local government fiscal activity, and ensure that
local governments have sufficient resources to provide needed social
spending and infrastructure.

High
The returns on investment would be much lower than envisaged, which
would cause bankruptcies and large financial losses. Such financial losses
would in turn hamper employment and growth.
Policy response: Decisive, comprehensive reforms to rebalance the
economy.

Appendix III. Staff Estimates of Augmented Fiscal Data5
This note lays out the data and assumptions used in calculating this staff’s estimates of augmented fiscal
balances and debt. Section I explains staff’s estimate of the general government data. Section II presents the
assumptions used to estimate the augmented fiscal deficit and net borrowing; Section III does the same for
the augmented debt. Section IV presents additional considerations on the potential perimeter of public
sector liabilities.

with Government Finance Statistics practices,
considers the stabilization fund part of the general government, recording cash transactions with the
stabilization fund “below the line,” as transactions with other government accounts would be treated.
Staff also add external and some local government (“on-budget”) debt to the general
government balance sheet. The external debt stock is calculated from the flows of external financing,
with an adjustment for estimated amortization. The local government is based on the NAO (2011)
estimate for the stock at end-2010, and the NAO (2013) report and assumptions about amortization are
used to estimate 2011–12 data. Bonds issued by the central government on behalf of local governments
are already included in the official general government debt stock. General government expenditure
(and thus, the deficit) is adjusted by the amount of this additional financing.
B. Construction of “Augmented Fiscal Deficit” and “Net Borrowing”
The “augmented fiscal deficit” and “net borrowing” add to the general government data the quasi-fiscal
activities which are currently classified as off-budget, chiefly infrastructure spending. Augmented fiscal
deficit is equal to augmented net borrowing plus the net proceeds from land sales. The estimates are
constructed based on financing (below-the-line) data, and an above-the-line approach is used as a crosscheck. The calculation requires numerous assumptions to fill in data gaps, highlighting the uncertainty
surrounding the estimates.

Market financing is the borrowing by local
government entities from the commercial banks, trust companies, and corporate bond market. The
“augmented net borrowing” excludes net land sales, but is otherwise the same as the augmented
fiscal deficit.

to make the expected contribution to the
2009‒10 stimulus package. Hence local governments largely channeled their borrowings through
LGFVs and other government-related entities that typically borrow from policy banks, commercial
banks, and more recently from trust companies and the corporate bond market.

LGFVs are legally distinct entities, often receiving public credit enhancement, that engage in
long-term infrastructure projects. Despite legal prohibitions, some LGFV debts were informally
guaranteed by local governments, and there is a general perception that the local governments
would stand behind their LGFVs if needed. LGFVs borrowing could also be collateralized by land or
other assets, either owned by the LGFV itself, pledged by the local government, or provided by
another entity. Such guarantees or collateral are important for infrastructure LGFVs, which, especially

in the short term, may not generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt. Some LGFVs may
operate on a primarily commercial basis, while some local-government owned SOEs may carry out
quasi-fiscal activities. However, since the former are exceptions, rather than the rule, the assumption
here is that all LGFV debt warrants inclusion in the augmented deficit, while local-government
owned SOE debt does not.
If approved by the State Council, local
governments and government related
entities can issue debt on a discretionary
basis. This amounted to around 7 percent of
end-2010 local government debt according to
the NAO (2011). Staff estimates annual issuance
by equally distributing accumulated debt
among earlier years. This assumes that central
government bonds issued on behalf of local
governments were already included in the total
stock.

The other major components of market financing are bank loans, corporate bonds, and trust
loans:


Bank loans accounted for 79 percent of total local government debt by 2010, equivalent to
CNY 12.7 trillion, of which CNY 10.7 trillion was borrowed by provincial, city, and county
governments (NAO, 2011), CNY 0.8 trillion by township governments (DRC), and CNY 1.2 trillion
for roads and highways that are not captured by the NAO (2011). Using the growth rate of local
government debt provided by the NAO (2011), staff estimate the net local government debt
issuance and the proportion financed through bank loans for earlier years. Information gaps
prevent decomposition of net bank loan issuance by the gross amount, repayment through land
sales proceeds, and debt rollover. The NAO (2013) report is used to estimate the debt stock at
the end of 2012 based on the survey result that debt has risen by 13 percent since 2010.

Changes in cash deposits of the government are included as financing. Deposits totaled around
4 percent of GDP at end-2012; these had been growing steadily, but started falling as a share of GDP
after the peak of the crisis. Deposits of LGFVs, however, are not included due to lack of data.
Land sales
Data on net land sales are not published for every year and are estimated using some simplifying
assumptions. Gross land sales data in recent years are from CEIC. Most land sales are channeled
through Government Managed Funds (GMFs), with the gross proceeds recorded as revenue in offbudget accounts. For example, in 2011 gross land sales explained CNY 3.3 trillion (7 percent of GDP) of
the CNY 3.8 trillion in GMFs’ revenue. Net land sales for 2010 and 2011 are derived from Ministry of
Finance data that show how the gross proceeds were used. Net proceeds subtract the cost of acquisition,
compensation to farmers, and land development. In 2010, the net proceeds were 50 percent of the
gross, whereas they were only 33 percent in 2011. Except for 2010‒11, data are not available to calculate
net proceeds, so staff assume the net proceeds each year are 42 percent (the average of 2010 and 2011).
Land sales data for 2005-9 appear incomplete and for 2005 and earlier are discontinuous, so a series is
extrapolated using data on land sales growth from Soufun (a Chinese real estate services firm) and
official data for 2010–12.

Cross-check with Above-the-Line Data
Budgeted revenue is adjusted for GMF income net of
land sales. Once land proceeds are excluded, this item is
small. In 2011, officially reported GMF revenue was
CNY 4.1 trillion, but, after subtracting land sales (which
only accrue to local governments), this falls to CNY 0.8
trillion. Of this, CNY 0.3 trillion is from the central
government and CNY 0.5 million from local governments
(CNY 3.8 trillion less CNY 3.3 million in land sales). Data on
central government GMFs come from the Ministry of
Finance and CEIC. For local governments, staff assumes
that GMF revenue is a constant share of land sales.

Expenditure is adjusted for spending by GMFs and LGFVs. Data on LGFV spending are not available,
so staff includes all infrastructure investment, calculated from data on fixed asset investment, in
augmented spending.7 This is added to total spending by the budget and GMFs, which is then adjusted
to avoid double-counting of on-budget and GMF-financed infrastructure spending. Specifically, based
on 2011 data, staff assumes that infrastructure spending accounts for 21 percent of local government
budget spending, 14 percent of central government budget spending, 36 percent of local GMF
spending, and 47 percent of central GMF spending. The residual is the estimate of LGFV infrastructure
spending, and broadly corresponds to the financing data.

The above-the-line approach yields an augmented
fiscal deficit that is somewhat larger than the
financing approach in recent years. This is not
surprising, as the above-the-line data include all
infrastructure spending even though some is
executed by entities outside the augmented
government—such as SOEs. Moreover, it could
also be inflated to the extent that some LGFV
infrastructure spending is financed by ownrevenue instead of market borrowing.

Construction of Augmented Debt Ratio
Debt data are based on public sources or cumulated financing flows. Central government debt
data are readily available from public sources. For augmented local government, NAO (2011)
provides the starting point, an estimate of CNY 12.7 trillion for 2010. Data for previous and
subsequent years are then calculated based on the financing assumptions described above.

7

Infrastructure investment is calculated as the sum of fixed asset investment in primary industry; electricity and
heating; gas; water; highway transport; waterway transport; air transport; water conservancy and environment
management. Since the breakdown is only available since 2004, staff assume that infrastructure investment and total
fixed asset investment grew at the same rate in previous years.

Differences with other public estimates are
minor, and often stem from different
methodologies or base years. For example, the
DRC and NAO (2011) estimates refer to the end of
2010. While the National Audit Office conducted a
nation-wide survey, most investment banks and
research institutions, which lack the authority and
resources to access microlevel data, took
approximations based on publically available
information on bank credit.

In most cases, higher estimates are due to different coverage. DRC’s local government debt
estimate, which captures townships in addition to provinces, cities, and counties, is CNY 2 trillion
higher than the NAO estimate, which only captures three levels of government. In addition to local
government explicit liabilities, many estimates also include central government debt and contingent
liabilities at the general government level, such as NPLs held by asset management companies,
borrowing by policy banks, and pension fund liabilities.

C. Other Considerations
The augmented fiscal data are intended to provide a better picture of the fiscal policy stance and gross
government liabilities. They do not provide a comprehensive picture of government net worth in a
balance sheet framework.
Railways Ministry debt is excluded from the
augmented data. The Ministry was corporatized
this year and debt moved to a new SOE, which
should be classified going forward as part of the
public sector but not the augmented government.
It is consistent, therefore, to exclude it from the
estimates of augmented fiscal debt and deficit as
defined in this exercise (including it would increase
somewhat the estimated augmented deficit and
debt).

Note: Net issuance were calculated as the difference of debt stock provided by ChinaBond Audit
Reports. Debt stock by the end of 2012 were extrapolated from Sept 2012 debt stock and the net
issuance in 2012 is the difference between the estimated 2012 debt stock and 2012 debt stock.

Contingent liabilities are also excluded. Quasi-fiscal debts are explicit liabilities, but the
government is also exposed to contingent liabilities, including debt of nonfinancial state-owned
enterprises excluding LGFVs, policy banks’ outstanding debt, nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the
banking sector, old NPLs assumed by asset management companies, and pension fund liabilities.
The Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) estimated total 2010 contingent liabilities at just
above 100 percent of GDP.
Social security funds are excluded from the data. China does not consolidate social security into
general government accounts. Inclusion would increase augmented revenue and spending, but

somewhat reduce the deficit. The social security
funds have also built up financial assets: the
National Pension Fund held assets of 4.3 percent of
GDP at end-2012. However, the pension system
faces significant challenges going forward. World
Bank (2013) notes that legacy costs in the pension
system were 80–132 percent of GDP in 2008 and
that the system had a potentially large actuarial
deficit (estimates, albeit dated, suggest the actuarial
deficit was around 95 percent of 2001 GDP).

On the other hand, state assets, including public sector financial assets, are also excluded
from the gross augmented debt estimates. The government’s significant ownership stake in SOEs
is also excluded. China does not publish a public sector balance sheet, and estimation of the
government’s equity stake is difficult, though the value is probably large. According to CASS, the
government owns CNY 60 trillion (147 percent of GDP) worth of equity of state owned for-profit
nonfinancial enterprises, CNY 8 trillion (20 percent of GDP) worth of equity in state-owned for-profit
financial enterprises, and almost CNY 8 trillion of worth of equity in state-owned nonprofit
enterprises.

Exchange Arrangements:
China’s exchange rate regime has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since June 21, 2010.
De jure classification of the exchange rate is managed floating. On July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank
of China (PBC) announced that the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be
revalued upward by about 2.1 percent (from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange rate
regime would move to a managed float in which renminbi’s value is set with reference to a basket of
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

currencies. The stated intention of the Chinese authorities was to increase the flexibility of the
renminbi’s exchange rate. The authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in the
reference basket and their relative weight. The PBC indicated that it would adjust the exchange rate
trading band as necessary to reflect market developments and financial and economic conditions.
Under the new regime, the band around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the
renminbi was kept at ± 0.3 percent around the central parity published by the PBC while the trade
prices of the non-U.S. dollar currencies against the renminbi were allowed to move within a certain
band announced by PBC, which was initially set at ±1.5 percent and increased to ±3 percent in
September 2005. In August 2005, the governor of PBC revealed that U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen,
and Korean won were the main currencies included in the basket; and U.K. pound, the Thai baht, and
the Russian ruble were among other currencies included in the basket. In May 2007, the band
around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the renminbi was widened to ± 0.5 percent.
After maintaining the renminbi closely linked to the U.S. dollar between July 2008 and June 2010,
the PBC announced on June 19, 2010 a return to the managed floating exchange rate regime
prevailing prior the global financial crisis with the exchange rate allowed to move up to 0.5 percent
from a central parity rate to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. Further, on April 14, 2012,
the PBC announced a widening of the renminbi’s trading band against the U.S. dollar in the
interbank foreign exchange market. As of today, the band has been widened from ½ to 1 percent,
allowing daily fluctuations of up to twice the previously permissible amount relative to the central
parity rate. So far this year, the renminbi-U.S. dollar rate has remained in a 2 percent crawling band
and the de facto exchange rate arrangement is a crawl-like arrangement. The trading prices for the
renminbi against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on the one hand and against
the ringgit and the ruble on the other hand float within a 3 percent and a 5 percent range of the
day’s middle exchange rates of the renminbi against these currencies, respectively.
On January 4, 2006, over-the-counter (OTC) trading of spot foreign exchange was introduced with
15 banks initially designated as market makers. The number of market makers has since risen
to 31 with all the banks approved as spot market makers, and 27 approved as forward and swap
trading market makers. The centralized spot foreign exchange trading system (CFETS) remains
operative, but its central parity rate (renminbi against the U.S. dollar) is now based on a weighted
average of CFETS and OTC transactions. Under the new system, CFETS first inquires prices from all
market makers before the opening of the market on each business day, exclude the highest and
lowest offers, and then calculates the weighted average of the remaining prices in the sample as the
central parity for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar for the day. The weights for the market makers,
which remain undisclosed, are determined by the CFETS using various factors, including the
transaction volumes of the respective market makers in the market. The method for determining is
as follows: The CFETS determines the middle rate for the renminbi against the ringgit, yen, and the
ruble similarly. The middle exchange rates of the renminbi against the euro and Hong Kong dollar,
and pound sterling, respectively, are determined through cross rates by the CFETS based on the
day’s foreign exchange middle rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and the exchange rates
for the U.S. dollar against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on international
foreign exchange markets.

China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation requirements on proceeds from exports
and from invisible transactions and current transfers. Starting on August 13, 2007, all enterprises
(domestic institutions) having foreign exchange revenue from current operations may keep foreign
exchange receipts according to their operational needs in their current foreign exchange accounts.
With SAFE approval or registration, domestic institutions may open foreign exchange capital
accounts and retain foreign exchange revenues from capital transactions. Domestic institutions that
had no current foreign exchange revenue may purchase foreign exchange for imports in advance
based on documentary proof of the payment and deposit the funds into their foreign exchange
accounts. Individuals may, also open foreign exchange savings accounts and deposit foreign
exchange purchased in accordance with the relevant regulations. There are no measures currently in
force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. However,
China has notified measures to the Fund, pursuant to procedures under the Executive Board
Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to measures imposed solely for national or international security
reasons.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. Effective on July 1, 2006, quotas
on foreign exchange purchases for foreign direct investment (FDI) were abolished, and domestic
investors were allowed to purchase foreign exchange to finance pre-FDI activities. Since
December 1, 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) have been allowed to invest
domestically in A shares, subject to certain restrictions, and all nonresidents have been allowed to
purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The overall
investment limit for QFIIs was US$80 billion in 2012. As of the end of 2012, a cumulative total of
207 QFIIs had been approved, with a total investment limit of US$37.443 billion. The Qualified
Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme was introduced in 2004, and measures have since
been taken to promote its development. Since May 1, 2006, residents can freely purchase up to
US$20,000 foreign exchange and this limit was raised to US$50,000 in September 2006. Above this
amount, purchases require relevant documents. In May 2007, the QDII scheme was expanded to
allow qualified banks to invest retail funds in foreign equities. Effective July 5, 2007 the China
Securities and Regulatory Commission extended QDII to securities and fund-management
companies. The firms have to meet certain capital and other requirements. From April 2006,
qualified insurance companies were also allowed to invest their own foreign exchange externally
under the QDII scheme up to 15 percent of their total assets. QDIIs may also invest in foreign
derivative instruments.
The use of renminbi in international transactions has been expanded. In 2010, international financial
institutions were approved to raise funds domestically in renminbi for use offshore. Since August
2011, trade transactions between all provinces and cities in the Mainland with other countries may
be settled in renminbi. Since August 17, 2010, eligible foreign institutions may invest in the
interbank bond market in renminbi. The eligible institutions include foreign banks engaged in
cross-border trade settlements in renminbi, the Hong Kong and Macao region renminbi clearing
banks, and foreign central banks and monetary authorities. These investments are subject to limits,
but there is no minimum holding period. Starting from January 6, 2011, resident enterprises in

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

20 provinces and cities in the Mainland may use renminbi for outward FDI in those countries which
accept such settlement. In December 2011, a new pilot scheme was announced to allow up to
RMB20 billion in portfolio flows into the securities markets (through a renminbi Qualified Foreign
Institutional Investor scheme), and in October, rules were published to allow overseas firms to invest
renminbi raised offshore in the Mainland as foreign direct investment. Since 2012 all residents and
non-residents can use RMB for FDI. Under the expanded RMB qualified foreign institutional
investors (RQFII) scheme, Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese financial institutions, as well as financial
institutions registered and operated in Hong Kong, may invest in domestic securities markets using
RMB proceeds raised overseas. Hong Kong-based banks may provide yuan loans to companies
based in the Qianhai District of Shenzhen, with limits on the size of the loan.
External borrowing remains subject to permission by the respective authority except for FFEs which
may borrow abroad within the difference between the enterprise’s total investment and registered
capital. Lending abroad generally requires approval, but domestic associated enterprises of
multinational corporations may directly lend to offshore associated enterprises.
Article IV Consultation:
China is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The 2012 Article IV mission was concluded on
June 7, 2012 and the staff report was published on July 6, 2012.
Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance provided from 2000 through April 2013 is summarized in Annex V.
Resident Representative:
The resident representative office in Beijing was opened in October 1991. Mr. Murtaza Syed is the
Resident Representative.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of June 18, 2013)
1.
The IMF China team led by Mr. Rodlauer (mission chief) met with the World Bank team
led by Mr. Rohland on May 24, 2013 to discuss key areas of reform to ensure sustainable medium-term
growth in China, minimize risks, and improve the inclusiveness of growth. The teams discussed their
agendas for 2013-14. The last such meeting was held May 2012 in Beijing.
2.
The teams agreed the focus of reform in China should be on shifting growth to a more
balanced and sustainable path. Reforms should aim at preventing further buildup of risks stemming
from rapid credit growth and quasi-fiscal spending. These measures would reinforce structural steps
taken to reform the financial sector and social security system, strengthen the social safety net, raise
resource prices, and open up the service sector to competition.
3.

Based on this assessment, teams identified the following reform areas as macrocritical:



Reform of social safety nets. Strengthening China’s pension systems will reduce incentives for
personal savings, helping to rebalance the economy toward consumption. In particular, ensuring
sufficient resources for current pensioners while improving the actuarial prospects of the current
system will reduce uncertainty for the elderly and current workers. Addressing coverage issues in
the Chinese health system would further reduce incentives to save, and help develop China’s
service sector.



Climate change and renewable energy. Air pollution, water quality and supply, and issues such as
desertification, dependence on coal, and degradation of grasslands have social, health, and
economic effects. Underpricing of energy and inadequate consequences for pollution have
worsened these effects while contributing to China’s dependence on industry. Raising these factor
costs and investing in renewable energy will make growth more sustainable and inclusive.



Infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure has been a key driver of the Chinese economy,
particularly during the slowdown around the Global Financial Crisis. However, the rapid pace of
investment has in some cases left communities behind, and in other cases has led to excessive
investment in projects with relatively low social or financial returns. Filling in the gaps of investment
in social projects will make growth more inclusive while improving the overall social and financial
efficiency of infrastructure investment. Measures to improve the process of approving new
infrastructure projects will ensure that investments are focused in areas of the highest social return.



Financial liberalization. Rapid credit growth has been at the center of China’s impressive growth
record for the past few decades, but in recent years has led to a buildup of vulnerabilities. As the
labor force peaks and capital intensity declines, ensuring continued strong growth will require a
nimble financial system that can support projects raising total factor productivity without further
adding to financial sector risks. Key measures in this area include the gradual liberalization of interest

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

rates, stepped-up supervision and regulation of the financial system, overhaul of the system of
resolving failed financial institutions, and the introduction of deposit insurance.


4.

Strengthening the execution of fiscal policy. Off-budget spending, in infrastructure but also in
other areas, undertaken by local-government owned entities have led to a buildup of debt estimated
by the Fund at around 50 percent of GDP in 2012. Bringing these projects on-budget and improving
the transparency of fiscal policy will reduce fiscal and financial sector risks.
The teams agreed to the following division of labor.



Social safety nets. The Bank will continue to work with the Chinese authorities on both parametric
and structural reforms to the Chinese pension system, with a view toward ensuring that the system
protects the most vulnerable, ensures a fair return on savings for all participants, and is financially
sustainable in the long term. The Fund will look at issues related to the balance between social
contributions and other revenue sources, as well as how social safety nets fit into the overall fiscal
and macroeconomic policy framework.



Renewable energy. The Bank’s focus on climate change and renewable energy in China will
continue to emphasize cutting-edge renewable energy technologies, scale-up of energy
conservation and investments in energy efficiency, and green building policies (for heat and energy
efficiency). Engagements with a climate change focus will extend to expansion of distribution of
electricity from natural gas generation, analysis of carbon capture and storage potential, and
development of carbon markets. The Fund is ready to provide assistance on shifting the pricing and
taxation of energy, and discussing the growth and fiscal implications of such a shift.



Fiscal framework. The Bank will continue its work with the Shanghai municipal government to
transfer technical assistance on Medium Term Expenditure Framework and debt sustainability
analyses. The Fund can provide advice on strengthening the fiscal framework (including for centrallocal relations), streamlining budgetary preparation to bring off-budget spending on-budget, and
establishing frameworks for shifting infrastructure projects toward a public-private partnership basis
in cases where this is appropriate.



Financial liberalization. The Bank is working with the authorities on the development of a financial
sector reform strategy. The Fund will continue to follow up on the recommendations of the 2011
FSAP and provide technical assistance to the Chinese authorities as needed.



Fiscal issues. The Bank will continue its work on expenditure and revenue policies and on fiscal
management in the context of its urbanization study, currently under preparation together with the
Development Research Center of the State Council and expected to be completed early 2014. The
Fund will continue to discuss the near- and medium-term implications of China’s fiscal stance and
policy choices on the broader economy as well as implications for global spillovers.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) partnership with the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
has grown in many ways since the PRC became a member of AsDB in March 1986. The PRC is AsDB’s
second largest shareholder among regional members and the third largest overall, as well as an
important middle-income country client. By the end of 2012, the PRC’s cumulative borrowing from
AsDB reached $26.3 billion with 192 loans for public sector projects. Of the total public sector loans,
51 percent was allocated to the transport sector, followed by agriculture and natural resources
(12.5 percent) and energy (11.4 percent), water and other municipal infrastructure services
(9.9 percent), industry and trade (2.6 percent), finance (2.2 percent), and multisector (10.3 percent).
Over the past 25 years, AsDB has helped finance 34 private sector projects in the PRC totaling
$3.54 billion.
2.
AsDB also funds Technical Assistance for the PRC. By the end of 2012, AsDB had provided a
total of $402.8 million in grants for 691 technical assistance projects, consisting of $124.7 million for
preparing projects and $278.1 million for policy advice and capacity development.
3.
Overall, the PRC has demonstrated strong capabilities in implementing projects. The good
performance shows the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design,
implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for
development projects, particularly those proposed for external financing. Loan disbursement and
contract award performance is good.
4.
The PRC has demonstrated its strong partnership with AsDB by contributing to the Asian
Development Fund, establishing the $20 million PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation
Fund (the PRC Fund), and replenishing another $20 million to the PRC Fund. The PRC Fund—the first
fund established in AsDB by a developing member country—providing technical assistance projects
to support subregional cooperation initiatives, particularly Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) programs.
5.
The Asian Development Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011–15 was endorsed by
AsDB Board of Directors in May 2012. The CPS 2011–2015 is aligned with the priorities of the PRC’s
12th Five-Year Plan 2011–15 that intersect with those of AsDB’s long-term Strategy 2020, particularly
the redoubling of efforts to promote socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development.
The CPS reflects the PRC’s changing circumstances as a rapidly growing middle-income country with
increasing emphasis on innovation and value addition and South-South cooperation to underpin the
evolving AsDB-PRC partnership. The CPS is built on three strategic pillars: (i) inclusive growth,
(ii) environmentally sustainable growth, and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. It identifies
four priority sectors for country operations during the CPS period: (i) energy, (ii) natural resources

1

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

and agriculture, (iii) transport, and (iv) urban development. The sector selection reflects AsDB’s
comparative strengths and expertise through its longstanding operations in these sectors.
6.
Projected public sector lending in 2013–2015 will total about $4.21 billion, of which
36 percent will support the transport sector; 15 percent for agriculture, rural development, and
natural resource management; 38 percent for urban development, water supply, and sanitation
improvement; and 12 percent for the energy sector. Over 90 percent of the projects are located in the
western, central and north-eastern regions in line with the CPS’s priorities of promoting inclusive
growth and environmentally sustainable growth.
AsDB’s technical assistance will complement the lending program to improve the sector policy
environment, support governance and capacity development, and strengthen the knowledge base
and innovative features of lending operations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts and government finance statistics.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) compiles and disseminates annual GDP by activity in
current and constant prices (2010) and quarterly estimates of GDP. Both the annual accounts and
quarterly accounts are based on the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). The techniques
for deriving volume measures of GDP are not sound and need to be improved. GDP by expenditure
is compiled at current and constant prices, but the constant price estimates are not published. Data
on the levels of expenditure components of real GDP are not available on a quarterly basis.
Nevertheless, the NBS has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national
accounts data, the most important being improving the exhaustiveness of the GDP estimates by
activity. Further improvements are intended for both the annual and quarterly accounts, however, no
target dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of
the private sector, presents new problems for data collection and compilation. The ability to change
the data collection systems is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system.
3.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment indices are compiled with
the corresponding month of the previous year as a base period but, no chain-linked time series are
produced. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series.
4.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not comprehensive, and
are only available on a quarterly basis.
5.
In January 2001, the NBS began to publish a Laspeyres price index that provides a time
series for each January to December (with January each year = 100). This more accurately reflects
consumer spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food
declined). The number of survey items has been expanded to at least 600 for small cities and
counties and more for large and medium-size cities (e.g., 1800 for Beijing). The most recent weights
of the major CPI components were provided to the staff in 2006.
Government Finance Statistics
6.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude
spending associated with official external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary
funds are only provided annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains poor, mainly
because data are not classified by economic type. The authorities have indicated an intention to
begin collecting these data and to develop accrual based measures of fiscal performance over the
medium term while also strengthening the compilation of cash based GFS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Monetary and Financial Statistics
7.
In recent years, improvements have been made in monetary and financial statistics.
However, the monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims on the
government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side. The reported net
foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate valuation effects and interest earnings
on foreign reserves. The PBC has also ceased to report separate data on central government
deposits in its balance sheet since April 2005 because the MOF no longer distinguishes between
central and other government deposit accounts. This change has led to breaks in data series of
monetary base and monetary aggregates.
8.
The April 2012 monetary and financial statistics mission discussed with the authorities the
possibility of expanding the data scope of FSIs to include encouraged FSIs for deposit-takers. The
authorities indicated that the work on the compilation of the encouraged FSI data is at an early
stage and, furthermore, they are working on adopting the Basel III at this stage and agreed to
consider the mission’s recommendations after the developmental work is completed for collecting
data under the Basel III.
External Sector Statistics
9.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The authorities continue their efforts to improve the coverage
of direct investment transactions in the balance of payments (BOP) and IIP statistics, and progress is
being made in developing these statistics. Since the International Transactions Reporting System is
the major data source for balance of payments (BOP) statistics, in order to ensure its smooth
operation, regular training programs for staff in the provincial offices of SAFE have been
recommended. In 2011, China commenced participation in the Coordinated Direct Investment
Survey (CDIS).
10.
Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need to
strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation. In 2010, China started submitting total and
public external debt data for the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, a notable step
forward.

Data Standards and Quality
11.

China has participated in the General Data Dissemination System since April 2002, and the

Data Reporting to STA for Publications
12.
Despite improvements in reporting a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable
historical data are not available. Reporting of data to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag.
Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the timeliness of consumer price,
industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS have improved substantially. No
long-term time series are available for the consumer and producer price indexes and industrial
production; rather the comparison is made each period with the same period of the previous year.
However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published on wages, trade
volumes, or prices/unit values.
13.
China has reported general government cash-based budget data for 2003–09 following the
GFSM 2001 methodology for publication in the 2011 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
However, these data are limited, with no data provided on government transactions in expense,
assets, and liabilities. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and
grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure by
function is largely aligned with international best practice.
14.
Owing to source data issues, the authorities have not yet been able to report a GFSM 2001
Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the budgetary central government accounts on a
subannual basis. As a result, there are no fiscal data for China on the Principal Global Indicators
website.
15.
The April 2012 monetary and financial statistics mission established procedures for regular
reporting to the Fund of data on the central bank and other depository corporations in the format
of standardized report forms (SRFs) , which has been planned to begin in May 2013.
16.
The FSIs data currently posted on IMF’s website are available only for core indicators for
2010 and 2011 and no historical data series have been provided. The April 2012 mission encouraged
the authorities to compile and report the FSI data with quarterly periodicity. The authorities agreed
with the improved periodicity for their FSI data, but indicated that they would prefer to move to
semi-annual reporting prior to compiling the quarterly data.
17.
The authorities have resumed reporting data on international reserves for publication in the
IFS. However, the monthly time series are now submitted every three months, instead of every
month. With regards to BOP and IIP data, the authorities started submitting quarterly data to STA
for publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOP data are available on
a quarterly basis starting in 2010 and IIP starting in 2011). Additionally, China participates in the
CDIS and data on inward investments are available for 2009 and 2010.

Data Dissemination to the Public
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the timing
and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector
indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series
(e.g., unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time
series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner.
Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are
published nine months or more after the end of the year. Nevertheless, in the case of BOP and
quarterly external debt data disseminated in QEDS, time lag is around four to seven months.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

July 9, 2013

Prepared By

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
This supplement reports on developments since the staff report was finalized. This new
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Interbank market. Interbank interest rates increased markedly in early-June, but have since
retreated close to their previous levels. The tight liquidity conditions reflected a combination of domestic
seasonal factors (such as a June 10‒12 holiday and corporate tax payments), reduced capital inflows, and
the fact that the central bank did not accommodate fully the associated demand for liquidity. This was
designed to signal the central bank’s intention to contain overall credit expansion and, in particular, to
rein in rapid growth of nontraditional forms of lending that make use of the interbank market. Interbank
interest rates periodically spike, often around holidays when demand for liquidity is high. However, the
recent episode was more pronounced and lasted longer than previous ones as the central bank initially
refrained from providing liquidity. After several days of progressively tighter market conditions,
exacerbated by uncertainty and a stronger reaction by banks than anticipated (as even liquid banks were
reluctant to lend), the central bank provided some additional liquidity. It also announced that it would
ensure sufficient market liquidity going forward, while emphasizing that banks needed to improve their
own liquidity management. As a result, interbank rates have come down significantly. For example, as of
July 8, the seven-day repo rate stood at 3.7 percent compared to an average of 3.3 percent during the
first five months of the year. The one-year swap rate was 3.8 percent as of July 8, which suggests that the
market expects a further easing of liquidity conditions in the months ahead.1

weakened slightly in June (to 50.1, from 50.8 in May).
Official second-quarter GDP estimates, along with many of

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation Discussions with the
People’s Republic of China
On July 12, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation discussions with the People’s Republic of China. 1
China’s economy is expected to grow at around 7¾ percent this year, notwithstanding a
moderate slowdown during the first half, with resilient domestic demand offsetting lingering
weakness in the external environment. Inflation has continued its downward path, and with
persistently high investment contributing to excess capacity in many sectors, is likely to
remain subdued around 3 percent this year and next.
Macroeconomic policies have been supportive toward achieving this year’s growth target.
The overall fiscal deficit is likely to be around 2 percent of GDP, similar to last year. Strong
growth in total social financing is expected to underpin a slight rebound of activity in the
second half of this year. Capital inflows have resumed in recent months and the renminbi has
appreciated by around 1½ percent against the U.S. dollar in the year through June, and by
about 6 percent in real effective terms. International reserves have risen to about
US$3.44 trillion at the end of March (up from US$3.31 trillion at the end of 2012).
Last year the current account surplus increased slightly to 2¼ percent of GDP, from just
under 2 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, China’s progress on external rebalancing has been
substantial—the current account as a share of GDP is now less than a quarter of its pre-crisis
peak in 2007. By contrast, domestic imbalances remain large. National accounts data show
that last year gross fixed capital formation grew further as a percent of GDP, while private
consumption was broadly unchanged, indicating that a decisive shift toward a more
consumption-based growth path has yet to occur. Accelerating the transformation of the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

growth model remains the main priority, as reaffirmed in recent policy announcements by the
new administration.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed China’s continued strong economic growth with subdued
inflation. Directors noted nevertheless that the growth outlook is clouded by mounting
domestic vulnerabilities in the financial, fiscal, and real estate sectors. At the same time,
potential spillovers from developments in the euro area and major advanced economies
continue to pose external risks. Directors agreed that China has the capacity to withstand
shocks, but considered that a further strengthening of policy buffers over time would be
desirable.
Accordingly, Directors underscored the importance of transitioning to a new growth path that
is more consumption-based, inclusive, and environmentally friendly. They welcomed the
authorities’ reform strategy in this direction, which charts a path toward mitigating risks,
rebalancing growth, and addressing income disparities, thus safeguarding China’s important
contribution to global growth.
Executive Directors agreed that the near-term challenge is to contain risks to financial
stability, by reining in credit growth and nontraditional forms of lending. Going forward,
Directors stressed that a more market-based financial system would help improve the
allocation of capital, boost household income, and prevent a further buildup of risks.
Emphasizing that financial sector liberalization should progress at the appropriate pace and
sequencing, they considered as pressing priorities further deregulation of interest rates,
greater use of market-based instruments in monetary management, and enhanced prudential
oversight, including over the activities of non-banks.
In this connection, Directors agreed that a more robust and transparent framework for
resolution of bad debts and troubled financial institutions would facilitate an orderly exit of
weak institutions. They also welcomed the authorities’ plan to introduce deposit insurance,
and encouraged them to take steps to remove the perception of implicit government
guarantees on some financial products, which would ensure a more effective pricing of risk
and limit moral hazard.
Directors recognized the contribution of off-budget, quasi-fiscal activity in supporting
demand since the global financial crisis. Nonetheless, they encouraged the authorities to
unwind it gradually to limit fiscal risks and, if economic growth slows down too sharply,
they recommended using on-budget fiscal stimulus, focused on consumption.

3

Directors also encouraged continued efforts to strengthen the governance and transparency of
local government finances while protecting priority spending. In addition, shifting the tax
burden from social contributions toward more progressive and efficient forms of taxation,
including a value added tax, would boost the role of private consumption as a growth-driver
and reduce income inequality. Directors welcomed the authorities’ indication to consider this
as part of a comprehensive reform of the social security system.
Taking note of the staff’s assessment that the renminbi remains moderately undervalued,
Directors considered that a more market-based exchange rate system would facilitate further
internal and external rebalancing. They supported the authorities’ policy of restraining
foreign exchange intervention, thereby allowing market forces to play a greater role in
exchange rate determination.
Directors stressed the importance of advancing structural reform under the Twelfth
Five-Year Plan. They encouraged continued liberalization of the capital account, carefully
sequenced with financial and exchange rate reforms. Further progress on demand rebalancing
is particularly crucial, including by opening markets to domestic and foreign competition,
especially in the services and upstream industries, raising resource prices and taxes, and
increasing dividend payments by state-owned enterprises to the budget.
Recognizing China’s rapid economic and financial development and its increasing global
importance, Directors supported plans to continue to upgrade the statistical base, which they
hoped will eventually lead to China’s subscription of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard. In particular, they welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to improve data on
local government finances.

1/ Contribution to annual growth in percent.

Statement by Mr. Tao Zhang, IMF Executive Director, at the Conclusion of the
2013 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of China
July 12, 2013
On behalf of my authorities, I thank staff for the discussions held during the mission. My
authorities value staff’s constructive dialogue and advice, and appreciate the importance of
this annual consultation with the Fund. I am pleased to confirm my authorities’ intention to
publish the staff report.
The Chinese economy remains firm despite facing a lackluster external environment. In
particular, growth was maintained at a solid pace, and inflationary pressures remained
subdued. At the same time, structural adjustments of the economy continue to proceed, with
consumption playing a bigger role in driving economic growth, helping to restrain current
account surplus alongside. Meanwhile, the banking sector remains sound, and new measures
were actively rolled out to regulate local credit conditions and nonbank financing. Issues on
local government debt also continue to be monitored closely and were addressed with further
rounds of actions. To promote a healthy development in the local property market, measures
were implemented and fine-tuned to contain price pressures, while social housing
construction continues to receive full policy support to assist the less well-off.
The Chinese Government will build on the progress achieved under the Twelfth Five-Year
Plan to continue to balance the economy toward consumption, putting balanced emphasis on
the quality and pace of growth. The Government is determined to transform the growth
model through accelerating structural reforms, including further interest rate liberalization,
exchange rate reform, capital account convertibility, and strengthening the service sector.
Meanwhile, urbanization will continue to be promoted to help double the GDP as well as
income per capita by 2020, compared with the levels in 2010. While a short-run economic
slowdown may result, the Government sees reforms to be necessary in order to settle the
economy on a sustainable and inclusive long-run growth path. Having said that, the Chinese
economy is still on track to achieve the 7.5 percent growth target this year, with monetary
and fiscal policies being well-placed to help smooth the structural adjustment in the
economy.
Recent economic developments
The Chinese economy maintained a stable growth pace on the back of solid domestic
demand. Real GDP grew at 7.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of this
year, after expanding at 7.8 percent in 2012. Growth of fixed asset investment also remained
stable, registering at 20.6 percent in 2012 and 20.4 percent in the first five months of this
year, with the pickup in infrastructure and real estate development investment largely
countering the slowdown in manufacturing and other investment. Retail sales growth,
however, slowed to 12.6 percent in the first five months of this year from 14.3 percent in

2
2012, partly due to my authorities’ efforts to rein in administrative spending. Industrial
production growth also slowed down somewhat over the same period, from 10.0 percent in
2012 to 9.4 percent in the first five months of this year. Recent releases of the PMI suggested
that China’s economic growth is likely to remain steady in the near term, with solid income
growth of households and the pickup in industrial profits growth expecting to provide
support to consumption and investment spending going forward.
Inflation remained largely subdued. After registering at 2.6 percent in 2012, the CPI inflation
rate dropped to 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first half of this year, mainly due to
the moderation in food price inflation. Meanwhile, the producer price inflation rate dropped
further to -2.2 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first half of this year, from -1.7 percent
in 2012, as global commodity prices remained largely contained during the period.
Notwithstanding the subdued inflationary pressures, my authorities remain highly vigilant to
potential challenges to price stability, in view of the upward pressures on labor cost, resource
products price reforms, and abundant global liquidity. My authorities’ projection of CPI
inflation for 2013 is 3.5 percent.
Fiscal policy
My authorities see a proactive fiscal policy to remain appropriate. On the revenue front,
fiscal revenue growth moderated to 6.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first five
months of 2013, after registering at 12.8 percent in 2012. The deceleration in the revenue
growth was largely due to the economic slowdown and structural tax cuts, with the latter
being part of my authorities’ continuous efforts to promote a stronger private sector. On the
expenditure front, fiscal expenditure growth dropped from 15.1 percent in 2012 to
13.2 percent in the first five months of this year, with my authorities continuing to shift
expenditure composition away from administrative spending to social spending. For 2013 as
a whole, the budget deficit is set at RMB 1.2 trillion (about 2 percent of GDP), and my
authorities will provide any needed fiscal cushion mainly through on-budget stimulus.
Fiscal indebtedness remains manageable. The central government debt-to-GDP ratio edged
down further to 14.9 percent in 2012, while the pace of expansion in local government debt
remained controllable. According to staff’s estimates based on official data, taking into
account local government debt, the general government debt-to-GDP ratio still remained
moderate by international standards, and has dropped to 26.1 percent of GDP in 2012, from
28.7 percent of GDP in 2011 and 33.5 percent of GDP in 2010, respectively. More
importantly, China’s favorable interest rate-growth differential, as estimated by the latest
IMF Fiscal Monitor, will help restrain any upward pressure on the debt-to-GDP ratio going
forward. Having said that, my authorities are highly vigilant to potential risks stemming from
local government indebtedness, and had taken prompt actions to restrain local government
borrowing, such as prohibiting injection of land reserves into LGFVs and halting irregular
financing activities of local governments. Meanwhile, pilot programs on municipal bonds

3
and property tax had been implemented, and can be expanded, when appropriate, to provide
more transparent and sustainable funding sources to ease local governments’ fiscal pressures.
Monetary policy
A prudent monetary policy stance remains appropriate to guard against inflation and financial
risks. M2 growth picked up during the year to reach 15.8 percent in May, on the back of the
large increase in foreign exchange inflows, robust loan growth, and money creation through
channels such as bond purchases by financial institutions and interbank transactions. Were
foreign exchange inflows to dampen going forward, my authorities are confident that
M2 growth will gradually be brought back into line with the annual target of 13 percent, and
will take appropriate policy action, if needed. My authorities also remain vigilant to ensure
that credits are expanding at an appropriate pace, and are flowing to support the real
economy, particular the SMEs. On the other hand, the PBC introduced new liquidity
management tools, namely the short-term liquidity operations and standing lending facility,
to smooth interbank liquidity conditions. While volatilities in the interbank market had
emerged recently, partly due to seasonal and sentimental factors, it is important to emphasize
that overall liquidity in the banking system has been adequate, as evidenced by banks’ ample
excess reserves. The PBC has also pledged to maintain stable interbank liquidity conditions
and to provide liquidity support to financial institutions that meet macroprudential
requirements. As such, interbank liquidity conditions have largely normalized.
Financial sector
The banking sector remains in good shape, with the latest stress-testing results conducted by
the CBRC suggesting that commercial banks would be resilient to various shocks and
exposures. Meanwhile, the Basel III capital requirement has begun to be implemented,
conducive to banking stability going forward. To further guard against financial stability
risks, my authorities have stepped up supervision on banks’ off-balance sheet and nonbank
financing activities, such as imposing new requirements on banks’ wealth management
product (WMP) business, and restricting nonbank financing for LGFVs. The CBRC also
issued new guidance requiring banks to enhance their monitoring, underwriting standards,
and disclosures of exposures to LGFVs, as well as capping banks’ exposures to LGFVs. On
the other hand, actions were taken to address other sources of vulnerabilities in the financial
system, such as the concerted actions taken to eliminate irregular activities in the interbank
bond market, and the imposition of new requirements on limiting excessive positions on
foreign exchange flows. A new round of measures, including enforcement of capital gains
tax on existing home sales, hiking down-payment ratio and mortgage rate, were also
implemented to dampen the property market, further ensuring financial stability.
External sector

4
China’s current account surplus remained subdued at a low level of 2.3 percent of GDP in
2012 due to a confluence of factors, mainly including structural adjustments in the economy.
In particular, the RMB has become more flexible over time, which allows the level of the
RMB exchange rate to stay close to its equilibrium level. Contained international commodity
prices and subdued external demand also contributed to the reduction in the current account
surplus. While cyclical factors had been at work, my authorities see staff’s baseline view on
the medium-term current account path to lie on the high side, particularly in view of the
observed upward bias in staff’s past projections. In my authorities’ view, the current account
path under the rebalancing scenario is deemed more accurate, with the ongoing economic
adjustments amidst further urbanization, increased flexibility of the RMB, demographic
changes, and factor price reforms helping to restrain the medium-term current account.
On the exchange rate assessment, my authorities view that the quality and the reliability of
the EBA estimation results are yet to be addressed. The sizable unidentified factors in the
estimated model also make it very clear that the EBA methodology is not yet ready for policy
analysis. Meanwhile, the broad range of estimates under the CGER methodology means that
it is contentious of whether the RMB is indeed undervalued. Overall, my authorities view
that both the EBA and the CGER methodologies have not yet been able to capture the rapid
structural changes in many economies, including China, and so further work on the subject is
needed.
As noted in the staff report, the small net capital outflows in 2012 were associated with
changes in exchange rate expectation. This suggested that the RMB exchange rate could
exhibit more two-way movements, as flexibility of the exchange rate increases further going
forward. My authorities continue to uphold the principle that foreign exchange intervention
would be restrained in order to allow market supply and demand to play a greater role in
exchange rate formation. This can be observed from the fact that reserve accumulation was
largely absent in 2012, with the recent intervention being an anomaly triggered partly due to
the unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies.
Reforms
Structural rebalancing of the economy has been proceeding in line with the Twelfth FiveYear Plan. The importance of the service sector in the economy continued to increase, with
the size of the tertiary industry largely equalizing that of the secondary industry in 2012.
There are also signs that labor share of income has picked up, with both growth in the per
capita real disposable income of urban household and the per capita real net income of rural
household outpacing the real GDP growth in 2012. This, together with my authorities’ efforts
on strengthening social spending, supported a continued rebalancing of the economy toward
consumption during the year. In particular, consumption remained as the main driver of
growth in 2012, with the growth contribution of the final consumption expenditure
component being higher than that of the gross capital formation component for the second

5
consecutive year.
While the importance of investment in the economy is set to be reduced, investment growth
is expected to remain steady as economic rebalancing proceeds. While my authorities have
actively voiced against investment in sectors with excess capacity and high pollution, my
authorities continued to support urban and social infrastructure investment in order to
promote urbanization and enhance people’s living standards. Moreover, my authorities are
determined to strengthen social housing investment in order to address social tensions and
protect the poor. With all that said, investment is unlikely to experience any sharp contraction
going forward, with an orderly rebalancing process in China benefiting the global economy
alongside.
My authorities have actively rolled out new reform plans, manifesting the strong
determination for reforms. On the financial sector, my authorities see the desirability of
facilitating orderly operations of market forces, and will continue to strengthen financial
infrastructure and supervisory oversight. A priority for this year is to promote further interest
rate liberalization and introduce deposit insurance. Meanwhile, further capital account
convertibility has been streamlined. Deepening exchange rate reform remains an important
agenda, with my authorities committing to further increase the flexibility of the RMB
exchange rate. On the fiscal front, measures have been initiated to improve the expenditure
structure and reform the budget system for better transparency and inclusiveness.
Government restructuring was also carried out to improve administrative functions and
reduce government intervention on the economy. To ensure sustainable growth, my
authorities have outlined plans for establishing a strict environmental protection system, by
expanding further the resource pricing reform, and imposing higher taxes and levies on
products and sectors that cause pollution, particularly coal. On social welfare, my authorities
continue to emphasize social protection, particularly the importance of enhancing the
pension, education, medical, and healthcare system. In this regard, my authorities see the
need for allowing migrant workers to access the same social services as urban residents.
My authorities place high importance on transparency, and are committed to maintain high
data quality in order to benefit the international community. My authorities have been
supportive of the Fund’s data initiatives, such as the GDDS and the SDDS, and have stepped
up efforts to engage with the Fund in this regard.
