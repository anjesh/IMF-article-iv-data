Executive Summary
The economy is recovering steadily, following the recession triggered by the global
crisis. The authorities have made good progress in reestablishing economic stability and
rekindling growth, despite a generally unfavorable external environment.
The key challenges remain to ensure fiscal, financial, and external sustainability, while
igniting new engines of growth. With this in mind, the policy discussions focused on:


The appropriate size, speed, and composition of fiscal consolidation. The
authorities and staff agreed that the budget’s structural gap should be closed at a pace
matching the economy’s speed of recovery while safeguarding growth-enhancing
public investment and well-targeted social protection spending.



The need to keep inflation low while supporting the recovery and strengthening
the monetary policy framework. Given the outlook for domestic demand and credit,
there was agreement to maintain a moderately accommodative monetary stance
despite external shocks to inflation. The National Bank of Moldova’s (NBM)
transition to inflation targeting should continue, with appropriate improvements in the
policy framework.



Efforts to bolster export-led growth. Structural reforms will continue to focus on
creating an investment- and export-friendly business climate, stepping up
liberalization and deregulation, and resuming preparations for large-scale
privatization.

Performance under the Fund-supported program has been strong. All performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks for the First Review have been
observed. The authorities are requesting a modification of the end-September performance
criterion on the budget deficit in line with the reduced 2010 deficit target.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Massive capital inflows in 2006-08 lifted growth but also created macroeconomic
vulnerabilities amid hesitant progress in Moldova’s transition to a market economy.
Booming remittances, FDI, and credit boosted domestic consumption and investment, and growth
averaged over 5 percent. However, large capital inflows permitted an expansion of the current
account deficit to 17 percent of GDP, fueled double-digit inflation, and caused a substantial real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation. The loss of competiveness, combined with a
Russian embargo on wine imports from Moldova in 2006-07 and a drought in 2007, dampened
export growth. Despite some progress in structural reforms, the economy remained overregulated
and hampered by relative price distortions. High barriers to entry and low competition in a
number of sectors kept domestic prices of many goods and services significantly above regional
levels. In contrast, utility tariffs generally remained well below cost-recovery levels, leading to
substantial arrears and underinvestment.
2.
The global crisis abruptly curtailed capital inflows and external demand, forcing
current account adjustment and a recession. Reflecting an abrupt decline in remittances, FDI,
and exports, domestic demand and imports collapsed, and real GDP fell by 6½ percent (Figure 1).
Although the leu depreciated significantly, deflation pressures persisted. The current account
deficit almost halved to 9½ percent of GDP; nonetheless, a large external financing gap opened. It
was filled by running down the reserves of the NBM and financing from international financial
institutions. Credit to the economy declined, and the share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the
banking sector tripled since end-2008; one medium-size bank failed.
3.
Despite two rounds of parliamentary elections in 2009, political uncertainty persists.
The July elections led to the formation of a new four-party coalition government with a narrow
majority that proved insufficient to elect a President of the republic under the current rules. The
authorities intend to hold a referendum on a Constitutional amendment that would prevent such
gridlock in the future and to call early elections afterwards, in late 2010.
4.
The authorities have sought to strengthen economic integration with the EU and
other development partners. Moldova and the EU are partners within the European
Neighborhood Policy (ENP), and an action plan, supported by a Partnership and Cooperation
Agreement, lays out the strategic objectives of cooperation based on effective implementation of
political, economic, and institutional reforms. A Consultative Group meeting in March 2010
confirmed the partners’ willingness to extend significant financial and technical assistance in
support of the authorities’ reform agenda.

6
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations1
The authorities’ responsiveness to past Fund advice has been mixed, with three distinct
phases. Four reviews were completed under the previous PRGF-supported program before it
went off track in late 2008. During this period, the authorities generally agreed with the
Fund’s advice, except for the prescription against heavy management of the exchange rate.
Afterwards, major disagreements emerged. Fiscal policy deteriorated significantly, with
sizable pre-election hikes in current spending, while monetary policy was kept too tight until
mid-2009, attempting to defend an overvalued exchange rate. Structural reforms stalled as
well. Since late 2009, however, macroeconomic policies—in the context of the new
ECF/EFF-supported program—have been reoriented toward restoring fiscal, financial, and
external sustainability and supporting growth with significant fiscal adjustment under way,
the adoption of a new monetary policy strategy focusing on price stability, and a
revitalization of structural reforms. Despite some weaknesses, data provision is adequate for
surveillance, and Moldova subscribes to the SDDS (see Informational Annex, section III).

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.

The economy is steadily recovering from the 2009 recession:



Growth is returning faster than expected. A strong pick-up in industrial production and
in external trade in late 2009, helped by the removal of many trade restrictions and
exchange rate depreciation, continued in early 2010. Consumer demand is recovering as
well. As a result, GDP grew by 4.7 percent in Q1 2010, supported by replenishment of
business inventories, private consumption, and net exports. Unemployment, however,
reached 9.1 percent, in part owing to seasonal fluctuations.

Inflation rose in early 2010, pushed up by necessary energy tariff adjustments,
higher excise taxes, and exchange rate depreciation. In May, it amounted to 7.9 percent
relative to a year ago, which was comparable to neighboring countries (chart). Core
inflation remained contained at 5.1 percent. The exchange rate has broadly stabilized after

7
the seasonally high demand for foreign exchange in Q1 subsided; recently, it has been
moderately depreciating against the U.S. dollar and appreciating against the euro.



After falling until 2007, poverty has remained broadly stable in the recession.
Remittances helped reduce overall poverty in the boom years to 25.8 percent of the
population in 2007, with notable improvements in infant and maternal mortality rate and
access to clean water, while extreme poverty declined to 2.8 percent. Although wages and
pensions continued to increase, there was a sharp fall in remittances and rise in
unemployment, and on balance overall poverty increased slightly in 2008-09. The launch
of the targeted social assistance system in the second half of 2009, on the other hand,
helped reduce extreme poverty further to 2.1 percent (Table 8).

6.
Since late 2009 the authorities have been implementing their ambitious Economic
Stabilization and Recovery Plan:


Fiscal policy has embarked on an adjustment path. The 2009 deficit (6.4 percent of
GDP) came well below projections. Revenue benefitted by an upsurge in VAT, while the
authorities realized some expenditure savings relative to budget commitments. The
adjustment continued in early 2010, supported by robust revenues and by expenditure
restraint. At the same time,



The NBM tightened policy somewhat in response to the deteriorating inflation
outlook. The NBM is in the process of gradually moving from a money-based monetary
policy framework to inflation targeting. In January 2010, the NBM announced an inflation
target of 5 percent with a narrow ±1 percent deviation band. When this target became

8
threatened by rising headline inflation, the Bank raised its policy rate by 200 basis points
to 7 percent (Figure 3); however, the monetary stance remains accommodative.


Structural reforms have been reinvigorated. The authorities have scrapped a number of
export and import restrictions and simplified customs controls, licensing requirements,
and procedures for business registration and liquidation. The energy regulator ANRE
raised energy tariffs to cost-recovery levels.

7.
After a deep contraction in 2009, economic activity in the Transnistria region is
recovering, but gas-related external debt remains a major concern.1 Following the global
economic crisis, exports fell by about 37 percent in 2009, and workers’ remittances declined by a
quarter; industrial production and investment slumped by similar magnitudes. Reflecting the
revival in external demand, industrial output increased by nearly 9 percent in the first four months
of 2010 (compared with the same period of 2009). Massive subsidies to ailing enterprises
propelled the budget deficit to 22 percent of GDP in 2009. This was financed by the accumulation
of external arrears that pushed external debt to over 300 percent of the region’s output. About
three quarters of this debt is made of arrears for gas payments to the Russian supplier Gazprom,
which is estimated to have reached some US$2.0-2.2 billion at end-2009.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
8.
All performance criteria and indicative targets for end-March 2010 were observed,
and all structural benchmarks were implemented, albeit one of them with a delay (SMEFP
Tables 2 and 3). In particular, the authorities put in place an action plan for a speedy expansion
of a means-tested social assistance scheme, which has already led to increased enrollment.
Meanwhile, the NBM analyzed and shared with Fund staff the results of the diagnostic studies of
all banks completed by an external auditor, which confirmed the banks’ stable condition. The
NBM also prepared legal amendments to the laws on financial institutions and deposit insurance
to strengthen the bank resolution framework. These amendments have been approved by the
Government and submitted to Parliament for adoption, the first set with some delay.
IV. OUTLOOK
9.
The short-term outlook is cautiously optimistic. GDP growth is projected to reach
2.5 percent in 2010 and 3.6 percent in 2011, supported mainly by the projected recovery in
external demand from the major trading partners Russia and Ukraine and by the ongoing
liberalization and deregulation of the economy.2 The cumulative impact of two rounds of
adjustments in domestic energy prices will continue to keep inflation high in the next few months,
but this effect should be short-lived, and inflation should ease toward 6 percent by mid-2011. The

unable to discuss developments in the region and verify the statistics available from the web sites of local institutions,
as the local authorities declined the proposed meetings.

The strong growth in Q1 2010 is expected to moderate going forward as inventory rebuilding is completed.

9
rise in international energy prices and the gradually recovering domestic demand could widen the
current account deficit to 10½ – 11¼ percent of GDP in 2010-11 as growing imports outweigh the
rebound in exports and remittances.
10.
The new external environment is a drag on potential output growth. Staff has reduced
their estimates of potential growth to 4 percent (from 5-6 percent before the global crisis) as
private investment and FDI are expected to strengthen only gradually given current global
projections and labor migration abroad continues, albeit at a declining rate. Sizable productivity
gains supported by the envisaged structural reforms and large public investment in infrastructure
will still underpin medium-term growth (Box 5).
11.
Downside risks still prevail and have increased lately. A growth slowdown in the EU
could depress remittances and exports, while international energy price spikes could stoke
inflation. Deteriorating loan quality could restrain bank lending, hindering the recovery. Political
instability could hold reforms back, leading to a withdrawal of donor financing that could reopen
large balance of payments gaps. On the upside, the ongoing liberalization and deregulation of the
economy may provide a larger–than-anticipated growth impulse.

12.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment that the current exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals, while business climate-related measures of competitiveness indicate
a need for deep structural reforms. The exchange rate regime is classified as “floating”. Staff
estimates of the exchange rate position––subject to the usual caveats of considerable uncertainty–
–range from an overvaluation of 7 percent to an undervaluation of 1 percent, with an average
overvaluation of less than 5 percent. Moreover, unit labor costs in manufacturing remain
competitive in comparison with Moldova’s neighbors. Broader measures of competitiveness,
however, do call for further structural reforms, as discussed at a seminar with the World Bank and
the authorities (Box 2). Agreeing with this assessment, the authorities pointed out that their
current structural reform program is aimed specifically at improving international competitiveness
of Moldova’s goods and services.

10
Box 2. Competitiveness and the Equilibrium Exchange Rate
After a real effective depreciation of about 20 percent since the peak in February 2009,
CGER-type analysis suggests that the leu is broadly in line with fundamentals. Under
various versions of the macroeconomic balance approach, the estimated current account norm
ranges between -5.8 and -7.7 percent of GDP, encompassing the projected 2015 underlying
current account deficit of 7.5 percent of GDP. This implies an assessment range between
moderate overvaluation and slight undervaluation. Under the external sustainability approach,
the most recently observed net foreign liability position of 75 percent of GDP at end-2009
suggests a current account norm of -5.6 percent of GDP, which translates into an overvaluation
of 6.8 percent. Finally, the deviation of the current real effective exchange rate from its historical
average points to a minor overvaluation.

While external price competitiveness seems by and large restored, broadly defined
competitiveness needs to improve further. Labor costs have remained low, but Moldova still
ranks below its regional competitors in terms of enabling business environment. Over the last
three years, the situation in Moldova has not improved much based on its World Economic
Forum (WEF) ranking or EBRD indicators. Thus, enhancing competitiveness requires further
structural reforms, particularly those related to improving investor protection, removing
structural impediments to financial sector development, and investing in infrastructure to lower
production and distribution costs.

Debt is sustainable at present, but vulnerabilities remain (Appendix I). The debt
sustainability situation has not changed significantly since the last debt sustainability analysis
(DSA) was issued in January 2010. Updated projections suggest that Moldova’s risk of debt
distress remains low. Public and publicly guaranteed debt is moderate at 31 percent of GDP at
end-2009 and is projected to peak at 36 percent of GDP in 2011. The sizable development partner
support pledged at the Consultative Group meeting in March 2010 (US$2.6 billion over five
years) is equally split between grants and low-interest loans and would thus not impair debt
sustainability; absorptive capacity is more likely to be a binding constraint. The previously
contemplated large loans from China and Russia did not materialize. The identified external debt
of state-owned enterprises amounts to only 0.4 percent of GDP and is treated in the DSA as
implicitly government-guaranteed.3 Private sector external debt, of which only 15 percent is owed
by the banks, is being rolled over smoothly. However, total external debt is projected to reach
77 percent of GDP in 2011, and debt services would exceed 20 percent of exports of goods and
services a few years later. Debt-related difficulties could then arise should external nondebt
financing recede.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
While recovering from the crisis, Moldova has a long way to go. In the short term the
main task for macroeconomic policies is to strike the right balance between supporting the output
recovery, restoring fiscal sustainability, and maintaining financial and external stability. In the
medium term, the challenge will be to facilitate the transition from a state-dependent remittancedriven economy to a market-based export-led one. With this agenda in mind, discussions focused
on policies to:


maintain progress in fiscal adjustment, while opening space for priority investment and
well-targeted social assistance;



support the recovery after the deep recession in 2009, while containing inflation pressures
in the face of large cost-push shocks;



ensure stability in the financial system given remaining risks and foster a resumption of
bank lending; and



raise the economy’s potential growth rate by implementing long-overdue structural
reforms to stimulate private investment, strengthen competitiveness, and facilitate exportled growth.

This excludes the external debt of the gas company Moldovagaz (about 7½ percent of GDP in early 2010) as it is
not a majority state-owned enterprise. The Russian company Gazprom owns 50 percent of Moldovagaz and also
manages the shares owned by Transnistria (about 13 percent).

A. Fiscal Consolidation while Protecting Investment and Social Assistance
15.
Restoring fiscal sustainability is a precondition for sustainable growth. Early 2009
saw a large deterioration of the structural fiscal balance, stemming mainly from unaffordable
increases in public wages and pensions (Figure 2). Domestic sources of budget financing were
nearly exhausted, leading to accumulation of expenditure arrears and necessitating an urgent
mobilization of resources from international development partners. The new government then
embarked on a path to gradually restore fiscal sustainability at a pace matching the economy’s
speed of recovery. The authorities have appropriately chosen restraint in current spending, while
raising social assistance to protect the vulnerable and public investment to address infrastructure
bottlenecks, a type of spending with significant contribution to growth.
16.
The amended 2010 budget continues to pursue growth-enhancing consolidation with
adequate social protection. Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to save most of the
additional revenue brought by higher than projected growth in 2010, while increasing funds for
investment and social assistance (SMEFP ¶8). The amended budget will thus provide for a
37 percent increase in capital expenditure and over 50 percent increase in social assistance
spending relative to 2009. The resulting deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP broadly preserves the
programmed speed of structural fiscal adjustment, including already committed grants (table). It
also provides for gradual, but front-loaded clearance of domestic expenditure arrears, which were
higher than expected at the end of 2009 (SMEFP Table 2). Staff expressed concern about the
higher-than-budgeted spending on goods and services, which signaled difficulties in controlling
the assumption of commitments by various government branches. The authorities stated that
reforms in procurement and internal financial control, to be introduced in the second half of 2010,
will allow them to rein in this spending in 2011 (SMEFP ¶11).

Box 3. Fiscal Consolidation in Moldova1
Large pre-election spending hikes in 2009 led to the emergence of an
unsustainable structural fiscal position in Moldova. The government that came to
office in late 2009 has adopted a fiscal consolidation plan in the context of an
ECF/EFF-supported program with the IMF. The plan envisages a significant but
gradual fiscal adjustment at a speed matching the economy’s rate of recovery from
the 2009 recession. This approach guards against the risk of a negative feedback loop,
where the consolidation deepens the recession and causes a loss of revenue.
The plan focuses on rationalizing the government wage bill and spending on goods
and services––areas where Moldova spends considerably more than its regional peers–
–while protecting quality public infrastructure investment and well-targeted social
assistance. This would be achieved mainly through school and class consolidation in
education, a reform in

net to economic agents who had hitherto evaded it and to focus collection efforts on
companies and sectors with the highest compliance risk.
These measures will be essential to stop further deterioration of Moldova’s fiscal
balances. To secure durable results, however, they must be complemented by further
medium-term structural reforms, in particular in pension and health, to anchor long-run
sustainability and prevent deterioration in fiscal balances in the future.

Restraint on current spending will guide consolidation efforts next year as well. To
advance the ongoing structural fiscal adjustment, the authorities plan to reduce the budget deficit
to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2011, while creating fiscal space to further expand capital expenditure
and increase funds for targeted social assistance (SMEFP ¶9-10). The main consolidation policy
remains continuing rationalization of current spending (1¼ percent of GDP), supported by
reducing budgetary sector employment further by 1¾ percent through attrition (after a similar
reduction in 2010). The budget will also take advantage of gains in revenue (1 percent of GDP)
stemming from the strengthening economy, increased grant assistance, and better tax collection.
18.
Policy discussions on the medium-term framework focused on the appropriate fiscal
stance and size of the government, and reforms needed to reach the desired equilibrium:
Staff and the authorities agreed that the structural budget deficit should be all but
eliminated, in view of low private savings and the budget’s limited access to external
financing. On the current outlook,



The mission welcomed the authorities’ strategy for improving tax collection.
Following the recommendations of a Fund FAD TA mission, the strategy aims to
introduce a risk-based audit selection, target economic agents outside the tax net, and
combat tax evasion and outright fraud. Detailed operational plans for audit, arrears
collection, and taxpayer services will be developed by end-2010 (SMEFP ¶11).



Staff encouraged the authorities to persevere with the implementation of the new
targeted social assistance system as a key instrument for reducing poverty. The main
existing system of social assistance, based on population categories, is poorly targeted.4
The new means-tested system, which is in the process of being phased in since mid-2009,
should considerably improve targeting (at an additional cost of about ½ percent of GDP a
year). Over time, the two systems should be merged into an overall means-tested system
including the most vulnerable households.



The authorities agreed that significant reforms are needed in the social insurance
system to preserve its financial sustainability, particularly regarding sick leave
benefits and early retirement. To this end, two sets of legal amendments will be adopted
by December 31, 2010. One of these amendments will make the mechanism for sick leave
benefits more incentive-compatible by assigning the responsibility for the first day of sick
leave to the employee and the second day to the employer. The other amendment will
phase out the early retirement privileges for civil servants, judges and prosecutors. Staff
welcomed these measures and encouraged the authorities to advance the unfinished
pension reform in the medium term by broadening the contributions base, correcting the
pension determination and indexation parameters, and increasing the effective retirement
age. Such a reform would prevent an unsustainable decline of the already low pension
replacement rate (35 percent of the net wage on average), while preserving the pension
system financial sustainability (Selected Issues, Chapter I).
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

19.
The NBM and staff agreed that the current monetary stance appropriately balances
the need to keep a lid on inflation with the need to support the recovery. Cost-push inflation
and weak demand have complicated monetary policy, and the NBM has had to search for a
balance between containing inflation expectations and sustaining the still weak credit flow. The
mission and the authorities agreed that interest rate hikes in early 2010 have contributed to
stabilizing inflation expectations—thus alleviating second-round effects from the cost-push
shocks—and calming the foreign exchange market. However, as subdued credit and domestic
demand are not likely to fuel inflation pressures at present, the current moderately accommodative
monetary stance appears appropriate. Further monetary action might be necessary if domestic
demand recovers strongly and/or depreciation pressures persist. Moreover, staff supported the
NBM’s view that interventions in the foreign exchange market should continue to aim at
smoothing erratic movements, but should not resist sustained depreciation pressures.

4

The World Bank estimates that over 60 percent of assistance under that system goes to households from the upper
60 percent of income distribution, while more than half of the poorest households do not receive any benefits.

16
20.
There was an agreement that further development of the new monetary policy
framework could strengthen policy effectiveness.


The NBM’s monetary strategy upholds price stability as the primary objective of
monetary policy, operationalized as an annual inflation target, and the NBM’s base
interest rate as the main policy instrument. In view of the still underdeveloped
transmission mechanism and the relatively high degree of dollarization, the NBM and staff
agreed that other instruments of monetary policy, in particular reserve requirements, could
potentially be used as needed. The program design, based on a NIR/NDA performance
criteria and an indicative target for reserve money, remains appropriate at present, but may
be reconsidered when the transition to inflation targeting is complete.



Staff recommended increased NBM operational flexibility, including by extending the
policy horizon to the conventional 24 months and widening the target range to
accommodate large and volatile exogenous inflation shocks and the still weak
transmission mechanism (Box 4). The NBM agreed, while noting that a careful choosing
of the timing of these changes, as well as clear communication of their motivation would
be very important to preserve the credibility of the policy framework. Furthermore, the
NBM is working on amendments to the central bank law that, among other improvements,
shorten the lag between the adoption and effective dates of policy changes and thus
strengthen policy effectiveness.



Continuing extensive NBM communication, including regular press briefings and
publication of monetary policy reports will raise awareness, understanding, and
acceptance of monetary policy actions in the medium term.
C. Strengthening the Financial Sector

Box 4. Monetary Transmission in Moldova1
The transmission of monetary policy in Moldova is hindered by well-known structural
impediments affecting developing countries. Financial intermediation is constrained by a
burdensome legal system, lack of credit information on borrowers, and administrative
barriers to the use of collateral. Financial markets are shallow, with bank loans essentially the
only market source of private funding. A relatively high degree of financial dollarization
(about 40 percent of both loans and deposits are denominated in foreign currencies) limits
monetary policy effectiveness as well.
Quantitative analysis of developments over the past decade reveals a relatively weak
interest rate channel. Monetary policy instruments have only a partial influence on bank
lending rates. An econometric analysis suggests that increases in interest rates lower private
credit and inflation (with a lag), but no statistically significant relationship can be found
directly between interest rates and GDP growth.
The transmission of monetary policy was particularly impaired during the recent
financial crisis. Facing rapidly falling deposits, deteriorating asset quality, and an uncertain
outlook, banks significantly tightened their credit standards and increased the spread between
lending and deposit rates. Successive base rate cuts and injection of liquidity by the NBM
succeeded only partially in encouraging banks to loosen their lending conditions.
Examination of bank portfolios suggests that under such conditions a policy rate cut can still
affect lending rates by lowering the opportunity cost of other assets, but the magnitude of this
effect is small.
A number of measures are needed to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy in
Moldova. Improving debt resolution instruments and development of credit bureaus would
help the banks regain confidence in lending and mitigate credit rationing. Greater
transparency would alleviate market uncertainty about NBM policy, while improvements in
cash flow management by the NBM could also reduce interest rate volatility. Finally,
promoting domestic financial markets will increase reliance on domestic currency
instruments, thus strengthening the interest rate channel of monetary policy.

Moreover, a non-negligible share of foreign currency loans in total loans (Box 4) exposes the
borrowers and banks to exchange rate and credit risks. Finally, the banks’ efforts to clean up
their balance sheets is leading to a still stagnating credit stock, which in turn reduces banks’
interest income and forces them to keep the lending rates high and cut deposit rates to
maintain profitability.
22.
Policy discussions focused on upholding financial stability while seeking to
unblock credit. The NBM and staff agreed that closely monitoring banks’ asset quality,
lending and provisioning practices, and capital needs remained conditio sine qua non.


To ensure adequate capital buffers, the NBM has passed a regulation requiring
banks to keep their statutory capital above MDL 100 million and to double Tier I
capital in stages by end-2012. Moreover, distribution of retained earnings will require
prior notification of the NBM and justification in terms of capital adequacy. Staff and
the NBM agreed that this regulation strikes the right balance between fostering a stable
bank capital base and allowing resumption of lending to support the economy.



There was agreement that a well-developed contingency planning framework is
needed to guard against future financial sector risks. Drawing from the
recommendations of a recent Fund MCM TA report, the authorities have established a
high-level Financial Stability Committee with a main objective to ensure appropriate
interagency coordination and demarcation of responsibilities in times of financial
sector emergencies. By end-December 2010, the institutions represented in the
Committee will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which will provide a
framework for preparing detailed operational contingency plans during 2011 (SMEFP
¶14).



To remove structural impediments to lending, the authorities aim to facilitate
resolution of problem loans and foster company restructuring. Staff and the
authorities concurred that, in addition to the still uneasy business conditions, lending is
held back by bank difficulties in exercising their rights as creditors in case of
nonpayment. Correspondingly, by end-2010 the authorities will prepare legal and
regulatory amendments to ease collateral execution by banks and strengthen bank
incentives to restructure nonperforming loans, as well as speed up restructuring of
viable companies (SMEFP ¶15).

potential. The state footprint on the economy––both in terms of direct asset ownership and

addressed if Moldova aims to grow
out of its status as Europe’s poorest country.
24.
Sustaining high GDP growth over the medium-term will not be possible without a
significant increase in exports. Before the recession of 2009, the economy had relied heavily
on remittances-driven private consumption. While this model of growth will remain important
for the time being, it is nearing its limits (Box 5). Staff and authorities shared the view that
building up export potential and expanding access to the vast markets of Moldova’s major
trading partners in the East and West could provide a strong and sustainable boost to growth.
Consistent with this vision, the government places an emphasis on improving the business
environment and agreed with the need to maintain external price competitiveness.
25.
The authorities showed strong determination to continue improving the business
climate and promote investment. The most important initiatives include (SMEFP ¶16):


Extending the option to receive VAT refunds for purchases of investment goods to
investors in the entire country. Presently, investors in the two largest cities do not
receive such VAT refunds (they can only use their VAT credit to offset future tax
obligations). Affording them this option would unblock vital working capital and thus
facilitate companies’ operations and new investment.

20


Lowering the frequency of inspections of enterprises by various state agencies to
reduce red tape.



Introducing the “one stop shop” provision of business services in the customs
administration and enabling automated data exchange and electronic document
processing. Moreover, the Export Promotion Organization will begin providing a wide
range of consultancy services for exporters and investors.



Amending the necessary legislation to simplify the procedure of converting
agricultural land for industrial and trade needs, as requested by both foreign and
domestic investors.

Staff welcomed these initiatives and pointed out that sustainable growth in the future will
depend largely on the success of efforts to spur export-led growth.
Box 5. Moldova: From Consumption-based to Export-led Growth1
Before the crisis of 2009, growth was mainly driven by expanding domestic demand fuelled
by migrants’ remittances. The share of private consumption in GDP increased from 56 percent
in 1995 to more than 90 percent in 2006–08. The trade deficit ballooned from about 26 percent of
GDP in 2000 to 53 percent of GDP in 2007–08. It was largely covered by remittances, which
jumped from about 5 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s to more than 30 percent in 2006–08.

The growth model based on
remittances is subject to well-known
constraints. As much as 40 percent of
Moldova’s labor force is already
working abroad, and this ratio can
increase further only moderately.
Moreover, migrants’ ties with the home
country weaken over time, and
remittances decline. The outflow of
labor and relatively subdued outlook for
loan-financed private investment and
FDI drag potential GDP growth down to
about 4 percent over the medium term,
which looks modest when compared to
Moldova’s vast development needs and
poverty-reduction objectives.

To boost Moldova’s growth potential, it is essential to promote export-led growth. Lowering
the costs of doing business, including by cutting red tape and facilitating compliance with business
regulations, as well as upgrading the country’s run down infrastructure, are critical for attracting
investments to the sectors producing tradable goods. Maintaining external price competitiveness
by keeping real wage growth in line with productivity gains and avoiding policies that could lead
to large overvaluation of the national currency is equally important.

21
26.
The annual progress report on implementation of the National Development
Strategy (NDS) will reassess Moldova’s development objectives and reinvigorate the
poverty reduction efforts. Drafted in 2007, the NDS was designed to spearhead the
development agenda for 2008-11. However, the economic crisis and political instability
in 2009 disrupted its implementation. By end-October 2010, the government plans to issue a
report that will reflect on the recent progress in poverty reduction and update the objectives
for 2011 (SMEFP ¶22).
27.
The financial condition of the capital’s heating company, Termocom, remains a
large fiscal and social risk. In line with past program conditionality, the energy regulator
ANRE now sets the tariff for heating and has raised it twice in 2010 in response to the higher
price of imported natural gas. While this tariff should allow Termocom to adequately cover its
current expenses, the company’s large historic arrears continue to weigh on the financial
performance of the whole sector. To find a solution to this problem that considers the interests
of all involved parties, the authorities will prepare a restructuring plan for the thermal energy
sector, including Termocom, by end-2010. Until then, it was agreed that creditors will allow
the company to operate normally, provided Termocom remains current on its 2010 liabilities
(SMEFP ¶19). To mitigate the impact of higher energy tariffs on the most vulnerable, the
central government will provide support alongside the municipal assistance scheme until the
new targeted social assistance system has been fully deployed.6
28.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ decision to resume efforts to divest the
remaining large state enterprises, where private involvement could lower prices and
improve service. Specifically, they plan to reopen the divestiture of Moldtelecom, the largest
telecommunications operator, whose privileged position distorts the telecommunication
market. The authorities indicated that they are considering such an operation within a wider
reform process to develop the whole sector. In addition, the authorities will begin preparing
other public companies for divestiture, in particular in air and rail transportation (SMEFP
¶20). Staff agreed that all these operations need to be carefully prepared and launched when
the international investor interest in Moldova returns.
29.
The trade regime is generally open and the authorities are working on further
expanding openness and simplifying procedures. Moldova is a member of the WTO, CIS
and CEFTA. It has concluded sixteen agreements on market access within the CIS and the
Pact on Stability in South-Eastern Europe. Since early 2008, it has also enjoyed Autonomous
Trade Preferences (ATPs) with the EU, which provide unlimited and duty free access to the

The European Commission has recently launched a free-trade-area feasibility study, which
would be a core element of a possible future Association Agreement. Meanwhile, the
authorities have already liberalized meat and dairy imports by simplifying the cumbersome

system of permits introduced in 2007. They intend to continue trade liberalization by
eliminating customs duties on many raw materials and investment goods from 2011 on.
VI. PROGRAM ISSUES
30.
The program design and monitoring mechanism will remain broadly unchanged.
The review schedule and phasing of disbursements is outlined in SMEFP Table 1. The
amended 2010 budget will be passed as a prior action. The authorities are requesting
modifications of the performance criterion on the budget deficit for September 2010 and the
program’s indicative targets for September and December 2010 that reflect the amended
budget and the improving macroeconomic outlook (SMEFP Table 2). New performance
criteria and indicative targets have been proposed for March 2011. The structural
conditionality––existing and proposed––is summarized in Table 3 of the SMEFP.
31.
Safeguards. The updated assessment completed on June 3, 2010 concluded that the
recommendations of the 2006 safeguards assessment have been implemented. Recent
developments of the NBM operations have strengthened the need for an independent
oversight of the bank and a legal framework for lending to local banks. The updated
assessment provided a set of recommendations in this regard, focused on mitigating new risks
and further strengthening the NBM safeguards framework.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.

Moldova is on the right track:



Growth is coming back, supported by a strong export rebound. Manufacturing,
trade, and agriculture are recovering steadily.



The ECF/EFF-supported arrangement is on track. Program implementation under
the First Review has been strong, and the authorities’ policies for the remainder
of 2010 aim to continue the stabilization efforts and support the recovery.

33.
The recovery has only just begun, however, and considerable challenges lie
ahead:


External and domestic developments pose risks to the outlook. A slow recovery in
major partners or spikes in international energy prices could test the recovery and the
policy framework. Political uncertainties could slow the implementation of reforms
and hinder growth and stability prospects.



The economy remains in need of significant structural transformations. Reforms
are needed to promote investment and export-led growth, while the public sector badly
needs expenditure rationalization and restructuring.

34.
The amended 2010 budget will pursue fiscal consolidation in a difficult
environment. Saving most of the unbudgeted revenue while providing additional funds for

23
social protection and investment strikes the right balance between fiscal policy objectives. The
overspending on goods and services is worrisome; decisive and timely reforms in
procurement and internal financial control are needed to rein it in.
35.
Further strong and sustained fiscal action is needed over the medium term. The
structural budget deficit should be essentially eliminated in view of low private savings and
the government’s limited access to external financing. This implies increasing the general
government’s headline balance by some 5 percentage points of GDP over the next four years.
Given the oversized public sector, fiscal consolidation should be achieved mainly by
restraining and prioritizing current spending, supported by measures to enhance revenue
collection and remove tax policy distortions.
36.
The authorities’ commitment to a long-overdue tax administration reform is
welcome. The reforms, which draw on Fund technical assistance, should help raise revenue
collection while reducing the compliance burden on most taxpayers.
37.
Monetary policy strikes the right balance between keeping inflation low and
supporting the recovery. While headline inflation may remain elevated for a while, pushed
up by past energy price adjustments, core inflation remains contained within the NBM target
range. On current trends, domestic demand should not be a source of inflationary pressures
soon, and international energy prices have stabilized recently, alleviating upside risks. The
current moderately accommodative monetary stance appears thus appropriate for the time
being.
38.
The monetary policy framework could benefit from more flexibility. The policy
horizon over which the NBM targets inflation could be lengthened and the band widened to
account for the transmission lags of monetary policy actions and the high uncertainty
stemming from Moldova’s inflation history and exposure to external shocks. The success of
this policy will crucially depend on preserving monetary policy credibility, which calls for
clear communication of the reasons and modalities of these changes.
39.
While external price competitiveness does not raise major concerns, broader
measures of competitiveness suggest a need for deep reforms. After the reversal in 2009,
the real exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, and the labor
costs/productivity combination compares favorably within the region. Broader measures of
competitiveness, however, call for further structural reforms to improve the business
environment, accelerate financial sector development, and invest in infrastructure. Such
reforms would give rise to a virtuous circle, in which rising productivity helps the country
attract foreign investment and know-how, in turn boosting incomes and productivity even
further and creating new jobs.
40.
Vulnerabilities of the financial sector appear manageable, but contingency
planning and reforms to remove impediments to lending will be important to strengthen
stability and development. The NBM should continue its vigilant hands-on supervision and
proactive engagement with banks to ensure that capital and liquidity buffers remain adequate

24
to cope with credit quality risks. A structured framework for contingency planning for
financial emergencies would improve the financial system’s resilience to shocks.
Strengthening the banks’ debt resolution framework could facilitate and speed up NPL
resolution, thus unclogging bank balance sheets to support a resumption of lending.
41.
The transition agenda remains unfinished. Moldova still lags behind other countries
at similar level of development in important areas including investor protection, access to
financing, and underdeveloped infrastructure as measured by various international rankings of
business climate. Recent progress in liberalization and deregulation, especially in international
trade, has been encouraging, but it is just the first step in a long journey.
42.
Stepping up exports is a key to achieving high and sustainable growth over the
medium term. The growth model relying on expansion of the domestic consumption fuelled
by remittances is nearing its limits. To sustain high GDP growth going forward, Moldova
needs to build up export capacities and expand access to the large markets of its neighbors.
43.
Bringing the energy sector to financial sustainability should remain high on the
authorities’ agenda. The maintenance of cost recovery tariffs for heating and other energy
inputs helps buttress the weak financial condition of the energy sector. However, broader and
more comprehensive reforms––including resolution of historic arrears and preparing
companies for private ownership––are needed to put the sector on a truly sustainable footing.
Staff has encouraged the authorities to work with the World Bank and other partners on these
issues.
44.
Staff recommends completion of the first review and approval of the request for
modification of the performance criterion for end-September 2010. Performance under
the program has been strong, and policies for 2010 remain appropriately ambitious. Staff also
supports the establishment of the proposed performance criteria for end-March 2011.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova be held in
accordance with the Executive Board decision on consultation cycles.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ATTACHMENT I: MOLDOVA: LETTER OF INTENT
Chişinău, June 30, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
Washington, DC 20431 USA

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Our reform efforts are proceeding well. Immediate fiscal and financial tensions have
eased, and Moldova is beginning to recover gradually from the recession. The first
quarter of 2010 showed early signs of stronger-than-expected growth of output and
exports amid improved financial and external market conditions. The economy remains,
however, confronted by a number of challenges: the needed fiscal adjustment combined
with only a gradual recovery of remittances and scarce job opportunities restrain domestic
demand; rising bank loan defaults inhibit credit to the economy; foreign investment
inflows are still low partly owing to political uncertainties; and inflation rose rapidly in
the past few months fueled by energy price hikes and the recent nominal depreciation.
Despite these difficulties, the program is on track. All quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets for end-March 2010 were observed. The structural benchmarks
under the program were also completed as planned, and mostly on time. In particular, we
put in place an action plan for a speedy expansion of a means-tested social assistance
scheme which has already led to increased enrollment. Meanwhile, the NBM analyzed
and shared with Fund staff the results of the diagnostic studies of all banks completed by
an external auditor, which confirmed the banks’ stable condition, and prepared legal
amendments to the laws on financial institutions and deposit insurance to strengthen the
bank resolution framework. These legal amendments have been approved by the
Government and, despite some delay, submitted to Parliament for adoption.
In consideration of our strong record of program implementation, we request the
completion of the first review of the program under the Extended Credit
Facility/Extended Fund Facility and the associated disbursement of SDR 60 million. The
second program review, assessing performance based on end-September 2010
performance criteria and structural benchmarks, is envisaged for December 2010.
Moldova remains committed to improving the well-being of the population through
reforms that promote sustainable growth and reduce poverty. This commitment was
shared and supported by our development partners during the Consultative Group
meeting in Brussels in March 2010. In the period ahead, our program will focus on
maintaining a measured pace of fiscal adjustment; reining in inflation while helping banks
restart the flow of credit to the economy; strengthening financial stability through

45
enhanced supervisory capacity and contingency planning; restructuring the energy sector;
and implementing deep structural reforms that would support Moldova’s reorientation
toward export-led growth.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached Supplementary Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (SMEFP) are adequate to achieve these objectives but
will take any additional measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. We will
consult with the IMF on the adoption of such additional measures in advance of revisions
to the policies contained in the SMEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultation. We will provide the Fund with the information it requests for monitoring
progress during program implementation. We will also consult the Fund on our economic
policies after the expiration of the arrangement, in line with Fund policies on such
consultations, while we have outstanding purchases in the upper credit tranches.

Sincerely yours,

Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies

46
ATTACHMENT II: SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
POLICIES
June 30, 2010
1.
The present document supplements and updates the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) signed by the authorities of the Republic of Moldova on
January 14, 2010, to account for recent macroeconomic developments and introduce
policy adjustments, as well as additional policies necessary to achieve the objectives of
the program. We remain committed to meet our obligations assumed previously under the
program.
I. REVISED MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
2.
Growth is outperforming expectations in 2010 so far, but the economy’s full
recovery will be gradual. Real GDP rebounded strongly in the last quarter of 2009 and
we now project a higher GDP growth of 2½ percent this year. But with the still tight
credit conditions and the structural reforms requiring time to bear fruit, growth is likely to
increase only gradually to 3.6 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2012. Exports and
investment are expected to drive activity in the near term, with tailwind from trade
liberalization reforms, a more favorable external environment, and improved
competitiveness. Meanwhile, owing to slow projected growth of disposable income and
consumer lending, consumption is likely to lag.
3.
Barring new external shocks, inflation should return to mid-single digits
in 2011. Fueled by the adjustment of energy tariffs, depreciation of the leu, and higher
excise rates, twelve-month inflation spiked to over 8 percent as of April 2010. While the
effect of these shocks may have already dissipated, further energy tariff hikes in May
could keep the pressure up in the short run. Nevertheless, the subdued if recovering
domestic demand contains core inflation (5½ percent in April), and we expect headline
inflation to decline to 6 percent by mid-2011.
4.
Alongside, strengthening revenue has improved the fiscal position. Solid
revenue rebound in late 2009 and some expenditure savings contained the budget deficit
to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2009. Revenue outperformed in the first quarter of 2010 as well
and we now project additional fiscal revenue of 0.7 percent of GDP this year relative to
the program.
5.
After a sharp drop to single digits in 2009, the external current account
deficit will widen somewhat in 2010-11, before resuming its adjustment. On account
of growing import-intensive domestic demand and some worsening of the terms of trade,
the current account deficit in 2010-11 is likely to widen by 1-2 percent of GDP to about
10½—11¼ percent of GDP. In the medium term, robust export growth and recovering
remittances should steer the current account deficit towards its equilibrium of 7½ of GDP.
Meanwhile, the recovery of foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as strong international
assistance should provide adequate support for Moldova’s external financing needs. At

47
the same time, as the economy’s borrowing space is being filled quickly, further external
borrowing will proceed at a measured pace to contain external debt.
6.
Concerns about financial sector stability have receded for now, but
unblocking credit is a key priority. As the deterioration of the economy in 2009 led to a
decline in demand for credit, a rise in the share of nonperforming loans (over 17 percent
as of April 2010), and a heightened perception of risk, banks have amassed large liquidity
and capital buffers. This has increased their short-term resilience to potential risks, as
confirmed by the NBM’s regular stress tests and the diagnostic study by external auditors.
However, this caution has also led to a large and protracted decline in credit since end2008, thereby slowing down the economy’s recovery.
II. REVISED POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR 2010-11
A. Fiscal Policy
7.
Developing a fiscal policy framework that is commensurate with the
country’s resources and geared toward promoting growth will be critical in the
medium term. Our fiscal strategy is based on the following elements:


Eliminate the large structural fiscal deficit over several years, at a pace
matching the economy’s speed of recovery;



Achieve fiscal adjustment mainly through restraints on the unaffordable
public sector wage bill and low priority current spending;



Strengthen revenue primarily through improved tax administration to
broaden the tax base and reduce fraud and abuse; and



Use the created fiscal space to increase infrastructure investment and
provide well-targeted social assistance to the most vulnerable.

8.
Consistent with this strategy, and reflecting the improved revenue outlook,
we will adopt a revised 2010 budget with a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP as a prior
action. Specifically, the government will use the additional projected revenue of
MDL 1.5 bn to reduce the budget deficit by MDL 0.9 bn, thus broadly maintaining the
planned speed of structural fiscal adjustment, and to fund additional essential spending on
priority social spending (MDL 0.5 bn) and public investment (MDL 0.3 bn). Increased
utility bills and slower-than-expected progress in procurement and internal financial
control reforms necessitate an increase of MDL 0.3 bn in spending on goods and services
in public institutions, which we have offset by savings in interest and other current
expenditure. All other programmed expenditure restraints will be maintained. The
Chisinau municipality will refrain from any previously unbudgeted payments to
municipal employees other than limited amounts for heating assistance. The program
targets for September and December 2010 will be revised accordingly and we request a
corresponding modification of the performance criterion on the general government
budget deficit for September 2010.

48
9.
Fiscal consolidation efforts through restraints on current spending will
continue next year. To advance the ongoing structural fiscal adjustment, we will aim to
reduce the budget deficit further to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2011, while creating room to
expand the strategically important capital expenditure. This will be achieved mainly
through further rationalization of current spending (1.2 percent of GDP), supported by
limiting budgetary sector employment to 228,000 positions through attrition while
reorganizing offices as needed to continue eliminating permanent vacancies. The budget
will also take advantage of gains in revenue (1 percent of GDP) stemming from the
strengthening economy, increased grant assistance, and higher tax collection (¶11).
10.
Social concerns arising from high energy prices will be addressed through
well-targeted social assistance. Specifically, by end-September 2010, the government, in
consultation with Moldova’s development partners, will approve a framework for social
assistance to help vulnerable households cope with higher energy tariffs during the five
cold months of 2011. We estimate the cost of such a framework at about MDL
120 million and will seek, as in 2010, external grant assistance for this purpose.
11.
In parallel, efforts will carry on to reduce fiscal risks and ensure
sustainability of public finances in the medium term. The following measures will be
combined with a number of structural reforms in the pipeline (¶18-20) to ensure a
financially sound public sector:


To address the high level of spending on goods and services, we are implementing
a procurement reform with the assistance of the World Bank. By end-2010, we
will automate the bids for delivery of goods and services in the government’s
centralized procurement agency, which will improve price discovery, thus
lowering the budget cost.



To improve control over budget execution, we have drafted a law on internal
financial control, which will create internal audit units in central administration
agencies. We expect the law to be passed by Parliament by end-September 2010
and the units to be fully operational by end-December 2010.



Having secured financial and technical support for a comprehensive tax
administration reform, an overall reform strategy and a time-bound action plan
along the lines suggested by a recent IMF TA report will be developed by the
Ministry of Finance by end-July 2010. By end-September 2010, the Ministry of
Finance will adopt a tax compliance strategy for 2011, introducing risk-based
audit selection, targeting economic agents not fully included in the tax net, and
combating tax evasion practices and outright fraud (structural benchmark). The
strategy will guide detailed operational plans for audit, arrears collection, and
taxpayer service activities during 2011, to be developed by end-2010.



To address misuse of the sick leave benefits mechanism, by July 31, 2010 we will
amend the relevant government decision to introduce much-needed oversight,
namely that a panel of doctors review the issuance of sick leave certificates.
Furthermore, a draft law will be adopted by December 31, 2010 to make the
mechanism for sick leave benefits more incentive-compatible for employees and

49
employers by assigning the responsibility for the first day of sick leave to the
employee and the second day to the employer (structural benchmark). This law
will also extend the requirement to pay social contributions to all persons
employed in Moldova in line with bilateral treaties. Another draft law, to be
passed by December 31, 2010, will phase out the early retirement privileges for
civil servants, judges and prosecutors by raising their retirement age by six
months every year until it reaches the regular retirement age (structural
benchmark). All these measures will become effective immediately after the
publication of the amendments in the Official Monitor.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
12.
The NBM continues to develop its new monetary policy strategy focusing on
inflation as a single nominal anchor. Despite short-term challenges, steady efforts by
the NBM to improve its communication and forecasting capacity—including by closer
coordination with ministries and public agencies, as well as holding regular press
briefings and publication of monetary policy reports—will help increase effectiveness of
monetary policy in the medium term. The NBM will consider increasing its operational
flexibility, including by extending the policy horizon and widening the target range to
accommodate high underlying uncertainty and the still underdeveloped transmission
mechanism. Furthermore, the NBM will propose amendments to the central bank law that
further strengthen its monetary policy framework, including by shortening the lag
between the adoption and effective dates of policy changes. At the same time, the NBM
will work to improve financial market infrastructure and its own operations to achieve
closer alignment of the bank interest rates with the policy interest rate.
13.
The NBM aims at bringing inflation to mid-single digits, while avoiding
premature tightening. On current trends, the likely overshooting of the end-2010
objective of 5 ±1 percent should be short-lived. The recent NBM interest rate hikes
(200 basis points) have contributed to stabilizing inflation expectations—thus alleviating
second-round effects from the cost-push shocks—and calming the foreign exchange
market. As domestic demand does not generate inflation pressures at present, a pause in
monetary tightening appears appropriate to reassess the inflation outlook. Further
monetary tightening might be necessary if domestic demand recovers strongly and/or
sustained depreciation pressures emerge. NBM communication of the transitory effects of
cost-push shocks on inflation and a commitment to abstain from direct central bank
financing to the economy are of key importance to uphold its accountability and
independence as well. NBM interventions in the foreign exchange market will continue to
aim at smoothing erratic movements, but not resist sustained depreciation pressures.
C. Financial Sector Policy
14.
Notwithstanding the abating immediate financial sector tensions, strong
contingency planning is needed to guard against future risks. In addition to the
forthcoming strengthening of the bank resolution legislation, further institutional action
should ensure appropriate interagency coordination and demarcation of responsibilities,
as well as timely responses to extraordinary financial shocks. In this context, by end-

50
June 2010 we will establish a high-level Financial Stability Committee including senior
policymakers from the institutions likely to be involved in responding to financial
emergencies. Furthermore, by end-December 2010, these institutions will sign a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with rules of coordination and a clear division of
responsibilities between them in times of financial sector distress (structural
benchmark). These measures will create a framework for preparing detailed operational
contingency plans and the necessary legal amendments in the course of 2011.
15.
Meanwhile, we will focus on removing impediments to bank credit through
facilitating resolution of problem loans and strengthening contract enforcement.
Resumption of credit will be facilitated by enhancing the speed and predictability of
collateral execution by banks and by strengthening regulatory incentives for banks to
restructure nonperforming loans. To this end, we will consider making NBM regulations
more supportive of debt restructuring, including by allowing faster reclassification of
restructured loans into lower-risk categories. Moreover, we will prepare amendments to:


the legislation regulating execution of real estate collateral, to allow for a speedy
disposition of the collateral, preferably without mandatory recourse to courts in
case of a dispute between the creditor and the debtor, but with proper safeguards
for the debtor, including swift and transparent auction procedures;



the legislation on corporate insolvency, to facilitate restructuring of viable
companies, inter alia by establishing a maximum period after the initiation of the
(preliminary) insolvency procedure during which secured creditors do not have
the right to dispose of the collateral and upon the expiration of which the secured
creditors will be given the authority to dispose of the collateral in accordance with
the other applicable legal provisions. This will create incentives for the debtor and
its creditors to negotiate a restructuring plan and avoid long liquidations. The
amendments will also establish an optional procedure allowing the court to
swiftly approve a restructuring plan supported by the required majority of
creditors, therefore limiting the ability of minority creditors to forestall
restructuring;



other relevant laws, as necessary, to achieve the above objectives.

By June 15, 2010, we will set up an expert group from key stakeholders to prepare these
amendments and consider other measures necessary to support the above mentioned
objectives. If necessary, we will seek technical assistance from the IMF staff and other
partners. The expert group will prepare a first draft of the amendments and share it with
Fund staff by October 15, 2010. The Government will adopt the legislative amendments
and submit them to Parliament by end-2010 (structural benchmark).
D. Structural Reforms
Improving the Business Environment
16.
Our efforts are focused on cutting red tape and stimulating private
investment and exports. We have already removed a number of export and import

51
restrictions and simplified licensing and custom control procedures (MEFP of
January 14, 2010, ¶21). In addition, we will implement the following additional measures:


By end-September 2010 we will simplify the VAT regime by extending the option
to receive VAT refunds for purchases of investment goods to the entire country
from 2011 on (structural benchmark). Other options to simplify the VAT
regime, in particular for exporters, will also be examined.



Cost of doing business will be lowered further by reducing the frequency of
inspections of enterprises by various state agencies and simplifying access to
digital signatures. These measures will be put in place by end-October 2010.
Meanwhile, we continue to review and streamline business regulations and permit
requirements, including the mechanism for issuing sanitary and veterinary
permits.



To promote trade, we will extend the “one stop shop” provision of business
services to the customs administration while also creating adequate IT capabilities
to enable automated data exchange and electronic document processing. The
Export Promotion Organization will be strengthened further with a view to turn it
into a one stop shop with a wide range of consultancy services for exporters and
investors.



To stimulate private investment and strengthen protection of investors’ rights, we
will review and amend as needed investment-related legislation, including the
laws on joint stock companies, entrepreneurship, and capital markets.



We will amend the Land Code and other related legislation to simplify the
procedure of converting agricultural land for other business needs.

Raising Efficiency of the Public Sector
17.
A modern economy requires efficient and motivated civil service. In
accordance with our plans, we will proceed gradually to introduce a new merit- and
performance-based wage system for public sector employees. As a first step, by end-2010
the Government will finalize the descriptions of job functions and responsibilities and
assess the needs to restructure institutions and offices. This system—which should not
lead to a marked increase in the public sector wage bill—will be put in place by endSeptember 2011.
18.
An oversized education sector, not fully attuned to the needs of the economy,
is a major impediment to growth and fiscal sustainability, and requires urgent
action. Our strategy is to eliminate excess capacity allowing a leaner and better-equipped
education system with adequately trained and paid staff.


In accordance with our plans, a government decision to merge ten vocational
schools will be passed by end-June and, combined with seizing enrollment in
three pedagogical colleges as of September 2010, will allow directing resources to
improve conditions in other schools. Further efficiency gains are expected from
the reduction of the number of classes in secondary schools from school

52
year 2010/11, as well as from allowing schools greater freedom to generate
revenue from own assets.


Going forward, we continue preparations for a comprehensive education reform. It
will seek school consolidation with a large part of the immediate budget savings
used to improve quality of the schools, procure a large fleet of school buses, and
repair school bus routes. Awaiting results from the two pilot rayons and the
nationwide feasibility study to be launched this summer, we, in cooperation with
the World Bank, aim to prepare a timetable for a school optimization program by
end-2010.

19.
We are committed to a credible strategy to resolve structural problems in the
energy sector, a long-standing drain on public resources. A long history of politicized
heating tariff setting has already bankrupted the heating company Termocom, created
large domestic and external gas payment arrears, with snowballing effects from underinvestment and inadequate coordination between creditors, utility companies, and the
authorities. To remedy the situation, our strategy will include the following elements:


By end-December 2010, the Ministry of Economy, the Chisinau municipality, and
key companies from the thermal energy sector, in consultation with the World
Bank and the IMF staff will agree on a restructuring plan for this sector, including
Termocom (structural benchmark).



Until then, Termocom’s ability to operate must be preserved through a credible
creditor coordination framework. To this end, by June 15, 2010, we will conclude
a MoU involving the Ministry of Economy, Termocom, its main creditors, and the
Chisinau municipality. Key elements of the MoU will include: (i) a method of
distribution of Termocom’s cash inflow that will allow the company to remain
current on its 2010 liabilities and prepare for the 2010/11 heating season, with
allowance for collection lags in its receivables; (ii) creditors’ abstention from
blocking Termocom’s bank accounts to allow the company to conduct normal
operations as long as the MoU is being observed; (iii) seeking resolution of
Termocom’s historic arrears (accumulated prior to end-2009) primarily through
asset sales/swaps.



The National Agency for Energy regulation (ANRE), in accordance with its
mandate and methodology, shall continue to set tariffs at levels that do not lead to
accumulation of arrears and losses in public utility companies.



Having secured financial assistance from the Swedish International Development
Agency (SIDA), by end-June 2010, ANRE, in consultation with SIDA, the World
Bank, and the IMF staff, will select a reputable international auditor to conduct a
financial audit of Termocom, to be completed by end-September 2010. The audit
results, combined with the results of ANRE’s own audit of Termocom, shall
inform Termocom’s restructuring plan.



The legacy of wage tariff norms, set in fixed proportion to the minimum wage,
still persists in utility companies and leads to unwarranted hikes of their wage
costs every time the minimum wage is raised. To alleviate the impact of this

53
practice on tariffs, ANRE will allow in the tariffs only inflation indexation of the
wage bill and the direct impact of minimum wage increases on wages below the
new threshold, while leaving utilities the freedom to raise wages further out of
profits and efficiency gains.
20.
With the external investment climate gradually improving, the government
will revive efforts to divest its noncore assets. By end-2010 the government, with
assistance from international financial institutions, will seek to select an advisor to
explore and propose options to develop the telecommunications sector, including through
divestiture of Moldtelecom. At the same time, by end-2010 the government will review
the list of state assets and prepare a timetable for the divestiture of other public companies
to facilitate liberalization of key sectors, particularly air and rail transportation.
E. Program Monitoring
21.
The program will be monitored through semi-annual reviews, prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and structural
benchmarks. The phasing of purchases under the arrangement and the review schedule
are set out in Table 1 of this memorandum. The second review under the program is
expected to be completed by December 31, 2010, and the third review – by
June 30, 2011. The list of the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
remains as set in ¶27 of the MEFP of January 14, 2010. The indicators set as performance
criteria will also serve as indicative targets at end-December 2010. The quantitative
performance criterion on the ceiling on the general government deficit for
September 30, 2010 has been revised in line with the updated fiscal projections (Table 2).
The quantitative indicative targets for September 30, 2010 and for December 31, 2010
have been revised as well. New performance criteria and indicative targets for
March 31, 2011 have been set (Table 2). The prior actions for completion of the first
review and structural benchmarks are set out in Table 3. Prior actions and structural
benchmarks for the third review will be further specified at the time of the second review.
The understandings regarding the quantitative performance criteria described in this
memorandum are specified in the TMU attached to the MEFP dated January 14, 2010.
22.
In accordance with the rules on the use of the Extended Credit Facility, we
will submit to the Fund and the World Bank an annual progress report on the
implementation of the National Development Strategy (2008-11) by endOctober 2010. The report will reflect progress in poverty reduction for the period with
the latest available data and will update the poverty reduction objectives for 2011.

On January 29, 2010, the Executive Board of the IMF approved three-year
arrangements for Moldova under the Extended Credit Facility and the Extended Fund
Facility (ECF/EFF). With each facility providing an equal amount, the combined
financial assistance will be equivalent to SDR 369.6 million (300 percent of quota) to
support the country’s economic program. The approval made an amount equivalent to
SDR 60 million (48.70 percent of quota) immediately available, with the remainder
available in installments subject to semiannual reviews.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) is
subject to an assessment with respect to the ECF/EFF arrangements approved on
January 29, 2010. The assessment completed on June 3, 2010 updated the findings of
the 2006 safeguards assessment. It concluded that recommendations of the 2006 safeguards
assessment have been implemented. However, recent developments of the NBM operations
have strengthened the need for an independent oversight of the bank and legal framework for

4
lending to local banks. The updated safeguards assessment provided a set of
recommendations focused on mitigating new risks and further strengthening the NBM
safeguards framework.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime was reclassified from a de facto peg (to the U.S. dollar) to a
managed float in April 2006. Due to the revision of the classification methodology, effective
February 2, 2009, the classification has been changed to floating, retroactively to
April 30, 2008. The NBM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in
order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the Moldovan leu against the dollar.
At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at changing the trend of the exchange
rate determined by the market. The NBM publishes the information on its interventions.
The official exchange rate of the Moldovan leu to the U.S. dollar announced by the NBM is
determined as the weighted average of daily noncash market transactions performed on the
interbank and intrabank market. The NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other
currencies on the basis of the leu-U.S. dollar rate and the cross-rate between the U.S. dollar
and these currencies.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 12, 2008 (Country Report
No. 08/139). Timing of the next Article IV consultation will be set in accordance with the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
X.

FSAP Participation:

Moldova received an FSAP mission in May 2004; the FSSA (Country Report No. 05/64) was
presented to the Board at the time of the 2004 Article IV discussions. An FSAP update
mission visited in October 2007; the FSSA update (Country Report No. 08/274) was
presented to the Board with the 2007 Article IV Consultation report.

ANNEX II: MOLDOVA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 27, 2010)
A. The World Bank Group Strategy
1.
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Moldova for FY09FY12 was approved on December 23, 2008. The CPS aims at assisting the country in
improving competitiveness and laying the foundations for inclusive economic growth. The
Bank works closely with the Government and other development partners in support of two
pillars of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2008-2011: (i) enhancing economic
competitiveness; and (ii) developing human resources, enhancing employment, and
promoting social inclusion. To effectively support these two pillars, the Bank’s strategy
includes a third pillar and crosscutting priority: (iii) improving governance and addressing
corruption, including improved public sector efficiency and effectiveness. The choice of
pillars has been guided by the Government’s own development strategy, client perspectives,
the lessons learned from the previous CAS, and the Bank understanding of Moldova’s
development challenges. Analytic and advisory work is a core element of the Bank’s
program.
2.
The Bank Group’s program of support for Moldova capitalizes on those areas where
the Bank has a comparative advantage for optimal impact and it tries to be strategic in its
engagement, not only in terms of where to direct IDA resources but also in terms of how to
best leverage its own internal partnerships. IFC plays a critical role in ensuring that the
Bank’s program appropriately addresses the needs of the private sector within the results
framework set forth by the CPS. IFC is well-positioned to provide an integrated package of
advisory support in removing the investment climate constraints to agribusiness
development. IFC will continue to provide trade finance, credit lines and advisory services to
financial intermediaries for lending to MSMEs, as well as support to regional private equity
funds that would help support the competitiveness of Moldovan companies.
3.
At least one single-tranche budget-support operation within the period was envisaged
to support economic recovery. In addition to these broad objectives, the CPS, which was
prepared at the onset of the crisis and political uncertainty, emphasized the need for
flexibility in the lending program of US$45-50 million per annum during FY09-FY12
(depending on IDA’s performance-based allocation system) in response to the impact of the
global financial crisis and political uncertainty. With IDA commitments in FY09 backloaded, IDA has been positioned to respond strongly to assist the authorities in mitigating the
impact of the crisis in FY10, with overall IDA commitments, including a current
Development Policy Operation (DPO), reaching US$69 million. Specifically, over this CPS
period, the Bank scaled up financing for five on-going, successful projects: Energy 2,
Moldova Social Investment Fund 2, Rural Investment Support Project 2, Health and Social
Assistance, and the Competitiveness Enhancement Project.

7

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
IDA’s partnership with the IMF in Moldova’s development strategy has been strong
over the past few years. Bank and IMF staffs have executed joint work and have continued to
carry out joint missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic policy dialogue with the
Government. The IMF is taking the lead on macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the lead
on structural and social issues. In a number of areas where the mandates of the two
institutions overlap, such as public finance, the work is being closely coordinated to ensure
that consistent advice is provided to the authorities. The existence of an IMF program has
been an important input for the determination of the adequacy of the macroeconomic policy
framework.
Areas in which the World Bank leads
5.
The Bank’s dialogue post-crisis has stressed the importance of achieving an orderly
fiscal balance and hastening economic recovery. Our budget support operation seeks to
ensure that social assistance spending is better targeted at the poorest, that road maintenance
is increased and small-scale social investments are preserved, and that declining agricultural
support is increasingly channeled towards investments. To kick start a more sustainable
recovery, the Bank is encouraging Government to liberalize export sectors, and to seek to
attract new private investment in ICT and energy sectors. In addition to budgetary support,
the World Bank scaled-up financing to a series of existing and successful operations in order
to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and help a speedier recovery.
6.
In the social and health areas: the Moldova Social Investment Fund 2 (MSIF2) was
scaled up to prepare a public works program, which will provide job opportunities to the
unemployed, while also building desperately needed community infrastructure. Also, during
the economic crisis, the Global Food Crisis Response helped to protect and improve the
health and nutritional status of vulnerable populations. This was achieved through
interventions to decrease the nutritional vulnerability of pregnant women, lactating mothers
and young children, and provision of temporary cash transfers to social institutions for the
elderly, children and people with mental and physical disabilities. A results-based Social
Protection Project is currently under preparation to help strengthen the effectiveness of the
social safety net.
7.
In education, the Quality Education in Rural Areas Project supports the
Government's education program to enhance the quality of teaching and learning, increase
access and equity, improve the efficiency in public spending for education, and strengthen
education planning and monitoring.
8.
In the area of competitiveness, additional financing was added to the
Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) to facilitate the growth of an export-oriented

8
real sector with: (i) a line of credit through qualified commercial banks to support investment
and working capital needs of exporting enterprises; and (ii) expanded matching grant scheme
to assist enterprises with upgrading their labor skills and management practices, and
introducing new products.
9.
In the area of rural and agricultural development, the Rural Investment and
Services Project 2 (RISP2) was scaled up primarily to add financing to the existing and wellperforming line of credit to rural entrepreneurs for farm and off-farm activities. Access to
credit is an important constraint to economic activity in Moldova and the situation has
worsened due to the global crisis. The RISP2 line of credit will help to mitigate the impact of
the crisis.
10.
In Public Sector Management, the World Bank manages a multi-donor Trust Fund to
support the Government’s efforts to reform the Central Public Administration. The Bank also
supports the development of the Government’s Public Finance Management System through
a new information system as well as technical assistance in support of internal controls and
audit
11.
With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services impacting the population at large and the poor in particular. The Energy
2 Project was scaled up to provide heating systems to public institutions, reduce losses in
electricity transmission and distribution networks. The National Water Supply and Sanitation
Project is aimed at (i) improving the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water
and sanitation services in selected urban and rural communities; and (ii) enhancing the
capacity of Ministry for Construction and Territorial Development (MCTD) to prepare and
supervise the implementation of investment program and to provide technical assistance to
the operating Apa Canals. The Moldova Road Sector Program Support Project is aimed at
reducing road transport costs for road users in Moldova by improving the condition and
quality of its road network and the way it is managed. The Bank is preparing an ETransformation for Governance Project focused on using ICT as a tool for improving
governance and tackling corruption (e.g. e-government, e-procurement).
12.
The Bank has supported a number of environmental projects. The Environmental
Infrastructure Project was approved by the Board in FY07. The objectives of the project are
to improve the quality of sanitary services in Northern Moldova and reduce the discharge of
pollutants, including nutrients into the Nistru River and demonstrate and disseminate costeffective nutrient reduction strategies and technologies for municipal wastewater sources.
Climate change is high on the Bank’s agenda with a proposed new operation – Disaster and
Climate Management Project.

9
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
Macroeconomic Development. The Bank’s team cooperates closely with the IMF in
the process of finalization of the 2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). The Bank
and the IMF jointly prepared a high level retreat in October 2009 to discuss current economic
situation and the best options of crisis response with the whole cabinet of Ministers of the
Republic of Moldova. These eventually led to new financing programs of both institutions
concluded with the government and a very successful Consultative Group meeting of
Development partners held on March 24, 2010 in Brussels. Development partners expressed
their strong support for the Government’s strategies elaborated based on the consultations
with the IMF and the WB and indicated financial support totaling US$2.6 billion over the
next four years, of which 30 percent is in budgetary and balance of payments support. The
dialogue between the IMF, WB and the key government officials on the drivers of economic
growth and growth strategy of Moldova in general was continued during the last IMF and
WB team visits on May 6, 2010.
14.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank is going to support the dialogue
between the IMF and the Government on 2011 budget. In this context, a policy note is under
preparation by the World Bank Staff that will analyze public expenditures in more detail and
provide some advice on the areas where efficiency savings can be achieved.
15.
Debt Management. The Joint IMF/WB team provided the Ministry of Finance of
Moldova with technical assistance on the Medium-Term Debt Strategy elaboration in
October 2009. The Ministry of Finance is now considering the follow up technical assistance
request to the Bank and the Fund with the aim of preparing Debt Management Reform Plan.

ANNEX III: MOLDOVA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 9, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance
and program monitoring. The authorities have continued to make improvements over the past
several years in a number of key areas, with technical assistance from the Fund.
National Accounts:
National accounts statistics are prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
according to the 1993 SNA methodology. Estimates do not include the Transnistria region
for which data have not been collected since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and
the expenditure sides, annually and quarterly. The data are prepared in current and constant
(previous year) prices, and annual data are revised—in two stages—as updated information
becomes available. However, the quarterly data often remain unadjusted, thus limiting their
consistency with the revised annual data.
Price statistics:
The NBS publishes monthly data on CPI and PPI and began publications of the core CPI
from 2010. The weights of the CPI basket are subject to annual review and adjustment in line
with the shifts in consumer basket.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled on cash basis, in broad compliance with the
recommendations of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986). With
the support of Fund TA, the authorities contemplate phased migration strategy for moving to
accrual-based fiscal accounting and implementing the GFSM 2001 beginning from 2012.
Full implementation of the GFSM 2001 would require significant strengthening of the
detailed balance sheet breakdowns and underlying accounting systems.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with international statistical standards
and of a generally good quality. The NBM compiles and submits monetary data using
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). Monetary data are reported by the NBM on a regular
basis and are being published in the IFS Supplement.
External sector statistics:
The compilation methodology follows the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual.
Besides the balance of payments statistics, Moldova disseminates quarterly international
investment position and external debt statistics. Data on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity are disseminated monthly.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Moldova
July 16, 2010

1.
This statement provides additional information on economic developments in Moldova
that became available since the issuance of the staff report. The additional information does not
change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On June 30, Parliament passed an amended 2010 budget in line with the
understandings in the Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. This
was a prior action for the First Review of the program (see SMEFP Table 3).
3.
The latest available data have been favorable and broadly in line with staff’s
projections. Industrial production grew by 11 percent in May relative to the same period last year,
providing further evidence of a sustained recovery. Twelve-month inflation in June fell to
7.8 percent, in line with expectations that the effect of earlier hikes in energy prices would be shortlived. In May, growth in credit to the economy turned positive on a 12-month basis for the first time
since June 2009, helping to increase banks’ profits and stabilize the NPL ratio at 17.3 percent.
Available monetary and fiscal data for May are in line with the June quantitative targets.
4.
On June 24, the World Bank approved an Economic Recovery Development Policy
Loan for Moldova in the amount of US$25 million. The loan will be used to fund priority
expenditure for economic recovery and social protection and lay the foundations for a sustained
post-crisis recovery in Moldova through exports and private investment.
5.
In early July, Russia’s consumer protection agency blocked Moldovan wine––a main
export product––from the important Russian market. Citing poor quality, the agency rejected
sizable consignments. The Moldovan and Russian authorities are discussing the matter. Meanwhile,
the Moldovan authorities have advised Moldovan exporters to suspend shipments to Russia until the
issue is resolved.
6.
Heavy rains have caused widespread floods in recent days. While the situation is still
evolving, the damage is likely to be significant, with hundreds of houses destroyed, thousands of
people displaced, and large areas of crops flooded. The authorities have appealed to the private
sector and the international community for emergency financial assistance in the form of grants.
7.

The authorities have consented to the publication of the staff report and the SMEFP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 27, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Moldova
On July 16, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Moldova.1
Background
Moldova has experienced rapid growth in 2006-08 spurred by booming remittances and FDI.
These trends reversed sharply in 2009 with the global downturn, driving real GDP down by
6½ percent and giving rise to large fiscal and external imbalances. Since January 2010, the
authorities’ efforts to restore fiscal, external, and financial sustainability and reignite growth are
being supported by two arrangements with the IMF: the Extended Credit Facility and the
Extended Fund Facility, amounting in total to SDR 369.6 million (US$546 million at present).
The economy is steadily recovering, with GDP growing by 4.7 percent in Q1 2010 relative to a
year ago. Economic activity is bolstered by a pick-up in industrial production and trade,
supported by the removal of many restrictions on exports and imports and exchange rate
depreciation, and growth is projected to reach 2.5 percent in 2010. Twelve-month inflation
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
reached 7.9 percent in May owing to necessary increases in energy tariffs, exchange rate
depreciation, and increases in excise taxes. However, core inflation remains contained close to
5 percent.
Fiscal adjustment has been strong and focused on restraining current spending. The 2009
deficit came well below expectations as a result of an upsurge in tax revenue and expenditure
savings, and the pace of fiscal adjustment has been maintained so far in 2010.
Monetary policy was significantly eased in the second half of 2009 to inject liquidity in financial
markets. Early in 2010 the monetary stance was slightly tightened to curb second-round effects
from energy tariff increases, but it remains accommodative to shore up the still subdued credit
growth and fragile recovery. The National Bank of Moldova has also announced inflation targets
in support of its objective to maintain price stability. Further development of the new monetary
policy framework would help strengthen policy effectiveness.
The financial sector has been relatively sound. Banks have remained liquid and well-capitalized,
and exposure to foreign assets and institutions in distress is minimal. However, nonperforming
loans remain high at over 17 percent in April 2010––although this ratio seems to have
stabilized––warranting vigilant monitoring of bank stability.
Executive Board Assessment
Moldova’s economy is recovering after the deep recession triggered by the global economic
crisis. In the context of the Fund-supported program, the authorities have made encouraging
progress in reestablishing economic stability and rekindling growth.
Fiscal policy has embarked on an adjustment path. Taking advantage of the faster than
expected recovery, the amended budget for 2010 appropriately saves the bulk of the extra
revenue while allocating more funds for public investment and social protection. The new
system of targeted social assistance has helped reduce extreme poverty. To sustain the pace of
fiscal consolidation going forward, the focus should remain on restraining current spending and
curtailing the oversized public sector.
The moderately accommodative monetary policy stance has been supporting the growth
recovery without losing sight of the inflation targets. After the transitory impact of external
upward pressures on prices and much-needed adjustment of energy tariffs in early 2010,
inflationary pressures have subsided. The central bank closely monitors financial indicators of
the banking sector, which appears liquid and well-capitalized. The gradual shift of the monetary
policy framework towards inflation targeting should continue, while interventions in the foreign
exchange market should aim only at smoothing erratic fluctuations without resisting sustained
trends.

3

The ongoing and envisaged structural reforms are appropriately focused on stepping up
liberalization and deregulation and creating a business environment conducive to investments
and exports. Building up export potential and expanding access to the vast markets of
Moldova’s major trading partners in the East and West should provide a strong and sustainable
boost to growth. Implementation of government plans to divest state enterprises should help
improve their efficiency and attract additional foreign investments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under the Extended Credit Facility and
the Extended Fund Facility Arrangements with Moldova
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review of Moldova's economic performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and
the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements. The blended financing arrangements under
the ECF and the EFF for an amount equivalent to SDR 369.6 million (about US$559.18
million) were approved on January 29, 2010 (see Press Release No.10/21). The completion
of the first review makes an amount equivalent to SDR 60 million (about US$90.78 million)
immediately available for the authorities. The Executive Board also modified the endSeptember performance criterion on the budget deficit in line with the reduced 2010 deficit
target.
After the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
“Moldova’s economy is recovering after the deep recession triggered by the global economic
crisis. In the context of the Fund-supported program, the authorities have made encouraging
progress in reestablishing economic stability and rekindling growth.
“Fiscal policy has embarked on an adjustment path. Taking advantage of the faster than
expected recovery, the amended budget for 2010 appropriately saves the bulk of the extra
revenue while allocating more funds for public investment and social protection. The new
system of targeted social assistance has helped reduce extreme poverty. To sustain the pace
of fiscal consolidation going forward, the focus should remain on restraining current
spending and curtailing the oversized public sector.
“The moderately accommodative monetary policy stance has been supporting the growth
recovery without losing sight of the inflation targets. After the transitory impact of external
upward pressures on prices and much-needed adjustment of energy tariffs in early 2010,
inflationary pressures have subsided. The central bank closely monitors financial indicators

2

of the banking sector, which appears liquid and well-capitalized. The gradual shift of the
monetary policy framework towards inflation targeting should continue, while interventions
in the foreign exchange market should aim only at smoothing erratic fluctuations without
resisting sustained trends.
“The ongoing and envisaged structural reforms are appropriately focused on stepping up
liberalization and deregulation and creating a business environment conducive to
investments and exports. Building up export potential and expanding access to the vast
markets of Moldova’s major trading partners in the East and West should provide a strong
and sustainable boost to growth. Implementation of government plans to divest state
enterprises should help improve their efficiency and attract additional foreign investments”.

Statement by Age F. P. Bakker, Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova and
Victor Yotzov, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 16, 2010
The Moldovan authorities appreciate the constructive dialogue with the Fund
management and staff over the years. They attach great value to the close relationship
with the Fund, whose advice continues to support the policy formulation process in
Moldova.
Recent Developments
Growth has outperformed earlier expectations. Real GDP rebounded strongly since the
last quarter of 2009 and now the authorities project a higher GDP growth of 2.5 percent
this year. In spite of this, with still tight credit conditions and ongoing structural reforms,
growth is likely to increase only gradually to about 5 percent in 2012. Exports and
investment are expected to drive activity in the near term, strongly supported by recent
trade liberalization reforms and a more favorable external environment. Due to the
adjustment of energy tariffs, depreciation of the leu, and higher excise rates, twelvemonth inflation spiked to over 8 percent in early 2010, but is gradually subsiding now. It
is expected to return to mid-single digits in 2011 as the effect of the above mentioned
shocks dissipates.
The fiscal position improved significantly over the last months. A solid revenue rebound
in late 2009 and some expenditure savings contained the budget deficit to 6.4 percent of
GDP in 2009. Revenue continues to outperform in the first quarter of 2010 as well and
now the authorities project additional fiscal revenue of 0.7 percent of GDP and lower
overall deficit this year relative to the program.
After a sharp crisis-driven drop to single digits in 2009, the external current account
deficit is expected to widen to slightly above 10 percent of GDP in 2010-11, before
resuming its adjustment. In the medium term, robust export growth and recovering
remittances should steer the current account deficit towards its estimated equilibrium of
about 7-8 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the recovery of FDI, as well as strong
international assistance, is expected to provide adequate support for Moldova’s external
financing needs. At the same time, as the economy’s borrowing space is being filled
quickly, further external borrowing will proceed at a measured pace to contain external
debt.
With regard to the performance under the program, all PC and indicative targets for endMarch 2010 were observed, and all structural benchmarks were implemented. In
particular, the authorities put in place an action plan for a speedy expansion of a meanstested social assistance scheme, which has already led to increased enrollment. The NBM
analyzed and shared with Fund staff the results of the diagnostic studies of all banks

2
completed by an external auditor, which confirmed the banks’ stable condition. The
NBM also prepared legal amendments to the laws on financial institutions and deposit
insurance to strengthen the bank resolution framework. These amendments have been
approved by the Government and submitted to Parliament for adoption.
Fiscal Policy
The Moldovan authorities are committed to developing a fiscal policy framework that is
commensurate with the country’s resources and geared toward promoting growth.
Accordingly, the fiscal strategy, as underscored in the original MEFP as well as in the
recent supplement, is based on four main pillars:
 Essentially eliminating the large structural fiscal deficit over several years, at a
pace matching the economy’s speed of recovery;
 Achieving fiscal adjustment mainly through restraints on the unaffordable public
sector wage bill and low priority current spending;
 Strengthening revenue primarily through improved tax administration to broaden
the tax base and reduce fraud and abuse; and
 Using the created fiscal space to increase infrastructure investment and provide
well-targeted social assistance to the most vulnerable.
Consistent with this strategy, and reflecting the improved revenue outlook, the authorities
adopted a revised 2010 budget to a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP – down from 7 percent
as envisaged in the original program. Moreover, fiscal consolidation efforts through
restraints on current spending will continue next year. To advance the ongoing structural
fiscal adjustment, the authorities aim to reduce the budget deficit further to 3.4 percent of
GDP in 2011, while creating room to expand the strategically important capital
expenditure. This will be achieved mainly through further rationalization of current
spending, supported by limiting budgetary sector employment. The budget is also
expected to take advantage of gains in revenue (up to 1 percent of GDP) stemming from
the strengthening economy, increased grant assistance, and higher tax collection.
In addition, to improve control over budget execution, the authorities have already
drafted a law on internal financial control, which will create internal audit units in central
administration agencies. It is expected that the law will be passed by Parliament by endSeptember 2010 and the units to be fully operational by end-December 2010.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
The NBM continues to develop its new monetary policy strategy focusing on inflation as
a single nominal anchor. Despite some short-term challenges, steady efforts by the NBM
to improve its communication and forecasting capacity will help increase effectiveness of
monetary policy in the medium term. Furthermore, the NBM is considering increasing its
operational flexibility, including by extending the policy horizon and widening the target
range to accommodate high underlying uncertainty and the still underdeveloped
transmission mechanism. At the same time, the NBM is planning to propose amendments
to the central bank law that further strengthen its monetary policy framework, including
by shortening the lag between the adoption and effective dates of policy changes

3
The main challenge for the central bank is bringing inflation to mid-single digits while
avoiding premature tightening. On current trends, the likely overshooting of the end-2010
objective of 5 ±1 percent should be short-lived. The recent NBM interest rate hikes have
contributed to stabilizing inflation expectations (thus alleviating second-round effects
from the cost-push shocks) and calming the foreign exchange market. As domestic
demand does not generate inflation pressures at present, the monetary authorities believe
that a pause in monetary tightening appears appropriate to reassess the inflation outlook.
Further monetary tightening may be considered if domestic demand recovers strongly
and/or sustained depreciation pressures emerge. Meanwhile, NBM’s interventions in the
foreign exchange market will continue to aim only at smoothing erratic movements, but
not resisting sustained depreciation pressures.
Financial Sector Policy
Limited financial integration has kept Moldova insulated from the international financial
turmoil. Banks have remained liquid and well-capitalized, and exposure to foreign assets
and institutions in distress is minimal. Moreover, low interdependency limits the systemic
threat from individual bank failures. However, nonperforming loans, currently above 17
percent of total, remain high and give cause for some concern.
Notwithstanding the abating immediate financial sector tensions, the authorities have
embarked on strong contingency planning to guard against future risks. In addition to the
forthcoming strengthening of the bank resolution legislation, further institutional action
should ensure appropriate interagency coordination and demarcation of responsibilities.
In this context, a high-level Financial Stability Committee, including senior policymakers
from the institutions likely to respond to financial emergencies, has been recently
established and is already operational.
The authorities focus on removing impediments to bank credit through facilitating
resolution of problem loans and strengthening contract enforcement. They are also
studying how resumption of credit can be facilitated by enhancing the speed and
predictability of collateral execution by banks and by strengthening regulatory incentives
for banks to restructure nonperforming loans. To this end, the authorities consider making
NBM regulations more supportive of debt restructuring, including by allowing faster
reclassification of restructured loans into lower-risk categories.
Structural Reforms
The authorities’ general goal remains cutting red tape and stimulating private investment
and exports. To this end a number of export and import restrictions and simplified
licensing and custom control procedures have been implemented. In addition, the
authorities plan to implement additional measures, including simplifying the VAT regime
for exporters; lowering cost of doing business by reducing the frequency of inspections of
enterprises by various state agencies and simplifying access to digital signatures. Also,
the authorities continue to review and streamline business regulations and permit
requirements.

To promote trade, the authorities plan to extend the “one stop shop” provision of business
services to the customs administration while also creating adequate IT capabilities to
enable automated data exchange and electronic document processing. The Export
Promotion Organization will be strengthened further with a view to turn it into a one stop
shop with a wide range of consultancy services for exporters and investors.
The authorities are strongly committed to a credible strategy to resolve structural
problems in the energy sector. A long history of politicized heating tariff setting has
already bankrupted the heating company Termocom, created large domestic and external
gas payment arrears, with snowballing effects from underinvestment and inadequate
coordination between creditors, utility companies, and the authorities. To remedy the
situation, the government is working on a strategy that would include a general
agreement between all interested parties on a restructuring plan for the sector as a whole.
Until then, Termocom’s ability to operate will be preserved through a credible creditor
coordination framework.
With the external investment climate gradually improving, the government will revive
efforts to divest its noncore assets. By end-2010 the government, with assistance from
international financial institutions, will seek to select an advisor to explore and propose
options to develop the telecommunications sector, including through divestiture of
Moldtelecom. At the same time, by end-2010 the authorities plan to review the list of
state assets and prepare a timetable for the divestiture of other public companies to
facilitate liberalization of key sectors, particularly air and rail transportation.
The authorities fully acknowledge that a modern economy requires efficient and
motivated civil service and are strongly committed to raising efficiency of the public
sector. In this regard, the main objective is introducing a new merit- and performancebased wage system for public sector employees. As a first step, by end-2010 the
Government will put efforts to finalize the descriptions of job functions and
responsibilities and assess the needs to restructure institutions and offices. The new
system should not lead to a marked increase in the public sector wage bill and will be put
in place by end-September 2011
Finally, the Moldovan authorities believe that the policies set forth in the SMEFP are
well designed and sufficient to achieve the objectives of the program. At the same time,
they stand ready to take any further measures that may become necessary. In accordance
with the Fund’s policy, the authorities will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the SMEFP.
