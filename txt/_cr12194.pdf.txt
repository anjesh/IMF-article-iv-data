STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 8, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Nigeria has shown robust growth during the past decade, with rates among the
highest in sub-Saharan Africa. However, unemployment rates have risen and the public
finances and balance of payments remain vulnerable to a fall in oil prices.
Outlook and Risks: Inflation is projected to rise slightly in 2012 owing to the reduction in
the fuel subsidy, while growth is projected to remain strong at 7 percent. The principal
downside risk is a larger than envisaged deterioration in the global environment that
substantially reduces world oil prices.
Rebuilding fiscal buffers: The government’s planned fiscal consolidation for 2012–15 will
be essential for rebuilding fiscal buffers in the uncertain global environment and
safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
Clarifying the monetary framework and reducing pressures on foreign exchange
reserves: The monetary authorities should focus on a clear inflation objective and allow the
naira to gradually adjust in response to market conditions.
Restoring financial system stability: The resolution of the 2009 banking crisis has been
largely completed. Comprehensive reforms to strengthen supervision and the regulatory
framework have been initiated.

Promoting Inclusive Growth: The authorities aim to boost prospects for inclusive growth
by improving the business climate, addressing infrastructure gaps, and implementing
reforms that promote sectors with high employment potential.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NIGERIA

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Nigerian economy has grown
robustly even during the 2008–09 global
crisis, partly due to the effective
implementation of countercyclical policies.
Non-oil GDP growth has remained stable
despite a considerable decline in oil prices and
a domestic banking crisis in 2009. A strong
countercyclical policy stance prior to the
global crisis allowed Nigeria to accumulate
substantial fiscal savings and international
reserves and to later use them up to minimize
the crisis’s impact on the domestic economy.
2.
While growth has been strong, it has
not been fully inclusive. Although Nigeria’s
growth rate over the last decade has been
among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa and
there is some evidence of income gains for the
rural poor,1 the official unemployment rate has
risen in recent years, reaching 24 percent in
2011 (Figure 1), and the achievement of many
of the Millennium Development Goals is still a
long way away (Table 6). 2

3.
The 2011 Article IV consultation
discussions centered on the policies needed
to rebuild buffers amid the uncertain global
environment, safeguard macroeconomic
stability, and make growth more inclusive.
Discussions also focused on reforms to
improve management of the oil sector and oil
revenues; and on the steps taken to resolve
the recent bank crisis and strengthen the
supervisory and regulatory framework. This
policy agenda reflects the main issues covered
in the authorities’ Transformation Agenda
(Appendix I). During 2011, the authorities’
policies were broadly in line with
recommendations from the 2010 Article IV
consultation, including commencing with fiscal
consolidation; tightening monetary policy;
establishing the Sovereign Wealth Fund; and
moving ahead with bank resolution and
banking reforms.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
Economic growth remains strong
and inflation has declined (Figure 1). Non-oil
GDP growth held relatively stable at
8.3 percent in 2011. A decline in oil and gas
output in the first half of the year is expected
to have resulted in an overall real GDP growth
rate of about 6.7 percent. Inflation declined to
10.2 percent in December 2011 (y-o-y),
compared with 11.7 percent a year earlier, in
response to monetary tightening by the

“Nigeria – Employment and Growth Study”

Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics has a relatively
broad definition of unemployment. It considers as
employed only those members of the work force that
work 40 or more hours per week, whereas the ILO
definition has no minimum threshold for hours
worked.

NIGERIA

5.
Despite historically high oil prices,
international reserves remained flat
(Figure 2). Notwithstanding an estimated sharp
improvement in the external current account in
2011, international reserves remained flat in
the face of net capital outflows, reflecting
political uncertainty prior to the April 2011
general elections; a global flight to safety in
the second half of the year; and intervention
by the CBN during the first three quarters of
the year to avoid a depreciation of the
currency. In November 2011, the authorities
adjusted the soft exchange rate band
(+/-3 percent) around the naira-US$ bilateral
rate by some 3 percent to accommodate
continuing downward exchange market
pressures.3
6.
A modest fiscal consolidation took
place in 2011. (Figure 3). The non-oil primary
deficit (NOPD) of the consolidated
government is estimated to have narrowed
slightly from about 34.6 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2010 to 32.9 percent in 2011, mainly
due to expenditure restraint at the federal
government level. Higher oil prices helped
shrink the overall fiscal deficit from 7.7 percent
of GDP in 2010 to about 0.2 percent of GDP in
2011.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

measure, after being introduced on
January 1, was partially rescinded just two
weeks later. The subsidy cost about 4 percent
of GDP in 2011. Its removal caused the
gasoline price to rise by 116 percent and
proved to be extremely unpopular. After a
week-long national strike, the government
rescinded the measure, rolling back the price
to 50 percent above the old subsidized price of
N65 per liter (Appendix II).
8.
Monetary policy was tightened
substantially in 2011. After lowering its
overnight deposit rate to one percent in
mid-2010 to support the fragile banking
system, the CBN has increased the rate by
900 bps since September 2010 (Figure 4).
Market rates have risen accordingly and real
short-term interest rates are now positive for
the first time in nearly four years, fluctuating at
around 4-6 percent.
9.
Financial soundness indicators point
to continued improvements in the health of
the banking system. Non-performing loans
have declined sharply following their purchase
by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria
(AMCON) and credit has stopped declining
(Figure 5).

7.
The authorities had planned the
removal of the gasoline subsidy to be a key
source of fiscal saving in 2012 but the
3

Nigeria’s exchange rate regime is classified as “other
managed”. Nigeria is an Article XIV member. Multiple
prices are a technical characteristic of the central
bank’s Dutch auction system and can give rise to a
multiple currency practices (MCP). Staff does not
recommend approval of this MCP. Staff is currently
conducting a comprehensive review of Nigeria’s
exchange system to identify the extent of any further
restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to
Fund approval.

B. Outlook and Risks
10.
The baseline economic growth
outlook remains positive. Non-oil GDP
growth is projected to moderate to 7.8 percent
in 2012, reflecting the tighter monetary and
fiscal policies and a softer global economy,
while overall GDP growth would rise slightly to
6.9 percent on the basis of a moderate
rebound in oil output. Over the medium term,
non-oil growth is projected to moderate
further, reflecting continued fiscal adjustment,
and then level off at about 7 percent. Oil
production would grow gradually, rising from
2.4 million barrels per day in 2011 to
2.6 million barrels per day in 2015.
11.
The baseline macroeconomic
projections assume the implementation of
the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan.
Based on the draft 2012 budget and the partial
removal of the fuel subsidy, the NOPD of the
consolidated government would decline to
27.9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012. The
authorities’ 2012–15 Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) contains strong restraint in
recurrent spending, which is projected to
reduce the NOPD further to 18 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2015.4 The accumulation of oil
revenue savings is projected to boost
international reserves from US$33 billion in
2011 to US$61 billion in 2015. Staff’s
assessment of reserve adequacy indicates that
the projected path of gross reserves could be
close to the estimated optimal range
(Appendix III).
12.
Inflation is projected to rise
temporarily as a result of the increase in
4

These staff projections assume fiscal measures that
would offset half of the remaining subsidy cost in
2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

gasoline price. Inflation is forecast to peak at
around 12–13 percent in the middle of year
and then decline to 11–12 percent by year’s
end, reflecting effects of the monetary
tightening in 2011 and the authorities’ planned
fiscal consolidation. Over the medium term,
inflation is projected to fall to the 5–8 percent
range.
13.
Risks to the short-term outlook are
skewed to the downside. A larger than
envisaged deterioration in the global
environment could result in substantially lower
world oil prices, thereby limiting the
possibilities for fiscal consolidation and the
buildup of international reserves (Figure 6).
Based on the limited data available to staff,
spillovers from potential eurozone banking
problems appear small as domestic banks rely
relatively little on external funding. Failure to
implement the authorities’ planned fiscal
adjustment measures would result in faster
accumulation of domestic debt, and put an
undue burden on monetary policy to contain
inflation and prevent pressures on the naira
and international reserves. Finally, the ongoing
violence in the northern Nigeria could
adversely impact growth prospects, particularly
if it spreads to other parts of the country.
Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities had a broadly similar
view on the outlook and risks. They
expressed serious concern about the
heightened global economic uncertainty and
the possible contagion effects for Nigeria.
Indeed, the authorities revised down the
budget reference price in the MTEF to US$70
per barrel for the 2012–15 from a previously
announced US$75 per barrel.

NIGERIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REBUILDING FISCAL BUFFERS
15.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy aims
to rebuild fiscal buffers, reorient spending
from recurrent to capital; and keep debt
levels low.5 The projected NOPD in the
medium term is also in line with staff’s
estimates of the long-run sustainable NOPD
(Appendix IV). Staff endorsed the fiscal
objectives as well as the key policy measures
designed to achieve them:


Given its high cost, eliminating, or at least
substantially reducing the gasoline subsidy
is essential to the success of any fiscal
adjustment effort.



Medium-term fiscal adjustment is to be
driven mainly by restricting the growth of
recurrent spending; the wage bill, when
adjusted for inflation, is projected to
decline on average by 2 percent a year
after having risen by 23 percent in 2010.



The setting of a budget oil reference price
at US$70 per barrel will induce fiscal
restraint at the state and local government
levels, given their relatively limited
borrowing capacity (Box 1).



Intensified efforts to improve non-oil
revenue collections will help to reduce
fiscal vulnerability to oil price shocks.

16.
During the discussions, the
authorities anticipated that the elimination
of the subsidy would be unpopular but
viewed the subsidy as fiscally unsustainable
and highly distortionary. Moreover, the
5

Staff analysis indicates that Nigeria is at low risk of
debt distress. However, a prolonged oil price shock
without offsetting measures could undermine the
recent progress made in public debt sustainability.

removal of the subsidy was key to creating
fiscal space for infrastructure spending and
well targeted social safety net programs that
were important to drive the authorities’
inclusive growth agenda. Evidence from a
number of countries shows that gasoline
subsidies are regressively distributed, with by
far the largest benefits accruing to the richest
households.6 In Nigeria, the subsidy has
discouraged private investment in domestic
refining capacity, resulting in a drain on
foreign reserves through the importation of
petroleum products. Moreover, given rampant
rent-seeking behavior and smuggling, a
significant portion of Nigeria’s fuel subsidy
benefits accrue to people in neighboring
countries.7 In an effort to address concerns
leading to opposition to the measure, the
authorities launched a public information
campaign and established the Subsidy
Reinvestment and Empowerment (SURE)
program, which includes a transparent
monitoring framework for the subsidy savings
and the specific projects that are to be funded
by the savings. These projects include road,
railway, and petroleum refinery construction;
the expansion of urban mass transit systems;
youth employment programs; and conditional
cash transfers for pregnant women (see
Appendix II).

6

See Coady et al., Petroleum Product Subsidies: Costly,
Inequitable, and Rising (IMF Staff Position Note,
SPN/10/05, 2010). Using evidence from 13 countries
(not including Nigeria), this study found that over 80
percent of total benefits from gasoline subsidies
accrued to the richest 40 percent of households.
7

According to the authorities, estimated daily gasoline
consumption in the first half of 2011 was about 39
million liters, while subsidy claims were made on about
51 million liters.

NIGERIA

Box 1. The Fiscal Framework in Nigeria
Nigeria’s complex fiscal federalism is comprised of three tiers of governments (federal, states, and
local governments (SLGs)) and many extra-budgetary funds. All oil and gas revenue and most of non-oil
revenues are pooled and then shared by all tiers of governments. The sharing formula for oil and gas
revenue, which accounts for over 75 percent of total revenue, is prescribed in the Constitution: after
allocating 13 percent to producing areas, the remainder is shared as following: federal government
(48.5 percent), states (26.7 percent), local governments (20.6 percent); and extra-budgetary funds
(4.2 percent).
The authorities have made many attempts to improve the management of oil and gas revenues. In
2004, the budget oil price-based rule was established along with the Excess Crude Account (ECA)—a
stabilization fund. The inflows into (outflows from) the ECA were the oil revenues in excess of (below) the
budget benchmark revenues, which was determined, ex ante, by the budget oil price and projected oil and
gas production. The money allocated to the budget and the deposits into the ECA accrued to the various
tiers of government according to the constitutionally determined sharing formula. The final budget oil price
was typically the outcome of negotiation between the executive branch and the National Assembly. As the
budget oil price sets the portion of the oil revenue that is directly distributed to the levels of government, it
is a key instrument to constrain spending, especially for the SLGs, which have limited borrowing capacity.
The ECA has lost traction in recent years. As the ECA accumulated large balances, spending pressures
built up and a variety of discretionary withdrawals nearly depleted the fund by the end of 2010. In this
context, the authorities replaced the ECA with the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which has a much stronger
legal foundation. The SWF, which was launched in October 2011, is jointly owned and supervised by all three
tiers of the government, and has three separate components, each of which is allocated 20 percent of
“excess” oil revenue above the budget benchmark revenue: a stabilization fund; an infrastructure fund (to
finance domestic infrastructure development); and an inter-generational saving fund. The governing board
has the discretion to allocate the remaining 40 percent among the three funds. The stabilization fund will be
better protected against ad hoc withdrawals with stricter withdrawal rules than under the ECA. However, the
legislation is silent on the mechanism for determining how much oil revenue is allocated to the SWF, as the
benchmark budget oil price remains subject to negotiation between the executive and legislative branches.
In an oil producing country, the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) should ideally serve as the anchor for
fiscal policy. The authorities agreed and noted that they use the NOPD in their own fiscal policy analysis.
However, given the authorities’ lack of control over SLG spending, which comprises around 50 percent of
total general government spending; they are not able to directly target the NOPD. Thus, the budget oil
price-based rule, together with ceilings on the federal government deficit (3 percent of GDP) and debt
(25 percent of GDP) prescribed by the 2007 Fiscal Responsibility Act, constitutes the fiscal anchor in Nigeria.
Looking forward, it will be important to further strengthen the framework by adopting a rules-based
approach to setting the budget benchmark revenue and strengthening compliance provisions for the Fiscal
Responsibility Law.

17.
The partial reinstatement of the
subsidy is estimated to cost 2 percent of
GDP in 2012. Staff recommends that the
authorities come up with additional measures
to offset at least half of this cost in order not
to jeopardize the buildup of reserves in the
Sovereign Wealth Fund (the likely source of
funding for the subsidy).8 The authorities have
publicly announced that they remain
committed to a full removal of the subsidy but
have not specified any timeline. In the
meantime, they have established a formal
process to deepen consultations with
stakeholders (including labor unions) and
begun to address issues raised by them,
including fast-tracking the rehabilitation of
refineries and initiating an audit of the stateowned petroleum company. At the time the
staff report was written, the authorities were
still determining their revised fiscal strategy for
2012.
Staff also noted that the planned
18.
contraction of the real wage bill and other
recurrent spending would need to be handled
carefully. In particular, measures would need to
be underpinned by comprehensive reforms in
order to ensure that the fiscal savings were
sustainable and consistent with the goal of
improved public service delivery. Reforms
currently being implemented to improve public
expenditure management systems are also
crucial.9

8

Some savings may come from scaling back
infrastructure programs whose funding was tied to the
subsidy savings.
9

The authorities have completed an inventory of all
government bank accounts, and have set up a
Treasury Single Account (TSA) technical committee
under the Accountant General. However, more work is
required to articulate the scope and structure of the

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

19.
With a flat outlook for oil revenues,
the limited growth in government spending
will not result in a substantial improvement
in the overall fiscal balance. As a result, the
projected accumulated fiscal surpluses would
fall well short of the formula-driven inflows
into the Sovereign Wealth Fund
(SWF, see Box 1). Some of this difference is
reflected in the accumulation of federal
government domestic debt, which is projected
to rise from 15 percent of GDP in 2011 to
17 percent in 2015, and whose cost of
servicing substantially exceeds the projected
return from the SWF financial assets. In the
discussions, staff noted that the asset-liability
mix might not be optimal and could be
addressed by linking inflows into the
intergenerational savings and infrastructure
components of the SWF to the generation of
fiscal surpluses. However, given that the SWF
legislation was passed into law only last year
(and requiring considerable political effort) it is
too soon to propose revisiting the framework.
20.
In light of the risks to the global
economy, staff recommended that priority
be given to rapidly building up the SWF’s
precautionary balances. Thus, during
2012-13, the SWF’s stabilization fund should
be allocated close to the maximum allowable
60 percent of gross SWF inflows. Staff also
discussed short-term options to minimize the
issuance of domestic debt. Two options to
explore are (i) utilizing some of the substantial
federal government bank deposits
(around 8 percent of GDP) instead of
borrowing; and/or replacing debt financing
with funding from the infrastructure fund to
finance the capital projects in the budget.

21.
The erosion of oil revenues (in terms
of non-oil GDP) over the medium term
highlights the importance of strengthening
the focus on non-oil revenues. The
authorities’ efforts to boost non-oil revenues
are appropriately focused on improving tax
administration. They anticipate a substantial
gain in collections from operational
improvements and reforms at tax collection
agencies, and new rules requiring
income-generating government agencies and
enterprises to make remittances to the
treasury based on their gross instead of net
revenues. Notwithstanding positive gains from
these measures, staff argued that tax policy
measures would also be needed in the
medium term. Tax rates on the non-oil sector
are substantially below the African average
and there are also widespread exemptions.

Staff recommended that work on tax policy
reform, incorporating Fund TA advice, be
accelerated so that it could begin to be
implemented in the next few years.
Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities indicated that they
would seek to maximize the allocation to
the SWF’s stabilization fund in the near
term. They also agreed on the urgency to raise
non-oil revenues. However, they felt that it was
important to focus on the successful
implementation of their tax administration
reforms before turning to tax policy reform, to
maximize the latter’s effectiveness. They were
also confident that the measures they had
initiated to boost revenues collections, in
particular from government agencies, would
surpass staff projections.

CONTROLING HIGH INFLATION AND FOREIGN
EXCHANGE PRESSURES
23.
Staff supported the tightening of
monetary policy over the past year and the
adjustment of the soft exchange rate band
last October. The reversal of the overly
accommodative policy stance was needed to
contain inflation and to counter continued
pressures on international reserves. Staff
discussed the CBN’s decision to intervene
heavily in the foreign exchange market during
much of 2011 to avoid a depreciation of the
currency (Figure 4). Staff considered that this
policy could have risked excessively depleting
reserves.
24.
Staff recommended focusing on a
clear inflation objective and allowing
gradual adjustment of the naira over time
in response to market conditions. It

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

indicated that more empirical work on the
pass-through from exchange rates to inflation
would strengthen the CBN’s ability to detect
and respond to inflationary pressures. With
increased openness of the capital account, the
exchange rate will become more sensitive to
interest rate differentials and shifts in
international investor sentiment. In this
context, attempts to stabilize the currency at a
specific exchange rate could frustrate the
CBN’s desire to pursue an independent
monetary policy oriented toward price
stability. Staff’s analysis of the exchange rate,
based on CGER-based methodologies,
suggests that the currency is broadly in line
with fundamentals (Appendix V).

NIGERIA

25.
Following the 275 basis point
increase in the policy rate in October, staff
sees merit in a “wait and see” approach
before taking further action on interest
rates. The full impact of October’s strong
tightening measures and November’s shift of
the exchange rate band is most likely yet to be
fully realized. Moreover, the authorities should
not react to the temporary rise in inflation
caused by the partial removal of the fuel
subsidy provided second round effects do not
materialize. Staff supports the CBN’s intentions
to scale back reliance on the cash reserve ratio
and more actively use open market operations
to guide short-term interest rates. This will
make the monetary policy rate a more
effective signaling tool and improve the
monetary transmission mechanism.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities noted that early in
2011, monetary policy was still focused on
supporting the fragile banking system. The
accommodative monetary conditions may
have contributed to high inflation and
excessive foreign exchange demand. At the
same time, they intervened in the foreign
exchange market and resisted a depreciation

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

of the currency fearing that a depreciation
could add to the financial market nervousness
already arising from the banking crisis and the
presidential election campaign and further fuel
inflation. Nevertheless, the CBN emphasized
that it was not in favor of defending the
exchange rate at all costs and agreed that the
naira should be allowed to adjust to changes
in market conditions. It also agreed that more
empirical research would help to better shed
light on the impact of exchange rate
movements on inflation.
27.
The CBN reiterated its commitment
to bring inflation down into the single
digits. It emphasized that the government
needed to deliver on its promised fiscal
adjustment so that the burden of
macroeconomic management could be more
evenly shared. While the CBN believed that
recent tightening measures were still to make
their full impact on inflation, it explained that it
would not shy away from additional hikes in
the policy rate if required. Moreover, the CBN
regarded the elimination of the fuel subsidy as
crucial for relieving pressures on the currency
and facilitating accumulation of international
reserves.

RESTORING FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY
28.
The recapitalization of the
intervened banks was completed in late
2011, and with it, the resolution of the 2009
banking crisis has been largely achieved.10
10

In 2009, 8 out of 24 banks (one third of the system
by assets) had to be intervened because of either
insolvency or serious undercapitalization. The
authorities intervened decisively by injecting liquidity
into the troubled banks, providing broad guarantees,

Nonperforming loans were purchased by the
Asset Management Company of Nigeria
(AMCON) in exchange for tradable three-year

for private investors to inject capital sufficient
for these banks to meet prudential
requirements. The other three (smaller) banks
have been temporarily nationalized and fully
recapitalized by AMCON. About N3.6 trillion
(face value) in bonds (16 percent of 2011
non-oil GDP) was issued to finance these
operations and AMCON recently requested an
increase in its borrowing limit to N4.5 trillion.
The authorities removed the CBN guarantees
on all interbank liabilities at the end of 2011,
based on their assessment that there had been
no new problems with the recapitalized banks.
29.
Staff stressed that the operations of
AMCON need to minimize fiscal and moral
hazard risks. With the cleanup of financial
institutions completed, staff supported
AMCON’s decision to halt purchases of new
NPLs. Staff expressed concern that the absence
of a sunset clause for AMCON and its authority
to purchase NPLs outside of a crisis resolution
framework could encourage moral hazard
behavior by banks in the future. It
recommended that AMCON aim to wrap up all
operations associated with the recent crisis in
12 years as planned. To deal with the purchase
of NPLs outside of a crisis resolution
framework, staff recommended that the
authorities explore options to facilitate the
development of private distressed asset firms.
30.
AMCON’s financial operations
envisage the repayment of its financial
liabilities after 12 years with no need for
cashflow support by the government. The
funds for repaying the recapitalization bonds
are expected to come from an annual
0.3 percent levy on bank assets; the sale of
assets securing the acquired NPLs; and grants
(N500 billion over 10 years) funded from the
CBN’s net profits. Staff considered that
AMCON’s projection of no funding gap was

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

based on reasonable assumptions and fairly
robust in the face of less favorable parameters.
At the same time, the mission urged continued
focus on strengthening AMCON’s operational
capabilities in order to maximize asset
recoveries—a key parameter for its financial
viability.
31.
Staff welcomed the many initiatives
underway to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework (Appendix VI).
Stricter regulations on corporate governance
and risk management; programs to improve
the CBN’s ability to assess systemic risks; and
initiatives to boost cross-agency and crossborder cooperation among regulators will help
to avoid a repeat of conditions that prevailed
prior to the 2009 crisis. While steps have been
taken towards improving the AML/CFT regime,
staff encourages the authorities to address the
remaining AML/CFT-related deficiencies and to
continue the process of implementing the action
plan they agreed with the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF).11
Authorities’ Views
32.
The CBN recognizes that, following
three years of financial sector turmoil and
the implementation of a number of
reforms, a comprehensive evaluation of the
soundness and stability of the banking
system is needed. It expressed a strong
interest in undergoing an FSAP Update in
2012, which would serve as an excellent means
to take stock of all the measures taken thus far
(including in the AML/CFT area) and provide a

road map for remaining reforms. Regarding
moral hazard risks associated with AMCON,
the authorities agreed that it would be
important to facilitate the operations of private
distressed asset firms. They noted that absence
of such firms was due mainly to a legal
framework that made it extremely difficult to
secure collateral on non-performing loans;
AMCON’s success in this regard was due to the
special legal powers accorded to it. The

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

authorities clarified that the absence of a
sunset clause for AMCON was not aimed at
making AMCON a permanently active
institution, but at avoiding a potentially timeconsuming legislative process to establish
another such vehicle in case of future need. In
this context, staff saw merit in “mothballing”
AMCON, so as to have it as a readily available
tool to respond quickly to eventual future
banking crises.

REFORMS AGENDA
A. Oil Wealth Management
33.
Staff welcomed the establishment of
the Sovereign Wealth Fund last year, given
its stronger legal framework compared with
that of the ECA. In November 2011, the SWF
was capitalized with a transfer of US$1 billion
from the Excess Crude Account, which will be
gradually wound down. The hiring of the SWF
management team is underway while
operating rules governing withdrawals from
the infrastructure fund, and investment of SWF
resources still need to be articulated (Fund
technical assistance is scheduled for early
2012). The authorities expected that the SWF
would be fully operational by June 2012. Staff
emphasized the importance of ensuring that
the SWF was able to improve the transparency
of the administration and use of oil revenues,
including the revenues accruing to subnational governments. Staff reiterated
recommendations made during the 2010
Article IV consultation that spending funded

from the SWF should be channeled through
the budget.
34.
The authorities plan to move ahead
on the Petroleum Industry Bill, which has
been stalled in the National Assembly for
about three years. The draft bill, which
benefitted from TA from the World Bank and
the Fund, contains comprehensive reforms
that, among other things, redefines the roles
of key executive and regulatory agencies and
the national oil company, and outlines a new
fiscal regime governing oil and gas. A key
objective of the new fiscal regime is to
increase the government take from operations
under production sharing contracts. The
authorities agreed that it would be crucial to
ensure that the final legislation retains the
spirit and objectives of the original bill, which
aimed to significantly enhance transparency
and accountability in the sector.

B. Policies for Promoting Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth
35.
The authorities see economic
diversification and increased
competitiveness as vital to achieving their

goal of strong, sustainable inclusive
growth. The increase in the official
unemployment rate likely reflects, to an

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NIGERIA

important degree, a growing informalization
of the labor market.12 Indeed, in recent years,
the main sources of growth have been
agriculture and wholesale/retail trade, both
predominantly informal sectors and likely to
have work weeks less than 40 hours. The
authorities’ approach is to focus on reversing
the trend toward informality, while
simultaneously facilitating the growth of
labor-intensive sectors. Policy initiatives in this
direction are focused on (i) boosting
infrastructure, particularly in transportation
and electricity generation; and (ii) improving
the business climate (Appendix I). In this latter
area, the 2012 World Bank’s Doing Business
Report noted a need to address difficulties in
paying taxes, registering property, and
carrying out international trade, and the high
cost and inadequate supply of electricity.13
Staff supported the reforms in the energy
sector, in particular the plan to introduce
cost-reflective pricing (scheduled for the first
half of 2012), aimed at increasing investment

and boosting electricity supply. Staff also
supported the authorities’ intention to protect
the most vulnerable users, including through
lifeline electricity tariffs. Staff endorsed efforts
to scale up public investment to address gaps
in infrastructure within the expenditure
envelope envisaged in the MTEF; and reforms
to transform agriculture from a subsistence to
a modern, commercially oriented sector with
strong linkages to the manufacturing sector.
36.
A key medium-term challenge is to
increase credit access for the productive
sectors of the economy. Staff welcomed
initiatives that have been launched to
strengthen credit bureaus, expand options to
collateralize credit, and pro-actively develop
domestic capital markets. The FSAP update
could flesh out a concrete set of proposals to
enhance access to credit for enterprises.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Nigeria has shown robust growth
during the past decade, with rates among
the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. It
emerged largely unscathed from the global
financial crisis as the government used up
the large buffers accumulated during the
previous oil boom.

12

See World Bank, 2009, Nigeria: Employment and
Growth Study p.9).

13

13Nigeria has just tenth the electricity generation
capacity of South Africa,while having four times its
population.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

38.
Economic growth is projected to
remain strong in 2012 but risks are skewed
to the downside. A larger than envisaged
deterioration in the global environment could
result in substantially lower world oil prices,
thereby limiting the possibilities for fiscal
consolidation and the buildup of international
reserves. Failure to implement politically
difficult fiscal adjustment measures could
result in faster accumulation of domestic
debt, and put an undue burden on monetary
policy to contain inflation and prevent
pressures on the naira and international
reserves.

NIGERIA

39.
Implementation of the MTEF is key
to rebuilding fiscal buffers, lowering
inflation, and maintaining economic
stability. Staff believes that the planned fiscal
adjustment path will allow for a rebuilding of
precautionary reserves in the Sovereign
Wealth Fund and keep debt at appropriately
low levels. Staff supports the fiscal adjustment
measures, in particular, setting the budget oil
reference price at US$70 per barrel for
2012-15; phasing out the fuel subsidy with
due social safeguards; restricting the growth
of recurrent spending; and intensifying efforts
to improve non-oil revenue collections.
40.
Given the global risks, the decision
to set the budget reference oil price at the
relatively conservative level is appropriate.
Furthermore, excess revenues that accrue to
the SWF should be allocated to build up the
stabilization fund as rapidly as possible. Once
this is achieved, proportionately more of the
SWF inflows can be allocated to the
infrastructure fund, which should be used to
finance projects that are included in the
budget.
41.
The reduction in the gasoline
subsidy in January 2012 and planned use
of some of the savings to fund better
targeted safety net programs and high
priority infrastructure projects has a
number of potential benefits. The subsidy
has been costly, poorly targeted, and has led
to major economic distortions, such as
discouraging investment in domestic refining
capacity; and rent-seeking behavior, including
smuggling to neighboring countries. Efforts to
further reduce fuel subsidies could be guided
by an evaluation of the experience in early
2012. The reduction in the gasoline subsidy
should be supported by aggressively
following through on reforms aimed at

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

improving public financial management
systems and the management of the country’s
oil resources. In this regard, the Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF) and the Petroleum
Industry Bill (PIB) are crucial reforms.
Important SWF operational procedures
remain to be clarified to ensure that the
government is able to improve its control of
the overall stance of fiscal policy.
A rules-based approach to setting the budget
oil price would further strengthen the fiscal
framework and the SWF. The authorities
should also prioritize the passage of the PIB,
making sure that it retains the key objectives
of the original bill, including better
transparency and accountability.
42.
The projected decline of oil
revenues relative to the non-oil GDP over
the medium term highlights the
importance of strengthening the focus on
non-oil revenues. While the current focus on
strengthen tax administration is well founded,
staff recommends that work on tax policy
reform, incorporating Fund TA advice, be
accelerated so that it could begin to be
implemented in the next few years.
43.
The tightening of monetary policy
over the past year and the recent
adjustment of the soft exchange rate band
are welcome, and come in the wake of a
period of overly accommodative monetary
policy. Staff sees merit in a “wait and see”
approach before taking further action on
interest rates and sees no need to react to the
first round increase in inflation arising from
the reduction in the fuel subsidy. The decision
in late November to adjust the soft exchange
rate band around the naira-US$ bilateral rate
by some 3 percent was a sensible move to
accommodate foreign exchange market
pressures, which have since abated. Staff’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NIGERIA

analysis does not point to a fundamental
misalignment of the exchange rate. Looking
ahead, staff recommends focusing on a clear
inflation objective and allowing a gradual
adjustment of the naira over time in response
to market conditions.
44.
The authorities’ actions to resolve
the recent banking crisis have been
commendable. The recapitalization process is
complete and financial soundness indicators
point to continued improvements in the
health of the banking system. Based on the
limited data available to staff, spillovers from
potential eurozone banking problems appear
small.
45.
The operations of AMCON need to
minimize fiscal and moral hazard risks. The
operational capabilities of AMCON should
continue to be strengthened in order to
maximize asset recoveries. With the cleanup
of financial institutions virtually completed,
the staff supports AMCON’s decision to halt
purchases of new NPLs. AMCON should aim
to winding up all operations associated with
the recent crisis within the envisaged 12-year
period. At the same time, staff sees merit in
mothballing AMCON, so as to have it as a
readily available tool to respond quickly to
future eventual banking crises.
46.
Staff welcomes the many initiatives
underway to strengthen regulation and

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

supervision. Stricter regulations on corporate
governance and risk management; programs
to improve the CBN’s ability to assess
systemic risks; and initiatives to boost
cross-agency and cross-border cooperation
among regulators will help to avoid a repeat
of conditions that prevailed prior to the 2009
crisis. The reforms to strengthen the AML/CFT
framework are also positive and the
authorities should continue to implement the
action plan agreed with the FATF. Staff shares
the authorities’ view that an FSAP update in
2012 would serve as an excellent means to
take stock of all the reforms undertaken thus
far and provide a road map for remaining
reforms.
47.
The initiatives now underway to
improve the business climate and reform
sectors with high employment potential
can substantially boost prospects for
inclusive growth. Staff supports the scaling
up of public investment within the
expenditure envelope envisaged in the MTEF;
initiatives to reform the energy sector, in
particular increasing power supply and the
introduction of cost-reflective pricing; and
market-based reforms to improve access to
credit for productive sectors.
48.
Staff recommends that Nigeria
remains on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

Oil Shock

Baseline

Oil price shock scenario assesses the impact of a 20 percent price decline (around $20 a barrel) relative to
the baseline. As the resulting oil price remains above the budget reference price for oil, no adjustment in
public spending is assumed. Non-oil GDP and non-oil exports are also assumed unchanged.
Alternative scenario assumes that some key reforms are not implemented. In particular (a) real recurrent
spending is held constant in contrast to the real reduction outlined in the authorities' MTEF; (b) remaining
fuel subsidies are not removed and financed through the SWF. While building the SWF, preference is given
to stabilization fund.

NIGERIA

Appendix I—Transformation Agenda
President Goodluck Jonathan and his
economic team have announced a
‘Transformation Agenda’ that sets out the
economic goals and policies of his
administration for 2012–15. It is compatible
with Nigeria’s development strategy (Vision
20:2020), which is an elaborate economic and
social strategy aimed at making Nigeria one of
the 20 leading economies by 2020. The key
features of the Agenda are highlighted below.
1.

acyclical spending, intergenerational
saving, and funding of infrastructure
projects.
2.


Improving the business climate. Boost
power infrastructure, (via privatization,
public investment, reform of the tariff
regime, and removal of subsidies); invest in
transportation networks (including with
Public-Private Partnerships); and address
other areas flagged by the World Bank
Group’s report on “Doing Business
Indicators” so as to raise Nigeria’s ranking
by 10 places.



Promoting investment in sectors that
foster economic diversification and job
creation. Highlighted sectors include
power; transportation; agriculture
(focusing on R&D, marketing reform, and
promoting value chains); and security
(labor-intensive, although the primary
objective is to provide a safer environment
for both business and citizens).



Improving human development and
accelerating progress towards the
Millennium Development Goals. On
education, the aim is to build a more
competitive labor force by increasing
secondary school enrollment and
completion rates by 10 percent (with
a focus on females). Also, there are
initiatives to improve healthcare and the
targeting and delivery of social safety net
programs (e.g., school feeding, youth
employment, maternal and child services).

Macroeconomic Policy and

Objectives


Inclusive growth. Maintain real GDP
growth in the 7–8 percent range, but with
substantially better results in job growth
(unemployment rate is 24 percent), than
has been achieved thus far.



Fiscal consolidation. Reduce the deficit of
the federal government from 3½ percent
in 2010 to 1½ percent by 2015 and to
maintain domestic debt at 16½ percent of
GDP.



Other key fiscal policy objectives.
(i) Remove the fuel subsidy, which cost
over 4 percent of GDP in 2011; (ii) Increase
capital spending from 25 percent to
32 percent of total spending by 2015,
including by containing the growth of the
public sector wage bill; (iii) Boost non-oil
revenues, including through administrative
reforms, and requiring autonomous
government entities to transfer 25 percent
of their gross revenues to the federal
government; (iv) Establish a Sovereign
Wealth Fund as a vehicle to promote

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Structural reforms

NIGERIA



Tackling Corruption. Early actions in this
area would include strengthening the
Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative; government procurement
reform; publication of detailed fiscal data

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

for all levels of government; and a “name
and shame” program aimed at large tax
delinquents.

Appendix II—The Fuel Subsidy1
Developments in Fuel Subsidy

regulated prices in Nigeria remained almost
constant for the last 6 years. Consequently, the
cost of the subsidy has almost quadrupled
over that period (text table). For 2011, the total
subsidy cost is estimated at about US$9 billion
(4.1 percent of GDP)—larger than the capital
budget—with gasoline accounting for over
75 percent of the total.

1.
In Nigeria, fuel subsidy costs have
been rising. While diesel was deregulated
some years ago, two key fuel products
(gasoline and kerosene) continued to be
subsidized by the government. Despite
substantial increases in the international
market prices of these products, their

2.
Not only is the gasoline subsidy
costly, but it is poorly targeted and has
introduced major distortions. The poor
derive relatively little direct benefit from
Nigeria’s gasoline subsidy, except through
public transportation. The subsidy has
discouraged private investment in domestic
refining capacity, resulting in a drain on
foreign reserves through the importation of
petroleum products. Given rampant rentseeking behavior and smuggling, a significant
portion of Nigeria’s fuel subsidy benefits
accrue to people in neighboring countries.

3.
In this context, on January 1, 2012,
the government eliminated the subsidy on
gasoline. The subsidy on kerosene was not
adjusted. Following the move, the price of a
liter of gasoline has more than doubled, from
N65 (US$0.42) to N141 (US$0.91). Some of the
savings from gasoline subsidy removal was
expected to be used for targeted social safety
net programs and key infrastructure projects
(see details on SURE below). In addition, the
government appointed an independent board
of prominent persons and government officials
to oversee the use of the resources freed up
by the removal of the subsidy.
4.
However, the removal of the fuel
subsidy set off widespread criticism and
protests across the country, led mainly by
labor unions. A widely supported nationwide

NIGERIA

strike started on Monday January 9, with
protesters demanding the full reinstatement of
the gasoline subsidy. One week later, the
government agreed to scale back the price
increase and reinstate a portion of subsidy.
The government’s decision prevented a
disruption of oil production, as oil workers had
planned to join the national strike.
5.
The authorities have publicly
announced that they remain committed to
a full removal of the subsidy but have not
specified any timeline. In the meantime, they
have established a formal process to continue
consultations with stakeholders (including
labor unions) and have begun to address
issues raised by them. In this context, the
authorities are fast-tracking the rehabilitation
of some refineries and are initiating an audit of
the state-owned petroleum company. They
also announced plans to launch an
investigation into possible irregular practices
in the petroleum importing sector; and
prioritize passage of the Petroleum Industry
Bill.
6.
The remaining subsidy will have
significant fiscal costs in 2012. The new
gasoline price is fixed at N97 (US$0.60) per
liter, which is 50 percent higher than the old
regulated price of N65 (US$0.42) but well
below the deregulated price of N140-N145.
According to staff’s preliminary estimate, the
reduced subsidy on gasoline and the
continued subsidy on kerosene will cost close
to US$6 billion (2.2 percent of GDP) in 2012.
The estimate is based on projected slight
decline in oil prices in 2012 and assumes that
increased efforts to tackle corruption
associated with the importation of petroleum
products will generate savings, as will the
impact of the higher regulated price on

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

gasoline consumption (assumed to drop by
10 percent).

The Subsidy Reinvestment and
Empowerment (SURE) Program
7.
The government prepared a detailed
program—SURE—to earmark and use
savings from the subsidy removal for
targeted social safety net programs and
infrastructure projects. In addition, to
address government’s credibility gap, a board
made up of government officials and
representatives from a wide cross-section of
civil society will oversee the calculation of the
subsidy saving amounts, monitor the
allocation of those funds, and evaluate the
execution of the funded projects. The SURE
program has two objectives:


Mitigate the immediate impact of the
removal of the subsidy on the poor, and
lay foundation for successful development
of better-targeted national safety net
program.



Accelerate economic transformation
through investments in critical
infrastructure.

8.
The SURE program includes a variety
of social safety net programs to mitigate
the impact of removal of the subsidy on the
poor segment of population. These include:


Urban Mass Transit – Increase mass transit
availability by facilitating the procurement
of diesel-run vehicles (subsidized loans,
reduced import tariffs, etc.) to established
operators. In the first step of this program,
the government is expected to import and
distribute 1600 buses within months.

Appendix III—Staff Analysis of Reserve Adequacy1
1.
A new methodology for reserve
adequacy assessment for low-income
countries was applied to Nigeria. 2 Although
the results should be interpreted with caution
given the uncertainty in macroeconomic
outlook and fiscal policy, they suggest that the
import coverage of Nigeria’s reserves
projected for 2012–15 in the Staff Report
would be close to the estimated optimal level,
as long as the authorities implement the
planned fiscal consolidation.
2.
The method takes account of both
costs and benefits of holding reserves. In
this framework, the optimal level of reserves is
determined by balancing the crisis prevention
and mitigation benefits of reserves against the
net financial cost of reserves, defined as
foregone investment opportunities measured
by the marginal product of capital. The optimal
level of reserves estimated under this method
is interpreted as the optimal level in the face of
large external shocks, given the country’s
fundamentals (fiscal balance, institutions, and
exchange rate regime).
3.
To apply the model to Nigeria,
shock variables (i.e., proxy for adverse
scenario: terms of trade, external demand,
FDI to GDP ratio), except for the foreign aid
to GDP ratio, were set at the bottom
10 percentile of the Nigeria-specific
distribution over the past ten years
(2001-2010), in order to simulate “worst
case” conditions. Given Nigeria’s low reliance
on foreign aid, the foreign aid shocks were

assumed to be zero. Fundamentals are set
under the baseline as follows: CPIA was set at
their 2009 level (latest available data); fiscal
balance was set at the 2007–10 average; the
exchange rate regime was classified as “not
flexible” given its heavily managed nature. The
values used for the baseline analysis are
summarized in the text table below.
4.

Under these baseline assumptions,

the optimal level of reserves varies from
3.7 months to 7.4 months of next year’s
imports of goods and services, depending
on the unit cost of holding reserves
(see the text table below).
5.
Two alternative scenarios were run:
(i) a strong fiscal consolidation scenario,
where the fiscal balance is set at the
2011-15 average projected in this Staff
Report; and (ii) a weaker fiscal scenario,
where the fiscal deficit is more than twice
as high as in the baseline. Alternative
scenario (i) produces an optimal level of
reserves that is lower than in the baseline;
while the alternative scenario (ii) leads to the
optimal level that is higher than in the
baseline.

6.
In light of the large infrastructure
investment needs in Nigeria, the
opportunity cost of reserve holding could
be relatively high, say 4 to 5 percent. This
suggests that, as long as the fiscal
consolidation takes place as planned, the
projected level of reserves in the Staff Report

(between 4¾ and 6½ months of prospective
imports) would be appropriate.3 However, in
light of heightened uncertainty about
macroeconomic outlook and fiscal policy, this
result should be interpreted with caution.

rate regime in general in the Board Paper SM/11/31.

Appendix IV—Permanent Income Hypothesis the
Permanently Sustainable Non-oil Primary Deficit1
A popular approach to assessing long-term
fiscal sustainability in countries with finite oil
reserves is based on the permanent income
hypothesis (PIH). Under this approach, the
government spends the net oil wealth at a
gradual pace that ensures a constant share for
each generation according to some welfare
criteria – that is, government consumption
smoothing over time in line with expected
permanent income from oil reserves (i.e., net

present value of oil revenue). This in turn can
be translated into a sustainable path for the
non-oil primary deficit (PSNOPD), providing an
upper bound for the permissible government
deficit over the long term that can be financed
out from the use of oil revenue. The PSNOPD
can be used as one benchmark to assess the
sustainability of actual policies and/or to
consider alternative policy scenarios that are
consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability.

In the PIH model, the government chooses an
expenditure policy that maximizes a social
welfare function subject to an intertemporal
government budget constraint. In its simplest
form, the solution yields a constant amount of
government spending, G, which is equal to the
return on the net present discounted value of
all future oil and gas revenue (plus non-oil
revenue)?

Appendix V—Staff Analysis of the Real Exchange Rate1
Introduction
1.
This assessment uses the CGER
methodologies to determine whether the
level of Nigerian real exchange rate is in
line with fundamentals, taking into account
some of the key characteristics of the
Nigerian economy. The three methodologies
provide complementary perspectives on the
exchange rate assessment for Nigeria, but the
results must be treated with caution.
Differences arise due to the difficulty of
properly modeling the underlying
macroeconomic links and the inherent
difficulty of incorporating critical countryspecific information into cross-country
approaches. These differences are most
prominent for low-income countries and for oil
exporters, which complicates the assessment
for Nigeria. Defining a current account norm is

1

complex also because of the relatively poor
BOP data quality. The current assessment is
based on data as of December 2011.
2.
This assessment suggests that there
is no fundamental misalignment of the
exchange rate (see Text Table below). One
method—relating the value of the naira to its
fundamental determinants— suggests that the
naira is in line with equilibrium. Two other
methods give mixed results: the
macroeconomic balance approach suggests an
undervaluation of 10¼ percent, reflecting
projected current account balance that is
stronger than the norm; while the external
sustainability approach, comparing the
projected current account surplus with the
level needed to stabilize net foreign assets,
suggests that the naira is overvalued by
8½ percent.

The Equilibrium REER Approach
3.
Equilibrium real exchange rate
(RER) approach resulted in a marginal
overvaluation (0.7 percent) in 2011. The
equilibrium RER regression results by panel
DOLS estimates for oil exporting countries
presented by Bems and de Carvalho Filho
(2009, IMF WP/09/281) was applied to
Nigeria.2 In calculating the determinants of
the equilibrium REER level (commodity terms
of trade, government consumption to GDP,
net foreign assets to GDP, and relative
productivity differentials), the 2011 estimates
reported in this Staff Report were used for
Nigeria while projections for 2011 from the
September 2011 WEO were used for global
variables and trading partners. As to the level
of real effective exchange rate (REER) in 2011,
the average level of REER during the first nine
months of 2011 was used as a proxy.

The Macroeconomic Balance Approach
4.
Macroeconomic balance approach
suggests in some undervaluation in 2011.
To estimate the current account norm for
Nigeria, panel regression results for oil
exporting countries presented by Bems and
de Carvalho Filho (2009, IMF WP/09/281) was
applied to Nigeria. In calculating determinants
of current account norm (non-oil fiscal
balance, oil balance, relative income, lagged
current account, relative growth, dependency
ratio, and population growth), projections for
2016 underlying this Staff Report were used
for Nigeria while projections for 2016 from
the September 2011 WEO were used for

trading partners.3 The estimated current
account norm for Nigeria is -2.1 percent of
GDP. Nigeria’s projected current account
balance is +0 .4 percent of GDP in 2016. Given
the estimated elasticity of current account
balance in Nigeria, the exchange rate is
estimated to be undervalued by 10.3 percent.
This result should be treated with caution,
however, given uncertainties about the
estimated current account norm.

The External Sustainability Approach
5.
Based on the medium-term
projections for real growth and inflation,
an external current account surplus of
2.4 percent of GDP would stabilize net
foreign assets at the end-2011 level over
the medium term. This is somewhat higher
than staff’s projected medium-term current
account surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP, which
suggests that the currency is overvalued by
8.5 percent. However, determining the
appropriate target level for net foreign assets
in Nigeria is not straightforward. As an oil
producer seeking to preserve oil wealth for
future generation, Nigeria should be seeking
to accumulate financial assets via a higher
current account surplus. On the other hand, as
a low-income country with substantial
investment needs, there is also a case for
using its oil savings for infrastructure
investments.

Appendix VI—Recent Bank Regulatory and Supervision
Reforms1
1.
In response to the banking sector crisis
in Nigeria the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
has undertaken a series of reform measures to
ensure financial sector stability; enhance the
quality of banks; foster a healthy financial
sector evolution; and ensure that the financial
system supports sustainable economic growth.
This appendix discusses some of the key
reforms.
2.
Repeal of universal banking
guidelines. As part of the regulatory reform,
the CBN has repealed earlier universal banking
guidelines, which authorized banks to engage
in noncore banking financial activities and
reintroduced a narrow banking model.2 This
action stems from the conclusion that the
universal banking model had exposed banks to
higher operating risks, increased their
propensity to put depositors' funds into risky
nonbanking business, and consequently
heightened the risk of financial system. Under
the new arrangement, Nigerian banks no
longer are allowed to perform nonbanking
activities and, to the extent that they are
commercial or non-interest banks, have to opt
for either a regional, national, or international
license (each having its own minimum capital
requirements). In essence, this is a return to a
more restrictive set of conforming banking
activities established in the Bank and Other
Financial Institution Act (BOFIA); namely (i)
1
2

CBN regulation, “Regulation on the Scope of Banking
Activities and Ancillary Matters No. 3,” 2010, issued
November 2010.

commercial banking; (ii) merchant banking;
and (iii) specialized banking. Banks are
required to submit to the CBN a plan of
divestiture of nonbanking assets. Once the
plan is agreed by the CBN, banks have until
May 14, 2012 to complete divestitures of
nonbanking activities. The implementation of
the new arrangement will reshape the
structure of the financial sector, as various
banking groups will have to modify their
organizational structures and divest insurance
and/or securities activities that they may
currently perform. It is likely that some banks
will opt for a holding company structure which
will provide new supervisory challenges for the
authorities.
3.
Implementing a risk-based
supervision (RBS) framework.3 The key
objective of the RBS framework is to provide
an effective process to assess the safety and
soundness of banks and other financial
institutions. This is achieved by evaluating their
risk profile, financial condition, risk
management practices and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. The RBS
framework enables a better evaluation of risks
through the separate assessment of inherent
risks and risk management processes. As a
forward-looking dynamic process it places
greater emphasis on the early identification of
emerging risks and system-wide issues. RBS is

applied on a consolidated basis and allows the
supervisor to prioritize efforts and focus on
significant risks by directing efforts to banks
that that have higher risk profiles. Further, the
implementation of the RBS framework
supports the need to comply fully with the
Basel Core Principles on Supervision and to
prepare an enabling environment for the
eventual implementation of the Basel II Capital
Accord.
4.
Strengthening cross-border
supervision. The CBN has taken a series of
steps to make more robust its cross-border
supervision of Nigerian banks, including
setting out a clear framework for banks
engaged in cross-border activities, consistent
with the BOFIA.4 In addition, cross-border
collaboration among regional supervisors the
CBN is to be strengthened through
establishment of memoranda of
understanding with host
regulatory/supervisory agencies as a
prerequisite for the establishment of Nigerian
bank operations within those jurisdictions.
Enhanced information sharing and exchange
of best practices through the West African
College of Supervisors will also foster regional
collaboration among regulatory/supervisory
agencies.
5.
Improving the CBN’s financial
stability oversight and coordination with
other supervisory authorities. The key
features of this pillar center on strengthening
the Financial Stability Committee (FSC) within
the CBN; establishment of a macroprudential
framework; and making the Financial Services
Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC) a
4

Banks”, CBN April 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

more effective tool for the coordination of
regulatory and supervisory activities in the
Nigerian financial sector.
6.
Tackling money laundering and
terrorism financing. Although not directly
related to the banking crisis, the authorities
have taken various reforms to ensure
compliance with Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating of Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation enacted in
2009. The reforms include the development of
an AML/CFT RBS framework to guide bank
examiners in carrying out AML/CFT risk-based
examinations of financial institutions. The
AML/CFT framework is designed to be
compatible with sound industry practices and
to ensure consistency in the application of the
AML/CFT requirements. The authorities believe
that these reforms and a clear demonstration
of AML/CFT effective compliance would allow
Nigeria to be removed from Financial Action
Task Force’s (FATF) shame list when it is next
assessed in 2012.
7.
Successful implementation of these
reforms is critical for a robust and stable
financial sector in Nigeria. Strengthening of
financial sector policies and supervisory
capacity will also benefit the wider African
region, given Nigeria’s leadership as a major
economy in the African region and the
significant outreach of its banks in neighboring
countries.

Appendix VII. Nigeria—Transition to GFSM 20011
1.
The federal government fiscal
operations in Table 3a of the staff report
are broadly consistent with the national
presentation of the budget. The accounting
of government operations in Nigeria is on a
cash basis, covers only the federal government
and is not yet compatible with the GFSM 2001
format. The Nigerian authorities are in the
process of moving to GFSM, but its
implementation been slow. Some initiatives
towards the adoption of GFSM 2001 were
taken. For example, a new chart of accounts
was introduced at the federal government
level that broadly complies with the GFS (with
some exceptions). Yet, fiscal data at the federal
government level are not yet publicly
disseminated following the GFS structure.

2.
The sub-national governments have
not introduced reporting based on
international standards, and the existing
information on the sub-national fiscal
accounts is also limited. This data constraint
makes it impossible to create consolidated
fiscal accounts from readily available data in
the full GFSM 2001 format. Nonetheless, to
promote international comparability of
government operations, fiscal accounts for the
consolidated government in a GFSM 2001
compatible format are presented in this
appendix (Table VII.1).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

February 9, 2012

Approved By

Saul Lizondo and
David Marston (IMF) and
Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)

Prepared by IMF and World Bank staffs in
collaboration with the Nigerian authorities.

Based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA),
Nigeria remains at a low risk of debt distress. In the baseline scenario and in the case of
the standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. For the customized
stress test, which simulates a persistent oil price shock, all indicators deteriorate when
compared to the baseline results, but remain within all of the country-specific thresholds
relevant for Nigeria. The main finding of the DSA, that Nigeria is at a low risk of debt
distress is the same as that for the last DSA, published in February 2011. But the findings
from the stress scenarios also show that, without significant compensating policy
measures, a prolonged negative oil price shock or permanent real GDP growth shock
could undermine the recent progress in achieving macroeconomic and debt
sustainability. Nevertheless, given Nigeria’s strong financial starting position, timely
policy action should be able to avert future sustainability problems. The assumptions
used for this DSA are broadly similar to those used in the previous DSA, although with a
higher oil price projected throughout the baseline forecast period. The analysis is
complicated by the still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, and the
DSA does not incorporate debt of the state and local governments due to data
limitations.

Debt data, sustainability issues, and the new debt limit policy were discussed with the authorities in the
course of the 2011 Article IV consultation. This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on
the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries,

public debt is estimated at total US$6.3 billion, or
2.7 percent of GDP, at end-2011.3 Approximately
$4.8 billion of that total external debt stock is
multilateral debt, of which about 85 percent is
owed to IDA. The breakdown for external debt by

One important limitation of this DSA is
that it only applies to debt contracted at the
consolidated central government level. Data on
state and local governments’ borrowing are
currently not available. While sub-national
borrowing is currently limited and tightly
regulated, there is scope for State Governments
to expand their exposure to domestic creditors.
Public debt data analysis is also complicated by a
multiplicity of off-budget funds. Figures for
Nigeria’s debt stock do not include debts
contracted by public enterprises.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The assumptions in the baseline
scenario for 2011–31 underlying this DSA are
as follows:






4

Average GDP growth of 6½ percent over
the period 2011–31 (somewhat below the
average of 7 percent for 2008–10)
reflecting buoyant annual growth of
non-oil GDP of around 7.2 percent (on the
basis of continued structural reform
efforts) and modest growth of oil and gas
GDP of 1.8 percent.
A recovery in capital inflows, including in
foreign direct investment to the oil sector,
which would be highly sensitive to political
developments and the outcome of the
Petroleum Industry Bill. In line with WEO
projections, the analysis assumes a
Nigerian oil price of US$103.7 per barrel in
2012, moderating to US$88.9 per barrel by
2017, and then increasing ½–1 percent in
nominal terms thereafter.4
A consolidated government non-oil
primary deficit (NOPD) would decline from
34½ percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 to
around 18½ percent of non-oil GDP in
2015. It would continue to decline
gradually thereafter. This is broadly
consistent with the medium-term
projections outlined in the government’s
medium-term fiscal strategy. Such a stance
would also be consistent with preserving
the real value of oil and gas wealth for
future generations based on estimates

The DSA is based on WEO projections for crude
prices as of December, 2011. Nigerian oil price is
projected by using the past relationship between the
Nigerian crude price and average global oil price.

derived from a permanent income
hypothesis exercise. In addition, it is
assumed that the oil-price-based fiscal rule
continues to be applied, with a budget oil
price assumed to be on average around
20 percent below the projected oil price.5


After a strong export growth during
2010-11 driven by a recovery of oil prices,
exports are projected to stagnate during
2012–16 and then grow by 5½ percent a
year afterwards. Imports are projected to
grow strongly during 2012–16, reflecting
buoyant economic growth. The current
account surplus would continue to decline
to about ½ percent of GDP by 2016
because of stagnant oil price and strong
imports, and then hover around zero
thereafter.

4.
At the time of the 2010 DSA, Nigeria’s
external public debt was projected to total
$4.8 billion, or 2.2 percent of GDP, at
end-2010, while domestic public debt was
projected to reach 14.1 percent of GDP at
end-2010. In the event, external debt totaled
2½ percent of GDP, while domestic public debt
was 15½ percent of GDP. The current account
surpluses in 2010–11 were significantly lower than
5

The government is assumed to establish a
medium-and long-term sustainable fiscal position. The
long-term sustainable fiscal position is calculated on
the basis of a constant consumption of oil wealth in
real terms. This implies a decline in the consumption
of oil wealth (the non-oil fiscal deficit) as a percent of
non-oil GDP over time. Oil reserves are sufficient to
sustain oil production at or above current levels
throughout the projection period. The discount in the
budget oil price relative to the actual oil price and
prudent expenditure policy provides for overall
surpluses and an accumulation in financial assets
throughout.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

NIGERIA

forecasted in the 2010 DSA largely due to the
change in methodology to estimate imports. The
fiscal stance in 2010 was substantially weaker
compared with what was envisaged at the time of
the previous DSA, reflected in the depletion of the
Excess Crude Account. However, the fiscal stance
is estimated to have improved moderately in
2011, with an estimated primary surplus in the
year being slightly higher than projected in the
2010 DSA. While overall growth in 2010–11 was
slightly lower than the level projected at the time
of the 2010 DSA, non-oil growth outcomes were
better than the projected levels. Finally, oil prices
are broadly in line with the levels projected for the
2010 DSA.
5.
The assessment makes the assumption
that the Nigerian authorities would not issue
another Eurobond in the near term, but draw

on the infrastructure loan from the Chinese
authorities in the amount of about
US$ 500 million during 2012–13.6 It also
assumes that the China loan would be on
concessional terms.
6.
It is important to note two issues with
the external sector data for Nigeria that
complicate the debt sustainability analysis.
First, there are still large errors and omissions in
the presentation of the balance of payments
statistics, which may reflect an underestimation of
current account debit transactions, and which lead
to the observed large residuals in the DSA
presentation. Second, there is also a break in the
balance of payments series between 2009 and
2010, given the change in 2010 of the
methodology to estimates imports

EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY7
A. Baseline
7.
In the baseline scenario (Table 1 and
Figure 1), the nominal external debt burden is
projected to be broadly unchanged
throughout the projection period. The present
value (PV) of external debt falls consistently
throughout the projection period, while the PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio averages less than 2 percent

over the period. The debt service to exports and
the debt service to revenue ratios also decline
gradually throughout the projection period. All
debt and debt service indicators remain well
below their respective policy-dependent
threshold levels throughout the projection period.

B. Stress Tests and Alternative Scenarios
8.
Standardized stress tests (Table 2 and
Figure 1) were carried out. Under the most
extreme case (i.e., export shock), (i) the PV of the
debt-to-GDP ratio is not likely to exceed
15 percent of GDP throughout the projection
period; and (ii) the PV of debt-to-exports ratio
reaches a peak of around 58 percent, far below its
indicative policy-dependent debt burden

As planned, the authorities issued a US$500 million
Eurobond in early 2011. The loan from China would
be for 20 years with a 2.5 percent interest rate.

threshold of 150 percent.
9.
A country-specific alternative scenario
was also examined. This scenario is designed to
illustrate the impact on the external accounts and
debt dynamics of a prolonged large oil price
shock (oil price is assumed to be 30 percent

below the baseline during 2012–16 and to go
back to the baseline level in 2017). All indicators
worsen considerably relative to the baseline but

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

remain within the policy-dependent thresholds
relevant for Nigeria.

FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Consolidated government gross debt
outstanding is estimated at about 18 percent
of GDP at end-2011, and is projected to
decline to about 3½ percent of GDP by 2031.
The current maturity structure of domestic debt is
favorable, with the short-term debt accounting for
only a quarter of total debt. Under the baseline
scenario (Table 3 and Figure 2), consolidated
government debt to GDP ratio would steadily
increase slightly from 18 percent in 2011 to about
19¾ percent in 2014, because the projected level
of accumulated fiscal surpluses during the period
would fall short of the accumulation of external
assets in the sovereign wealth fund (SWF). After
2015, the public debt to GDP ratio would
gradually decline and come down to single digits
by 2023. This is largely due to the continued

efforts of fiscal consolidation at the general
government level and sustained growth assumed
under the baseline scenario.
11.
The standardized stress tests
underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust
to the economic environment. In particular,
present value of public debt to GDP ratio would
creep up to 25 percent throughout the projection
period under a permanently lower real GDP
growth scenario.8 With oil prices stabilizing over
the medium term, public debt dynamics would
become more susceptible to negative economic
growth shocks. In such an adverse scenario, fiscal
policy will need to adjust by about 1 percent of
GDP each year to bring the public debt stock path
to the same path under the baseline. (Table 4 and
Figure 2).

CONCLUSION
12.
Nigeria is at low risk of external debt
distress. In the baseline scenario and in the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook
remains robust throughout the projection period.
However, the findings from the stress scenarios
also show that, without significant compensating
policy measures, a prolonged oil price shock or
deterioration in the growth could undermine the
recent progress made in achieving
macroeconomic and public debt sustainability.
_____________________________
Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.5 (medium performer), which
is the three year average of the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant
country-specific thresholds are a PV of external debt to
GDP of 40 percent, a PV of external debt to exports of
150 percent, and an external debt service to exports
ratio of 20 percent.

Nonetheless, given Nigeria’s strong financial
starting position, timely policy action should be
able to avert future sustainability problems.
Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities were in agreement
with the staff’s main conclusions. The staff’s
finding of low external debt risk was consistent
with their views. In addition, they agreed that
timely policy adjustments would need to be made
in the event of a prolonged negative oil price
shock.
_______________________________
8

Under the alternative scenario in the Staff Report,
which assumes that some key fiscal reforms are not
implemented during 2012–15, the public debt to GDP
ratio would rise to about 24 percent of 2015.

1/ Includes public and publicly guaranteed external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to
maintain an exchange rate fundamentally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility
and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. In recent years it has maintained an
exchange rate band vis-à-vis the US dollar and has recently allowed adjustment of the band’s
mid-point in response to market forces. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is also other
managed arrangement. In spite of some stability of the Naira-US dollar exchange rate, the nominal

2

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

effective exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in recent years. The CBN publishes information
on its interventions through auctions on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank
market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that
the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% around the
central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime.
XI.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was subject to a
full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that expired on
October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed on
November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial
reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

NIGERIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of December 31, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data
deficiencies—in particular inadequate information on subnational public finances, and large
errors and omissions in the balance of payments—continue to hamper policy design and
monitoring. The Statistics Act passed in 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics
as the main coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements,
including better information sharing between data producing and collecting agencies.
Nevertheless, a number of problems continue to prevent the compilation of timely and internally
consistent data, in particular, lack of good source data and insufficient computerization.
National accounts: Statistical methods used to derive production-based GDP have been
improved through the development of more comprehensive estimates for a number of individual
industries, although a number of statistical challenges remain. As reported in IMF Country Report
No. 8/64, revisions to the national accounts published in late-2007 led to some apparent
discontinuities in the series for non-oil GDP, and in particular agricultural output in 2002 and
2004, which complicates analysis of historical economic activity. Work is ongoing to conduct a
new agricultural census, which should lead to improvements in the measurement of agricultural
production—a key sector accounting for over half non-oil GDP—which is currently estimated on
the basis of outdated survey information. The reliance on the consumer price index to construct
the constant price GDP series leads to weaknesses. The introduction of additional indices, such as
a producer price index, would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price measure.
The base year for the national accounts (1990) is in urgent need of updating given the significant
chances to the structure of the economy since then, and the authorities have recently requested
Fund Technical Assistance in this regard. The compilation of GDP using the expenditure approach
would facilitate analysis of savings-investment balances.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural
price data, is available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to November
2009=100, using the 2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97
survey-based expenditure weights.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are opaque and complicated not only by the federal
structure but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds. The most pressing shortcomings are
related to inadequate data coverage, particularly of the subnational governments which
comprise almost one-half of total government expenditure. The federal government has limited
information on the subnational fiscal accounts which makes it difficult for it to play a stabilizing
role by targeting a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this issue have been stymied by
constitutional restrictions. To facilitate the timely preparation of a consolidated set of fiscal
accounts, governments at all levels need to use consistent budget classification, chart of
accounts, and accounting systems. There is also a need to formalize the publication of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

NIGERIA

government accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis and to report on the operations of
parastatals.
Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation
of monetary statistics. Earlier problems with the CBN accounting framework and IT issues, which
had contributed to significant distortions in reported monetary data, have now been resolved.
There is a need for a clearer measure of commercial banks’ foreign assets and liabilities that
captures both their on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The definition of the other depository
corporations (ODCs) sector should also be extended beyond commercial banks to include all
deposit-taking nonbank financial institutions, such as microfinance banks and primary mortgage
institutions.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including
both core and a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN. The
CBN is currently working to methodologically strengthen the estimation of FSIs and is also more
closely supervising banks to ensure accurate disclosure practices.
Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of
Nigeria’s balance of payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the
authorities have expanded the range and improved the quality of data sources used to compile
the balance of payments statistics.
There are however still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which complicate
the assessment of external sustainability. It will be important, therefore, to further strengthen the
measurement of the balance of payments and the international investment position. There is a
need for improved validation of transactions reported by banks, measurement of transactions
outside the banking system and the possible under invoicing of imports, and verification of
estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the banking sector (which are difficult to
reconcile with other sources, such as data from Bank of International Settlements reporting
banks).
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the
Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The
Debt Management Office (DMO) should work to extend the coverage of their database to
include private sector liabilities and foreign investment in domestically issued debt securities.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria
On February 22, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2011 Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Economic growth remains strong in Nigeria, with non-oil real gross domestic product (GDP)
estimated to have grown at 8.3 percent in 2011 and overall real GDP at about 6.7 percent.
Inflation slightly declined to 10.3 percent in December 2011 (year-on-year) from 11.7 percent a
year earlier, in response to monetary tightening by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and
moderation of food prices.
A modest fiscal consolidation took place in 2011. The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) of the
consolidated government is estimated to have narrowed slightly from about 34.6 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2010 to 32.9 percent in 2011, mainly due to expenditure restraint at the federal
government level. Higher oil prices helped shrink the overall fiscal deficit from 7.7 percent of
GDP in 2010 to about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Monetary policy was tightened substantially
in 2011 in response to high inflation and strong foreign exchange demand. The central bank has
gradually increased its overnight deposit rate by 900 basis points since September 2010 and
tightened regulatory requirements. In November, it adjusted downward its soft band around the
naira-US dollar exchange rate, and depreciation pressures on the naira have since abated.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
Financial soundness indicators point to continued improvements in the health of the banking
system.
Growth is projected to remain robust in 2012 and inflation is projected to increase temporarily as
a result of the increase in gasoline prices. The main downside risks to the short-term outlook
are a further deterioration in the global environment and an exacerbation of current violence in
northern Nigeria.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for countercyclical policies that have supported
economic activity in challenging circumstances. Directors considered that the medium-term
growth outlook remains favorable, although subject to external downside risks. Accordingly,
they emphasized the continued need for policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability, diversify
the economy, and make growth more inclusive.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy to rebuild fiscal buffers through a better
prioritization of public expenditure, continued subsidy reform, and improved tax administration.
Efforts in these areas will also provide the necessary resources for targeted social programs
and needed infrastructure. Directors endorsed the use of conservative oil price assumptions in
the preparation of the budget but noted that only a comprehensive tax reform will reduce the
budget’s dependence on oil revenues over the medium term.
Directors highlighted the importance of improving public financial management, including a
stronger framework for managing Nigeria’s oil wealth. They welcomed the establishment of a
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) and underscored that a rules-based approach to setting the
budget reference oil price would strengthen the budgetary process and the operations of the
SWF. In this regard, Directors recommended that outlays from the SWF’s infrastructure fund be
integrated into the budget and medium-term expenditure plans.
Directors noted the monetary authorities’ commitment to further reduce inflation but considered
that a pause in the tightening cycle is at present warranted. More broadly, they agreed that a
monetary framework better focused on a clear inflation objective should help anchor inflation
expectations and support disinflation. Greater exchange rate flexibility will also facilitate the
pursuit of price stability.
Directors commended the authorities for their actions to resolve the recent banking crisis. The
modalities of operation of the asset management corporation should continue to make sure that
fiscal risks and moral hazard are minimized. Directors supported the central bank’s focus on
strengthening supervision and the regulatory framework, including by addressing remaining
deficiencies in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime. They
also agreed that a Financial Sector Assessment Program update will help take stock of the
progress so far and provide a road map for remaining reforms in the financial sector.

3
Directors concurred that wide-ranging reforms are needed to make growth more inclusive. They
welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to improve the business climate and reform sectors with
high employment potential, particularly agriculture. Directors encouraged the authorities to
persevere with planned reforms in the energy sector under appropriate social safeguards.

Statement by Mr. Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Nigeria
February 22, 2012
On behalf of my Nigerian authorities, I would like to thank the mission team for the focused,
open, frank, and constructive discussions on macroeconomic development and policy issues
in Nigeria. The team visited Nigeria at the time the country was finalizing her policies and
programs geared towards transforming the economy and their inputs were quite valuable.
The visit of the Managing Director, Ms Largarde shortly after the mission further enhanced
policy dialogue between the authorities and the Fund. My authorities are in broad agreement
with the analysis and policy thrust in the staff papers.
Economic Conditions in 2011
The economy continued its growth momentum in the fourth quarter of 2011 driven mainly by
non-oil production activities including agriculture and services sectors. Besides the extrabudgetary spending on petroleum products subsidy, fiscal activities remained largely on track
with modest consolidation achieved and the deficit within target. Public debt level remained
low and sustainable while monetary policy was generally tight. Consequently, inflationary
pressures eased with headline inflation closing at 10.3 per cent in December, 2011. Lending
and money market real interest rates turned positive in response to upward adjustments in
policy rate and lower inflation.
Financial stability was restored following the resolution of the banking crisis through the
purchase of non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks by the Asset Management Company of
Nigeria (AMCON), mergers and acquisition of the ailing banks as well as recapitalization of
some banks. Credit to the economy including to the private sector increased while growth in
aggregate money supply hovered around the indicative growth benchmark of 13.75 percent.
External sector performed well due largely to improved domestic oil production and
favorable international oil prices. In spite of these, accretion to external reserves was minimal
due to high demand for foreign exchange and the need to stabilize the exchange rate.
However, reserves remained adequate to cover at least four months of imports of goods and
services.
Outlook for 2012 and beyond
Developments in the advanced economies, particularly the demand for crude oil, crude oil
prices as well as international food and commodity prices are key to Nigeria’s medium-term
economic performance. Political instability arising from various social tensions could also
pose some threats. Despite the downside risks associated with these developments, the
medium-term economic outlook is quite positive on account of expected increase in domestic
oil production, fairly high international oil prices, and improved performance of the non-oil
sector. The authorities’ economic diversification strategy which focuses on agriculture,
entertainment industry, non-oil minerals, and real estate (growth drivers), and infrastructure,
power, roads, ports, education, and health (enablers), will drive and sustain robust GDP

1

growth going forward. The initial uptick in inflation due to partial removal of subsidy on
petroleum products and the expected hike in electricity tariff would eventually moderate.
Policies going forward
The overall policy objective is to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment through a
strong and prudent fiscal policy anchored on an oil-price-based fiscal rule, manageable
deficits, sustainable debt-GDP ratio of no more than 30%, and a proactive monetary policy.
These measures would constrain inflation to single digit, engender a stable and competitive
exchange rate, build foreign reserves, and promote inclusive growth.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities have expressed strong commitment to fiscal consolidation that began in 2011.
The objective is to increase non-oil revenue, reduce recurrent expenditure, increase the
effectiveness of capital expenditure, and build fiscal buffers. This rebalancing of the
distribution of government spending also includes reduction in overhead expenditure and
government borrowing, and limiting fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in line with the
Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).
Steps have been initiated to increase revenues by blocking leakages from various sources,
improving corporate tax collection, and boosting internally generated revenue. Reducing
recurrent expenditure to sustainable level through elimination of waste, inefficiency,
corruption and duplication is receiving attention. Additionally, capital expenditures are being
prioritized to ensure appropriate funding and completion of the large portfolio of on-going
projects while also taking on flagship projects already identified in the Transformation
Agenda.
A key policy stance of the government is the removal of the remaining subsidy on petroleum
products and eventual deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry. The saving
from the subsidy removal is expected to be invested in viable capital projects and provision
of safety nets for the poor and vulnerable groups as stated in the Subsidy Reinvestment and
Empowerment (SURE) program.
Monetary Policy
Price stability remains a major challenge to monetary authorities, particularly in an import
dependent economy with low non-oil exports, high government spending, and huge demand
for foreign exchange. In spite of this, the monetary authorities continue to focus on
maintaining price and exchange rate stability. While no specific rate of inflation is targeted,
there is a common understanding that a single digit rate is appropriate for the economy. On
exchange rate, the authorities have demonstrated strong preference for stability with
necessary adjustments to align to economic fundamentals.
Financial Stability
The monetary authorities are also focusing on the health of the financial sector. Owing to
various policy actions taken, the banking sector is now more stable and healthier than in the
pre-crisis period with non-performing loans (NPL) reduced significantly while system-wide
2

capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is at a comfortable level. The risk to the financial system of the
Euro crisis so far is minimal. Recapitalization of the remaining banks would be completed
while all mergers/acquisition arrangements will be fully consummated.
Both risk-based and cross border supervision have been instituted with reasonable micro-and
macro- prudential policies. Going forward, the authorities intend to continue to pay attention
to supervision, prudential issues, sectoral exposure of banks, transparency and disclosure, as
well as strengthening of the legal and institutional frameworks for financial sector regulation
and crisis resolution, particularly the Financial Stability Committee within the central bank,
Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC), and AMCON. More
agreements with regulatory/supervisory agencies in countries with Nigerian banks will be
signed for effective cross-border supervision.
An important element of the financial sector reforms is the abolition of the universal banking
system and the categorization of banking operations into commercial, merchant and
specialized banks with the latter including non-interest banks (islamic banking),
microfinance banks, development banks and mortgage banks. The commercial banks are
authorized to carry on banking business on a regional, national or international basis while
the non-interest banks will carry on banking business on regional or national basis. Already
two banks – JAIZ bank and Stanbic bank – have been licensed to operate the non-interest
bank window. The new banking model which is expected to take effect this year is not
designed to restrict banking activities. Rather it is intended to reposition the banking sector
for effective contribution to the Nigerian economy. The possible supervisory challenges will
be promptly addressed.
Structural reforms
At the center of the economic transformation agenda are structural reforms. The major
programs either undertaken or proposed include the following:
Liberalization and privatization of the power sector based on the Power Sector
Roadmap. The state power company – Power Holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN - has
been unbundled into eleven distribution companies, six generation companies and a
transmission company. The distribution and generating companies are earmarked for
privatization. Upward adjustment in electricity tariff is also expected to take effect shortly.
Ports and customs reforms to reduce the cost of doing business and shorten the time for
goods clearance. The overall goal is to ensure 48 hours cargo clearance. Already the number
of agencies at the port has been reduced from 14 to 6, and the 24 hours operation at the ports
has commenced.
Speedy passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). A special task force and a technical
sub-committee on PIB are already in place to interface with the parliament in this regard. The
passage of the bill will pave the way for full deregulation of the oil sector and is expected to
increase private investment.

3

Improving governance and building institutions. The major actions include promotion of
transparency and accountability in the management of public funds, implementation of the
Freedom of Information Act, fight against corruption through strengthening of anticorruption agencies (the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, ICPC, and the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC), and reform of the public service for
optimal service delivery.
Investing in priority areas for job creation and inclusive growth. This cuts across security
including more support for the police, defense and counterterrorism operations; critical
infrastructure including power, roads and railways; and human capital development
particularly health care and education. Government will continue with its multifaceted
National Job Creation Scheme including the Youth Enterprise With Innovation in Nigeria
(YouWin) and Public Works and Women/Youth Employment (PW/WYE) programs.
Of particular interest is agriculture which is undergoing transformation from traditional
farming to modern commercial agriculture for both small and large scale farmers. The
objectives are to ensure food security and promote exports of commodities such as rice,
cassava, sorghum, oil palm, cocoa, and cotton where there is comparative advantage.
Already a risk sharing arrangement where the government guarantees 70% of bank loans to
the private sector for agricultural activities is in place. Other measures include, development
of private sector-driven marketing institutions, substitution of high quality cassava flour for
wheat flour in bread baking, and zero import duty on machinery and specified equipment for
agricultural activities effective January 31st 2012.
Conclusion
In the past year, my Nigerian authorities have shown tremendous commitment towards
developing the Nigerian economy and ensuring macroeconomic stability. The economic
transformation agenda has been put in place and an Economic Management Team (EMT)
chaired by the President, and an Economic Management Implementation Team (EMIT) have
been established to drive the process. The authorities are confident that the policies
implemented so far and those proposed are generally in the right direction. This has resulted
in the recent upgrade of Nigeria by Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s. No doubt the
challenges are enormous but the authorities would persevere. The Fund’s role in the
transformation process especially through policy advice is highly appreciated by my
authorities.
