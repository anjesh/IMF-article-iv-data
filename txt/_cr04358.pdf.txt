September 29, 2004
•

A staff team comprising Messrs. Haas (Head), Lutz, and Stavrev (all EUR) visited Tallinn
during June 7–18, 2004.

•

The mission met the Governor of the Bank of Estonia, the Ministers of Finance, of Economy,
of Social Affairs, and members of their staffs, as well as representatives of trade unions, and
the private financial sector. Mr. Ross, Senior Advisor, Nordic-Baltic Executive Director’s
Office, participated in the concluding discussions. On the way back from Tallinn, Mr. Haas
met in Brussels with EC officials to discuss ERM°II entry issues.

•

Estonia acceded to the European Union on May 1, 2004, and entered into the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM II) on June 27, 2004, while unilaterally maintaining its currency board
which fixes the Estonian kroon to the euro.

•

The authorities published the Concluding Statement of the mission and intend to publish this
staff report.

•

The right of center coalition government (Res Publica, the Reform Party, and the People’s
Union) has been in power since April 2003. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled
for 2007.

•

Estonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Sections 2, 3, and 4), and maintains no
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for those
imposed in compliance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the measures
adopted by the EU within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. All
such restrictions have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision 144-(52/51).

•

Estonia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data provision is timely and
facilitates effective surveillance (Appendix I).

•

In concluding the 2003 Article IV consultation on October 22, Directors commended the
authorities for their commitment to a prudent fiscal policy. However, in light of the large
current account deficit and Estonia’s currency board, most Directors were of the view that a
more proactive fiscal policy would be required to maintain macroeconomic stability. Directors
also noted that the country’s currency board had served the country well and noted that
confidence in it continued to be strong.

-3I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Estonia’s economic performance has been among the best of the new EU countries
over the last decade; it acceded to the EU on May 1, 2004 and joined ERM°II at the end of
June. The country has achieved considerable nominal convergence, with all indicators at levels
better than the average of the other new EU members (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, Estonia has
been among the fastest growing of the accession countries. This has resulted in remarkable
progress toward real convergence—per capita GDP has almost doubled since 1993, reaching
around 45 percent of the EU average in 2003 in PPP terms. However, the external current
account deficit has deteriorated appreciably and remains a cause of concern.

2.
The macroeconomic and financial sector policies pursued by successive
governments since independence have been broadly in line with those proposed by the
Fund (Box 1). The authorities regard Estonia’s cooperation with the Fund as having been
helpful in keeping the course of economic reforms steady despite nine governments in the
first 10 years of independence, contributing to Estonia’s successful transition.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Economic activity has been gathering strength with the improvement in the
external environment. Real GDP growth accelerated to 6.8 percent (year-on-year in
2004Q1) from 5.8 percent in 2003Q1, driven by domestic demand and supported by
technology sector exports, which have benefited from the recovery in demand in Estonia’s
major trading partners. The negative contribution to growth of net exports has thus declined.

and, importantly, technical
assistance. At the time of independence, the Estonians were keen to have a market based
economy as rapidly as possible and acquired technical assistance to this end, from the
Fund and other sources. During this period, SDR62.7 million were drawn under Fundsupported programs.

The second phase started in 1994 and extended until the Russia crisis in mid-1998 and
can be characterized as a period of recovery and growth. During this period the Fund
continued to provide considerable technical assistance and policy advice, advice which
was generally pursued. All of the financing was solely of a precautionary nature. The third
phase focused on dealing with the fall-out of the 1998 Russian crisis and continued
through 1999. Again, the principal contribution of the Fund was in providing policy
advice and technical assistance; no drawings were made. The final phase can be
characterized as recovery and the run-up to EU accession. During this period the Fund
continued with policy advice and some technical assistance, but no financial arrangement.
By the end of the period, Estonia was a surveillance country and a member of the EU.
Since the last consultation, the authorities have successfully managed the transition to
ERM II entry. Directors’ call for a more proactive fiscal policy to maintain
macroeconomic stability was heeded in 2003, with an appreciable fiscal tightening, which
is however set to be reversed in 2004.
In sum, Estonia’s relation with the Fund has been characterized by a high degree of
ownership of the implemented policies and has resulted in a successful transformation to
a market economy. While there were differences (as in the Fund’s initial advice against
the setting up of a currency board), these were rapidly overcome and the cooperation
focused on advancing reforms further. Finally, extensive use was made of technical
assistance in all its forms.

Baltics: A decade of Cooperation,” by Adalbert Knoebl and Richard Haas, IMF WP/03/241.

4.
Inflation accelerated in the first half of 2004, but is expected to remain within
the Maastricht criterion. Although rising fuel and sugar prices—reflecting EU tax
harmonization—led to a spurt in year-on-year inflation to 4.5 percent in June 2004 (from
1.1 percent in December 2003), no lasting rise in inflationary pressures is foreseen—and
indeed the 12-month rate receded to 3.9 percent in August. Economy-wide real wages
increased substantially as a result of lower-than-anticipated inflation in 2003, but productivity
gains dampened the effect on real unit labor costs, which increased only modestly.
5.
However, the external current account deficit deteriorated further and remains
a cause of concern. The current account

2003 (Figure 3). Part of the deterioration

6.
Fiscal policy tightened in 2003.
The general government surplus more than
doubled to 2.4 percent of GDP, with actual
revenues exceeding forecast levels,
reflecting, in part, stronger-than-expected
domestic demand and employment growth.
However, most of the fiscal tightening
occurred as a result of postponed personnel
and administrative expenditures of about
2 billion EEK (1.5 percent of GDP) and will
be reversed in 2004.

Domestic credit growth remained buoyant, financed increasingly by bank
borrowing abroad, mainly from foreign parent banks. Bank credit to households soared
by around 50 percent at the end of 2004H1 over 2003H1, albeit from low levels (12.1 percent
of GDP, and only 35 percent of household disposable income at the end of 2003, low by
international standards), as households borrowed to acquire real estate. Nevertheless, real

estate prices rose only modestly in 2003 and remained stable in the first half of 2004. Credit
growth to enterprises also accelerated to close to 30 percent (Figure 4). With a slowing in the
growth of deposits, banks increasingly financed their lending from external sources, and the
banking system’s net foreign asset position turned negative in late 2003. While the banks
have limited foreign exchange exposure, the foreign exchange positions of households and
enterprises are high—around 65 percent of household loans and 78 percent of enterprise
credits are in foreign exchange, 95 percent of which in euros.
8.
The largely foreign-owned banking system remains financially sound. The risk
weighted capital-adequacy ratio was around 15 percent in 2003 and the percentage of
nonperforming loans declined further to 0.4 percent of the total—the lowest among transition
countries—and the share of overdue loans in the export-oriented and real estate sectors was
reduced in 2003. Although bank competition and declining interest rates squeezed margins
and interest income declined, bank profits remained strong, with income from services fees
growing briskly and Estonian banks expanding in neighboring markets.

Despite increased external vulnerabilities, confidence in the currency board
arrangement remains strong. Indeed, in line with Estonia’s early ERM°II participation, no
currency risk is currently priced in domestic assets, with Standard & Poors’ (S&P) sovereign
foreign and domestic currency ratings being equal. Estonia’s credit rating was upgraded in
July 2004 by Fitch to A from A- following upgrades by both Moody’s and S&P in 2002;
Estonia’s Eurobond spread over German bunds declined further to less than 5 basis points at
the end of second quarter of 2004. Reserve coverage of base money has remained stable.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions focused on the policy priorities required for successful
performance in ERM°II and the subsequent smooth adoption of the euro. In particular,
the discussions centered on: (i) the near to medium-term outlook and associated risks, with
particular focus on external vulnerabilities; (ii) the viability of the ERM°II central parity rate
and monetary and financial policies in the run-up to euro adoption; (iii) the appropriate fiscal
stance during ERM°II participation.
11.
The authorities reiterated their intention to participate in ERM°II at the current
euro rate as soon as possible while unilaterally maintaining the currency board. The
Bank of Estonia (BoE) argued that, given the well-established credibility of the currency
board over the last 12 years, this would eliminate the need for a double-regime switch and
facilitate the smooth adoption of the euro. At the same time, BoE emphasized the importance
of fiscal policy in the context of the currency board in restraining domestic demand, curbing
inflationary pressures, and reducing external vulnerabilities. Staff concurred and added that
the credibility and consistency of macroeconomic and structural policies would be crucial in
keeping the Estonian economy competitive. It also noted the government’s important
signaling effect on the economy in determining public sector wage increases and the
consequent need for moderation.
A. Near and Medium-Term Outlook
12.
There was a
consensus that the
macroeconomic outlook for
2004 and over the mediumterm remains favorable. In
their 2004 convergence
program, the authorities
project real GDP growth of
close to 6 percent over the
medium term and a current
account deficit which declines
gradually from 13 percent of
GDP in 2004 to 8.7 percent in

2008, both slightly higher then staff projections. The staff projects real GDP to grow by
5¾ percent in 2004, dropping to 5 percent in 2008, driven by both strong domestic and
external demand. Staff projects the current account deficit to decline to around 6 percent of
GDP from a forecast of 11.2 percent in 2004, as “one-off” investment projects are completed
and as private savings, supported by growing participation of the second and third pillars of
the pension system, increase. Both the authorities and the staff forecast average inflation to
rise to about 3 percent in 2004, from 1.3 percent in 2003, as a result of EU tax harmonization
and an increase in administered prices. However both staff and official forecasts are not
without risks. In particular, on the domestic side, private savings might not rebound as
expected, with repercussions on the external account; on the external front, further oil price
increases and weaker export markets are key downside risks.
13.
In view of these downside risks and of Estonia’s relatively high gross external
debt, staff presented two scenarios for the path of gross external debt ratio over the
medium-term—a baseline scenario and a worse-case scenario.1, 2 In the baseline scenario,
gross external debt, almost all of which is private, was 70.5 percent of GDP in 2003 and is
projected to decline to 65 percent of GDP in 2009. For most of the standard shocks under the
Fund’s external sustainability exercise, external debt stabilizes at below 80 percent of GDP in
2009 (Table 8). In the worse-case scenario, which could occur if FDI coverage of the current
account is substantially less than the 50 percent assumed in the baseline, gross external debt
increases from 70.5 percent in 2003 to around 80 percent of GDP in 2009; the application of
the standard interest rate shock results in a faster accumulation of gross external debt,
reaching nearly 90 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 8a). However, the authorities responded
that, due to transition, the ten-year average historical shocks used in these scenarios overstate
the magnitude of possible shocks in the future and the likelihood of shocks of this magnitude
was consequently seen to be small.
14.
Against this background, staff highlighted the external vulnerability risks posed
by continuing high current account deficits. While previous studies3 have found that a
significant part of the variation in the current account deficits in the Baltic countries is
explained by productivity-improving investments and consumption-smoothing, staff
emphasized that the present level of the current account deficit is not sustainable in the longterm.

1

Public sector debt does not pose any sustainability risks due to its very low level of about
4 percent of GDP. Therefore, staff discussed only external sustainability issues.
2

It should be noted that Estonia’s net external debt was only 22.8 percent of GDP in 2003,
and has increased by less than gross debt in recent years, because the economy’s gross
foreign assets have risen, reflecting increased economic and financial integration.

3

See IMF Country Report 03/331 and ECB Working Paper No. 311, February 2004.

- 13 -

15.
The authorities recognized the risks of increased external vulnerability, but
pointed out several offsetting factors. They noted that the level of the primary current
account deficit, excluding interest payments and reinvested earnings (the latter of which are
self-financing) was in line with estimated equilibrium levels of the current account deficit
over the medium-term. Moreover, they pointed out that, on average, 70 percent of the current
account deficit was financed by FDI4 during 1996–2003, with the bulk of FDI going to
manufacturing and financial sectors, while net external debt increased only modestly and
remains relatively low. In addition, the authorities noted that investment had grown strongly
and had resulted in substantial productivity improvements, placing Estonia among the fastest
growing new EU members. The strong productivity growth has also supported exports and
resulted in a substantial increase of Estonia’s export share in its main trading partners
(Box 2).
B. Viability of the Current ERM°II Central Parity
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that the current ERM°II central parity rate is
viable in the run-up to the euro adoption. Estonia joined ERM°II at the end of June 2004
with a commitment to unilaterally maintain the currency board. In light of the high degree of
nominal convergence, the track record of a successful currency board over the last 12 years,
and current views and expectations of Estonia’s competitiveness, staff supported this
decision. Although there is, unavoidably, some uncertainty around estimates of the
equilibrium real effective exchange rate, staff agreed with the authorities that the present
level of the EEK/euro peg falls within the estimated range of the equilibrium rate and no
major competitiveness pressures are evident. Staff stressed, however, that external
competitiveness would be maintained only if wage increases reflected improvements in
productivity over the medium term.
17.
However, continuing high current account deficits and credit growth, combined
with low domestic saving, suggest a nascent overheating and pose potential risks for
Estonia in the period ahead. These risks could translate into the potential cost of having to
adjust in the future to entry in ERM II at an overvalued real effective exchange rate. The
authorities noted, however, that the labor market in Estonia is quite flexible and, therefore,
output losses would be expected to be both temporary and small. While staff agreed that
Estonian labor market is flexible and noted that recent studies5 of international institutions
(the OECD, EC and ECB) also supported this view, it emphasized that labor market
4

This topic is dealt with in more detail in the Selected Issues Paper, “Estonia’s External Debt
and Domestic Balance Sheet Developments.”
5

The studies characterized the Estonian labor market as flexible, noting the predominance of
enterprise-level bargaining, the low rate of unionization, a low minimum relative to the
average wage, a modest unemployment compensation replacement rate, and a high degree of
wage flexibility.

Box 2. Indicators of Competitiveness and Equilibrium Exchange Rate
Estonia’s external competitiveness remains relatively strong. Both PPI-based and CPI-based
real effective exchange rates have appreciated by around 2 percent annually since 2000,
consistent with a Balassa-Samuelson effect of the same magnitude. In addition, unit labor costs
in manufacturing relative to Estonia’s trading partners have remained broadly unchanged over
the last three years, as wage increases were matched by strong productivity growth. Market
shares of Estonian exports in both world and EU imports increased significantly over the last
decade with a recent pause related to the mobile telephones market. Thus, despite the large
current account deficit, there is no clear evidence of a competitiveness problem.

flexibility needed to be maintained in the future to avoid the disruptive effects on the
economy of negative exogenous shocks.6
C. ERM°II Membership and Supporting Monetary and Financial Policies
18.
The discussions focused on the main policies needed for supporting smooth
ERM°II participation and the consequent adoption of the euro. In addition to prudent
fiscal policies, the discussions centered around high credit growth to households and the
available policy responses, banking supervision, and the activities of Kredex—a quasigovernment loan guarantee agency.
19.
The authorities emphasized that levels of bank credit in Estonia are not excessive
when compared to the other new EU members. The BoE had recently undertaken a
comparative study of credit developments in the new EU members and the results suggested
that Estonia’s domestic credit level is below the average for the sample, although the growth
rate is among the highest. Staff stressed that although rapid credit growth has been
experienced in other transition and peripheral euro area members, and is an expected feature
of real convergence, it posed potential risks to macroeconomic and financial stability and
needed to be monitored carefully. The authorities agreed and pointed out that they had
recently reduced borrowing incentives by limiting mortgage interest deductibility. In addition,
they also noted that the BoE and the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) had repeatedly
drawn Estonian banks’ attention to the need for conservative lending practices.
20.
Nevertheless, the authorities were aware of the risks that fast credit growth
poses to macroeconomic stability and had considered, but rejected, several options to
moderate credit growth, aside from continuing moral suasion. The FSA also noted that
many banks followed credit scoring and internal risk management strategies consistent with
prudential regulations applied at the parent foreign banks. The authorities found staff’s
suggestion to introduce statistical provisioning7 appealing, but they pointed out that, because
Estonia has not yet experienced a full economic cycle, it would be difficult to estimate the
amount of provisioning. In responding to staff’s proposal to tighten prudential controls, the
BoE noted that, while it would continue to monitor credit growth closely, it was reluctant to
use prudential requirements to restrict it. The authorities also emphasized that tightening of
prudential regulations should be applied carefully, because this might create incentives for
changing the structure of the Estonian banking system from subsidiaries to branches, as
capital adequacy requirements do not apply to branches.

On the importance of labor and product market flexibility for reducing Estonia’s
vulnerability to adverse external shocks, see the Selected Issues Paper, “Estonia: Labor and
Product Market Flexibility and Productivity Catch-up in the Run-up to the Euro Adoption.”

7

Statistical provisioning accounts for the phase of the economic cycle in calculating loan loss
provisions and reduces their procyclical behavior.

- 16 -

21.
As a measure to reduce credit growth, the authorities planned to further reduce
mortgage interest deductibility. The government intends to decrease total deductions from
taxable income to 50 thousand EEK starting in January 2005. The BoE was also aware of the
impact of Kredex on mortgage loan growth, given its large share (around 20 percent of all
mortgages). While recognizing the benefits of a slower pace of growth of its activities, it
noted the sensitive social and political implications of limiting Kredex activities. Staff
supported the reduction of mortgage interest deductibility and recommended that the
authorities carefully assess the macroeconomic implications of Kredex operations. In
particular, staff suggested that they take into account the impact on credit growth and
macroeconomic imbalances when considering future increases in either the overall or
individual limits on guarantees issued.
22.
The authorities described the results of stress tests, in particular, of bank
vulnerability to interest rate shocks. They pointed out that banks perform interest rate
stress tests on a quarterly basis, using the methodology of the parent banks. At the same time,
to ensure compliance with Estonia’s supervisory regulations, the FSA also gathers data and
replicates the interest rate stress tests. The authorities also explained that the banks had been
instructed to educate borrowers about the implications of rising future interest rates for
servicing variable rate mortgages. FSA noted that due to the high credibility of the currency
board and the relatively mild fall-out from the Asian and Russian crises, exchange rate stress
tests had not been performed. However, it emphasized that, although domestic foreign
currency denominated borrowers could pose credit risks, the banks had a positive net foreign
exchange exposure and were well-capitalized and provisioned against possible exchange rate
shocks.
23.
The authorities have no plans to issue a 10-year maturity domestic currency
denominated bond in the near future. While they agreed with staff that such an instrument
would likely promote growth of the domestic bond market by providing a benchmark interest
rate and promote long-term investment vehicles for the rapidly growing second pillar pension
funds, they noted that because of the government’s strong financial position there is no real
need for such an instrument at present.
D. Fiscal and Public Sector Issues
24.
The authorities planned for a balanced budget in 2004, but a better outcome
seems likely. They explained that budget developments in the first half of the year suggest a
fiscal surplus of about ¾ of a percent of GDP, as better than projected revenues more than
offset postponed expenditures in 2003. The revenue impact of EU-related VAT changes was
expected to be roughly neutral, as measures having a negative impact on revenues (e.g., the
one-off loss due to VAT taxation deferment) are compensated by measures having a positive
impact (fuel and tobacco excises increase and the abolition of VAT incentives on goods
received as foreign aid). The authorities also noted that, although there were some delays in
the disbursement of EU funds, no budgetary pressure from these delays is expected, and they
expressed satisfaction with the utilization of agricultural and entrepreneurship funds from the
EU. Staff, while agreeing on the likelihood of a better-than-budgeted outcome, noted that it

- 17 -

would still fall well short of the recommendation to maintain a surplus similar in magnitude
to that achieved in 2003, imparting an untimely fiscal stimulus to the economy.

(percentage point change in structural

25.
The authorities have targeted a balanced budget in 2005 as well as over the
medium term. The main goal of the 2005–08 budget strategy was to keep balanced—or
slightly positive—budgets over

26.
Staff stressed that, absent an independent monetary policy, a restrictive fiscal
policy in 2005 was needed to limit external vulnerabilities. It noted that, given the
expected surplus in 2004, the 2005 budget target of an overall balance for the general
government would imply an appreciable easing of fiscal policy—about ¾ of a percentage

- 18 -

point of GDP. Staff reasoned that, despite Estonia’s enviable government debt position, for
reasons of external balance and likely long-run pressures related to increasing pension and
health care costs, the authorities should save the entire 2004 fiscal surplus and target, at a
minimum, a neutral fiscal stance in 2005. A neutral fiscal stance would imply raising the
2005 target from a balanced budget to a surplus of at least ¾ percent of GDP. The authorities
agreed, in principle, that, because of increased external vulnerabilities, a fiscal surplus in
2005 similar in magnitude to the one expected in 2004 would be desirable. However, they
noted that it would require large expenditure cuts, which they saw difficult to achieve.
27.
Staff argued that, fiscal surpluses should be reduced only gradually over the
next several years, with implications for the government’s planned tax reductions. The
government intends to lower the level of taxation and to reduce the size of the public sector
by the end 2007. The coalition agreed in December 2003 to lower the flat rate personal
income tax rate from the current 26 percent to 20 percent over the next three years, while
increasing the nontaxable threshold to 1,700 EEK in 2005 and 2,000 EEK in 2007. Staff
emphasized, however, that to reduce external vulnerabilities and ensure a smooth adoption of
the euro, taxes should be reduced only after expenditure cuts have been clearly identified,
unwinding the fiscal surplus only gradually.
28.
The Estonian pension reform has been a success, but staff saw potential
pressures on the PAYG first pillar in the future. With more than half of the eligible
working population participating in the fully-funded second pillar by the end of 2003, interest
in it has far exceeded initial expectations. And the Ministry of Finance (MoF) projected a
sustainable pension fund in the long-run, assuming the current pension indexation formula.
Staff, however, pointed that under the MoF’s assumptions, replacement rates declined
substantially (from around 40 percent in 2003 to about 29 percent in 2020). This fall in the
replacement rate, together with a declining and aging population, and the costs associated
with the shifting of contributions to the second pillar, could put pressure on the first pillar and
lead to increasingly larger deficits in the coming years (Box 3).
29.
There was a broad agreement that healthcare spending was likely to increase
substantially in the medium-term for both demand and supply reasons. The authorities
noted that surveys among health care personnel suggested that a fair number had considered
accepting jobs abroad. To keep these people in Estonia, higher wages would be needed,
which would result in supply pressures to the health insurance fund. In addition, as living
standards improved and life expectancy increased, growing demands of an aging population,
especially for long-term care, would weigh on health care costs.

the average (first plus second
pillar) replacement rate declines by more than 10 percentage points by 2020.
An alternative scenario, assuming constant average replacement rates and lower real
GDP growth and returns on second pillar assets, results in permanent deficits of the
PAYG first pillar and growing liabilities. Under this scenario, the average annual deficit
of the PAYG first pillar is around ½ percent of GDP, and the system accumulates
significant liabilities—15 percent of GDP by 2030, in contrast to a 10 percent surplus in the
authorities’ baseline.
Projected healthcare expenditures also seem to be underestimated in the baseline
scenario. Several reasons could lead to higher than expected healthcare expenditures. First,
as life expectancy increases, healthcare costs are expected to rise. As the 2001 EU study on
ageing population concludes, healthcare expenditures in the EU countries could rise by
close to 3 percent of GDP by 2050. Second, as anecdotal evidence shows, some healthcare
workers consider accepting higher paid jobs in the richer EU countries, which suggests that
with rising incomes, there could be competitive pressures for higher payments to healthcare
workers.

30.
The authorities expressed their satisfaction with the December 2003 FAD
mission on multi-year budgeting and noted that the main recommendations of the
mission have been implemented. Multi-year budgeting was implemented and the authorities
expected more efficient fiscal planning.
31.
There were differences in views between MoF and local governments about the
proposed new local governments act, expected to be submitted to Parliament in the
autumn. While the MoF’s viewpoint was that the law would strengthen local governments’
financial discipline and increase their efficiency, local governments disagreed and
complained about increased mandates without commensurate increase in resources. Local
governments noted also that the new revenue distribution formula (11.4 percent of the total
tax base) significantly worsened their revenue collection compared to the old formula
(56 percent of revenue collections), and created budgetary tensions. Staff pointed that it stood
ready to provide technical assistance in state and local financial relations if the authorities
thought it useful.
32.
EU accession could have significant budgetary implications. EU transfers may
result in lower revenue due to a combination of factors such as co-financing obligations,
Schengen border-related expenses, loss of customs revenues from imports originating in the
EU, and a decrease in VAT

expenditure control.
E. Structural Policies
33.
The pace of structural reform slowed, as most large scale privatizations were
completed. The authorities have no intention to sell the government’s stake in Estonian Air
(34 percent) in the near future. While a privatization offer was, in principle, considered for
the government’s “golden share” in the Estonian telecom (27.3 percent), a deal is not
expected in the near term. Progress continues in adopting the EU’s acquis communautaire;
this could involve some structural regression in Estonia’s open trade system, notably in
agriculture.
34.
The restructuring of the energy sector has advanced as planned. The authorities
have refurbished two of the blocks of Eesti Energia on schedule. They intend to link the
electric grid with Finland and make it operational by 2006. In line with EU accession

- 21 -

agreements, the authorities intend to gradually liberalize the energy market to 35 percent by
the end of 2008, from the current 10 percent, and fully open it by the end of 2012. The
authorities also plan to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil shale by the introduction of
wind- and wood-based production capacities, which are expected to generate 5 percent of the
energy needs by 2010.
35.
The authorities discussed the possibility for creating a venture capital fund to
support the development of the information technology sector. The authorities explained
that the size of the fund is intended to be relatively small (0.5 billion EEK) with 50 percent
private participation. While recognizing Estonia’s strong record of transparency, staff
stressed that global experience with such schemes indicates less than stellar outcomes and,
therefore, felt that a more market-based solution would be preferable.
36.
Active labor market policies designed to reduce unemployment will be submitted
to Parliament in the autumn. The authorities noted that, despite Estonia’s generally flexible
labor market, certain features could be further improved. In particular, they plan to replace
the unemployment benefits with a jobseeker’s allowance, which is intended to induce the
unemployed to actively search for jobs. The authorities pointed that although the
unemployment rate has declined in recent years, it remains a persistent problem in some
regions and among those with low skills. There are still severe skills mismatches and a large
number of long-term unemployed, especially among non-Estonian speakers in the depressed
northeast. To deal with these issues, the authorities plan to improve the current system of
vocational training by better targeting the needed groups. Staff welcomed these initiatives.
F. Other Issues
37.
The authorities have implemented legislation to combat money laundering and
the financing of terrorism. Estonia’s anti-money laundering legislation has been brought in
line with the latest EU directives in this area. The methods used by the Financial Intelligence
Unit seem to work effectively, as reflected in the increased number of cases judged to be
suspicious in 2003 versus 2002. Estonia has fully implemented all U.N. Security Council
Resolutions regarding the financing of terrorism.
38.
Estonia has been at the forefront of transparency and provides good quality
data. They subscribed to the SDDS in September 1998 and started posting metadata in
January 1999. Estonia is in observance of the SDDS and meets the specification for coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness of the data dimension for most data categories, with the exception
of timeliness of quarterly GDP, for which a flexibility option is being taken.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Estonia’s remarkable economic transition and solid economic performance
culminated in EU membership on May 1, 2004. The country joined ERM°II and is in
compliance with the Maastricht criteria, with all convergence indicators at better levels than
those in the other new EU members. The economy is well poised to meet the challenges in
the transition to the euro.

- 22 -

40.
However, the current account deficit remains high and is a potential cause of
concern. Not because it signals a loss in competitiveness—conventional measures of
competitiveness indicate that this is not a problem in Estonia—but because it indicates
growing tensions that are not sustainable over the medium term if left unaddressed.
41.
Estonia’s currency board arrangement underlines the need for an especially
conservative fiscal policy to minimize risks under ERM II. The currency board is a viable
strategy in the run-up to euro adoption. Estonia’s credit rating is relatively high and there
appear to be no problems of competitiveness. No currency risk is currently priced in domestic
securities, attesting to the system’s credibility. However, macroeconomic and structural
policies will need to be carefully directed at underpinning such credibility and maintaining
Estonia’s competitiveness. Under a currency board arrangement, fiscal policy must play the
dominant role in restraining domestic demand and curbing inflationary pressures.
42.
In the present context, this means running a surplus in 2005 at least similar to
that expected in 2004, decreasing gradually to balance over the medium term so as to
avoid a large, unwelcome fiscal stimulus. Such an approach, combined with favorable
external demand and an expected increase in private savings, will help to avoid overheating
the economy, restore the current account balance to more sustainable levels, and reduce
external vulnerabilities.
43.
The authorities plan to reduce income tax rates over 2005−07, but this would
require identifying offsetting savings. The above objective of fiscal restraint must have
primacy and taxes should only be reduced if realistic expenditure cuts (or other revenue
sources) have been clearly identified. Further rationalizing the large number of local
government units could provide some relief to the budget that would help accommodate the
tax decrease and, also, enhance efficiency in the public sector. Improving intergovernmental
finances could also provide efficiency gains.
44.
The authorities have to address the needs of an aging population while ensuring
long-term fiscal sustainability. Although, from a fiscal standpoint, Estonia is better placed
than many countries, the costs of an aging population and increasing health care are expected
to put pressure on the budget in the long term. The fiscal surpluses now required for macro
stability provide an opportunity for the country to provision for the future needs of Estonians.
Accordingly, the 2004 and subsequent fiscal surplus should be set aside to finance the future
needs of the first pillar of the pension system. The recent adoption of a multi-year budgeting
program is a welcome step in achieving this goal.
45.
Credit growth should continue to be monitored carefully and active
consideration given to tightening prudential controls if needed. In light of Estonia’s
strong economic growth record, and the relatively mild collateral damage in the wake of the
Asian and Russian crises, there is a distinct possibility that risks of future downturns could be
underestimated by borrowers and lenders alike. Thus, an emerging “financial accelerator”
could contribute, in the absence of vigilant financial sector supervision, to increasing the
amplitude of the business cycle.

- 23 -

46.
In addition to prudent fiscal budgeting, the need for a flexible labor market
remains paramount in supporting the currency board. External competitiveness will be
maintained only if wage increases reflect, over the medium term, improvements in
productivity. While most wage agreements are conducted at the firm level, taking into
account specific developments, the government must remain aware of the signaling role that
it provides in determining public sector wages. The authorities’ intention to focus efforts on
integrating youth and the long-term unemployed into the ranks of wage earners through the
use of active labor market policies is also welcome.
47.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Estonia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Excludes foreign assets of the central government's SRF.
2/ Currency board cover is equivalent to base money (e.g., the sum of currency issue plus the kroon liabilities of the Bank of Estonia in its
correspondent accounts).
3/ Requirement to be met on the basis of daily average of deposits over month. Up to June 2000, it includes liquidity requirement equivalent to
3 percent of the reserve requirement base (imposed since December 1997). After June 2000, the liquidity requirement was incorporated in the
reserve requirement. Starting in January 2001, 3 percentage points of the 13 percent reserve requirement could be met with high quality eurodenominated foreign instruments. In July 2001, this foreign share of reserve requirements was raised to 50 percent.
4/ Net of currency board cover. ECU through 1998, euro thereafter.
5/ The fall in base money in 2001 is associated with a reduction in the cash reserve requirements.

1/ Includes the impact of the pension reform.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ The large historical residual is due to foreign asset transactions.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ The large historical residual is due to foreign asset transactions.

1/ Banks must meet reserve requirements on the basis of average reserve holdings over each reporting period. End of period levels can, therefore, be below the level of
required reserves. Starting in January 2001, 3 percentage points of the 13 percent reserve requirement could be met with high quality euro-denominated foreign
instruments. In July 2001, this foreign share of reserve requirements was raised to 50 percent.
2/ Non-performing loans are defined as loans overdue from 30-150 days and under current regulations all non-performing loans over 150 days are written off. The ratio
rose sharply in early 1999 reflecting the impact of the Russia crisis on the financial condition of enterprises.
3/ Defined as the ratio of total liabilities to total capital; a decline in the ratio indicates improvement.
4/ Excludes currency board cover and Government deposits held abroad (including the Stabilization Reserve Fund).
5/ Calculated as the difference between short-term (under 1 year) average lending and deposit rates on domestic and foreign currency loans and deposits.

Safeguards Assessment:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Estonia was subject to the
transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-by Arrangement which was approved on
March 1, 2000 and which expired on August 31, 2001. The transitional procedures require a
review of only the BoE’s external audit mechanism. This assessment determines whether the
BoE publishes annual financial statements that are independently audited in accordance with
internationally accepted standards. The external audit assessment was completed on
1

Updated information relating to members positions in the Fund can be found on the IMF
web site (http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/tad/index.htm).

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

December 13, 2000. The assessment concluded that BoE's external audit mechanism is
adequate, as reported in 2001 Article IV Staff Report.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Estonia is the kroon. The kroon replaced the ruble on June 20, 1992. Since
that date, the Bank of Estonia has guaranteed the conversion of kroon bank notes, coins, and
reserve deposits of commercial banks at a fixed rate of exchange of EEK 15.6466 per euro
(and EEK 8 per deutsche mark until 31 December, 2001). Estonia has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Estonia maintains an exchange system that is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, apart from
restrictions in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1076, 1269,
1333, 1368 and 1373 and the measures adopted by the EU within the framework of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy. All such restrictions have been notified to the Fund
according to Decision 144-(52/51). It appears that Estonia does not maintain restrictions on
capital transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
The 2003 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
October 22, 2003.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Estonia’s financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
March, 2000. The associated Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and
the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report, were completed in June and August
2000 respectively. IMF missions also conducted assessments of fiscal transparency, and data
quality and dissemination practices, in Estonia, in April and May 2001, respectively. These
assessments were discussed in the 2001 Article IV consultations, and the resulting ROSC
modules were completed later that year. The ROSC modules were updated during the 2002
Article IV consultation. The updates were published on the Fund’s external website.

APPENDIX II

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Estonia became a member of the World Bank on June 23, 1992. The World Bank’s
early involvement in Estonia included work on public expenditure issues (1994), local
government financing (1995), and the impact of the transition process on living standards
(1996). In June 1997, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review Update.
2.
In June 1999, the World Bank completed a Country Economic Memorandum entitled
“Estonia: Implementing the EU Accession Agenda.” In February 2000, the World Bank
initiated work on a Regional Development Program for the northeastern-most county of
Estonia, Ida Virumaa. The work included the development of an action program designed to:
(a) strengthen regional institutions providing labor and education services, as well as other
social services; (b) support the development of small and medium enterprises; and
(c) mitigate past environmental damages, contributing to sustainable development. The work
was completed in June 2000. Work is proceeding on the financial sector regulatory system,
and the financing of municipalities and reform of the structure of sub-national governments.
3.
The Board of Executive Directors approved the first World Bank lending operation in
Estonia, a Rehabilitation Loan for US$30 million, in October 1992. In May 1994, loans to
support district heating rehabilitation (US$38.4 million) and highway maintenance
(US$12 million) were approved. A US$10 million Financial Institutions Development Loan
(FIDL) was approved in October 1994, a health project (US$18 million) in January 1995,
followed in April 1995 by an environment loan (US$2 million), and an agricultural loan
(US$16 million) in March 1996. All the above-mentioned projects have already been
completed and closed. In March 2000, the Board approved a Transport Sector Project
(US$25 million), focusing primarily on road improvements. The implementation of this
project is continuing, and the project closing date is December 31, 2005.
4.
In late 2003 Estonia opted to cancel the undisbursed World Bank loan balances. The
Bank currently has only one active project (Transport Sector Project), which is due to be
closed in 2005. The Bank’s local office in Tallinn was closed in June 2001 and no new
lending is expected.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 11, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
On November 8, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia.1
Background
Estonia’s successful economic performance over the last decade culminated in EU accession
on May 1, 2004. Estonia joined ERM II, maintaining its currency board at the preexisting peg
against the euro. The country has been among the fastest growing of the accession countries:
per capita GDP has almost doubled since 1993 and reached around 45 percent of the EU
average in 2003 in Purchasing Power Parity terms. However, the external current account
deficit deteriorated sharply since 2002 and remains high.
Economic activity has been gathering speed. Year-on-year growth accelerated to 6.8 percent
in 2004Q1 from 5.8 percent in 2003Q1, driven by domestic demand and supported by
technology sector exports. Inflation accelerated in the first half of 2004 as a result of EU tax
harmonization. But no lasting rise in inflationary pressures is foreseen. Unit labor costs
increased only modestly, with productivity gains dampening the effect on the growth of real
wages.
The external current account deficit widened to 13.2 percent of GDP in 2003. Although it is
expected to decline, as part of the deterioration was due to “one-off” investments of about
5 percentage points of GDP related largely to energy and transportation, the underlying current
account deficit was higher than its historical average. However, the high current account deficit
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the November 8, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2does not appear attributable to worsening competitiveness—market shares of Estonian
exports to the main trading partners increased.
Fiscal policy tightened in 2003: the general government surplus more than doubled to
2.4 percent of GDP. This has occurred in part because of strong revenue performance
stemming from stronger-than-expected domestic demand and employment growth. Some of
the fiscal tightening, however, resulted from postponed personnel and administrative
expenditures and will be reversed in 2004.
Domestic credit growth remained high and was financed mainly by banks’ external borrowing
from foreign parent banks. Year-on-year credit growth to households accelerated to around
50 percent at the end of the first half of 2004, as households borrowed to acquire real estate.
However real estate prices rose only modestly in 2003 and remained stable in the first half of
2004.
Estonia’s banking system remains financially sound. The percentage of non-performing loans
declined further and, at 0.4 percent of the total, is the lowest among transition countries.
Although bank competition and declining interest rates squeezed margins and interest income
declined, bank profits remained strong, with income from services fees growing briskly and
Estonian banks expanding in neighboring markets.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Estonia’s accession to the European Union and early entry in
ERM II. This followed solid economic performance during the past decade, and a successful
transition to a market economy underpinned by prudent fiscal policy, along with flexible labor
and product markets. Directors commended the authorities for Estonia’s remarkable nominal
and real convergence with the EU, and agreed that the economy is well placed to meet the
challenges of adopting the euro. They also welcomed the exemplary track record of
cooperation between the Fund and the Estonian authorities.
Directors noted that Estonia’s high and rising external current account deficit is partly
explained by one-off factors, and that a large part of the deficit has been financed by foreign
direct investment inflows. Furthermore, Estonia’s external competitiveness remains strong.
Nevertheless, most Directors agreed with the view that the continuing high current account
deficits are a potential cause of concern and may not be sustainable over the medium term.
Looking ahead, Directors underlined the importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal policy
stance in order to avoid exacerbating the current account imbalance and to minimize the risks
under ERM II in the context of the currency board arrangement, which has served Estonia
well. The currency board arrangement remains credible, as indicated by Estonia’s relatively
high credit rating, and is a viable strategy in the run-up to euro adoption. Directors
underscored that macroeconomic and structural policies will need to continue to be carefully
directed at underpinning this credibility, with fiscal policy playing the dominant role in
restraining domestic demand and curbing inflationary pressures.
Against this background, Directors called on the authorities to maintain in 2005 a fiscal surplus
similar to that expected in 2004. Furthermore, over the medium term, the surplus should

-3decrease only gradually until fiscal balance is achieved. This will be necessary in order to
avoid a large and unwelcome fiscal stimulus. Directors considered that such an approach will
help to avoid overheating the economy, restore the current account balance to more
sustainable levels, and reduce external vulnerabilities.
Directors cautioned the authorities that the planned income tax cuts over 2005–07 will require
identifying offsetting savings. Given the primacy of the objective of fiscal restraint, taxes should
be reduced only if realistic expenditure cuts, or other revenue sources, have been clearly
identified. Further rationalization of the large number of local governments and improvements
in intergovernmental finances should provide some relief to the budget and help accommodate
the tax cuts and enhance public sector efficiency.
Directors observed that labor market flexibility, and wage increases that are in line with
improvements in productivity, will also remain vital for maintaining external competitiveness
and supporting the currency board. Moderation in public sector wage growth will be of crucial
importance in light of its signaling effect on the private sector. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to focus efforts on drawing unemployed youth and the long-term
unemployed into the labor market through the use of active labor market policies, including
better-targeted vocational training to reduce skill mismatches and reform of the unemployment
benefits scheme.
Directors commended the successful pension reform in Estonia. Going forward, a key
challenge will be to address the needs of an aging population and increasing health care
spending while ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. Directors underscored that the fiscal
surpluses required currently for macro stability also represent an opportunity to make
appropriate provision for the future needs of Estonian citizens. The recent adoption of multiyear budgeting is a welcome step in achieving this goal.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains well-managed and sound, with adequate
capital and low non-performing loan ratios. However, they cautioned that the recent rapid
credit growth could pose a risk to macroeconomic and financial stability, and should continue
to be monitored carefully. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need for
conservative lending practices, supported the planned reduction in mortgage interest
deductibility to limit credit growth, and recommended that consideration be given to tightening
prudential controls if needed. Directors also welcomed Estonia’s implementation of legislation
to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors commended the completion of most large-scale privatizations and the progress
made in restructuring and liberalizing the energy sector.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Republic of Estonia
and Tanel Ross, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 8, 2004
Our Estonian authorities would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Haas and his
team for the high quality work and the excellent set of papers. The authorities broadly agree
with staff’s analysis and recommendations, including on the challenges in the years ahead.
Recent economic developments and prospects
Estonia is in the middle of a broadly based cyclical upturn. The authorities expect the
real GDP growth to reach at least 5.8 percent for 2004. Inflation picked up in the second
quarter, mostly due to EU accession related factors, including the increase of the excise
taxes, but it has subsided from then on. Therefore, the authorities’ inflation forecast for 2004
remains unchanged at around 3 percent. The increase in labor productivity will be around
4.5 percent in 2004, up from last year and exceeding the expected 4 percent growth of real
wages.
The medium term outlook is favorable with the output growth expected to reach the
medium term potential of around 6 percent in 2005. The expansion will be underpinned by
investments and acceleration of labor productivity growth. Inflation is projected to stay close
to 3 percent both in 2005 and 2006, leaving room for a gradual nominal convergence, while
still within the expected margins of the Maastricht criterion. The unemployment rate has
declined below 9 percent in 2004, but although the situation in the labor market has gradually
improved over the last years, the authorities are aware that the labor participation rate should
be increased further if the robust output expansion is to be maintained.
Medium term adjustment of external accounts and credit market developments
The current account deficit has narrowed gradually from mid 2003, supported by a
strong export performance. While the EU accession induced a one-off increase in imports
and widened the external deficit temporarily in the second quarter, the trade deficit has since
resumed a declining trend. The authorities expect the current account deficit to improve
somewhat in 2004 as compared to last year. Net factor outflows, mostly reinvested earnings
on the inward FDI, will amount to some 7 percent of GDP, more than half of the current
account deficit. The inflow of foreign savings has remained robust with the gross FDI flows
to Estonia exceeding 9 percent of GDP. As Estonia’s investments abroad have increased as
well, the net FDI flows will be around 6.5 percent of GDP for 2004, roughly one half of total
capital inflows. Intra-group lending by Scandinavian financial conglomerates to their
Estonian subsidiaries and branches accounts for most of the remainder. Direct borrowing of
enterprises remains subdued.
The rate of credit growth has remained broadly unchanged at around 30 percent.
While the expansion of the total household borrowing has decelerated somewhat, its yearly
growth is still around 40 percent, with mortgages accounting for 75 percent of the household

-2debt. On the other hand, the reliance by the real sector on the domestic financial system has
increased, as foreign direct borrowing from parent companies has been partly substituted by
domestic bank lending. Thus, the modest decrease in the growth of household credit is partly
offset by increased lending to enterprises. The financial leverage is still not very high with a
household credit to GDP ratio equaling around 20 percent of GDP and the overall bank
lending to the real sector amounting to 55 percent of GDP.
Fundamentally, the current account deficit and relatively high credit growth are
considered natural at this stage of Estonia’s development, reflecting the productivity catch-up
and ongoing balance sheet adjustments. Indeed, the authorities welcome staff’s balance sheet
analysis that provides further evidence of domestic investment being the main factor
underlying the current external deficit. Even if the one-off impact of the major infrastructure
investments of 2002 and 2003 is gradually subsiding, the private investments are likely to
remain strong. On the other hand, the public sector savings and high corporate profitability
cannot at this stage fully compensate the households’ inter-temporal consumption
adjustment, underpinned by increasing productivity, higher incomes and efficient financial
intermediation. Against this backdrop, the authorities expect the current account deficit to
decline to 9 percent of GDP in 2006 and to around 6 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Macroeconomic policies in 2004 and 2005
The durable convergence with the Euro Area and meeting the Maastricht criteria in a
sustainable manner are the overarching policy objectives of the Estonian authorities. The
general policy framework remains firmly centered on the currency board and the ERM2
membership. The adjustment of the external position is the main policy concern, as the
authorities are aware that the current account deficit cannot be sustained at the present level
for long. Therefore, fiscal prudence and a strong financial sector are considered essential for
the efficient functioning of the currency board and smooth participation in the ERM2
mechanism. Strong and transparent fiscal and structural policies are also seen as important
for the formation of private sector expectations and investment decisions.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Estonia joined the ERM2 framework shortly after the EU accession. During the first
four months in the mechanism, the Estonian kroon has not experienced any pressures and the
short term interest rate differential against the Euro is negligible. Estonia will maintain its
currency board as a unilateral commitment during the ERM2 membership.
The authorities plan to adopt the Euro at the earliest time possible, in accordance with
the provisions of the EU treaty. Consequently, their policies on the monetary front are aimed
at maintaining an adequate size of banks’ liquidity cushions while continuing technical
preparations for joining the Eurosystem. The central bank has kept the statutory level of
required reserves at 13 percent, but the changes in the calculation of the reserve base - to
bring it fully in line with the ECB requirements - resulted in an increase of the effective
reserve ratio by 1 percentage point in 2004. Moreover, the authorities are planning the

-3adoption of the intraday liquidity instrument to increase the efficiency of the banks liquidity
management.
The financial system is strong and well capitalized. The consolidated capital
adequacy ratio stands close to 12 percent, above the legal minimum of 10 percent, and
profitability is solid. Moreover, the share of non-performing loans has declined further to
0.4 percent of the total loan portfolio. Nevertheless, the still rapid credit growth calls for
vigilance and the authorities have discussed internally the possible use of prudential ratios for
counter-cyclical purposes. However, the outcome of the application of such measures would
be suboptimal under the prevailing market structure, as all major financial institutions belong
to the Nordic financial conglomerates. More importantly, the authorities have intensified
their participation in supervisory cooperation on regional and EU levels.
The authorities are putting emphasis on analyzing the banks’ own risk management
systems, including in the context of preparing for the adoption of the Basle II framework.
Moreover, they remain alert to address possible risks in the real estate and mortgage markets,
as the growth of mortgage lending has not only enhanced the supply of new housing, but the
prices have increased by 15 percent over the last year as well. Against this backdrop, the
banks’ lending practices are closely monitored to maintain the loan-to-value ratio broadly at
70 percent for housing loans. The authorities have also reduced by one half the upper limit on
households’ total tax deductible expenses, including interest payments on mortgages.
Estonia has in place a housing finance support scheme. A specialized governmental
agency, Kredex, guarantees for certain groups of the population the initial down payment,
typically around one third of the value of the underlying mortgage. The authorities regard
this system as an important policy instrument, most notably to support the home ownership
among young families. However, they recognize the need to balance the public policies
against broader macroeconomic concerns. By October 2004, Kredex had fully used up the
statutory limit of 700 million Estonian kroons on its mortgage guarantee portfolio and this
proved to be an opportune time to modify the scheme to better target the new entrants to the
housing market. The eligibility criteria for applicants were tightened and the maximum
amount of a single guarantee reduced by 25 percent. The government decided also to
increase the ceiling on the total amount of guarantees by 250 million Estonian kroons,
considerably less than initially planned.
Fiscal policy
Estonia continues to adhere to a prudent fiscal stance, commensurate with a fixed
exchange rate regime and fully in line with the EU framework. The authorities remain
committed to maintaining the general government budget in surplus or balance over the
medium term, consistent with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU
Treaty.
Against the stronger than projected output expansion, Estonia recorded a significant
budget surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2003, mostly accounted for by the functioning of
automatic stabilizers. The central government’s share in the surplus was allocated partly to

-4the reserves of the public pillar of the pension system while the other part is set aside for
upgrading the public education facilities. As the revenue performance has exceeded
projections also in 2004, the government has prepared a supplementary budget to assign
some of the expected over-performance to mostly education and environment-related
investments. However, this supplementary budget, yet to be approved by the parliament, will
add to government spending in 2004 by no more than some 0.2 percent of GDP. The
authorities project the fiscal surplus to reach nearly 0.7 percent of GDP for the FY 2004,
broadly in line with the cyclical position as the output growth would be slightly below its
medium term potential. The amount of fiscal reserves is expected to be around 10 percent of
GDP by the end of this year.
The authorities have submitted the FY 2005 budget to the parliament. It is fully
balanced on the general government level, in line with the Budget Strategy for 2005-2008
that sets nominal expenditure ceilings for governmental agencies. On the structural front, the
authorities will continue the tax reform with a view to decrease the share of direct taxes in
the overall tax burden. They intend to decrease the flat income tax rate from 26 to 24 percent
in 2005 while containing current expenditures and increasing excise duties, so that the tax
reform will be fully financed. Looking forward, the authorities are preparing a
comprehensive strategy of tax policies from 2005 to 2009 aiming, among other things, at a
lower taxation of labor and the increase of the consumption and environmental taxes.
The local governments recorded a deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2003, fully
accounted for by one municipality, the capital city of Tallinn. During 2004, the deficit of
municipalities has been reduced to half, as some local governments have reached the legal
borrowing limits and, consequently, have contained their spending. The deficit of
municipalities is expected not to increase from the current level of 0.2 percent of GDP in FY
2005. To strengthen the budgetary management in the municipalities, the government has
prepared a draft Local Governments’ Financial Management Act that would, among other
things, tighten the limits of deficit and debt, and will introduce a requirement to maintain a
liquidity reserve.
As discussed during the 2003 Article IV consultation, the Estonian authorities have
established a separate company to manage all real estate holdings of the central government.
Consequently, a part of the public investments in structures are recorded by the central
government as financial investments in the real estate company, AS Riigi Kinnisvara. The
audited accounts of AS Riigi Kinnisvara are publicly available over the internet, and the
authorities have consulted with Eurostat to ensure full compliance of their rules with the EU
regulations and practices.
Structural policies
The authorities continue to promote an advanced structural reform agenda to support
balanced and sustained growth over the medium and long term, including by addressing long
term fiscal challenges and by advancing reforms in product and labor markets within the
framework of the Lisbon agenda.

-5The transition to the three-pillar pension system has been successfully completed. The
first public pillar is financially sustainable, despite small inevitable transitory costs, and will
turn firmly into surplus in a 10 year horizon. Estonia’s health care system is based on a
universal participation in the Health Insurance Fund and on the system of autonomous
private and public service providers. The Health Insurance Fund, financed by the earmarked
part of the payroll tax, is financially sound at present. Additionally, the reform of public
hospital network is going on in accordance with the Hospital Master Plan 2015, approved by
the government in 2003. However, the long term sustainability of the social policy
framework depends ultimately on the actual replacement ratios and on the availability of
finances to cope with higher medical costs in the future. In this regard, the authorities agree
with the conclusions of staff’s analysis on Estonia’s aging and healthcare expenditures. At
the same time, they believe that relatively high fiscal reserves and very low public debt will
provide some support in coping with these challenges.
While agreeing with staff that labor market developments have been broadly
favorable, the authorities are aware that more needs to be done to increase the employment
rate. Further steps in labor market policies include a new draft Employment Contracts Act
and an adopted National Action Plan of Employment. While the former is aimed at
enhancing the flexibility of contractual relations between employers and employees, the latter
will provide more focused services for training of the workforce and will increase the
budgetary resources for the implementation of these priorities.
The authorities specified their timetable for the energy sector reform in 2004. In
accordance with the EU Directives and provisions governing Estonia’s accession to EU,
Estonia’s energy market will be fully opened for competition by 2012. Meanwhile, the joint
stock company owned by major Finnish and Estonian energy suppliers has started the work
to connect the Estonian and Scandinavian electric grids, thereby facilitating the gradual
integration of Estonia’s electricity market to the Scandinavian networks from 2006 and
onwards.
Finally, the parliament has adopted a new law to support the voluntary mergers of the
municipalities in order to streamline the system of local governments and to reduce their
number. Financial incentives to encourage the unifications are provided in the FY 2005
budget. The authorities expect that the strict co-financing rules for use of the EU funds will
have a catalytic role in this regard as well.
