EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

There are increasing signs that Japan’s longstanding problems have eased:
¾ The recovery has gained pace and broadened, deflation is easing, and the nearterm outlook is for a continued robust expansion and narrowing deflation (there
remain downside risks to the outlook, mainly arising from external factors);
¾ Monetary policy has been supportive, with short-term interest rates held at zero under
the BoJ’s quantitative easing policy. Exchange rate policy has sought to smooth shortterm volatility and worked to avoid an undue tightening of monetary conditions;
¾ Encouraged by policy measures, financial and corporate sector weaknesses are
diminishing, as reflected in declining nonperforming loans and improved profits
and deleveraging, respectively;
¾ Fiscal deficits remain large, and public debt has grown rapidly. The authorities aim
to achieve a primary surplus (excluding social security) by the early 2010s, and
recently approved reforms will improve the pension system’s finances.

Key Issues and Policy Discussions
•

With agreement on the broad direction of policies, the staff favored expanding
current reforms to secure a strong and durable medium term expansion:
¾ Regarding monetary policy, the mission agreed with the BoJ’s policy of keeping
short-term interest rates at zero until inflation turns positive. The mission proposed
that the BoJ enhance its communications strategy to stabilize inflation
expectations, including by quantifying a medium-term inflation objective. The BoJ
sees this as one possible option for managing the transition to positive inflation;
¾ In the financial sector, the mission proposed expanding on current reforms to
more quickly resolve remaining weaknesses—especially for regional banks whose
restructuring has lagged. The authorities preferred a more gradual approach;
¾ On fiscal policy, with the economy stronger than initially envisaged, fiscal savings
in FY2004 relative to the budget would be desirable. For the medium term, the
mission advocated a specific target balance and measures to achieve it, to enhance
the credibility of the government’s plan. The authorities aim to further enhance
credibility through concrete progress;
¾ Structural economic reforms should be expanded to encourage job creation and
raise productivity and potential economic growth. The priorities are to strengthen
competition policy, increase labor market flexibility, and advance regulatory
reforms. Further trade liberalization is also needed, particularly for agriculture.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
There are clear indications that Japan’s longstanding problems—sluggish
economic activity, deflation, and financial and corporate sector weaknesses—have
eased. GDP has grown for eight consecutive quarters, picking up pace recently, and labor
market conditions are improving. Also, deflationary pressures have diminished, against the
backdrop of a narrowing output gap and supportive monetary policy. Meanwhile, progress
has been made in addressing corporate and financial sector problems, helped by the
economic expansion and encouraged by policy measures.
2.
Despite these favorable developments, weaknesses remain that could restrain
growth over the medium term. Deflation (though mild) persists; additional corporate and
financial sector restructuring is needed; and public debt is high and rising. Moreover,
accelerated deregulation and other structural reform efforts are needed to lay the basis for a
strong and durable expansion over the medium term.

The buoyant recovery initially reflected exports, but subsequently broadened to
domestic demand. Starting in early 2002, exports (especially to Asia) rebounded reflecting a

Index number problems may cause an upward bias in measured GDP growth (and a
corresponding downward bias in deflation as measured by the GDP deflator). Most estimates
of the bias are around ¼ to ½ percent per annum. However, one oft-cited private study has
suggested it may be higher, while rough STA estimates through 2002 are close to zero. The
bias for 2003 can be more precisely estimated once the needed data are released in late 2004.

Box 1: Is the Japanese Recovery for Real?
This recovery is likely to be more durable than the previous recoveries during the
1990s, for three reasons: 1

Second, corporate restructuring has
fostered structural gains in
profitability, which should support
investment going forward. Firms
have steadily pared back excess
leverage and labor costs during this
expansion. As a consequence, they are
now better positioned to reap profits as
demand grows, which is positive for
the investment outlook.
Third, the corporate and financial
sectors have become more resilient
to shocks. Firms have deleveraged
while banks have shed
nonperforming loans and equity
holdings. As a result, these sectors
have become less vulnerable to
shocks that could trigger a sharp
cutback in investment by firms or
credit crunch by banks and thereby
put the expansion at risk.

-6pickup in partner-country growth (especially China),3 and the revitalization of exportoriented firms; accordingly, real net exports were a principal contributor to the
accompanying turnaround in GDP growth. Subsequently, business fixed investment also
began to grow briskly, fed by robust corporate cashflow and demand to replace aging capital.
Most recently, consumption has shown strength, despite weakness in household income,
while import growth has firmed.
5.
The recovery has begun to lead to improvements in labor market conditions.
Employment, the labor force, and compensation, which had been declining since 2001, have
stabilized, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent from the record-high
5.5 percent reached in early 2003. Also, job offers have risen both in absolute terms and in
relation to the number of job seekers, while the fraction of firms reporting that they employ
excess labor has decreased.
Consumer price deflation has subsided to a mild rate
6.
Reflecting both the expansion
and one-off factors, CPI deflation has
eased. Since January 2003, the y/y fall in
the core CPI (which excludes fresh food)
has narrowed substantially owing to the
declining output gap and temporary
influences such as tax hikes and oil price
increases. Net of transitory factors, the
underlying trend shows that the core CPI
is falling by 0.3 percent. Expected
deflation has waned as well: current
consensus forecasts are for a broadly flat
CPI over 2004 and 2005.

9.
During 2003 and into early 2004, periodic bouts of upward pressure on the yen
threatened to unduly tighten monetary conditions and thereby adversely affect Japan’s
recovery. Market concerns about adjustment in the major exchange rates focused on the large
current account imbalances in the United States and Japan, the latter of which rose to a
surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2003 with sizeable increases in both the trade and nonfactor
services balances. In response to upward pressure on the yen, the authorities intervened in
record levels (¥20 trillion in 2003 and a further ¥15 trillion during January–March 2004).5
However, in April 2004, both upward pressure on the yen and intervention ceased. Since

market for these securities and thus strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

structural basis (including social security
but excluding bank support) the fiscal
stance was unchanged with a deficit
broadly stable at around 6½ percent of
GDP. A decade of high deficits has fed
rapid growth in public debt, which at end2003 stood at 166 percent of GDP on a
gross basis (80 percent on a net basis)—
the highest among advanced countries by
a substantial margin.

Financial and corporate sector weaknesses are diminishing
11.
Financial institutions made headway in strengthening their financial conditions,
but some banking sector weaknesses persist and regional banks have lagged behind.7
During FY2003 (the year ending March 2004), major banks cut bad loans, reduced deferred
tax assets (DTAs) and equity holdings and lifted their capital adequacy ratios amid the
economic recovery, the stock market rebound, and tighter regulation under the Program for
Financial Revival (PFR).8 The economic

but are subject to less demanding regulation than major banks (and are not covered by the PFR)

Also, banks increased their bond holdings, raising their exposure to capital losses from
rising long-term interest rates. However, if higher rates were accompanied by stronger
growth, attendant gains in credit quality and stock prices would likely offset these losses.

Looking ahead, the near-term baseline outlook is for a continued expansion with
mild deflation. Assuming that the external environment remains supportive, the robust
expansion is likely to continue over the near term, thanks to firmer support in domestic
demand and reduced financial and corporate sector vulnerabilities (see Box 1). Staff’s current
projections are for GDP growth of about 4½ percent in 2004 and 2½ percent in 2005. As the
remaining economic slack diminishes, deflationary pressures are likely to ease further, and

directly and through knock-on effects on its partner countries. These risks include a sharp
rise in long-term U.S. interest rates that could spark global portfolio rebalancing and
volatility in international capital markets; a slowdown in China that could dampen its
demand for Japan’s exports;11 a supply shock in oil markets that could foster a sustained oil
price increase and thus reduce partner country growth;12 and geopolitical shocks that could
trigger a deterioration in business and consumer confidence. There are upside risks as well:
consumption and business fixed investment could show further surprising strength, for
instance if labor markets conditions and corporate profits improve more rapidly than
anticipated.
16.
Over the medium term, growth is envisaged to slow to around potential,
estimated by staff at 1.7 percent per year. This estimate assumes that productivity growth
continues at around current rates. However, additional structural economic reforms—such as
further deregulation of labor and product markets—and continued progress in financial and

Staff estimates that a 10 percentage point fall relative to baseline in China’s imports for
domestic use, caused by slowing Chinese domestic demand, would reduce Japan’s GDP by
about ½ percentage point.

Staff estimates that a sustained 10 percent rise in oil prices could reduce Japan’s GDP by
up to ½ percentage point over the long term (near-term effects would be considerably
smaller).

- 11 corporate sector restructuring could boost productivity, raise Japan’s economic potential and
foster more rapid job creation over the medium term.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
During recent years, policies have moved broadly in line with past staff advice in
key areas. In the monetary policy area, various steps have been taken to counter deflation;
bank regulation has been tightened; the framework for corporate revitalization has been
improved; and on the fiscal front, the personal income tax base has been broadened, cuts in
public works spending have continued, and elements of a medium-term fiscal consolidation
strategy have been formulated. However, policy measures have generally been more
moderate than those advocated by staff, mainly reflecting officials’ concerns that bolder
actions might harm the economy in the near term.
18.
Further progress in addressing Japan’s economic problems would convey
benefits both domestically and internationally. Continued efforts to reduce domestic
vulnerabilities and revitalize the economy and financial system would strengthen Japan’s
growth in the medium term. In turn, putting Japan on a firmer and more robust growth path
would help to support the global expansion and strengthen its resilience to shocks. Also,
stronger growth could reduce Japan’s current account surplus, and thus limit both global
pressures for protectionism and the risk of disorderly adjustments among major currencies.
19.
The 2004 discussions took place against the backdrop of an improved economic
outlook and progress in addressing Japan’s structural problems. The mission and the
authorities agreed that Japan’s near-term prospects had brightened considerably in the past
year and that the risks to the outlook had become more balanced. In addition, progress had
been observed in reducing financial and corporate sector weaknesses, although it was
acknowledged that more needed to be done. In areas where progress has been less marked—
notably fiscal consolidation and structural reforms—a consensus nevertheless existed on the
key problems to be tackled, and it was also agreed that the main elements of a reform
program had been sketched out.
20.
With agreement on the broad direction of future policies, the consultation
discussions centered on the desirable speed and modalities of reforms. The mission
considered that the policy priorities going forward were to build on the existing reform
program in order to resolve remaining weaknesses and secure a strong and durable mediumterm expansion. While the authorities generally agreed on the policy requirements and
priorities, in several areas they preferred to maintain their existing approach to allow more
time for their current policies to work or to fully consider all options.
Monetary policy: committing to end deflation, then stabilizing inflation expectations
21.
The BoJ has recently taken steps to clarify and demonstrate its commitment to
maintain zero short-term interest rates as long as deflation persists. In October 2003, the
BoJ clarified its commitment by announcing two necessary conditions for ending
quantitative easing—that core CPI growth be nonnegative for a few months, and that a
majority of Policy Board members forecast positive core CPI inflation—while stressing that

- 12 even if these conditions obtained, it might
maintain its present policy. Also, in
October 2003 and January 2004, the BoJ
raised its current-account balance target,
which helped reassure markets that the
current framework will be kept in place
until deflation ends.

milder) deflation, the current monetary
policy stance and strategy should be
maintained until inflation is positive. With the economy strengthening, deflation waning,
and liquidity ample, the case for additional increases in the current-account target had
weakened substantially. However, if markets became concerned that quantitative easing
might end too early, additional increases in the current account target could signal further the
BoJ’s resolve to maintain the framework until deflation was decisively subdued.
bojcab

23.
The mission suggested that as the onset of inflation drew nearer, the BoJ could
enhance its communication strategy to stabilize inflation expectations. For example, the
BoJ could quantify its inflation objective, setting it high enough to limit the risk of returning
to deflation, account for upward bias in CPI inflation, and facilitate relative price adjustments
in the presence of downward price rigidities. Also, to mitigate the risk to the BoJ’s reputation
if inflation temporarily strayed from the objective, it should be clearly specified as the BoJ’s
view on a desirable medium-term inflation rate, rather than as a binding target that it was
committed to achieve within a specified time period. In addition, the BoJ could consider
issuing more detailed discussion of its views on monetary policy and the inflation outlook in
periodic reports.
24.
BoJ officials noted that they were weighing options for managing the transition
to positive inflation and for the appropriate medium term monetary framework.
Regarding the immediate future, BoJ officials saw the present quantitative easing approach
as a more effective policy commitment than inflation targeting, as their current approach was
based on actual inflation—an objective concept—rather than (subjective) expected inflation.
Looking beyond the transition period, they viewed inflation targeting as one option and
highlighted specific implementation issues. If an inflation objective were to be announced,
BoJ officials agreed that the objective should be understood as applying over the medium to
long term to allow due flexibility to respond to short-term shocks. They also were
investigating ways to convey the inflation forecast of the policy board in an effective manner
while taking into account the fact that policy board members had diverse forecasts.
25.
As for exchange rate policy, the authorities emphasized that their continued
approach was to aim to smooth excessive short-term volatility in the yen. They regarded
the interventions during 2003 and early 2004 as “extraordinary measures to deal with
extraordinary circumstances,” and as having successfully smoothed sharp short-term
fluctuations in the currency. More recently, with pressures on the yen/dollar exchange rate
having become more balanced, there was less need for such extraordinary measures. In this

- 13 connection, the mission agreed with the authorities that past sizeable interventions had kept
upward pressure on the yen from leading to an undue tightening of monetary conditions. It
also concurred that if such pressures reemerged, to the extent that they threatened to stall the
recovery and heighten deflationary pressures, further intervention could be warranted.
Financial and corporate sectors: completing the task of revitalization
26.
The authorities’ strategy to resolve remaining banking weaknesses comprised
continued enhanced regulation of major banks and measures to promote restructuring
of regional banks and their borrowers. For the major banks, they would continue to
implement the PFR’s regulatory measures, such as forward-looking provisioning for selected
loans, with the aim of reducing these banks’ bad loan ratios to around 4 percent by endMarch 2005 and strengthening the banks before insurance coverage was scaled back on
interest-bearing demand deposits on April 1, 2005. For the regional banks, an Action
Program for Enhancement of Relationship Banking Functions encouraged such banks to help
borrowers restructure their operations, with the objective that loans to these borrowers could
be upgraded. Also, a new facility would offer regional banks precautionary capital injections
to support restructuring and strengthening of their operations (available in principle to any
bank but intended for regional banks; the measure passed the Diet in June 2004). Injections
would be provided only to viable banks that were indispensable for regional economies, with
management accountable for implementing a restructuring plan.
27.
The mission welcomed these measures and encouraged the authorities to expand
on these reforms to more quickly resolve remaining banking sector weaknesses. It
acknowledged that strengthened regulation had helped to foster a marked improvement in
major banks’ financial conditions, and noted that these banks were broadly on track to
achieve the NPL targets set under the PFR and that there were no signs of strains in the runup to the cutback in deposit insurance coverage. Nevertheless, significant weaknesses
remained among the major banks, and regional banks had made less progress in reducing bad
loans. Building on existing reforms would help to expeditiously resolve these problems so
that banks could lend and thus help to sustain the expansion. In particular, the mission
favored (in line with the 2003 FSAP):
•

To further improve recognition of and provisioning for problem loans, encourage
banks to make more extensive use of forward-looking provisioning, and allow
provisions required by the FSA to be recognized as a cost for tax purposes;

•

To strengthen bank capital, phase in limits on DTAs in bank capital, and raise the
capital adequacy requirement for all domestic banks to 8 percent;

•

To enhance the environment for profitability, front load and flesh out plans to reduce
competition from Japan Post and government financial institutions (GFIs), including
by more rapidly phasing out their preferences, and clarifying the timetable for
shrinking their operations;

•

To improve bank governance, urge banks to enhance the roles of outside directors and
auditors, and exercise government ownership rights in any major bank that does not
meet the end-March 2005 NPL target to make improvements in its management;

- 14 •

To encourage more rapid strengthening and restructuring of regional banks, subject
them to measures that have succeeded with major banks under the PFR, such as
special inspections, enhanced disclosure about DTAs, and targets for NPL reductions.
Also, use the capital injection facility, with appropriate conditionality, to facilitate
consolidation.

28.
With broad agreement on the main priorities, the main differences of view
between the authorities and the mission surrounded the timing and possible adverse
effects of additional measures. In particular, the FSA considered that progress had been
made by regional banks in implementing the Action Program, which took into account the
difficult conditions in regional economies, and thought that it should be allowed more time to
work. Also, in their view, raising the capital adequacy requirement for all banks could
adversely affect the lending attitude of regional banks. They agreed that expanded use of
forward-looking provisioning was desirable, and noted that some banks were applying such
practices more broadly on a voluntary basis; that said, they believed that banks were
adequately provisioned for distressed loans. Also, the government was considering ways to
deal with excessive DTAs in bank capital; any new rule would need to be phased in over
time and be accompanied by liberalized tax-deductibility of provisions (which the FSA may
propose again in 2004). As for GFIs, discussion would resume in 2005 on how to halve the
sector’s balance sheet as a proportion of GDP; the intention was that the GFIs should operate
in areas where private sector institutions would not operate, rather than competing with them.
29.
The mission agreed that existing regional weaknesses should be taken into
account but nevertheless saw a need to deal more decisively with banks’ remaining
problems. In particular, a uniform capital adequacy ratio and enhanced regulation for
regional banks would need to be introduced gradually over time, in light of the weaknesses in
regional economies and institutions. That said, plans to phase in such measures could be
developed soon. Also, since heightened regulation had worked well in fostering an
improvement in the situation of major banks, it could also be effective in encouraging
regional banks to restructure and in ensuring that they are equally strong as major banks.
Together with the mission’s other suggested steps, this could bring about an early
strengthening of the overall banking system.
30.
Officials observed that corporate restructuring was progressing, with the
Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan (IRCJ) coordinating a handful of cases.
The IRCJ, an official organization created in 2003, had some mechanisms such as tax
incentives to facilitate restructurings, and had also succeeded in coordinating large numbers
of creditors (over 100 in one case) and getting them to accept a pro rata haircut. As of early
June 2004, the IRCJ was involved in 17 cases (others were in the pipeline). The mission
considered that the IRCJ could appropriately continue to facilitate market-based
restructuring, particularly in instances where it could help to coordinate creditors.
31.
The mission observed that a strengthened banking system would facilitate
further corporate restructuring, by allowing banks to more easily shoulder the losses
involved in dealing with weak borrowers. In addition, revisions to the Commercial Code to
ensure that outside directors are fully independent from corporate management could

- 15 improve incentives for corporations to restructure both financially and operationally. The
mission acknowledged the continued official efforts to promote mergers and acquisition
activity, which had helped to foster revitalization.
Fiscal policy: stabilizing public debt over the medium term
32.
Reflecting their concerns about
the fiscal situation, the authorities
have put in place a strategy aimed at
medium-term fiscal adjustment to
stabilize public debt.

FY2004). To this end, they intended to keep government expenditure at or below its
current level as a percent of GDP through FY2006. Subsequently, they would
continue limiting expenditure but would also introduce revenue-enhancing
measures.13

•

Regarding the social security system, the government customarily reviewed the
pension and medical insurance schemes periodically and proposed reforms to the
Diet. A pension reform that strengthened the system’s finances passed the Diet in
June 2004 (Box 2).14 The reform featured gradual increases in contributions and
government transfers and reductions in pension benefits, which together would
significantly reduce the system’s long-term deficit.

33.
The mission and the authorities broadly agreed that the stronger economy
meant that a tighter fiscal stance was warranted from a near-term perspective. With
growth much higher than initially envisaged, achieving additional fiscal savings in FY2004
relative to the budget would be desirable. As the budget implied a constant cyclicallyadjusted deficit, the mission recommended that any stronger than expected revenues should
be saved and in addition the scope for expenditure savings should be explored. The
authorities agreed on revenues. However, they considered that it was too early in the fiscal
year (which began only in April) to consider expenditure measures. Also, it was not yet clear
that the recovery was sufficiently robust to step up discretionary spending cuts. However,
13

The government was also contemplating reforms of the fiscal relationship between the
central and local governments, which would aim to both decentralize decision-making and
achieve fiscal consolidation at the local and central government levels. See the selected
issues paper entitled “Reform of Local Government Finances.”

Box 2. Public Pension Reform in Japan
Japan’s demographic trends present a
serious challenge to its long-term fiscal
sustainability. Japan has the most rapidly
aging population among advanced countries.
The elderly dependency ratio is expected to
increase from about 30 percent currently to
more than 70 percent in 2050. Social security
expenditure (including on pensions, health,
and welfare) has been the fastest growing
component of public expenditure and is set to
continue outpacing GDP growth in the future.

1/ Defined as the number of people 65 years or older per 100 people aged 15-64 years.

Japan has a defined-benefit public pension
system with comprehensive coverage,
supplemented by various private pension plans. The public system includes the National Pension
(NP), which covers all people and pays flat-rate benefits; Employee Pension Insurance (EPI), which
covers private sector employees and pays wage-related benefits; and mutual pension schemes, which
cover public sector employees and have structures similar to that of the EPI.
The 2004 public pension reform recently passed by the Diet features the following changes:
•

Contribution rates would be gradually raised through 2017: by 27 percent in real terms for the
NP, and from 13.58 percent of salary to 18.3 percent for the EPI;

•

Pension benefits would be gradually reduced (by not fully indexing them to the CPI), but the
reductions would stop once the EPI benefits for a typical family fall to 50.2 percent of average
salary (the current level is 59.3 percent);

•

Government transfers to the NP would increase gradually from one-third to one-half of total
benefit payments between 2004 and 2009;

•

The reserves of the pension system would fall to the level of annual benefit expenditure by 2100
(currently the reserves are five times annual benefit expenditure).

The reform would improve the finances of
the pension system. Staff projections suggest
that with the reform the primary deficit of the
public pension system would be 2 percent of
GDP in 2050, compared to 5 percent of GDP
in the absence of reform.

latter because—other things constant—it
would require higher taxes); (ii) it does not
include an automatic mechanism to lower benefits or increase contributions in case that current
assumptions regarding economic growth and the evolution of other key variables turn out to be too
optimistic; and (iii) it deepens intergenerational inequality as the younger generations would bear
most of the burden of the reform.

- 17 spending measures might be contemplated later in the year, provided that the recovery
proved strong enough.
34.
Regarding the medium term, the
discussion focused on the best way to
undertake the sizeable adjustment that
would be needed. The mission considered
that an adjustment of 6.9 percent of GDP in
the primary balance excluding social security
would be needed to stabilize public debt
relative to GDP by 2013 (corresponding to
the authorities’ target period—the early
2010s—for attaining a primary surplus
excluding social security). Even after this
large adjustment, debt would remain very
high—110 percent of GDP. The
consolidation effort would most likely need
to comprise a mix of spending cuts and
revenue-boosting measures, which could
include:

estimated that each 1 percentage point increase would yield 0.5 percent of GDP;

•

Social security reforms to address the major medium-term fiscal challenges posed by
population aging. In addition to the recently approved pension reform, these could
include strengthened enforcement of pension contributions and reforms of the
medical and long-term care systems to contain rapidly growing costs. Future pension
reviews should duly consider both the system’s long-term finances and adverse
effects on growth when weighing contribution hikes against benefit cuts.

Also, in view of the size of the needed adjustment, measures to enhance the plan’s credibility
by specifying a primary surplus target and measures to achieve it could help to prevent a rise
in real interest rates.
35.
The authorities agreed that a sizeable adjustment was needed, and would aim to further
enhance credibility through concrete future progress. On tax reforms, the ruling parties had

- 18 recently outlined some possible measures, including reforms of the consumption tax by
around 2007, but the timing and modalities required further discussion. However, the
authorities were reluctant to adopt specific targets and measures in view of the unsuccessful
experience with a detailed and rigid medium-term fiscal adjustment program in 1998, which
had to be abandoned soon after its introduction. The mission agreed that any more specific
consolidation plan should have due flexibility to adapt to economic fluctuations, by
providing that shortfalls relative to the goal could occur during slowdowns and be made up
when growth revives. Also, it concurred that early steps to rein in fiscal imbalances could
also help to signal the commitment to medium-term consolidation.
Trade and structural reforms: expanding opportunities domestically and internationally
36.
The Koizumi administration has embarked on a broad-based program of
structural reforms, with a view to encouraging job creation and raising productivity and
potential economic growth (Box 3).15 The program spans deregulation of product and labor
markets, strengthened competition policy, and reforms of key public enterprises. In each of
these areas, progress has been made or proposals have been drafted.
37.
The mission noted the progress to date and encouraged the government to
accelerate its program for structural reforms. In view of the prospective rapid aging of
the Japanese population (see Box 2), such reforms are critical to enhancing prospects for
Japan’s economic vitality and prosperity in the years ahead. Priority areas include:
•

Regulatory reforms to improve resource allocation, notably by pressing ahead with
special structural reform zones; removing barriers to entry in sectors such as health
care, agriculture, and education; and permanently reducing capital requirements to
start new firms;

•

Strengthening competition policy to facilitate market entry and exit, including by
enhancing the resources and power of the Fair Trade Commission and increasing
sanctions for anti-competitive practices;

•

Increasing labor market flexibility, in particular by further clarifying conditions for
dismissing workers; further relaxing restrictions on fixed-term contracts, temporary
workers, and private job-placement firms; improving the effectiveness of public job
training programs; and raising contribution limits for portable corporate pensions;

•

Further progress in public enterprise reforms, notably of the highway and postal
corporations, through plans that would raise the efficiency of these enterprises, reduce
distortions in related private markets, and realize fiscal savings.

38.
The mission reviewed trade policy, especially the increased reliance on bilateral
agreements. Officials viewed the preliminary Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with
Mexico as a key development, as it included a number of commitments on agriculture. This
15

Box 3. Japan: Structural Reforms
The government’s structural reform agenda
aims to reverse the secular decline in growth
and productivity. Real GDP growth declined
from an average of 4 percent in the 1980s to
1½ percent in the 1990s. Estimates by the
Cabinet Office suggest that average labor
productivity growth declined from 3¾ percent to
2 percent over this same period, while total
factor productivity growth (based on a CobbDouglas production function) declined from
1.6 percent to 0.2 percent (Figure). The
slowdown in productivity is generally attributed
to rigidities that inhibited a rapid and efficient
reallocation of economic resources.

Consequently, structural reforms have been geared towards enhancing private sector activity and
employment. The current framework for reforms was set out in the Council on Economic and Financial
Policy’s Outline of Basic Policies for Macroeconomic Management and Structural Reform in 2001, and is
updated annually. The framework is wide-ranging, covering fiscal and monetary policies, financial sector
reforms under the Program for Financial Revival, trade policy, and other structural reforms.
The main elements of the structural reform agenda include the following:
•

Enhancing labor market flexibility. Restrictions on the use of temporary workers have been relaxed
by allowing such workers to be hired on fixed-term contracts of up to three years (up from one), and
rules governing worker dismissal have been clarified. Pension portability has been increased through
the introduction of defined-contribution plans, although these are subject to a low contribution limit
and have yet to be widely adopted. The scope for private job placement services has increased, but
the services currently account for only 1 percent of new hires.

•

Advancing regulatory reform. The Council for Regulatory Reform, a group of private-sector experts,
was established at the Cabinet Office in 2001 to guide regulatory reform. Its focus has been on
removing obstacles to private sector involvement in social sectors (e.g., healthcare and education)
and establishing “special structural reform zones” that relax business regulation at a local level on a
pilot basis. In FY2003, the first year of the program, over 300 special zones were approved. It is
expected that successful reforms will be extended nation-wide.

•

Strengthening competition policy. The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) has had mixed success in
addressing anticompetitive activities. Many companies have been exempted from the Antimonopoly
Act, and the FTC often relies on formal warnings, while fines for anticompetitive practices have been
infrequent and small. In recent years, steps have been taken to strengthen the independence of the
FTC and increase its resources. More generally, competition has been encouraged by temporarily
reducing the minimum capital required to start a new business.

•

Accelerating public enterprise reform. The emphasis has been on privatizing the highway and postal
corporations. The four highway corporations are to be transformed into six private corporations
which would enter into long-term contracts to build and manage highways. The privatization of Japan
Post is set to begin in 2007, although the modalities have yet to be determined.

The benefits of accelerating reforms in these areas are difficult to quantify, but could be significant.
A number of studies in the 1990s suggested that structural reforms could boost the level of output by
around 6 percent. A more recent study by the OECD, based on explicit assumptions about the scope for
reducing price-cost margins in a number of sectors, estimated that comprehensive regulatory reforms
could reduce producer prices by 5–7 percent and raise labor productivity and output levels by 5–6 percent.

- 20 new degree of flexibility could prove essential for prospective EPAs with Malaysia,
Thailand, the Philippines, Republic of Korea and ASEAN. The staff noted that while steps
toward a more liberal trade environment were welcome, broad-based liberalization through
the WTO framework would bring more substantial benefits and would demonstrate support
for the world trading system at a critical juncture. Staff also highlighted the risk of trade
diversion, and the need to avoid creating a multiplicity of trade rules that could complicate
trade administration. The authorities emphasized that the WTO and the Doha Development
Agenda remained the centerpieces of Japan’s trade policy and that their recent pursuit of
bilateral agreements did not represent a shift away from support for the multilateral trading
system. Instead, it represented in part a response to regional trade agreements by other
countries, which in recent years had reduced Japanese firms’ competitiveness in key markets.
Furthermore, the comprehensive nature of EPAs created an opportunity for Japan to pursue
objectives that had made little progress in the Doha Round.
39.
The authorities regarded the outcome of the WTO Ministerial in Cancun as
reflecting a deep-seated lack of consensus—principally on agriculture and the so-called
Singapore Issues. The mission suggested that Japan, along with other major industrialized
countries, should play a leadership role in reinvigorating the Round. It also reiterated
concerns that Japan’s continued high

The mission welcomed the expanded product coverage for tariff- and quota-free
imports from least developed countries (LDCs) under Japan’s Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP). It emphasized the importance of further lowering barriers to LDC
exports, as Japan’s imports from LDCs in 2003 accounted for only about 0.5 percent of its
total import bill. The mission noted that expanded LDC trade opportunities will be critical for
contributing to the Millennium Development Goals.

Japan ranks high among OECD countries in terms of the ratio of producer support to farm
output. Also, domestic producer prices in Japan are on average more than twice world
agricultural market prices.

The authorities were reviewing the methodology for compiling national-accounts
statistics and were considering a shift to a chain-weighted methodology to improve the
accuracy of the associated price and volume measures. The mission welcomed the aim to
improve the national accounts statistics and noted the authorities’ intention to conduct a data
ROSC starting in mid-2005.
42.
A fiscal ROSC update completed in June 2004 welcomed the progress achieved
in improving transparency and identified areas where further efforts were needed.17
Consistent with the original ROSC’s recommendations, reforms of the Fiscal Investment and
Loan Program (FILP) initiated in 2001 significantly reduced its size, the government has
announced a medium term fiscal target to indicate the desired direction of fiscal policy, and
the use of supplementary budgets has been minimized. Further efforts could be directed at
providing timely information on the consolidated general government balance, better
integrating the medium term framework with the budget process, and analyzing the financial
implications of the FILP program.
43.
An AML/CFT ROSC completed in June 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/187)
noted that important progress has been made towards achieving a high level of compliance
with the FATF Recommendations and that a comprehensive legal and institutional
framework is in place. Some weaknesses, however, were noted in international cooperation
and in staffing resources for financial supervision (including of Japan Post) and for the
financial intelligence unit.
44.
The authorities noted that, notwithstanding a cut in ODA, Japan remained the
second largest provider of such assistance. Also, Japan’s ODA was becoming more
focused, targeted and prioritized, with a view to promoting infrastructure development in
Asia and Africa. The mission observed that Japan’s ODA was currently equivalent to
0.2 percent of GNI, virtually the same as the weighted average in G-7 countries, and
encouraged the authorities to raise ODA closer towards the UN target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
The economic recovery, in tandem with policy measures, has fostered progress
in dealing with Japan’s longstanding economic problems. Deflationary pressures have
eased, against the backdrop of a narrowing output gap and supportive monetary policy; and
financial and corporate sector restructuring have continued, encouraged by enhancements to
bank regulation and the framework for corporate revitalization. This progress bodes well for
a continued expansion in the near term, although there remain risks to the outlook, stemming
mainly from the external environment.
46.
Looking ahead, decisively resolving remaining problems would help to sustain
the expansion over the medium term. Existing corporate and financial sector weaknesses
and the high and rising public debt are apt to pose vulnerabilities and restrain growth over the
medium term if not fully addressed. Accordingly, policies should aim to encourage continued
17

The authorities have consented to publication of the fiscal ROSC update.

- 22 and broader restructuring in the corporate and financial sectors, stabilize the public debt over
the medium term, and in addition unlock Japan’s untapped economic potential through
structural reforms. These steps would mainly involve building on the administration’s current
policy program.
47.
The current monetary policy stance and strategy are appropriate for the present
deflationary environment and should be maintained until inflation is firmly positive.
Recent increases in the current-account target and steps to spell out necessary conditions for
ending the quantitative easing framework have usefully clarified and demonstrated the
commitment to maintain zero-short term interest rates until deflation ends. While liquidity is
now ample, further increases in the current account target could be considered, if needed, as a
way of further signaling to markets the commitment to maintain the quantitative easing
framework as long as necessary. Also, with exchange rate risks now more balanced, largescale currency market interventions by the authorities no longer seem necessary to prevent an
undue tightening of monetary conditions. However, such interventions could be used if
significant upward pressures on the yen reemerged, to the extent that they threatened to stall
the recovery and heighten deflationary pressures.
48.
As the onset of inflation draws nearer, enhancements to the BoJ’s
communications strategy could help to stabilize inflation expectations. This could
include quantifying the BoJ’s inflation objective, although to mitigate reputational risks and
afford flexibility such an objective should be clearly specified as a desirable medium-term
inflation rate rather than a binding target to be reached in a fixed period. Also, the BoJ could
publish more details of its views on monetary policy and the inflation outlook.
49.
In the financial sector, the economic recovery and strengthened regulation have
fostered progress in resolving balance-sheet problems. Thanks in part to the Program for
Financial Revival, major banks have reduced NPLs and DTAs and are on track to attain the
NPL ratio target of about 4 percent by end-March 2005. Also, there are no signs of strain in
the run-up to the cutback in deposit insurance coverage, and it would be desirable to reduce
deposit insurance coverage on April 1, 2005 as currently planned. However, weaknesses
remain that are apt to restrain growth over the medium term if not addressed: one major bank
is very weak, regional banks have made less progress in reducing NPLs, core profits remain
low, and DTAs are still a significant share of regulatory capital.
50.
Expanded bank reforms could build on this progress to put banks in a better
position to lend and thus to help support the recovery. Building on policy efforts to date,
which have played a key role in pushing banks to address their difficulties, would help to
ensure continued and broader progress in resolving the banking system’s problems. For
major banks, measures to further improve recognition of and provisioning for problem loans,
strengthen bank capital, and bolster bank governance would be key. For the regional banks,
measures similar to those that have worked well for major banks would encourage them to
catch up in reducing NPLs, and holding them to the same rigorous minimum capital standard
as major banks would ensure that they are equally strong. However, these steps for regional
banks should be introduced gradually over time, in light of the weaknesses among these
banks and regional economies. Also, the new capital injection facility could be used, with
appropriate conditionality, to facilitate consolidation among the numerous regional

- 23 institutions. For all banks, implementing soon plans to scale back government financial
institutions in areas where they compete with private institutions would enhance the
environment for profitability.
51.
A strengthened banking system would also facilitate additional corporate
restructuring, because banks would be more easily able to take the losses involved in
restructuring weak borrowers. Revisions to the Commercial Code to ensure that outside
directors are fully independent from corporate management could improve incentives for
corporations to restructure. Also, the IRCJ can appropriately continue to facilitate marketbased restructuring, particularly in cases where it has an advantage in coordinating creditors.
52.
The staff shares the authorities’ concern about the fiscal situation. Public debt is
already at very high levels, and population aging will pose major fiscal challenges over the
medium term. In this connection, staff regards the official goal to achieve a primary surplus
(excluding social security) by the early 2010s and the recent adoption of public pension
reforms as steps in the right direction. In light of the need to begin fiscal consolidation and
the favorable economic environment, achieving savings in FY2004 relative to the budget
would be desirable. In particular, it would be useful to explore the scope for expenditure
savings this year, which (together with any stronger than expected revenues) should be used
to reduce the deficit.
53.
In the medium term, a sizeable adjustment will be needed to stabilize the debt
even at a very high level. Staff considers that options for consolidation could include further
social security reforms (in addition to the recently adopted pension measures, reforms of the
medical and long-term care elements), further cutting capital spending and broadening the
personal income tax base, and (in the medium term) raising the consumption tax. Early
consolidation steps could bolster the credibility of the government’s medium-term fiscal plan
and thereby reduce the risk of a harmful rise in real interest rates. Credibility could also be
enhanced by adopting a specific medium term primary surplus target and explicit measures to
achieve it, although this more specific plan would need due flexibility to adapt to short term
economic fluctuations.
54.
Accelerating the government’s structural reform program would raise potential
growth. Front-loaded regulatory reforms, measures to strengthen competition policy and
further increase labor market flexibility, and public enterprise reforms would help to unlock
Japan’s economic potential. In view of rapid population aging, such steps would be key for
enhancing Japan’s economic prospects in coming years.
55.
On trade policy, market opening under the preliminary EPA between Japan and
Mexico is welcome but multilateral liberalization under the WTO framework should remain
the centerpiece of Japan’s trade policy regime. In this context, it will be crucial for the
authorities to work with other industrial countries to ensure achievement of the Doha
Round’s development objectives; flexibility on agriculture will be essential in this regard. In
this connection, the high level of agricultural support remains a concern, and more costeffective and less distortionary means of addressing non-trade concerns might be sought.
However, the expansion of coverage for LDC exports under Japan’s generalized system of

- 24 preferences in 2003 is commendable, and the authorities should work to make further
progress in this area.
56.
The review of the national accounts methodology is welcome. The staff
encourages the authorities to make needed improvements to the national accounts data and
notes the intention to conduct a data ROSC starting in mid-2005. Also, reducing the
publications lag for fiscal statistics would ease analysis in this critically important area.
57.
The staff encourages the authorities to raise ODA toward the UN target of
0.7 percent of GNI. ODA is presently about the same as the average in G-7 countries.
58.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Japan maintains a floating exchange rate regime. The exchange system is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the
exceptions of restrictions maintained against Taliban, Al-Qaida, and other terrorists, pursuant
to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267, 1333, 1390 and 1373. These restrictions were
notified to the Fund (EBD/02/52) in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144–
(52/51). Japan also maintains exchange restrictions against the former Iraqi regime that have
not yet been notified to and approved by the Fund under the procedures of Decision 144–
(52/51).
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:

The 2003 Article IV Consultation discussions were held during May 22–June 4, 2003; the
Executive Board discussed the Staff Report (IMF Country Report No. 03/281) and concluded
the consultation on August 20, 2003. Executive Directors welcomed recent signs of
improvement in the economic situation and outlook, and the progress in tackling the major
economic challenges facing Japan. Nevertheless, Directors stressed that serious and
interrelated problems remained, and agreed that a more comprehensive and integrated policy
approach was needed to revitalize the corporate and financial sectors, tackle deflation, and
address fiscal imbalances. The staff report, staff statement, FSSA and PIN were all published.

ANNEX II

JAPAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Japan subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on July 3, 1996
and met the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data and for
dissemination of advance release calendars on June 9, 2000. Economic and financial data
provided to the Fund are considered adequate for surveillance purposes.
2.

National accounts

•

The Japanese National Accounts were revised in 2000 by the Economic and Social
Research Institute (ESRI) to reflect the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993
SNA). The data revision involved, among other things, the inclusion of spending on
computer software in investment expenditure and depreciation on social capital in
government consumption, and revision of the benchmark year to 1995. Improved
seasonal adjustment methods were also introduced to take account of leap year and
other shift factors. The data revisions, from 1980 onwards, are described in ESRI’s
publication System of National Accounts 1993 in Japan (April 2001).

•

Preliminary estimates of Japan’s quarterly GDP data are released by the ESRI.
Starting with data from the second quarter of 2002, it introduced a new method that
combines supply and demand side indicators to improve the accuracy of the
estimates. In particular, additional supply side indicators are combined with the
previously-used demand side indicators, which reduces the statistical discrepancy
between estimates of GDP measured from the production and expenditure sides.
ESRI also now releases the estimate about 1½ months after the end of the quarter,
approximately a month earlier than before. At the same time, more frequent backward
revisions and concurrent seasonal adjustment methods were introduced. More
complete annual national accounts data are only available with a lag of nine months.

•

The Bank of Japan (BoJ) revised its Wholesale Price Index (WPI) by updating the
base year from 1995 to 2000, changing commodities released as index series, and
increasing the number of sample prices for the index compilation. It also changed the
name of the index from the WPI to the Corporate Goods Price Index (CGPI) to better
reflect its characteristics.

•

The industrial production series was improved in April 2003. The base year was
updated from 1995 to 2000, with corresponding updates to components weights, and
seasonal adjustment factors. One effect of these revisions is to increase the weight on
the electrical machinery sector. In addition, revised seasonal adjustments may smooth
the recent history of the series.

•

In November 2002, methods for estimating pension fund output were improved, and
part of expenditure on mobile telecommunication devices was reclassified to
consumption because of wider dissemination of mobile phones to the public. These
changes as well as other less significant changes were incorporated in National
Income Accounts data back to 1980.

- 37 -

ANNEX II

•

The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) has been subject to volatility,
particularly in “lumpy” expenditure items such as consumer durables. Some steps
were taken in January 2002 to improve the quality of the data, including a modest
expansion of the sample size to about 9,000 households and reclassification of survey
items to better reflect expenditures on IT products. In addition, a new survey on
durable goods expenditures, covering about 30,000 households, was introduced in
October 2001.

•

The GDP data on some key components of demand are available only with the release
of the annual data, including the breakdown of trade flows into goods and services, of
business investment into structures and equipment, and of private consumption into
durables and nondurables.

•

Preliminary estimates for the income side of the national accounts (with the exception
of compensation of employees) are not provided, in part because estimates for profits
are based on an imputed quarterly pattern for annual data.

•

The ESRI relies on other agencies and organizations to compile the underlying source
data used to construct the national accounts, and coordinates with data providers on
issues such as the design of surveys and administrative collections to serve national
accounts purposes.

•

The GDP deflator and corresponding volume series are re-based every five years. The
current base year is 1995.

3.

Fiscal

•

Fiscal accounts distinguish between general (or ordinary) accounts for core
government functions, and special accounts, some of which are partly financed
through borrowing from the Fiscal Loan Fund which is the main part of the Fiscal
Investment and Loan Program (FILP). Information on the central government general
account is readily available, but published consolidated accounts—which incorporate
special accounts—are insufficient to calculate a consolidated deficit.

•

There exist more than 3,000 independent prefectures and municipalities, the finances
of which are consolidated with a delay of about one year.

•

Data on general government operations—including disaggregation by major
government sector—are available with the release of the annual national accounts
data.

•

The government has published its annual balance sheet since October 2000. Estimates
from FY1998 to FY2001 are now available. However, the relationship with the
national accounts flow data is unclear because the balance sheet consolidates the
FILP whereas flow data do not.

- 38 -

ANNEX II

•

The authorities have not reported fiscal data for publication in the GFS Yearbook
since 1994, and STA attempts to initiate reporting have been unsuccessful. As a
result, the Japan country page has been dropped from the 2003 GFS Yearbook. No
fiscal data are reported for publication in IFS.

4.

External sector

•

Monthly data on merchandise trade and the balance of payments are released on a
timely basis.

•

In the financial account of the balance of payments, the proceeds from the sale of
loans during 1997–2000 may be overstated because the sales were not recorded at
market prices. The BoJ recorded the corresponding large debit entries as capital
transfers in the capital account.

5.

Monetary and financial sector

•

Banking sector data are disseminated 6–8 business days after the end of the reference
month for money stocks and total credit. However, banking sector data on the
external position, as well as on the breakdown of credit to government and to the
private sector, are usually disseminated (as “The Monetary Survey” in the BoJ’s
Financial and Economic Statistics Monthly) 6–7 weeks after the end of the reference
month. As only data on money stocks and total credit meet the one-month SDDS
timeliness requirement for Analytical Accounts of the Banking sector (AAB), Japan
is using a timeliness flexibility option for the other components of AAB on the
grounds that they have an extensive branch banking system.

6.

Recommendations for data improvements

In the short term, there is need to:
•

improve the timeliness and periodicity of the fiscal data (particularly given the
importance of monitoring fiscal consolidation efforts on a comprehensive basis); and

Over the longer term, efforts should be directed to:
•

moving data production (other than monetary and financial statistics) to a single,
independent agency staffed with professional statisticians.

•

providing greater detail on the quarterly components of national accounts.

ANNEX III

JAPAN—PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
1.
This annex analyzes public debt sustainability in Japan, centered on a baseline
scenario broadly based on publicly announced medium term fiscal goals.1 The
authorities aim to move from a primary deficit to a primary surplus in the accounts of the
general government excluding social security by the early 2010s. For the purpose of this
analysis, it is assumed that a primary balance of zero is achieved by 2013 through tax
increases and capital expenditure reductions. Projections for the social security system
incorporate the favorable impact of the 2004 pension reform, but nonetheless show rising
deficits owing to rapidly increasing medical costs (health care contribution rates are assumed
to remain fixed). These assumptions are consistent with a reduction in the overall primary
deficit to about 3 percent by 2009.
2.
Under this scenario, the public debt will grow rapidly over the next 5 years. By
2009, net debt will reach 106 percent of GDP (compared to 80 percent of GDP at end-2003).2
Debt would accumulate even more rapidly than projected if the government needs to meet
any contingent liabilities such as bank recapitalization or default on guaranteed loans.
Standard stress tests illustrate the sensitivity of this projection to different shocks (see the
attached table for the full sustainability template).
3.
Stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio would require substantial consolidation
beyond that considered in the baseline. For example, stabilizing net debt at 110 percent of
GDP by 2013 (consistent with the government’s medium term horizon) would require
achieving a general government primary surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP.3 Reaching that
surplus requires an adjustment of 6.3 percent of GDP in the overall primary balance
(6.9 percent of GDP in the primary balance excluding social security), compared with an
adjustment of 3.6 percent in the baseline. The resulting ratio of net debt to GDP would be
very high by international standards and further consolidation may be desirable to reduce it.
4.
There is an urgent need to address the fiscal challenges related to rapid
population aging and high public indebtedness. Consolidation at the local and central
government levels would require significant efforts to control expenditure and increase
revenue. The adjustment in social security should involve a reform of the health care system
to address rapidly rising costs. The size of the needed adjustment underscores the importance
of limiting reliance on revenue measures in further reforms of the social security system as
the tax burden is already bound to increase significantly in the next two decades.
1

The paths for real GDP growth, GDP deflator growth, and real interest rates are consistent
with the current WEO projections.
2

Staff analysis of fiscal trends over 2003–2050 suggests that the accumulation of public debt
is unsustainable in the long run as well unless substantial adjustments are implemented (see
Chapter IV, Japan: Selected Issues, IMF Country Report 03/282, September 2003).
3

This estimation assumes a real potential GDP growth of 1.7 percent and long-term real
interest rate of 3 percent beyond 2009.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JAPAN
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Daniel Citrin and John Hicklin
July 23, 2004
1.
This supplement provides an update on economic, political, and financial market
developments since the release of the staff report (7/7/04). The thrust of the staff appraisal
remains unchanged.
2.
Recent indicators suggest that the economic recovery continues apace. During the
second quarter, the Tankan index of business conditions rose to its highest level in a decade,
adding to indications that the current recovery is the strongest of the post-bubble era.
Machinery orders have been on a solid uptrend, implying continued strength in private
investment. While data on consumer demand are highly volatile, the balance of recent
indicators point to further growth in private consumption. In particular, during May
household spending rose 5.6 percent (y/y), and the unemployment rate fell further to
4.6 percent. Also, Tankan survey data indicate a further easing of deflationary pressures,
although consumer price inflation remains slightly negative.
3.
Given the recent data, the near-term risks to the outlook may be tilted to the
upside, in particular with regard to business fixed investment and private consumption.
Consistent with both the most recent indicators as well as data for the period since late 2003,
the government has raised its forecast for FY2004 GDP growth to 3.5 percent up from
1.8 percent (released in January). In addition, a number of private-sector forecasters have
been revising upwards their projections. The July consensus forecast for CY2004 is
4.2 percent, which is slightly below staff’s forecast of 4.5 percent. The staff will review its
forecast of annual growth for 2004 following the release of second quarter national accounts
data in August.
4.
In the July 11 upper house elections, the ruling coalition retained a majority. The
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner the New Komeito Party now hold a
combined 139 seats (of 242), the same as before the elections. The leading opposition
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) gained a significant number of seats at the expense of other,
smaller opposition parties, and now holds 82 seats, up from 70 previously. (Half of the seats

-2in the upper house are contested every three years.) The ruling coalition also controls the
majority in the lower house.
5.
Following the elections, the discussion of pension reforms has regained
momentum. The DPJ has called for the repeal of the pension reform act, but the government
has stated that it plans to implement it as scheduled.1 The ruling coalition has, however,
proposed to hold discussions with the DPJ on future pension reforms. Also, the government
plans to establish a council—including business and labor representatives—to consider more
fundamental reforms to the overall social security system of pensions, medical care, and
long-term care.
6.
On July 14, two major banks announced plans to merge and form the largest
bank in the world. The merger would combine Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG),
which has the lowest ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans among the major
banks, with UFJ, which has a much higher ratio. Observers suggest that while the operational
aspects of the merger could be complex and time-consuming, a successful strengthening of
the merged bank’s management culture and the realization of synergies across business lines
would yield a strong and profitable bank. In addition, MTFG’s strong capital position could
allow UFJ to write off NPLs more quickly. Financial markets reacted favorably to the news,
with bank stocks rising after the announcement.

As noted in the staff report, the pension reform act passed in June stipulates a rise in
premiums from 13.58 percent this year to 18.30 percent in 2017; this would entail annual
premium increases of about 1/3 of a percentage point.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Japan
On July 28, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Japan.1
Background
There are clear indications that Japan’s longstanding economic problems have eased.
Growth is rebounding, deflation is diminishing, and progress is being made in addressing
corporate and financial sector problems. Looking ahead, near term growth prospects are
favorable, although weaknesses remain that could restrain growth over the medium term.
Japan’s economic recovery continued in 2003 and into the first part of 2004. For 2003, GDP
growth reached 2½ percent, double the mid-year consensus forecast, and continued at about
6 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2004. The recovery was initially driven by
business fixed investment and net exports, with the current account surplus widening to
3¼ percent of GDP. More recently, private consumption also contributed as labor market
conditions improved. Following steady declines since 2001, employment, the labor force, and
compensation stabilized, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in May, from the
record high of 5½ percent reached in early 2003. Meanwhile, deflationary pressures have
eased; core CPI deflation (excluding fresh food) narrowed, in part reflecting temporary factors,
but the GDP deflator continued to decline at a pace of about 2½ percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Monetary policy has maintained short term interest rates at zero under the Bank of Japan’s
(BoJ’s) quantitative easing framework. Increases in the BoJ’s target for current account
balances have also supported base money growth and promoted financial stability by ensuring
banks access to ample funding. Recent steps to clarify the monetary framework—by
announcing that quantitative easing will be maintained at least until core CPI growth is
nonnegative for a few months and positive inflation is expected—have helped reassure markets
that short-term interest rates will be kept at zero as long as deflation persists.
During 2003 and early 2004, the yen came under periodic pressure to strengthen against the
dollar, as markets focused on global current account imbalances. This pressure prompted the
authorities to intervene in record levels to avoid an undue tightening of monetary conditions,
with total intervention amounting to ¥20 trillion in 2003, and a further ¥15 trillion in the first
quarter of 2004. Both upward pressure on the yen and intervention have since ceased.
Since June 2003, the yen/dollar rate has appreciated by about 9 percent, but with the yen’s
appreciation against the euro more modest, on a multilateral basis the yen has appreciated only
moderately in nominal and real effective terms.
The government recorded another large fiscal deficit in FY2003—7.9 percent of GDP—slightly
lower than the previous year. On a structural basis (including social security but excluding bank
support), the fiscal stance was around 6½ percent of GDP, unchanged from the previous year.
Sustained fiscal deficits have fed a rapid increase in public debt, estimated to stand at
166 percent of GDP on a gross basis (80 percent on a net basis) at end-2003, by far the highest
among advanced economies.
The financial condition of the banking system improved in FY2003, particularly among major
banks, but some weaknesses persist and regional banks have lagged behind. Nonperforming
loans at major banks declined to about 5 percent of loans, in line with the authorities’ target to
reduce the ratio to about 4 percent by end-FY2004. Major banks also increased their profits and
capital adequacy ratios, aided in part by the economic recovery and gains on their equity
holdings. However, core profits and the quality of capital remained weak, and regional banks
(which account for 40 percent of bank lending) made less headway in reducing nonperforming
loans and strengthening their capital bases.
In the corporate sector, restructuring activity has expanded from large export-oriented
manufacturers to include small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and nonmanufacturers.
Although debt levels remain high, profit indicators have improved, driven at first by labor cost
reductions and strong external demand, and more recently by buoyant sales. The improvement
in corporate profits has contributed to a rebound in stock prices, with the Nikkei Index gaining
about 50 percent and ten-year JGB yields rising about 130 basis points to 1.8 percent since the
lows achieved in 2003.
The near-term economic outlook has improved over the past year. As the economic recovery
broadens further, real GDP is projected to expand by 4½ percent in 2004 and 2½ percent in
2005, with CPI deflation ebbing to zero by the end of this period. However, this outlook could be
threatened by external factors, including a potential sharp rise in global interest rates or a
slowdown in key trading partners. Beyond the near term, growth is envisaged to slow to around

-3potential, estimated by staff at around 1.7 percent per year. However, additional structural
economic reforms and continued progress in financial and corporate sector restructuring could
raise Japan’s economic potential.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed signs that the Japanese economy is emerging from its long period of
slump, with support from a range of policy measures. In particular, the recovery has
strengthened and become more broadly based, while labor market conditions have improved.
Meanwhile, deflationary pressures have eased, against the backdrop of a narrowing output gap
and supportive monetary policy. Also, restructuring has continued in the financial and corporate
sectors, encouraged by enhancements to bank regulation and the framework for corporate
revitalization.
At the same time, Directors noted that financial and corporate sector weaknesses remain, mild
deflation persists, and the public debt is very high, which could restrain growth over the medium
term. In addition, several Directors acknowledged the existence of risks related to the external
environment. Against this background, Directors considered that policies should build on the
existing reform program in order to resolve remaining weaknesses promptly, boost Japan’s
economic potential and thereby sustain the expansion over the longer term. Key priorities
include broader financial and corporate sector restructuring, medium-term fiscal consolidation,
and continued structural reforms.
On monetary policy, Directors welcomed recent steps by the Bank of Japan to clarify and
demonstrate its commitment to counter deflation by maintaining zero interest rates until both
actual and expected inflation rates turned positive. Directors saw the current accommodative
policy stance as appropriate and considered that further increases in the current account
operating target could be used if needed to reinforce the policy commitment. Also, as the end of
deflation draws nearer, enhancements to the Bank of Japan’s communication strategy to
provide a clear signal to markets about the future direction of monetary policy could help
stabilize inflation expectations. While some Directors supported quantification of a medium-term
inflation objective and an eventual shift to inflation targeting, a number of others considered
such an objective premature at this point in time in light of the uncertainty in the monetary policy
transmission mechanism.
Nearly all Directors observed that sizeable past interventions had kept upward pressure on the
yen from resulting in an undue tightening of monetary conditions. With exchange rate risks now
more balanced, such interventions were not seen as desirable. Many Directors considered that
additional intervention could be warranted if significant upward pressures on the yen reemerged
to the extent that they threatened to stall the recovery. Many other Directors, however,
expressed concern that such actions could exacerbate global imbalances, and urged that the
exchange rate be fully market-determined. Some Directors also asked for more analysis of
exchange rate policies in future Article IV reports as called for in the conclusions to the last
review of surveillance.

-4Directors noted that the economic recovery and enhanced financial regulation have fostered
progress in resolving banks’ balance-sheet problems. Major banks have cut nonperforming
loans (NPLs) and are on track to attain the target of reducing NPLs as a share of loans to about
4 percent by end-March 2005. At the same time, deferred tax assets have fallen as a share of
regulatory capital. In light of the progress in strengthening the banking system, Directors
welcomed the planned reduction in deposit insurance coverage by the end of the fiscal year.
Nevertheless, weaknesses remain in the banking system, as reflected in low core profits and
less progress in restructuring by regional banks. Directors thus welcomed the authorities’
commitment to press ahead with bank reforms, and encouraged the authorities to expand on
existing reforms to expeditiously resolve these weaknesses so that lending growth could
resume and help support the recovery. For major banks, measures to improve further the
recognition of, and provisioning for, problem loans, to strengthen bank capital, and to bolster
bank governance would be key. Also, to improve prospects for bank profitability, competition of
government financial institutions with private institutions should be scaled back. Regarding
regional banks, Directors observed that measures similar to those employed for major banks
could encourage more rapid restructuring. Also, the new capital injection facility could be used,
with appropriate conditionality, to facilitate consolidation among regional banks.
Directors commended the Japanese authorities’ high level of compliance with international
standards to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, and encouraged them to
address the remaining weaknesses identified.
Directors welcomed the notable headway in corporate restructuring, but also noted that
corporate debt remains high and aggregate returns on assets are still low by historical
standards. They considered that strengthening the banking system would facilitate additional
corporate restructuring, and they agreed that the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan
could continue to coordinate creditors and facilitate market-based restructuring.
Regarding fiscal policy, Directors welcomed the authorities’ strategy for achieving medium-term
consolidation. They noted that the better-than-anticipated economic environment could facilitate
an early start toward the authorities’ goal to reach a primary surplus early in the next decade.
In particular, it would be desirable to achieve savings relative to the budget in fiscal year 2004,
if the recovery remains robust, by saving any stronger-than-expected revenues and seeking
expenditure reductions.
Directors observed that a substantial medium-term fiscal adjustment will be needed to put the
public debt on a sustainable trajectory. Accordingly, they welcomed the recently adopted
pension reforms, while noting that further social security reforms will be needed in the medical
and long-term care systems. In addition, most Directors saw scope to broaden the personal
income tax base, increase the consumption tax rate over time, and further reduce public
investment. Many Directors also considered that the credibility of the medium-term
consolidation plan could be strengthened by defining a more specific goal for the primary
balance and supporting measures to achieve it, while retaining due flexibility to adapt to
short-term economic fluctuations. Some Directors called for further reform of local finances,
including a reduction in transfers from the central government and greater tax autonomy,

-5to encourage a more efficient allocation of resources and help improve the fiscal position at the
subnational level.
Directors noted that Japan has embarked on a broad-based program of structural reforms.
They considered that accelerated implementation of the reform program would help to raise
Japan’s long-term economic potential. In particular, front-loaded measures to improve labor
market flexibility, relax business regulation and strengthen competition policy, and reform public
enterprises could foster a more rapid and efficient reallocation of economic resources and
thereby bolster medium-term productivity and growth.
On trade policy, Directors viewed the Japan-Mexico Economic Partnership Agreement as a step
forward in further opening Japan's market, but stressed that multilateral liberalization should
remain the centerpiece of Japan’s trade policy regime. In this connection, they encouraged
Japan to work with other major industrial countries towards implementation of the Doha Round’s
development objectives, especially in agriculture. Directors welcomed the expansion of
coverage for LDC exports under Japan’s generalized system of preferences, and encouraged
the authorities to take additional steps in that direction.
Directors noted that Japan’s official development assistance (ODA) was presently about the
same as the G-7 average in percent of GNI. While recognizing that Japan remained the second
largest provider of such assistance, they encouraged the authorities to raise ODA toward the
UN target of 0.7 percent of GNI.
Directors welcomed the review of the methodology for compiling national accounts statistics,
which aims at improving the accuracy of price and volume measures. Also, they noted the
authorities’ intention to conduct a data ROSC starting in mid-2005.
