STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 8, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The authorities continue to make progress on their far-reaching political and
economic reform program. Key economic reform priorities are being realized. However,
macroeconomic and financial risks are building, and capacity constraints are slowing
institutional reform. Constitutional amendments are being considered ahead of the 2015
elections, and peace negotiations are continuing despite religious and ethnic tensions.
Macroeconomic situation and outlook: Growth is accelerating, with average growth
projected around 8¼ percent in the next few years, and inflation should remain broadly
stable. After depreciating in 2013, the exchange rate has stabilized. The external current
account has widened despite improved export performance but rising capital account
inflows should enable Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM)’s international reserves to grow
rapidly from their current low levels. Monetary aggregates are growing at double-digit
rates. The underlying fiscal deficit in 2013/14 is estimated at 3 percent of GDP and is
forecast to widen to around 5½ percent of GDP in 2014/15, but should decline below
5 percent of GDP in the medium term. However, off budget operations could increase
the deficit. Risks also arise from capacity constraints and thin fiscal and external buffers.
Medium- and long-term prospects: Economic prospects remain strong. Myanmar’s
long-run growth potential is estimated at around 7 percent, in line with peer countries’
experience, but sound institutional and policy frameworks need to be built to realize this.
Key policy recommendations: Macroeconomic policy challenges are likely to intensify
in the short term. Monetary policy tools need to be more aggressively deployed, and
mechanisms established to transfer public sector foreign exchange earnings
automatically to the CBM. The regulatory framework for the banking sector needs to be
urgently upgraded and supervision strengthened, particularly as foreign banks will soon
enter. Tax policy and administration should aim at simplifying the system and preparing
for the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT).
Technical assistance (TA): Capacity building will be crucial to achieve policy objectives.
The IMF continues to provide intensive TA in key areas, including in a wide range of CBM
operations, tax policy and administration, public financial management and statistics.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Myanmar continues to make a rapid economic transition, but the challenges remain
daunting. The authorities’ reform program focuses on opening up the economy to spur inclusive
growth. Initial reforms focused on the liberalization of the foreign exchange, trade and foreign
investment regimes, and special economic zones (SEZs) are being established. This is beginning to
attract foreign investment in the telecommunications, infrastructure, financial, and manufacturing
sectors. However, there is a long way to go before modern institutions are established and the
authorities’ capacity is being strained as they implement numerous reforms simultaneously.
2.
Continued progress in political reforms ahead of the 2015 elections would support
gains made in opening the economy. Constitutional changes are being considered and the
opposition is campaigning for amendments to enable Aung San Suu Kyi to run for the presidency
and reduce the military’s effective veto over constitutional changes. Nationwide peace negotiations
have recently made significant progress. Religious frictions, however, continue, and dominate
domestic and international attention. Provisional results of the 2014 Census, the first for over
30 years, indicate a population of 51.4 million, considerably lower than previously estimated.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
Growth is accelerating and the external balance remains stable. Output growth is
estimated to have risen to 8¼ percent in 2013/14, driven by construction, manufacturing and
services, and supported by agriculture. Inflation has broadly stabilized, and stood at 6 percent (y/y)
in May 2014. The current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 5½ percent of GDP in
2013/14, but to have been more than financed by foreign direct investment (FDI), new loans, and
inflows related to telecommunications licenses. After depreciating in 2013, the exchange rate has
stabilized. International reserves held by the CBM increased to US$4.5 billion by end-March,
covering nearly 3 months of prospective imports. While the base remains low, broad money and
private sector credit continue to grow rapidly at 32 and 58 percent (y/y) respectively in February.
Reserve money growth, in contrast, decelerated sharply to 14 percent (y/y). The underlying fiscal
deficit, which excludes one-off revenues from telecommunications licenses, is estimated to have
declined to 3 percent of GDP in 2013/14, due largely to improved performance of state economic
enterprises (SEEs). The headline deficit is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP.1

A. Outlook and Risks
Staff Views
4.
The economic outlook is favorable. Growth is expected to average 8¼ percent in the next
few years, led by rising gas production and investment, though there is considerable uncertainty
given data constraints. With the effects from wage and electricity price increases gradually
dissipating and with stable global commodity prices, inflation is expected to remain under control at
around 6 percent over the medium term. The current account deficit is projected to remain elevated
as FDI-related imports are balanced by rising exports and transfers. However, the CBM’s
international reserves are forecast to continue to increase rapidly as foreign inflows intensify.
Reserve money growth is projected to remain contained provided CBM undertakes significant
sterilization operations while broad money and credit to the economy will continue to expand at
double-digit rates. With transfers from the Union Government to states and regions increasing
significantly, the underlying fiscal deficit is set to widen to around 5½ percent of GDP in 2014/15,
but further one-off revenues should bring the headline deficit to around 4½ percent of GDP. In the
medium term, the underlying fiscal deficit is projected to decline again below 5 percent of GDP as
tax revenues increase gradually as a result of administration reforms. However, spending will need
to be carefully prioritized as large increases in revenues are not expected until the VAT is introduced.
5.
Risks are mainly domestic (Table 7). External and fiscal buffers remain thin, and the
authorities’ capacity to develop and implement policies and absorb technical assistance (TA) is being
stretched. Fiscal strains are building as tax exemptions increase at the same time as expenditure
pressures for both current and capital spending, including due to the forthcoming elections. External
borrowing for off-budget operations is also increasing, raising risks. The entry of foreign banks will
burden nascent supervisory capacity and challenge monetary and exchange rate management,
particularly in the face of continuing demand-side pressures on inflation. On the upside, large oneoff inflows from concession fees for oil and gas exploration could materialize in the near term. The
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that Myanmar, following completion of arrears clearance
with Paris Club creditors, is at low risk of external debt distress (Supplement 1). However, public debt
is expected to remain close to, albeit below, the indicative benchmark.
6.
Long-term prospects remain strong, but require sustained policy and institutional
reforms. In order to achieve rapid and inclusive growth, it is vital to maintain near-term
macroeconomic stability while building sound institutional and policy frameworks to manage the
budget and financial sector. Good progress has been made in implementing previous surveillance
advice in these areas, including under the 2013 Staff Monitored Program. Notable achievements
include establishing an autonomous central bank, unifying exchange rates and maintaining fiscal
control. Capacity constraints have, however, influenced the pace of structural reform and there is still
a long way to go. Policy discussions therefore focused on the key outstanding reforms.
7.
Intensive and well-tailored capacity building will be required to underpin the reforms.
Reflecting this, IMF TA in key areas, notably central banking and statistics, will be further scaled up.
Extensive support has already been provided (see Informational Annex) and has helped the

authorities modernize the CBM, develop a coordination mechanism for international financial sector
support, and establish a large taxpayer office. Key short-term priorities will be building CBM’s
systems and policies, enhance tax policies and systems, strengthen public financial management
(PFM), and improve statistics and macroeconomic analysis.

Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment. They noted that their
growth estimates and projections for 2013/14 and 2014/15 were somewhat higher than staff’s. They
stressed the strong investor interest in special economic zones and noted the importance of
initiatives to improve access to finance in rural areas. They also stressed the critical role of TA
support in macroeconomic management, in particular in transforming the financial sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Background
9.
The exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals but reserves remain low
(Box 1). International reserves have increased substantially in 2013/14, and are projected to rise
further with more large one-off inflows (for the capitalization of foreign bank branches, and the
remainder of telecommunications licensing fees), and a further rise in FDI and loan disbursements.
Nonetheless, they remain well below levels (5–6 months of imports) suggested by reserve adequacy
metrics (see IMF Country Report 13/250).

Box 1. External Assessment
Conventional econometrics-based methods of
exchange rate assessment are hampered by severe
data limitations. Moreover, their utility is significantly
limited by the rapid structural change taking place in
Myanmar. However, other indicators suggest that
the recent depreciation has helped the previously
overvalued kyat move closer toward alignment with
longer-term fundamentals.









The exchange rate depreciated by 15 percent
between April 2012 (when it was floated) and
June 2014, primarily reflecting strong import
demand from the private sector. The
depreciation has narrowed the divergence in
real appreciation rates since 2006 between
Myanmar and its peers.
Export performance has recently improved
markedly, with Myanmar’s share in world
exports growing significantly. This performance
has been driven by natural resources, but other
sectors have also contributed.
Labor costs remain the lowest in the region
which should underpin competitiveness.
However, other costs are rising rapidly,
particularly real estate. This, however, largely
reflects capacity constraints.

Trade; and IMF staff calculations.

The external current account is consistent with countries at similar stages of development and can
be sustainably financed by FDI and aid.

Increases in natural resource revenues, FDI and other inflows are likely to exert upward pressure on the
exchange rate over the medium term. Structural reforms will therefore be crucial for competitiveness.

10.
Inflation has stabilized but pressures remain. After rising to 7.3 percent (y/y) in August
2013, in part driven by the exchange rate depreciation, inflation declined to 6 percent in May, but is
likely to remain at this level due to increases in administered electricity prices and demand
pressures. Real estate prices in urban areas continue to rise while money and credit have continued
to grow strongly. However, financial depth remains low, with credit to the private sector at only
15 percent of GDP.
11.
CBM’s monetization of the fiscal deficit declined further in 2013/14. However, with the
fiscal deficit widening in 2014/15 (Box 2) and CBM’s international reserves projected to rise, there
will be pressures on reserve money. The one-year transition period for the new CBM law ended in
July 2014 giving CBM the budgetary autonomy needed to implement monetary policy effectively.

Box 2. Short-Term Fiscal Outlook
The authorities’ 2014/15 budget envisages a widening of the overall deficit to 6 percent of GDP, while
staff projections are significantly lower. Overall, staff’s revenue projections imply a headline deficit
below 5 percent of GDP, whereas the underlying deficit, which excludes one-off revenues from
remaining inflows from telecommunications licenses, is expected at about 5½ percent of GDP.



The authorities’ tax and SEE revenue forecasts are
conservative even after taking into account losses
from tax policy changes. Union Government
revenues from taxes are projected lower in
nominal terms than the 2013/14 outturn and SEE
receipts are budgeted to shrink by 1 percent of
GDP.



At the same time, nontax revenues from
telecommunication licenses will be lower than
budgeted. The budget includes about
US$1.2 billion (2 percent of GDP) in nontax
1/ Excludes one-off proceeds from sales of telecommunications licenses
awarded in June 2013
revenues from telecommunications licenses.
However, US$750 million of these were received in 2013/14 after the budget was passed, and only
about US$375 million are expected to materialize in 2014/15.



Staff’s revenue projection takes into account the changed pattern of telecommunications license
receipts, as well as a likely negative net revenue impact of the changes in the 2014 taxation bill.
Nonetheless, tax revenue and SEE receipts are expected to perform broadly in line with 2013/14
outcomes, which saw higher than budgeted SEE receipts and tax revenue.



The budget envisages a further increase in transfers from the Union to sub-national governments,
reflecting the political commitment to fiscal decentralization. While this is accompanied by some
transfer of government functions, it is nonetheless expected to lead to a net increase in
expenditure, in part because the basis for determining transfers is not yet clearly defined. The
budget also increases civil servants’ salaries by kyat 20,000 (US$20) per month, with proportional
increases in allowances and pensions, leading to a rise in spending by around 0.4 percent of GDP.
Spending on health and education as a share of GDP is budgeted to remain broadly stable, while
defense spending is expected to decline to 3.7 percent of GDP, from 3.9 percent last year.

With spending pressure related to the fiscal decentralization process likely to continue in 2015/16,
keeping the headline deficit within the 5 percent target will require continued good performance of
SEEs and tax proceeds. At the same time, careful expenditure prioritization will be required to allow a
resumption of growth in social expenditures and capital investment.

Staff Views
12.
Monetary policy will need to be more active in 2014/15. Substantial sterilization will be
required to keep reserve money and inflation under control. Credit growth will also need to be kept
in check to avoid fuelling demand and creating prudential risks. Finally, the forthcoming entry of
foreign banks could impose further demands on monetary policy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MYANMAR



Monetary policy tools need to be more aggressively deployed. Good progress has been made in
liquidity forecasting, deposit auctions have been held regularly, if generally at low volumes, and
the authorities have adopted reserve money targets. However, further steps are needed to use
reserve money targeting effectively. Key steps are reform of reserve requirements in line with
previous IMF advice; and utilization of budgetary autonomy to increase the scale of monetary
operations to meet the greater sterilization requirements. Furthermore, the excess liquidity at
the Myanma Economic Bank (MEB) will need to be absorbed to make deposit auctions effective
in establishing and influencing realistic market interest rates, and to allow development of an
interbank money market. In the meantime, direct control of interest rates should be retained.



Deficit monetization should be scaled back more rapidly to reduce money creation and inflationary
pressures. With significant foreign exchange inflows having occurred and more expected, this is
becoming more urgent. The introduction of treasury securities auctions will be key for reducing
CBM’s deficit financing. Other forms of CBM financing of fiscal operations, such as the financing
of the Myanma Agricultural Development Bank (MADB) should also be discontinued.



Budgetary autonomy requires a strong CBM balance sheet. An important element should be
converting old government debt to the CBM into marketable treasury bonds at market interest
rates at a range of maturities. This would provide the CBM with an income stream sufficient to
finance its operational expenses as well as substantial sterilization operations, should they
become necessary. Intensive building of capacity and strengthening of systems will also be
required—particularly in the accounting area.

13.
Expected large inflows of foreign exchange to the public sector present an important
opportunity to bolster the CBM’s international reserves. In this regard, it is imperative to
establish an automatic mechanism for transferring public sector foreign exchange earnings to the
CBM. This would replace the current mechanism of individual ministerial approvals for state-owned
banks’ ad-hoc sales of foreign exchange to CBM. The CBM’s policy of smoothing exchange rate
fluctuations through the foreign exchange auctions remains appropriate. However, the CBM could
use opportunities to acquire foreign exchange in the auctions more aggressively. Furthermore, a
strategy to manage international reserves to maximize the CBM’s returns and safeguard its thin
reserves buffer should be developed.
14.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy of keeping deficits below 5 percent of GDP remains
appropriate to balance Myanmar’s large development needs with supporting macroeconomic
stability and maintaining debt sustainability. Prolonged deficits above this level, particularly if
domestically financed, would run the risk of stoking demand pressures and driving overall public
debt above recommended levels. However, with rising transfers to regions and states, and new
commercial tax exemptions and preferential rates, the underlying fiscal deficit is projected above the
5 percent target for the next two years (Box 2). Even this relies on tax and SEE revenues continuing
to perform stronger than budgeted. If this does not materialize the underlying deficit could increase
beyond 6 percent of GDP. Moreover, off-budget borrowing increases contingent liabilities. Fiscal
policy in 2014/15 therefore needs to focus on strengthening revenue collection while minimizing
CBM financing of the deficit. In preparing the 2015/16 budget, the authorities need to broaden the
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

tax base, re-unify commercial tax rates and carefully prioritize expenditure pressures in order to
maintain a prudent fiscal path. Loan-financed off-budget operations should be strictly limited and
reported to the parliament alongside the budget.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities indicated that setting the framework for the CBM’s operations
following the transition period was a high-priority task.


They explained that they were focused on restructuring the legacy debt owed by the treasury to
the CBM, and formulating the CBM’s budget, and appreciated the IMF’s support in these areas.



The authorities also indicated that reforms to reserve requirements would be implemented soon,
while efforts to improve their liquidity forecasting capacity were ongoing.



They were considering using MEB’s excess liquidity to accelerate the reduction of fiscal deficit
monetization. This would reduce the burden on monetary policy tools in controlling systemwide liquidity, and offer a transition period of relatively low-cost domestic financing.



In advance of the establishment of an automatic mechanism to transfer reserves, transfers of
foreign exchange from state-owned banks to CBM were continuing.



They accorded high priority to developing their statistical and accounting functions, not least as
a precondition for implementing a new payments system. They requested further IMF TA to
support achieving this goal.

16.
The authorities stressed their commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline. They
emphasized recent strong performance, and pointed to ongoing efforts to strengthen debt
management. They also noted that they were building a medium-term fiscal framework to
strengthen planning and were investigating establishing mechanisms for saving windfall revenues.
The authorities agreed in particular that broadening the tax base and limiting exemptions were
important, but pointed to the parliament’s legislative authority.

B. Sustaining Rapid and Inclusive Growth
Background
17.
Myanmar’s long-run growth potential is substantial. Regional peers’ experience suggests
that, with appropriate policies, high growth can be sustained over a relatively long period (Box 3).
The authorities in 2013 introduced their Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR), a longterm strategy for achieving sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty. If its reforms are
implemented well, achieving average growth of around 7 percent over the next 20 years is within
reach. Regional integration could also help, including through the establishment of the ASEAN
Economic Community which could help Myanmar become integrated in regional supply chains and
promote inward investment. However, the emergence of Myanmar’s economy—with over

retail and wholesale trade, all facilitate business
activities, and yield synergies for robust economic
growth. Agriculture will grow at a slower pace, though it will continue to provide an important source
of employment in rural areas. In Myanmar, further discoveries of natural resource deposits could add
to growth prospects.
While the agricultural labor force is expected to gradually decline, economic transformation will likely
raise employment in industry and services. In China, urbanization and internal migration raised the
growth rate of the urban population to 4.4 percent a year on average during 1982–2002, compared to
1.2 percent growth in the total population during the same period. In Myanmar, the United Nations
project a decline in population growth from 1 percent in 2014 to ¼ percent by 2033. This will require
more rapid shifts in employment to sectors with high productivity growth which result in rapid
urbanization.

50 million inhabitants, and a GDP of about US$65 billion—could raise competitive pressures for
some other Asian low-income countries (LICs) for markets and FDI, especially in the garment sector,
which has served as an entry point for many economies into the global production chain, as well as
in tourism.
18.
The FESR appropriately focuses on poverty reduction. Poverty has been declining in
recent years but is still high, at around 26 percent. However, recent World Bank research suggests
that the rate may be even higher. Poverty is particularly intense in coastal and hilly regions, where
conflict is also most prevalent. Around a half of the poor rely on agriculture for their livelihood.

Staff Views
19.
Sustaining a broad-based and equitable economic expansion will require continued
structural reforms and further reallocation of public expenditure. Investments in infrastructure,
boosting access to finance, and agricultural reform are critical to spread economic opportunities.
The latter is particularly important for the reduction of poverty in rural areas. A legal and regulatory
framework that is transparently administered and fosters competition is indispensable for
encouraging domestic and international investment. To further accelerate poverty reduction, and
improve productivity, further expansion of education and health services will be needed. Sound

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

macroeconomic management will be vital: long growth spells are often accompanied by a buildup in
vulnerabilities, which need to be carefully managed.
20.
If properly leveraged, Myanmar’s natural gas wealth has the potential to boost growth
and development. Natural gas revenues represent an opportunity to expand public investment
which, if properly planned and executed, can help close infrastructure gaps, and increase
productivity and growth. However, international experience points to the dangers of borrowing
against future revenues to accelerate investment which can lead to absorption capacity constraints
and threaten debt sustainability. To analyze these issues staff applied the DIGNAR model developed
by the IMF Research Department.2 Simulations indicate that future gas revenue streams in Myanmar
should be used to finance a gradual scaling up in public investment while building fiscal space to
help maintain a stable macroeconomic environment. A sound and transparent fiscal regime for
extractive industries, as envisaged by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which
Myanmar has joined, would help better realize the revenue potential of natural gas reserves.
21.
Statistics need to be improved urgently to enable effective economic planning and
management. Weak capacity and data shortcomings are a significant obstacle to economic and
social policymaking and also hamper effective IMF surveillance. The importance of improving
economic statistics is recognized by the prominence it has been given in the authorities’ economic
reform strategy. At the same time, the authorities are seeking technical support from a wide range
of partners, including the IMF.

Authorities’ Views
22.
The authorities agreed that they needed to advance reforms on many fronts. They
pointed to rising public investment, increased electricity generation, and progress in developing
SEZs as important recent achievements. They also reiterated their commitment to preserving
macroeconomic stability, with particular emphasis on containing inflation, which has a
disproportionate effect on the poorer segments of the population. They also stressed the
importance of financial sector development including through mobile telephony.

C. Building and Using Fiscal Space
Background
23.
Fiscal space is limited. Public finances are dependent on SEEs and natural resource
revenues. Tax revenues are very low and the tax base remains narrow, in part due to widespread
exemptions, while social spending needs to rise. Public debt is projected to remain close to the
benchmark over the long term, and breaches it in some scenarios. Recent and planned off-budget

The model explicitly takes into account the impact of scaled-up investment on economic growth and existing
capacity constraints due to low public investment efficiency. Simulations were run around two potential public
investment paths and two alternative gas revenue scenarios. The results of this work were produced in collaboration
with RES staff and presented during the mission to representatives of the Ministry of Finance.

external nonconcessional borrowing and guarantees for policy banks and microfinance pose risks to
debt control and complicate fiscal management. On the other hand, budget constraints could be
eased in the short term if fees for oil and gas exploration materialize.
24.
The 2014/15 taxation bill reduced revenue potential and complicated administration.
While the bill broadened the tax base and streamlined income taxes, numerous exemptions and a
new reduced rate for the commercial tax were introduced, further complicating administration.
Some provisions were instituted to protect domestic industries, which complicates the mandate of
the commercial tax and also makes it more difficult to enforce.
25.
Structural reforms aimed at improving public sector effectiveness could pose shortterm risks to Union government finances. Further increases in transfers to subnational
governments without compensating transfer of functions and effective budget constraints on subnational governments could be a drain on Union government resources. Moreover, reforms that
separate SEEs from the budget could trigger contingent liabilities and would reduce an important
source of funding for the Union Government budget.

Staff Views
26.
Higher revenue is needed to provide a solid foundation for financing development,
including increases in health and education spending. To this end, introducing a VAT as planned
in 2018/19 is a key step. However, the groundwork for this needs to be laid soon. Critical steps,
which should be taken in the 2015 taxation bill, are to (i) reduce exemptions from the commercial
tax to a narrow range of well-defined consumption goods; (ii) unify the commercial tax rate to
facilitate enforcement and compliance; and (iii) reform the taxation of special consumption goods
into a separate excise tax (which will require agreement on apportioning the revenues to states and
regions). In addition, ad-hoc tax exemptions should be strictly controlled. To spur effective tax
administration, the Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) urgently needs to have taxpayers assigned. Unique
taxpayer identification numbers, as well as taxpayer self-assessment also need to be introduced.
27.
Fiscal decentralization and reform of SEE finances need to be carefully planned and
implemented. Both need to take capacity constraints and the short-term impact on Union
government finances into account. With regard to fiscal decentralization, it is important that reforms
take account of lessons learned from international experience (Box 4). In the area of SEE reform, the
degree of financial autonomy of SEEs, and their relation with the Union government need to be
clarified. SEEs in the resource extraction sector will likely need to be treated differently than other
SEEs, given their fundamental importance to the economy and public finances.
28.
Increases in social spending need to resume, and public investment needs to be
protected and expanded. This will add to spending pressures, and reinforces the need to prioritize
other government spending and pursue the priorities in the government’s PFM strategy, including at
sub-national levels. In this regard, the establishment of a new treasury department in the MoF is
awaiting approval by the cabinet. Immediate next steps include developing sufficient technical

Box 4. International Lessons for Design of Fiscal Decentralization1
Changes in the assignment of spending responsibilities and their financing (taxes, transfers, or
borrowing) across government levels can significantly affect macroeconomic management, in particular
government budgetary balances and debt position. Hence, the design of intergovernmental fiscal
arrangements requires careful coordination and sequencing, and needs to strike a balance between
efficiency and distributional considerations. Despite differences across countries’ specific
circumstances, some general lessons can be drawn from international experience.



The sequencing of decentralization matters, as resources should be made available to
subnational governments on equal footing with the assignment of spending responsibilities.
Decentralization could start in sectors where improvements in service delivery are more likely
and accountability can easily be established.



At the same time, the pace of decentralization should be as much as possible linked to the
capacity of subnational governments to carry out effectively the functions assigned to them. This
implies that devolution of expenditure functions can proceed at different speed as PFM and other
capacities vary across subnational governments (asymmetric arrangements).



Subnational governments should face effective budget constraints which means that they should
be provided with an overall envelope of resources (own revenue and transfers) that is sufficient to
allow them to carry out their assigned spending responsibilities.



Control over a portion of own resources is key to promoting accountability of subnational
governments to their constituents, as well as fiscal responsibility. The assignment of own revenue
sources to subnational governments must take into account economic considerations (such as the
degree of mobility of the tax base) as well as institutional ones (in particular the capacity of
subnational tax administrations). For instance, property and land taxes are typically assigned to
subnational governments.



As subnational own resources typically fall well short of spending responsibilities,
intergovernmental transfers are needed. They should be carefully designed with a view to
minimizing subnational governments’ fiscal vulnerability to cyclical fluctuations. Transfers can also
be used to address regional inequalities by taking into account relative taxing capacities and
spending needs.



Subnational borrowing needs to be carefully controlled to ensure fiscal discipline. Market discipline
is rarely effective in low-income countries.

capacity for cash flow forecasting, cash balance management, and treasury security issuance. More
broadly, budget policies should generate a steady flow of spending, with a focus on social and
investment expenditure, even if revenues are volatile due to one-off receipts.
29.
Treasury securities auctions need to be introduced in time for the 2015/16 budget,
which requires the establishment of a treasury department. The auctions would support a
reduction of CBM financing of the budget and spur strengthening of fiscal accounting and

reporting. Securities auctions will also assist financial sector development by helping reduce excess
liquidity, and establishing market-determined interest rates.

Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities stressed their commitment to far-reaching fiscal reform. They pointed
out that many of the provisions for exemptions and special regimes in the 2014 taxation bill had
been inserted by the legislature. They also explained that they intended to reform the taxation of
special consumption goods in next year’s taxation bill. With regard to tax administration, they
indicated that they expect the LTO to be managing taxpayers as per their original implementation
plan and they are taking measures to reduce tax evasion. The authorities were determined to move
forward with treasury securities auctions by early 2015, and establish the treasury department in the
MoF (for which they requested continued TA support). With regard to fiscal decentralization and SEE
reform the authorities noted they were working closely with the World Bank to develop plans.

D. Financial Sector Modernization
Background
31.
Expansion and modernization of the financial sector is accelerating. The authorities plan
to grant licenses to 5–10 foreign bank branches during 2014. There are also proposals for further
policy banks following the two licensed in 2013. A modernized Banking and Financial Institutions
Law is in the final stages of drafting, and modernized prudential regulations have been drafted. The
CBM’s supervisory capacity is gradually being upgraded, with IMF TA support. The parliament
passed Anti Money Laundering and Counterterrorism Laws in 2014, but substantial deficiencies
remain in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.
32.
The functioning of the foreign exchange market continues to improve. Foreign
exchange auctions are now settled in overseas accounts, boosting the efficiency of the foreign
exchange market.3 At the same time, use of the interbank market is increasing, but remains low. To
pave the way for acceptance of Article VIII obligations, a remaining key step is the issuance of a
comprehensive set of regulations for the Foreign Exchange Management Law.

Staff Views
33.
The impending entry of foreign banks will likely trigger a sea-change in the capital,
banking and financial markets. This implies an urgent need for the CBM to define a unified
playing field for both foreign and domestic banks. In addition to implementing prudential and
monetary reforms already in train, policies on lending and deposits in foreign exchange; capital
account flows; and foreign exchange reserve and liquidity requirements will need to be developed
urgently. These policies need to focus on containing macroeconomic risks (including by preserving
3

This removes the preliminary staff concerns of a multiple currency practice and exchange restriction mentioned in
the staff report on the last review under the SMP (EBS/14/16 at footnote 3). See Informational Annex for details.

the CBM’s discretionary approval of capital flows) while limiting the scope for dollarization. A key
principle should be to establish a strengthened, rules-based and transparent regulatory environment
before foreign banks commence operations. The entry of foreign banks should also be used as an
opportunity to modernize the domestic financial sector by fostering cooperation and learning in a
competitive environment.
34.
The expansion of the number of policy banks is concerning as it generates fiscal risks
and further segments the financial sector. While policy banks can be useful, international
experience shows they often make poor lending decisions and are not commercially managed
meaning that they incur large losses that ultimately have to be covered by the government budget.4
They therefore need to protect the quality of their loan portfolios, be closely supervised and operate
on a level playing field with other commercial banks, which requires strong management and credit
assessment skills. The number of new policy banks should be minimized and their external
borrowing tightly circumscribed.
35.
Strengthening supervision is critical. The enforcement of existing and new macro- and
microprudential regulations is key to preserving the stability of the financial system, especially in
light of continued rapid credit growth. To this end, expansion and substantial training of the CBM’s
supervisory staff is needed, including with respect to AML/CFT. The CBM will also need to develop
policies to attract and retain qualified staff, a task that is becoming more urgent as foreign banks
will enter the labor market for staff with experience and qualifications.
36.
Reform of state-owned banks, particularly the MFTB, is an important priority. When
foreign exchange reserves are channeled directly to the CBM, the MFTB’s role will be considerably
reduced. Its remaining operations will also be placed under competitive pressure by the entry of
foreign banks. Therefore, options for its future function in the financial system need to be explored.
Some of its staff could be absorbed by the CBM to assist in their expanded reserve management
role. The MFTB operations with private customers could be transformed into a commercial bank on
a par with other banks, sold, or closed. Any remaining policy functions would be absorbed into the
government.

Authorities’ View
37.
The authorities expressed confidence that they would be able to accept the
obligations of Article VIII soon. They pointed out that the process of issuing of foreign exchange
regulations was in its last stage and that remaining restrictions in the Foreign Investment Law would
be removed as part of the ongoing redrafting. While the interbank market continues to deepen,
they requested an extension of the Executive Board approval for the Multiple Currency Practice
(MCP) arising from the foreign exchange auction.

Fiechter, Litan and Pomerleano (2004).

38.
The authorities acknowledged that the entry of foreign banks presented considerable
challenges on a tight timeline. They were determined to meet them, since they had already made
commitments, and indicated that they accorded high priority to this issue. They valued IMF advice,
and requested additional TA to establish the policy and regulatory framework governing foreign
(and domestic) banks in the new activities opening up, such as lending in foreign exchange. With
regard to supervision, the authorities agreed on the need for capacity building and noted the need
for continued TA support.
39.
The authorities also acknowledged the risks associated with the creation of policy
banks. However, they pointed to political imperatives, and explained that they considered that such
banks could play an important role in developing the economy in areas where market-based
incentives alone would under-serve segments of the population, or specific sectors such as
agriculture. They indicated that they were exploring options to mitigate risks, including
consolidation of policy banks into one national development bank, or regionalization. They also
indicated that they would consider options for state bank reform, including transforming MFTB into
an export-import bank and eventually transforming MEB into a development bank.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The authorities’ economic reform program is bearing fruit, but challenges remain
daunting. Economic growth is expected to continue rising, while inflation should remain broadly
contained, though risks remain. The external position is improving, and the risk of debt distress is
low. Sectoral reforms are advancing and are expected to trigger large investments, most notably in
telecommunications and banking. Nonetheless, external and fiscal buffers remain thin, and fiscal
pressures are rising. Macroeconomic management challenges will increase with rising foreign
inflows, which will place further strain on the authorities’ already stretched institutional capacity.
41.
The CBM needs to take action on multiple fronts. Monetary policy tools need to be more
aggressively deployed to manage the impact of foreign inflows. A continued reduction in deficit
monetization is needed to ease the burden on these new tools. Foreign inflows should enable a
much-needed boost to the CBM’s international reserves. However, an automatic mechanism is
required that firmly establishes the CBM as the guardian of the state’s foreign exchange reserves.
The CBM’s policy of smoothing exchange rate fluctuations while not targeting a specific rate
remains appropriate. Finally, the CBM’s internal systems urgently need to be upgraded, particularly
in accounting and reserves management.
42.
The current strategy of keeping deficits below 5 percent of GDP remains appropriate
but off-budget borrowing needs to be carefully controlled. Increased tax revenue is crucial to
allow increases in social spending and public investment. Tax policy should focus on cutting back
exemptions, unifying the commercial tax rate, and introducing an excise tax which would lay the
foundation for a VAT in the medium term. Overall, budget policies should provide for a steady
stream of spending even if revenues are volatile due to one-off receipts. To finance spending

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

consistent with macroeconomic stability, treasury securities auctions need to be introduced which
will require strengthening of cash and debt management capacity.
43.
The regulation and supervision of the banking sector needs to be urgently upgraded.
The impending entry of foreign banks brings forward the need for far-reaching policy reforms so
that a modern regulatory regime is in place before the new banks begin operations. At the same
time, the opportunity to modernize the domestic financial sector needs to be seized. To control
risks, supervision needs to be strengthened appreciably, with adequate staff and financial resources
devoted to this task, and the supervisory perimeter extended to state banks. The number of new
policy banks should be minimized, the quality of their loan portfolios protected, and their external
borrowing tightly circumscribed, particularly if state-guaranteed.
44.
Continued intensive TA is critical for successful reform. Coordination, prioritization and
adaptation to Myanmar’s circumstances remain essential given the scarce administrative capacity
and the breadth of the agenda. IMF TA has been scaled up further, and will continue to be intensive,
evolve with Myanmar’s needs, and has been delivered in close coordination with other development
partners. In this regard, improving statistics to underpin economic management and IMF
surveillance will be crucial.
45.
Staff support the authorities’ request for approval of a MCP subject to Fund
jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 3. The MCP is maintained principally for nonbalance of
payments reasons. Since the MCP does not materially impede the member’s balance of payments
adjustments, does not harm the interests of other members, and does not discriminate among
members, and the authorities are unable at present to replace it, staff recommend Executive Board
approval for its retention until September 23, 2015 or the conclusion of the next Article IV
consultation, whichever is earlier.
46.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Source or Nature of Risk

Likelihood

Expected Impact and Policy Response

Medium

Impact: High
High inflation could erode public confidence in the CBM's ability to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Policy Response:
Accelerate reduction of monetization of fiscal deficit and more aggressive use of CBM's deposit auctions
to reduce reserve money growth.

Medium

Impact: Medium
Political instability in advance of general elections could undermine investor confidence in government
reform programs and delay investment.
Policy Response:
Use resources effectively by sub-national governments for maintaining peace and continue to promote
inclusive growth.

Medium/High

Impact: High
Revenue generation is undermined, and/or public debt rises beyond thresholds.
Policy Response:
Minimize tax exemptions and off-budget borrowing.

Medium/High

Impact: High
Dollarization is promoted, and financial sector stability is threatened.
Policy Response:
Tightly circumscribe domestic activities in foreign currency, retain discretionary CBM approval for capital
account flows, and strengthen supervisory capacity

(A) Domestic Risks
Rising inflation
A weather-related supply shock on
agricultural production and/or
further depreciation stokes inflation
that CBM is not able to counter due
to undeveloped policy tools.

Political instability
Ethnic and religious tensions as well
as failure to introduce expected
amendments to the 2008
Constitution stoke social uprising
and delay economic reforms.

Fiscal risks
A wide range of tax exemptions is
retained, and/or external borrowing
for off-budget operations increases.

Entry of foreign banks
Supervisory capacity is stretched by
entry of foreign banks and new
foreign exchange activities of
domestic banks.

Limited institutional capacity
The public sector is unable to cope
with speed of reform program,
leading to slippages and
undermining confidence.

Medium

Impact: High
Progress toward building capacity for macroeconomic management will be significantly delayed, and
macroeconomic stability could be compromised.
Policy Response:
Prioritize reform program, with better donor coordination and sequencing.

Low

Impact: Low
Major exports to the country includes gas, jade, and other natural resources, but gas exports are
predetermined in contracts. Also, two new gas fields are coming fully on stream this year, implying that
exports will likely grow regardless.
Policy Response:
Continue with structural reforms to diversify exports and trading partners.

(B) External Risks
Growth slowdown in China
Growth may fall significantly below
the authorities’ target, with the
slowdown caused by a variety of
possible reasons and absent
offsetting stimulus measures.

Continued buildup and eventual
Medium
unwinding of excess capacity,
eventually resulting in a sharp
growth slowdown and large financial
and fiscal losses (medium-term).

Impact: Medium
If China's sharp growth slowdown spans over the medium term, Myanmar's export to and FDI from China
could decline substantially over time.
Policy Response:
Continue with structural reforms to diversify exports and trading partners, and to improve business
climate for attracting FDI and developing the country's manufacturing base.

Protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging economies:
High

Impact: Low/Medium
Although Myanmar is integrating with the global economy, exports (excluding gas) remain small.
Policy Response:
Continue with structural reforms to diversify exports and trading partners, and build the manufacturing
and services sectors.

Sustained decline in fuel prices
A sustained decline in fuel prices,
triggered by deceleration of global
demand and coming-on-stream of
excess capacity (medium-term)

Medium

Impact: Low/Medium
The level and prices of gas exports are predetermined in contracts. Two new gas fields are expected to
come fully on stream this year, implying that exports will likely grow regardless. Export revenues from
other commodities may decline.
Policy Response:
Continue with structural reforms to diversify exports and trading partners, and build the manufacturing
and services sectors.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The kyat had been pegged to the SDR at K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. On April 1, 2012, the
authorities replaced the official peg to the SDR with a managed float. The Central Bank of Myanmar
(CBM) started daily two-way multiple-price foreign currency auctions with technical assistance (TA)
provided by Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). The auctions provide a mechanism
for the market to determine an exchange rate that the CBM can use to set its new reference rate.
However, the CBM reserves the right to periodically intervene to mitigate undue exchange rate
volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no
predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range, and expects the
value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The de jure exchange rate arrangement
has been reclassified to a managed float. Due to the multiple exchange rates and divergence of
these rates from the official rate, the de facto exchange rate regime is classified as other managed
arrangement.
Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has
eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar has made significant progress toward satisfying
Article VIII obligations. Almost all current account restrictions have been removed through the
implementation of the 2012 Foreign Exchange Management Law, the authorities plan to issue a
comprehensive set of regulations for the Law during 2014. However, Myanmar still maintains
exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under Article
VIII. Exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction arise from (i) requirement of tax certification
for authorizing transfers of net investment income abroad, and (ii) limitations on the remittance
abroad of net salaries. The MCP arises from the two-way, multi-priced foreign currency auction, and
the authorities have sought a further IMF approval of the retention of this MCP.
The MCP arising from the foreign exchange certificate (FEC) rate has been removed, as FECs were
redeemed from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and have subsequently been abolished.
The CBM has also adopted measures whereby foreign exchange auctions are settled in overseas
accounts, eliminating difficulties encountered by banks in making transfers of foreign exchange to
offshore accounts for purposes of current international transactions, as well as the foreign exchange
rate premiums charged as a result of these difficulties. This has removed the staff preliminary
concerns of a MCP and exchange restriction mentioned in the staff report for the last review under
the SMP (EBS/14/16, footnote 3).
Article IV Consultation
Myanmar is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were conducted on May 8–22, 2013 in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. The Executive Board
concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation on June 28, 2013.

Technical Assistance
Myanmar is now one of the largest recipients of IMF technical assistance (TA). Delivery is through a
mix of resident advisors; experts in the Bangkok-based Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R.
and Myanmar (TAOLAM) and short-term HQ and expert missions. The key areas of focus are:


Central Banking: a resident foreign exchange advisors and a monetary operations advisor based
in TAOLAM provide frequent responsive advice, supported by HQ missions. In addition regular
expert missions are conducted in order to assist CBM strengthen its accounting framework and
systems.



Financial Sector Supervision: work in this area is led by a resident advisor in Yangon supported
by HQ and expert missions, including on AML/CFT



Revenue Reform: a resident tax administration advisor is supported by HQ and expert missions
aimed at modernizing the Internal Revenue Department (IRD). Work on tax policy is delivered
through HQ missions.



Public Financial Management: the focus is on development of a Government Treasury, which is
led by an advisor based in TAOLAM and supported by HQ and expert missions.



Statistics: the work plan in this area has been developed following a multi-sector diagnostic
mission in 2013. As a result, external sector and government finance statistics advisor have taken
up duties in TAOLAM and expert visits continue to assist in the development of price statistics.



Macroeconomic Analysis: an advisor based in TAOLAM leads the work in this area that is closely
integrated with the broader IMF training program.

In all areas the IMF coordinates closely with other development partners. In the financial sector, the
IMF team has assisted the Central Bank of Myanmar develop a framework for coordination of
international technical assistance.
Resident Representative
Ms. Yu Ching Wong has been the Resident Representative of the country and stationed in Yangon,
since May 2013.
The Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar (TAOLAM)
IMF opened TAOLAM in Bangkok in October 2012. The new office, headed by Ms. Susan Creane, is
providing IMF technical assistance and training, in collaboration with the Bank of Thailand and the
Government of Japan. There are currently four TA advisors in the office, covering public financial
management, monetary operations, macroeconomics training, and external statistics, for both Lao
P.D. R. and Myanmar.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(July 2014)
The Fund and the Bank country teams for Myanmar, led by Mr. Davies (International Monetary
Fund, IMF) and by Mr. Zachau (World Bank Group, WBG), maintain excellent working relations
and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues.
The level of cooperation and coordination is excellent, and is becoming more regular as both
institutions have been scaling up their engagement in Myanmar. Staffs routinely share country
documents prepared by both institutions for their respective Executive Boards and collaborate
regularly on mutually relevant areas.
Following the clearance of arrears to the International Development Association (IDA) in
January 2013, the Bank has resumed normal lending relations to Myanmar and International
Finance Corporation (IFC) commenced its investment and advisory activities. A pre-arrears
clearance IDA grant to finance a National community Driven Development Project preceded an
initial Development Policy Operation in support of a program around macroeconomic stability and
arrears clearance. Since then, four IDA financed projects have been approved by the Executive Board
of Directors in electricity, telecommunications, public financial management, and education. The IFC
has made investments in microfinance, hospitality and banking sector through the Global Trade
Finance Program Facility. There are four IDA credit operations in the pipeline for delivery within the
next 12 months: on health, agriculture, integrated river basin management, and electricity
(guarantee for Independent Power Producer). IFC is developing its pipeline of investments in several
sectors. The WBG has also significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory services.
Following the completion of the 2013 Staff Monitored Program, the IMF is continuing to
provide intensive policy advice and technical assistance to the Myanmar authorities. On the
surveillance side, annual Article IV consultations will be supplemented with regular staff visits and
frequent engagement through the resident representative office which was opened in 2013.
Technical Assistance continues to intensify with three resident advisors in Myanmar and four in the
Bangkok-based TAOLAM alongside regular HQ-missions. Key TA priorities include development of
monetary and exchange rate policy tools, enhancing bank supervision, strengthening tax policy and
administration, enhancing budget preparation and execution, and developing macroeconomic
statistics. The Fund also has a wide-ranging training program for Myanmar.
There is strong collaboration between the WBG and IMF.


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. Representatives from the WB participate in IMF
Article IV missions to Myanmar. They also jointly carry out the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).
In this context, staffs from both institutions discuss macroeconomic policies and the main
messages to the authorities.



In the financial sector, the Bank and Fund teams have jointly prepared a note on collaborative
IMF-WB Financial Sector Technical Assistance Plan for Myanmar. The note specifies the areas
where the two institutions will collaborate and the specific areas in which each institution will
take the lead. In this regard, the Bank’s Financial and Private Sector Development team has had
joint missions with the IMF’s MCM Department team on the development of a financial sector
strategy, bank supervision, the Central Bank Law, and Financial Institutions Law.



Similarly, there have been joint missions in public financial management, including more
recently, in delivering a PFM Foundational Course and conducting a DSA. The teams are also
collaborating in the preparation of the macro-fiscal analysis chapter of the Public Expenditure
Review which is currently underway.



The IFC has consulted the IMF during its engagement with the CBM and banking sector on the
establishment of a private sector owned and operated credit bureau as well as during the
process of working with the government on the preparation of the new Investment Law, which
has implications for capital repatriation and tax incentives for investors.



Structural reforms. The IMF and WB teams have worked together and have shared views on a
range of other issues, including structural reforms for a better investment climate and private
sector development, agriculture, and social development. Representatives from the World Bank
participate in IMF Article IV, and provide their comments and inputs on important structural
issues that are incorporated in the IMF staff reports.

Based on the above partnership, the WB and the Fund share a common view about
Myanmar’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. Important reform priorities include:


Promoting long-term growth and diversification. Modernizing Myanmar’s economy will
require removing impediments to growth by enhancing the business and investment climate,
encouraging financial sector development, and further liberalizing trade and foreign direct
investment. The government’s Framework for Economic and Social Reform would benefit from
coordination across government agencies, broader consultation with stakeholders, and lessons
distilled from other countries’ experiences through substantial capacity building efforts.



Foreign exchange policy. The authorities have come a long way in liberalizing the foreign
exchange regime and will soon be able to accept their Article VIII obligations. Important actions
include: removing the remaining restrictions arising from provisions in the foreign investment
law and issuing comprehensive regulations for the foreign exchange management law, which
will replace the instructions issued over the last year by the CBM. Deepening the foreign
exchange market will require further development of the interbank foreign exchange market.



Monetary policy. Strengthening the CBM’s capacity to conduct monetary policy is a critical
prerequisite for macroeconomic management. To this end, the authorities need to ensure the
CBM is granted full budgetary autonomy with a strengthened balance sheet and improved
accounting systems. Continued attention to building tools and capacity for monetary policy is

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

required. Priorities include regularly conducting basic open market operations, reforming reserve
requirements, and refining the reserve money forecasting and targeting framework.


Financial sector. Liberalization of the financial sector needs to be complemented with a
stronger regulatory and supervisory framework to maintain financial stability. Changes should be
implemented step by step, in line with the development of needed supervisory and banks
capacity. For instance, developing money markets and improving banks’ risk management are
necessary precursors to liberalization of lending rates and maturities. The new Banking and
Financial Institutions Law, drafted with World Bank support, will help set the sector on a modern
footing. It will require the development and enforcement of modernized prudential regulations,
including on bank capital, nonperforming loans, connected lending, and large exposures. This
has become particularly urgent given the impending entry of foreign banks, which will also
require regulations on foreign exchange lending, and revised regulations on capital flows and
net open positions. The IMF and World Bank teams will work closely on this with the authorities
in the coming months. Other priorities include developing a plan to reform the state-owned
banks and establishing appropriate regulation of nonbank financial institutions.



Fiscal discipline and transparency. Prudent fiscal policy is essential to maintain macroeconomic
stability. Staffs emphasize an urgent need to improve the quality, timeliness, and transparency of
government financial statistics, including those of the state economic enterprises (SEEs). Strengthening
public financial management, including by establishing a treasury function, and defining institutional
arrangements to delineate fiscal responsibilities under the planned decentralization, are essential to
safeguard financial discipline. SEE reform needs to take a differentiated approach that takes into
account the impact on broader government finances, particularly as regards the autonomy of those in
the resource extraction sector. The government is commended for its strong commitment to adopting
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI).



Prioritizing fiscal policies toward social and infrastructure spending. Continued increases in
budgetary allocations towards health and education are welcome. There is still room for
reallocating further resources to social sectors where spending levels remain relatively low.
Further room remains also for reallocating resources from other sectors towards infrastructure
which is currently in a poor state and negatively affecting the business climate.



Avoiding accumulation of quasi-fiscal deficits. Staff welcomes the April 2014 adjustments of
electricity tariffs for end-customers, which will help reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit (QFD) in the
power sector resulting from tariffs below cost recovery. Elimination of QFD, which leads to decapitalization of the asset base in the power sector, is essential for financial viability and
mobilization of necessary investments to reduce electricity shortages and promote inclusive
development. However, it is advisable to gradually reduce cross-subsidies in electricity tariffs for all
residential users to encourage efficient use of electricity and avoid overcharging other user groups.
In addition, the wholesale electricity tariffs could now be adjusted to remove quasi-fiscal deficit at
the Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise. Care also needs to be taken to avoid building up
contingent liabilities in other areas, in particular the financial sector, where the establishment of
policy banks funded by state-guaranteed external borrowing could lead to a buildup of fiscal risks.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(July 2013)
Myanmar became a member of the World Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in 1962. By 1987, the
Bank’s total portfolio amounted to US$804 million equivalent, of which US$752.8 million equivalent
had been disbursed. New lending ceased after 1987 due to a lack of dialogue on policy reform. The
last formal Consultative Group meeting was held in January 1986 in Tokyo, chaired by the Bank.
Since then, occasional contacts between the government and the Bank continued on the sidelines
of the Annual Meetings.
Myanmar went into arrears with the Bank in January 1998 and subsequently into nonaccrual status
in September 1998. All credits that had been approved but which had not fully disbursed were
cancelled and Myanmar was not eligible for new loans. The Bank’s engagement with Myanmar
became limited to monitoring economic and social developments in the country based on available
information and reports, liaising with other international donors and agencies, continued
participation in IMF Article IV missions, and providing support to the work of other donors.
Relations between Myanmar and the Bank have however been recently normalized. As part of its
efforts to restore normal relations with the international community, the Government of Myanmar
cleared the full amount of its arrears to the Bank in January 2013, in the amount of US$420 million
through a bridge loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The Bank resumed
normal lending to Myanmar, with the first loan being a concessional IDA credit extended to help
Myanmar repay in full the bridge loan contracted to clear the arrears.
The Bank opened its first ever country office in Myanmar on August 1, 2012. Its engagement with
Myanmar is currently guided by an Interim Strategy Note. Preparation of a full Country Partnership
Framework is underway and is being informed by a Systematic Country Diagnostic that identifies
key priorities for accelerating progress towards ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the
twin goals that the WBG has committed to helping attain in its member countries.
Since the approval of the pre-arrears grant to finance a National Community Driven Development
Project, four IDA lending projects have been approved by the Executive Board of Directors in
electricity, telecommunications, public financial management, and education. IFC has made
investments in microfinance, hospitality and banking sector through the Global Trade Finance
Program Facility. There are four WB lending projects in the pipeline for delivery within the next
12 months: on health, agriculture, integrated river basin management, and electricity (guarantee for
independent power producers). IFC is developing its pipeline of investments in several sectors. Apart
from lending programs, the Bank has significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory services.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
(June 2014)
Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the same year.
In 2012, as the international community resumed engagement with Myanmar as a result of
significant economic and political reforms, the AsDB developed a road map toward resumption of
normal operations. The activities included initial assessments of the economy and of key sectors,
provision of technical assistance, and development of an interim country partnership strategy for
2012–2014.
AsDB’s interim country partnership strategy for 2012–2014 seeks to support the government in
achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. It focuses on (i) building human resources and capacities
(capacity building in ministries in core areas of AsDB involvement, and education); (ii) promoting an
enabling economic environment (macroeconomic and fiscal management; and trade, investment,
financial sector reform); and (iii) creating access and connectivity (rural livelihoods and infrastructure
development, especially energy and transport). AsDB will mainstream the thematic areas of good
governance, environmental sustainability, private sector development, and regional cooperation and
integration into its operations. AsDB will focus on the crosscutting areas of knowledge and
partnerships. The AsDB Country Operations Business Plan 2014–2016 was finalized in November
2013, which laid out an investment program covering energy, transport (mainly roads), agriculture
and natural resources, and urban development. In 2014, AsDB commenced analytical and
consultative work for a full Country Partnership Strategy which covers the period 2017–2021.
Myanmar cleared its arrears to AsDB in January 2013. The AsDB has so far provided 34 loans totaling
US$1,166 million for 29 projects and one policy-based operation. Of these, two loans amounting to
US$6.6 million were from the AsDB’s ordinary capital resources which have already been pre-paid,
and 32 loans were from concessional Asian Development Fund resources. The AsDB has so far
provided TA totaling US$43.2 million for 67 projects. Of these 67 TA projects, 31 projects have been
approved since AsDB reengaged with Myanmar in 2012.
Since resumption of its engagement with the international community, Myanmar has become an
increasingly active participant in the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). AsDB coordinates closely with the IMF, the
World Bank, the UNDP, and other development partners and is actively engaged in various sector
and thematic working groups formed by the government for aid coordination purposes.
The majority of AsDB assistance has been provided to support public sector management, followed
by development of the agricultural sector. The sector composition of AsDB lending to Myanmar is
summarized in the following table.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Data are
not provided in a timely manner, and official and independent estimates of key macroeconomic
variables differ widely.
National accounts. Myanmar’s national accounts broadly follow the concepts and definitions of the
System of National Accounts 1968. NA data are only available on an annual basis. Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) is compiled at current and constant prices, by economic activity. While production
expenditure approaches are used, significant discrepancies exist between the two. GDP is estimated
at producer prices, instead of the internationally recommended market prices. The accuracy of the
GDP in volume measure is hampered by the weaknesses of current price value-added estimates and
the lack of relevant price indexes, such as the producer price index. Coverage of the growing private
sector is incomplete due to a lack of comprehensive annual establishment/enterprise economic
surveys. National accounts estimates do not completely account for informal sector activity.
Estimates of some economic activities, particularly in agriculture, construction, and public
administration, need major improvement. Resource constraints at the Planning Department and the
Central Statistical Organization (CSO), along with the lack of interagency coordination and a clear
delineation of responsibilities, limit the conduct of surveys and other data collection. TA is being
provided by ADB and UNDP to improve the national accounts and to implement the 2008 SNA.
Price statistics. The current CPI weights are based on the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES). The CPI does not reflect international standards and best practices due to a number of
methodological weaknesses: weights only represent urban households; some construction inputs are
included; rentals of owner-occupied housing are excluded; missing prices are not imputed; and the
classification of items is outdated. The CSO has made no progress in implementing past TA missions’
recommendations due to the lack of commitment and inadequate resources. The CSO was expected
to address these issues when it introduced a new CPI in early 2014 with weights based on the results
of the 2012 HIES. However, the new CPI was not released as planned. Stronger direction from senior
levels is needed. STARE will provide more frequent TA to engage the authorities and promote
improvements.
Government finance statistics. There is no comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation of fiscal
data. Monthly cash-based budget execution data are available in local language, but are not
published. Annual comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of
the reference year. In addition, some transactions of state economic enterprises are recorded partly
on an accrual and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal and monetary data are not consistent. Budget
estimates and actual expenditures tend to differ by wide margins. In addition, recording of debt
statistics is not comprehensive.
Myanmar is participating in a three-year program funded by the government of Japan designed to
improve government finance statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region. The next mission under the
program is planned for August 2014. In addition, a long-term GFS advisor will soon be posted in the
country, also funded by the government of Japan, but under a separate program.

Monetary and financial statistics. The monetary survey compiled by the CBM covers the central
bank and all commercial banks (public and private). Reporting of monetary data in the Standardized
Report Forms, which accord with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual classification
principles, was established in January 2012. The quality of monetary statistics could be improved by:
(i) monitoring the consistency of the reciprocal/interbank accounts that show positions between the
CBM and the commercial banks; and initiating data review and resolution of large inconsistencies;
(ii) using electronic means to capture and share data to minimize mistakes; (iii) in due course,
adopting market or fair value-based valuation of financial instruments; and (iv) reviewing the
accuracy of recording of the IMF Accounts in the CBM’s balance sheet.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities do not provide financial soundness indicators to the
IMF Statistics Department for dissemination.
External sector statistics. The reliability of the balance of payments and international investment
position (IIP) is impacted by coverage gaps. Several components of the balance of payments and IIP
(e.g., some of services, direct investment assets, portfolio investment assets and liabilities, and other
investment assets) are missing. The, revaluation of the national currency in April 2012 has resulted in
a large break in the balance of payments and IIP series. Data for 2012 were reported to STA with a
lag of nine months. However, the data were not disseminated in the IMF’s 2013 Balance of Payments
Yearbook because of data quality issues. To address these issues, the TA mission in January 2014
proposed three benchmark actions: (i) initiate compilation of quarterly balance of payments data
with an initial six month lag; (ii) resubmit balance of payments and IIP standard component datasets
to correct for the erroneous presentation of the capital account item, and revalue liabilities to reflect
the revaluation of the national currency in 2012Q2; and (iii) correct the treatment of foreign-owned
enterprises in Myanmar’s ITRS and update ITRS coding in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual.
An STA three-year project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in Lao P.D.R. and
Myanmar started in March 2014. Under the project, technical assistance is provided by a resident
advisor stationed at the TAOLAM in Bangkok, Thailand.
Data Standards and Quality
Myanmar began participating in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System in November 2013.
No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA (optional)
Myanmar submits data reports to STA with a lag of two to six months. Balance of payments and IIP
data for 2012 are not yet disseminated in the IMF’s 2013 Balance of Payments Yearbook because of
data quality issues. No fiscal data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS. Annual data on the
operations of the consolidated central government were last reported for 2005 to STA for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but do not include an economic
classification of expenditure.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Jerald Schiff and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Myanmar is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress, following the clearance of its
external arrears in 2013/14 with the Paris Club creditors.1,2,3 Under the baseline scenario,
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt burden indicators remain well below
their indicative thresholds. Similarly, under the baseline scenario, total public debt will
also remain below the benchmark. However, shocks lead to the indicative benchmark for
the present value of total public debt being exceeded. While Myanmar’s risk of debt
distress can be characterized as low, it requires close monitoring, in particular because the
level of total public debt is close to the benchmark. Preventing total public debt
vulnerability from increasing will require prudent fiscal policy, improvements in tax policy
and public financial management and increasing use of concessional finance while
limiting nonconcessional borrowing to only viable and growth-enhancing projects.

1
External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt and public domestic debt dynamics are assessed using
the low-income countries debt sustainability framework, which recognizes that better policies and institutions
allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. The
quality of a country’s policies and institutions are normally measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Since Myanmar does not currently have a CPIA rating, the most conservative
thresholds are applied for the purposes of this debt sustainability assessment (DSA). The current DSA
framework uses the 5 percent discount rate specified in the new guidance note.

2
3

The DSA was jointly prepared by the IMF and the World Bank in consultation with the Asian Development Bank.

This risk rating is unchanged from the previous DSA which had assumed that the resolution of the external
arrears would be completed as planned.

MYANMAR

BACKGROUND
1.
The update of the external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard
low-income countries DSA framework. The DSA framework presents the projected path of Myanmar’s
external and public sector debt burden indicators, and draws conclusions on the sustainability of debt.
2.
The macroeconomic assumptions remain broadly unchanged compared with the last DSA
but updates have been made, with recent developments taken into account. The medium-term GDP
growth rate has been revised upward to 8.1 percent, reflecting the better than anticipated GDP growth
performance in 2013/14 (8¼ percent) which is expected to continue in the medium term, given robust
investment in productive sectors including manufacturing in special export zones.4 However, growth has
been revised slightly downward over the longer term, taking into account the new growth diagnostics
conducted for Myanmar. Several windfall gains, such as revenues from telecommunication and bank
licenses that are spread over a few years, have also caused a revision to the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit is
expected to improve compared to last DSA both in the medium and long term.

3.
The current DSA incorporates the resolution of Myanmar’s arrears with its multilateral and
bilateral creditors completed in 2013/14. In late-January 2013, the Paris Club reached an agreement with
the Myanmar authorities on a debt treatment to be completed in early 2014. Paris Club members agreed to
write off 50 percent of all arrears and reschedule the remaining arrears over 15 years with a 7-year grace
period. The treatment was phased, with 25 percent of the written-off occurring immediately and 75 percent
on the successful completion of a staff-monitored program with the IMF.5 Furthermore, Myanmar resolved
its arrears to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in January 2013, with the help of bridge
financing from Japan.
4.
As in the previous DSA, Myanmar is expected to gradually reduce its reliance on external
nonconcessional financing. With the resolution of its arrears and the re-engagement with the international
community, Myanmar is expected to gradually regain access to concessional resources. As donors re-

The staffs of the World Bank and the IMF, while strong supporters of the overall reform effort, note that there is
significant uncertainty surrounding the growth projections, given that the reform program has only begun recently
and data and capacity constraints are significant.

Italy have provided a more generous treatment than agreed in the Paris Club minutes.

engage with Myanmar, and gradually identify suitable projects, the share of nonconcessional financing is
expected to decline.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
5.
Successful completion of the resolution of the arrears in 2013/14 has ensured that all
external debt indicators are below their indicative thresholds. Furthermore, standard stress tests
indicate that no thresholds will be breached.6 To maintain external debt below the threshold, continued
strong performance of the external sector is critical, including by maintaining high export growth, attracting
foreign direct investment (FDI) to fund investment projects and obtaining more concessional financing.
6.
Total public sector debt will also remain below the indicative benchmark under the baseline
scenario but is vulnerable to shocks. The present value of total public debt as a percentage of GDP
remains below the indicative benchmark in the medium term. This trajectory reflects the significant
development needs of Myanmar and the associated overall fiscal deficits assumed in the baseline scenario.
It also underscores the need to limit the share of nonconcessional financing as is assumed in the baseline
scenario. However, this level of debt can give rise to vulnerabilities including a high debt service burden.
Overall, public debt sustainability is vulnerable to lower real GDP growth, and fiscal slippages. Risks are
somewhat mitigated as the authorities aim to use their borrowing to only finance economically viable
projects in priority sectors.
7.
Myanmar continues to face fiscal risks. Public finances are dependent on state-owned economic
enterprises (SEEs) and natural resource revenues. Tax revenues are very low and the tax base remains
narrow, in part due to widespread exemptions. Recent off-budget external non-concessional borrowing and
guarantees for policy banks7 and microfinance pose risks to debt control and complicate fiscal
management. Increases in transfers to subnational governments without effective budget constraints on
subnational governments could be a drain on government resources as a whole. Moreover, reforms that
separate SEEs from the budget could trigger contingent liabilities and would reduce a critical source of
budget funding.
8.
Several steps can be taken to mitigate against fiscal risks. Higher revenue is needed to provide
a solid foundation for financing development. To this end, introducing a value added tax (VAT) is a key step.
Fiscal decentralization and reform of SEE finances need to be carefully planned and implemented. Offbudget borrowing needs to be strictly limited and reported to the legislature alongside the budget. Strong
capital inflows, such as one-off revenues from oil and gas exploration, can also ease budget constraints in
the short-term.

6

The typical historical scenario is not shown in this analysis. In the case of Myanmar, the historical scenario would
imply an unlikely return to pre-reform policies: low noninterest current account deficits (consistent with binding
international sanctions) and sustained real exchange rate pressures.

7

Policy banks in Myanmar are financial institutions in which the government has an ownership stake and which carry
out functions that are associated with policies of the government.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
Myanmar is assessed to be at low risk of debt distress, following the resolution of its external
arrears in 2013/14. Under the baseline scenario, which incorporates the resolution of all arrears in 2013/14
as agreed with the Paris Club, all indicators for the external debt are below their indicative thresholds. Under
the baseline scenario, the total public debt also remains below the benchmark although it is vulnerable to
fiscal slippages and low real GDP growth. Preventing total public debt vulnerability from increasing will
require continuation of the current prudent fiscal policy, improvements in tax policy and public financial
management and increasing use of concessional finance.
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with these conclusions and with the thrust of the analysis.
They concurred with staff on the need to be cautious on nonconcessional borrowing and reconfirmed their
intention to use nonconcessional external borrowing only to finance economically viable projects in priority
sectors, at levels consistent with low risk of debt distress. The authorities reiterated their aim to keep the
fiscal deficit below 5 percent of GDP over the medium term.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 6, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Myanmar
On September 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Myanmar.
Growth is accelerating and the external balance remains stable. Output growth is estimated to
have risen to 8¼ percent in fiscal year (FY) 2013/14 (April-March). Inflation has broadly
stabilized, and stood at 6 percent (year-on-year, y/y) in April 2014. After depreciating in 2013,
the exchange rate has stabilized. The current account deficit is estimated to have widened to 5½
percent of GDP in 2013/14, but to have been more than financed by foreign direct investment,
new loans, and inflows related to telecommunications licenses. International reserves held by the
Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) increased to US$4.5 billion by end-March, covering 2¾
months of prospective imports. While the base remains low, broad money and private sector
credit continue to grow rapidly, at 32¼ and 58½ percent (y/y), respectively in February. The
headline fiscal deficit in 2013/14 is estimated at 1½ percent of GDP. A debt sustainability
analysis indicates that Myanmar is now at a low risk of debt distress.
The economic outlook is favorable. Growth is expected to average 8¼ percent in the next few
years, led by rising gas production and investment. Inflation is expected to remain under control
at around 6 percent over the medium term. The current account deficit is projected to remain
broadly stable, while the CBM’s international reserves are forecast to continue to increase
rapidly as foreign inflows intensify. With transfers from the Union Government to states and
regions increasing significantly, the underlying fiscal deficit is set to widen to around 5½ percent
of GDP in 2014/15, but further one-off revenues should bring the headline deficit to around
4½ percent of GDP. In the medium term, the underlying fiscal deficit is projected to again
decline to below 5 percent of GDP.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Medium and long-term prospects remain strong, but require sustained policy and institutional
reforms even as the authorities’ capacity is being strained. In order to achieve rapid and inclusive
growth, it is vital to maintain near-term macroeconomic stability while building modern
institutions and sound policy frameworks to manage the budget and financial sector.
Risks arise from thin external and fiscal buffers, particularly as the authorities’ capacity to
develop and implement policies and absorb technical assistance is being stretched. The entry of
foreign banks will burden nascent supervisory capacity and challenge monetary and exchange
rate management, particularly in the face of continuing demand-side pressures on inflation. At
the same time, structural fiscal risks are building as tax exemptions increase even as expenditure
pressures rise. External borrowing for off-budget operations is also increasing. On the upside,
large one-off inflows from concession fees for oil and gas exploration could materialize in the
near term
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the continued progress with their economic
reform program, which has contributed to strong growth. Directors noted that while the medium
and long-term economic prospects are favorable, Myanmar’s economy faces risks in the short
run as fiscal buffers are thin and the capacity to develop and implement policy remains
constrained. Accordingly, Directors recommended further efforts to reinforce policy and
institutional frameworks and pursue structural reforms. Directors agreed that continued technical
assistance from the Fund and other international institutions remains critical given Myanmar's
vast transformational needs and limited capacity.
Directors welcomed the advances made in developing monetary policy tools, but saw need for a
more vigorous deployment of these tools to manage the impact of foreign inflows, and keep
reserve money and inflation under control. Priority should be given to improving liquidity
forecasting, and developing a market for treasury bonds. Deficit monetization also needs to
continue to be scaled back. Directors supported the policy of smoothing exchange rate
fluctuations while not targeting a specific rate. Noting that international reserves remain low,
they urged the establishment of an automatic mechanism to transfer public sector foreign
exchange earnings to the central bank. Furthermore, Directors encouraged the authorities to
strengthen over time the central bank’s internal systems, particularly in accounting and reserves
management.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors emphasized the importance of a prudent orientation of fiscal policy that addresses
Myanmar’s development needs while safeguarding debt and macroeconomic sustainability. They
supported the strategy to keep fiscal deficits below 5 percent of GDP and underscored that offbudget borrowing needs to be carefully controlled. Additional efforts to mobilize revenues are
also necessary to allow increases in social spending and public investment. Priority should be
given to cutting back exemptions, strengthening tax administration, and preparing for the
introduction of a VAT. Directors stressed the need to strengthen public financial management.
Directors underscored the importance of upgrading regulation and supervision of the
banking sector in anticipation of entry by foreign banks. They also cautioned against the
establishment of additional policy banks and encouraged the authorities to ensure that their
operations do not pose financial and fiscal risks. Directors recommended addressing the
remaining deficiencies in the anti-money laundering framework.
Directors stressed that continued progress with structural reforms is necessary to ensure
macroeconomic stability and spur inclusive growth. Reform efforts should focus on investments
in infrastructure, expanding education and health services, boosting access to finance, improving
the business climate, and diversifying exports. Improving economic statistics is also essential.

Statement by Mr. Abdul Ghaffour, Alternate Executive Director and
Ms. Moe Moe, Senior Advisor to Executive Director for Myanmar
September 24, 2014
1.
On behalf of our Myanmar authorities, we would like to express our sincere
appreciation to Mr. Matt Davies and his team for the constructive discussions during the
Article IV Consultation and for the comprehensive reports. We are encouraged by the
positive assessment that the authorities continue to make progress on its economic reform
agenda and that the economic reform program is bearing fruit. The authorities highly value
the Fund’s advice and technical assistance, and also underscore the need to continue to
consider the Fund’s advice in moving forward with their reform strategy. They are in broad
agreement with staff reports in several areas including the reduction of fiscal deficit
monetization, improving public finance management and strengthening regulatory and
supervisory framework.
Recent Economic Development
2.
Real GDP growth is estimated to rise from 7.3 percent in 2012/13 to 8.7 percent in
2013/14 which was mainly driven by gas production, construction, manufacturing, services
and trade sectors and supported by agriculture. This growth momentum is projected to
continue and reach at 9.1 percent in 2014/15. Consumer price inflation has risen to
5.71 percent in 2013/14 largely due to the increase in fuel, rent and food prices.
3.
The current account deficit is expected to be widened at 5.5 percent of GDP in
2013/14 mainly because of the increase in imports of capital goods. Export has increased by
24.8 percent while import has risen by 51.7 percent in 2013/14 compared to the previous
year. The current account deficit has been largely financed by capital inflows, mainly FDI
which has stood at 4.6 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Gross international reserves held by the
CBM has increased from USD 3.1 billion in 2012/13 to USD 4.5 billion at end-March 2014
which is adequate to finance 3 months of imports. We envisage international reserves to
continue to increase given the increased capital inflows. While our authorities broadly
concurred with staff’s assessment on economic outlook, our authorities’ growth estimates
and projections for 2013/14 and 2014/15 are slightly higher than staff’s estimates.
4.
Credit to the private sector has increased year on year by 50 percent in 2012/13 and
52 percent in 2013/14 largely due to the business opportunity booming, relaxation on
collateral requirement, expansion of the credit access and SME’s encouraging development.
However, the share of state-owned banks’ lending to the private sector has decreased while
increasing by the private banks’. Money growth has decreased to 32.73 percent year on year
in 2013/14 comparing to the previous year.

2
Fiscal Policy
5.
The 2014/15 Budget was enacted in March 2014 with greater focus on priority socioeconomic spending e.g. with increase in budget for education and health sector. The 2014/15
budget also allows allocating more funds to local governments in order to fulfill rural
development and for poverty alleviation. More funds will also be allotted to the regions that
are in urgent needs. As the goal of achieving inclusive and sustainable growth and poverty
reduction is our authorities’ main priority, it is critical to strike the right balance by
prioritizing critical socio-economic expenditure to maintain a prudent fiscal path. We are
encouraged to note that staff is of the view that the authorities fiscal strategy of keeping
deficit below 5 percent of GDP as appropriate. This is critical to balance Myanmar’s large
development needs with supporting macroeconomic stability and maintaining debt
sustainability.
6.
Despite having an expansionary budget in 2014/15, our authorities remain committed
to maintain fiscal discipline and continue ongoing efforts to increase tax revenue by
strengthening tax administration, broadening tax base and simplifying the tax rate structure
as well as strengthening public debt management. In an effort to improve tax compliance and
thus collect tax efficiently, large tax-payers office (LTO) has been established in April 2014.
In implementing the public finance management reform, while the authorities have been
making efforts to increase revenue, they are also committed to continue improving fiscal
transparency including report on revenues from natural resources, preparing the budget
including the issuance of ceilings, preparing the medium-term fiscal framework, improving
the information on public procurement outcomes, empowering budget holders to execute
budget within clearly defined procedures and regulations, issuing budget execution report,
submitting the audit report to the parliament.
7.
The authorities concur with staff’s view on that government’s spending could be
prioritized while public investment needs to be protected and expanded. In this regard, the
new Treasury Department in the Ministry of Finance has been established in September
2014. The new Treasury Department will initially focus on cash management, debt
management and accounting and reporting functions during this year. In addition, the
introduction of treasury securities auctions is also being considered and our authorities intend
to reform the taxation of special consumption goods to further enhance tax revenue. Fiscal
decentralization and SEE reform are also being implemented and is in the initial stage. The
authorities also stressed that the importance of greater transparency, accountability and
responsibility in the use of allotted funds, and systematically use of allotted funds in accord
with financial rules and regulations and following the audit codes of conduct.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
On monetary and exchange rate policy front, our authorities have made good progress
in liquidity forecasting, deposit auction, reserve money targeting and in implementing the

3
managed float exchange rate system with a flexible exchange rate policy within the short
period of time with the technical assistance of the Fund. In fulfilling the objective to
achieving monetary stability which is one of the CBM’s goals, the authorities have reduced
deficit monetization which was previously considered as one of the main factors contributing
to inflationary pressure. In light of this, the authorities take note the staff’s recommendations
of introducing treasury securities auctions and converting old government debt to the CBM
into marketable treasury bonds at market interest rate and with a range of maturities.
9.
Our authorities are mindful of the potential inflationary pressure of capital inflows,
rising credit growth and government’s expansionary expenditure although deficit financing is
on a declining path. Given the nascent stage of money market in Myanmar and with managed
interest rate policy, the main instruments currently used to control inflation in the economy
are liquidity forecasting and deposit auction, which have placed inflation under control, at the
expense of reducing CBM’s net foreign assets. In this context, the authorities share staff’s
view that substantial sterilization is required to keep reserve money and inflation under
control. The authorities are also considering using the excess liquidity of the Myanmar
Economic Bank (MEB), the largest state-owned bank, to accelerate the reduction of fiscal
deficit monetization.
10.
Since transforming to the managed floating exchange rate system, the overvalued
Kyat has moved closer toward alignment with long-term fundamentals and narrowed the
divergence between Myanmar and its peers. The function of foreign exchange market is
improving. However, given the still absence of a mechanism in the multiple price foreign
currency auction that prevents that exchange rates of accepted bids at the multiple price
auction do not deviate by more than 2 percent, our authorities would request the Fund to
retain a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 3
until September 23, 2015 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is
earlier. To be a member of Article VIII, the regulations for the Foreign Exchange
Management law still needs to be issued as a remaining main step. The bill for regulations
for the said law has been submitted to the parliament and expected to be enacted soon.
Financial Sector Policy
11.
The Myanmar’s financial sector continues to expand and is undergoing rapid
modernization and the authorities acknowledge that the regulation and supervision of the
financial sector needs to be continuously strengthened. In this regard, a modernized Banking
and Financial Institutions Law is currently in the final stages of drafting, modernized
prudential regulations have been drafted and the CBM’s supervisory capacity is being
upgraded. Under the Myanmar’s 20 year Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) starting
from 2011/12 to 2030/31 with the aim of developing the financial sector, a number of
initiatives have been identified. The goals of FSDP consist of to implement net open position
of foreign exchange for authorized dealer licensed private banks; establish Yangon foreign
exchange market successfully; modernize the payment and settlement system; improve the

4
opportunities of people’s investment and to increase the paid-up capital for developing the
small and medium enterprises; initiate and develop the private insurance enterprises; and to
increase the job opportunities through the development of microfinance businesses. Our
authorities have been implementing these goals of FSDP with the help of technical assistance
mainly from IMF, WB, ADB and support from other international partners. The
implementation status of the plan is very encouraging and in line with the plan despite some
challenges of human capacity constraints and still weak institutional infrastructure
developments. Nonetheless, our authorities have committed to continue making efforts to
speed up the development of financial sector.
12.
By most international standard, Myanmar’s financial sector is still small. And the
current structure of the financial system consists of four state owned banks, 23 private banks,
42 foreign bank representative offices, about 800 branches of banks, one state-owned
insurance company, 12 private insurance companies, 189 microfinance institutions licensed,
and 3 upcoming policy-based banks, impending entry of foreign banks and a nascent capital
market.
13.
While banking and financial sector is rapidly expanding, the authorities have made
strides to reform regulatory environment. Since 2011, the development of regulatory reforms
in financial sectors include passing microfinance law in 2011, enacting foreign exchange
management law in 2012, enacting new central bank law and securities exchange law in
2013, the process of drafting new financial institutional law is ongoing, the process of issuing
regulations for the central bank law and foreign exchange management law are in last stage.
Other CBM’s policies governing bank operations have also been changed depending on the
required situation.
14.
Our authorities note that current regulatory reforms need to be expedited given such a
rapidly expansion in financial sector, especially with the entry of foreign banks into the
system. As such, the authorities share staff’s view on that strengthening supervision is
critical, and a strengthened, rule-based and transparent regulatory environment should be
established before foreign banks commence operations. Our authorities are determined and
committed to this effort and look forward to additional TA to strengthen the policy and
regulatory framework in new areas of activities of both domestic and foreign banks.
15.
Anti Money Laundering and Counterterrorism law has been enacted in 2014, and its
bylaws are underway of in their second draft. Our authorities remain committed to implement
a strong AML/CFT system and to address the remaining deficiencies in its AML/CFT
regime.
Conclusion
16.
Although growth outlook is favorable, the authorities are mindful of the challenges in
implementing reform measures on many fronts given the capacity constraints. To this end,

5
our authorities acknowledge that institutional capacity building need to be enhanced in a
speedier way to help smooth reform process to ensure current growth momentum is
sustainable. In this regard, the authorities note that the role of international financial
institutions and countries in the region in helping to strengthen Myanmar’s capacity building.
Therefore, our authorities would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Fund, the World
Bank, the ADB and countries in the region for their support and policy recommendations
over the years and look forward for their continuous support as we move forward with our
economic reform program.
