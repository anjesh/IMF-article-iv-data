EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments and outlook
The global financial crisis has slowed the Burundian economy and contributed to a significant
decline in inflation. Economic growth moderated to 3.5 percent in 2009, from 4.5 percent in
2008, mainly because of lower private transfers and foreign direct investment. Because of lower
international oil and food prices, headline inflation (end of period) declined from about
26 percent in 2008 to about 4.5 percent in 2009. Supported by donor flows and the SDR
allocation, gross official reserves remained steady at 6.5 months of imports in 2008–09. The
economic outlook is generally positive but subject to risks from the security situation and
external environment.
Article IV consultation
Against the background of the East African Community (EAC) integration, the Article IV
consultation discussions focused on three fundamental themes: (i) accelerating growth and
reducing poverty, (ii) accelerating financial sector reform, and (iii) safeguarding fiscal
sustainability while progressing toward MDGs. The authorities generally agreed with staff
recommendations.
Staff and authorities agreed on the need to pursue appropriate growth-enhancing reforms.
Critical reforms intend to: (i) refocus capital spending on key infrastructure to help relieve major
supply bottlenecks (for example, electricity and irrigation for agriculture); (ii) continue to remove
economic distortions, especially in the agricultural sector, to boost total factor productivity; and
(iii) accelerate EAC integration to improve competitiveness and the business environment. On
financial sector reform, the authorities will adopt a comprehensive strategy in the first quarter of
2011.
Staff and authorities also agreed that achieving debt sustainability should anchor mediumterm fiscal policy. Given Burundi’s high risk of debt distress and low capacity, external
financing of the budget should be limited to grants and highly concessional loans. However, the
authorities noted that, in exceptional cases where such financing is not available for critical
growth-enhancing investment included in the authorities’ development strategy, recourse to
nonconcessional financing will be discussed with the Fund and World Bank staffs, consistent
with the new debt limits policy. The authorities and staff agreed on the need to continue reforms
of wages and employment to bring the wage bill down to sustainable levels.
Program issues
Performance under the ECF-supported program has been satisfactory. All quantitative
performance criteria and the structural benchmark for March 2010 were met. Structural reforms
are on track. The revised program for 2010 takes into account: (i) a new law to address the
security forces’ dissatisfaction with pay; (ii) the cost of the 2010 general elections; (iii) droughtrelated emergency spending; and (iv) the authorities’ decision to issue domestic bonds during
2010–11 to clear the liability (2.4 percent of 2010 GDP) from retroactive implementation of civil
servant statutes.

Staff recommends completion of the fourth review based on Burundi’s performance
and the strength of the program.

6
I. GENERAL CONTEXT
1.
Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world. GDP per capita is about
US$140, and more than two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line. While the
country is making some progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it is
unlikely that any will be achieved by 2015 (Table 1).
2.
The country is emerging from more than a decade of civil conflict. The powersharing agreement signed in December 2008 by the government and the last rebel group,
Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL), paved the way for a series of national
elections, which run from May 24 to September 8, 2010. However, after the communal
elections on May 24, the general security situation has deteriorated following the
withdrawal of the opposition parties due to their dissatisfaction with the electoral process.
The representatives of the international community in Burundi issued a statement
highlighting that independent observers, both national and international, conveyed a
generally positive assessment of the elections and invited the opposition parties to
reconsider their withdrawal. On June 28, the incumbent president won the presidential
elections in which the main opposition parties did not participate. Legislative elections,
scheduled for July 23, represent a significant test for the peace process.
3.
In a difficult postconflict environment, Burundi has made steady, though
uneven, progress in implementing its ECF-supported economic reforms. At the
conclusion of the 2008 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors urged the authorities to
further strengthen public financial management (PFM) and move forward with structural
reforms to improve the investment climate and spur growth. The HIPC decision point was
reached in August 2005 and the completion point in January 2009. Burundi’s PRSP was
published in September 2006. The latest annual progress report was completed in
December 2009.
4.
The World Bank’s country assistance strategy focuses on structural reforms to
further increase growth and reduce poverty. The main priorities are to (i) promote
sustainable and broad-based economic growth, (ii) improve access to social services and
consolidate social stability, and (iii) strengthen governance.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The global financial crisis has slowed the Burundian economy and contributed
to a significant decline in inflation. Economic growth moderated to 3.5 percent in 2009,
from 4.5 percent in 2008, mainly because of lower private transfers and foreign direct
investment. Because of lower international oil and food prices, headline inflation (end of
period) declined from about 26 percent in 2008 to about 4.5 percent in 2009, well within the
single-digit level targeted under the program.
6.
Fiscal performance in 2009 was broadly satisfactory (Table 3). Despite the global
financial crisis, total revenue was 0.6 percent of GDP higher than programmed, reflecting
improved collections of income and indirect taxes. Total spending was contained below the
programmed level, as externally-financed spending was lower than programmed. The wage
bill was also kept within the envisaged budgetary envelope. Overall, the fiscal deficit

7
(excluding grants) was lower than programmed. Adjusted for the shortfall in external
nonproject financial assistance, domestic financing of the budget was well within the
programmed target (MEFP, Table I.1).

7.
Monetary policy has been geared toward achieving price stability while
supporting economic recovery from the impact of two exogenous shocks. In 2008
reserve money grew by about 25 percent as the central bank sought to accommodate the
first-round effects of higher oil and food prices. With the onset of the global financial crisis
in 2009, monetary policy was eased, without endangering the single-digit inflation
objective.
8.
The global financial crisis did not have a significant impact on Burundi’s
banking system. However, the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report
identified concentration risk as a key vulnerability of the banking system.
9.
Despite the food and oil shock and the global financial crisis, the external
position was supported by Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) and Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) relief and the SDR allocation. Notwithstanding the
negative impact of the food and oil crisis on the trade balance, the external current account
deficit improved in 2008 because of high transfers to mitigate the effects of the shock. In
contrast, in 2009 the external current account deficit worsened, even as the terms of trade
improved, because of lower donor support. Overall, the balance of payments position was
supported by HIPC and MDRI relief and the SDR allocation. Gross reserves remained at a
very comfortable level of 6.5 months of import cover.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

10.
Against the background of the EAC integration, the Article IV consultation
discussions focused on three key themes: (i) accelerating growth and reducing poverty,
(ii) accelerating financial sector reform, and (iii) safeguarding fiscal sustainability while
achieving progress toward MDGs. In addition, the mission discussed important issues
related to the Article IV consultation. To set the stage for the policy discussions, staff
presented the updated macroframework.

Box 1. Burundi: Main Recommendations of the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Advice

Status

Improve PFM.

Substantial progress has been achieved
(see Table I.1, IMF Country Report No. 10/75).
The authorities intend to maintain the momentum
on PFM reforms.

Improve the composition of spending.

Social spending has increased. However, the wage
bill remains high. Security spending is also still
high, reflecting the uncertain security situation.
There is room to improve budgetary forecasts of
social spending.

Reform monetary and exchange
operations.

Monetary policy has become more market based,
but the central bank needs to make more active use
of available policy instruments. A symmetrical
foreign exchange auction has been created and
liquidity auctions have been revamped by
eliminating floor prices.

Maintain prudent debt management.

Debt management has been enhanced as a result of
the reorganization of the debt unit at the ministry
of finance and the upgrading of debt management
software. There was no recourse to nonconcessional loans.

Implement structural reforms to
stimulate private sector.

The privatization of the coffee sector has been
launched, but only 13 out of 117 washing stations
have been privatized, owing to limited investor
interest. Progress in the reform of the investment
climate has been slow.

10
A. Macroeconomic Framework and Supporting Policy Mix
11.
The economy is expected to modestly recover from the global financial crisis in
2010. Real GDP growth is projected to rise to 3.9 percent in 2010, from 3.5 percent in 2009,
mainly because of a substantial increase in coffee production and donor-financed
investment. Headline inflation in 2010 is projected to remain in single digits at 9.5 percent,
although drought has put upward pressure on food prices. Gross official reserves would
decline to 6 months of imports, as a result of sterilization.
12.
Provided the security and political situation continues to improve, Burundi’s
medium-term economic outlook is generally positive: (i) GDP growth is expected to
average about 5 percent in the medium term, up from about 4 percent from 2007–09;
(ii) average inflation would decelerate to 5 percent by 2014; and (iii) gross official reserves
would stabilize at six months of imports (Text Table 2), consistent with the EAC
convergence criterion. Economic growth is expected to be driven by three main factors:
(i) continued removal of major economic distortions, especially in the coffee sector, which
will boost total factor productivity; (ii) a substantial increase in aid-financed investment,
largely for infrastructure renovation, which will help relieve major supply bottlenecks; and
(iii) with EAC membership, access to a bigger market and the possibility of attracting more
investment in areas where Burundi has a comparative advantage (for example, agriculture
and tourism). The UN Policy for Post-Conflict Employment Creation, Income Generation
and Reintegration (UN-PCEIR) could also drive growth by promoting stability. There is
scope for a significant increase in growth in the medium term, should potential investments
in the mining sector materialize.
13.
The medium-term fiscal outlook is expected to improve. The overall fiscal deficit
(on a commitment basis, including non-HIPC grants) is projected to decline from an average
of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2005–09 to about 1.5 percent by 2013, supported by gradual
improvement in revenue collections. Driven by spending on PRSP priority areas, current
spending would average about 25 percent of GDP in 2010–15, broadly unchanged from
recent years. The wage bill is projected to decline gradually to 11 percent of GDP by 2015,
taking into account demobilization and the need to accommodate hiring in priority sectors.
Acknowledging the need for significant investment in public infrastructure and in
agriculture, the macroframework shows an increase in capital spending, supported by
project grants.
14.
A coherent policy mix will support the above macroframework. Appropriate
growth-enhancing reforms will underpin the growth strategy. Achieving debt sustainability
should anchor medium-term fiscal policy. Given Burundi’s high risk of debt distress and
low capacity (Joint DSA, Supplement I), improving export capacity and relying on grants
and highly concessional loans to finance the budget is critical for achieving debt
sustainability. Ongoing fiscal reforms will also help in this regard. These include the new
budget law and reforms of tax policy, revenue administration, expenditure policy, treasury
management, and debt management.

11
15.
Monetary policy is geared toward stabilizing prices while allowing sufficient
scope for improved economic growth. To this end, the central bank will continue to use
the reserve money as an operating target, and broad money as intermediate target. To affect
its operating target, the central bank relies on liquidity auctions. Close collaboration
between the central bank and the ministry of finance is critical for effective monetary policy.
Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies has been strengthened by the creation of the
cash flow management committee and regular monthly meetings between the BRB and the
ministry of finance (IMF Country Report No. 10/75, MEFP ¶21). A smooth transition from
the current auction system to an interbank-based market will introduce greater exchange rate
flexibility, thus enhancing monetary policy. In the medium-term, efforts to achieve EAC
monetary union convergence criteria will also help consolidate macroeconomic stability.

16.
There are, however, significant downside risks to the medium-term outlook.
Besides the possible deterioration in the political and security situation, risks include
(i) delays in macrocritical structural reforms that underpin the growth objectives, (ii) an
uncertain external environment, and (iii) slow progress toward EAC integration. Weak
institutional capacity could also endanger policy implementation.

12
B. Accelerating Growth and Reducing Poverty
Background
17.
Extended conflict lasting for 17 years has been the biggest constraint on growth
through its negative impact on investment. Consequently, the government will need to
undertake a major infrastructure rehabilitation program, with the help of development
partners.
18.
The reform of the coffee sector is of great economic importance. The sector is the
principal source of income for nearly 800,000 households, and coffee accounts for about
two-thirds of total exports. It is expected that the recent privatization of 13 coffee washing
stations will have positive spillover effects on the entire sector. Because interest from
foreign investors was initially limited, the government has decided to reissue the invitations
to bid at the end of the current coffee campaign.
19.
Regional integration is critical for achieving medium-term growth objectives.
EAC membership could spur growth, because it would give Burundi access to a bigger
market (a population of 120 million) and increase the possibility of attracting more
investment in areas where Burundi has a comparative advantage (for example, agriculture
and tourism). Aware of these potential advantages, the government has already established
an interministerial committee to coordinate and facilitate decision making in the context of
the EAC. In addition, a national strategy and action plan, prepared with the assistance of
development partners, will be examined by a technical team by end-July and submitted to
the new government for endorsement.
Staff advice


Refocus capital spending on key infrastructure that will help relieve major supply
bottlenecks (for example, electricity and irrigation). All investment projects should be
subject to rigorous cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses. The authorities
should seek World Bank technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the system of
appraisal, selection, and monitoring of investment projects. Staff underscored that
external financing should be limited to grants and highly concessional loans to avoid
unsustainable debt.



Continue to reform the coffee sector. Staff considers coffee sector privatization
critical for boosting total factor productivity. The authorities will also pursue reform
of other key sectors including tea and telecommunications, in consultation with the
World Bank.



Accelerate implementation of the EAC national strategy and action plan to achieve
nominal convergence and spur structural reforms that would improve competitiveness
and the business environment. Staff also discussed the authorities’ plan to liberalize
the capital account by 2014, in line with EAC requirements. Together with structural
reforms, this should further improve competitiveness and the business environment.
MCM could provide TA if requested.

13
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities concurred that political instability has been a major
impediment to economic growth, and they therefore expect a rapid economic
turnaround following peaceful elections. They emphasized that their growth strategy
stands on four sectoral pillars (agriculture, tourism, energy and water, and transport and
communication infrastructure) and capitalizes on EAC membership. They pointed out that
the creation of an agency to promote investment will contribute to strengthening the
confidence of national and foreign investors (MEFP ¶14).
21.
The authorities agreed with staff’s recommendations and made the following
points:


Efforts are underway to refocus capital spending on the identified four pillars of
growth. The authorities asked for donors to help them pursue this goal. In addition,
the project planning unit at the ministry of planning would be strengthened by
centralizing technical expertise on project analysis that is currently scattered across
ministries.



The privatization of coffee washing stations will be relaunched by the end of the
ongoing coffee season. Although the coffee sector is important for growth and
poverty reduction, stabilizing the population growth and reforming land tenure are
also critical.



Every effort will be made to rely on grants and highly concessional financing.
However, in exceptional cases, where such financing is not available for critical
growth-enhancing investment included in the authorities’ development strategy,
recourse to nonconcessional financing will be discussed with the Fund and World
Bank staffs to ensure consistency with Fund policy on debt limits.



Institutional capacity is still inadequate, despite substantial TA. It is therefore critical
to identify and focus on the most urgent technical assistance needs.
C. Accelerating Financial Sector Reform

Background
22.
Access to financial services is limited, reflecting the underdeveloped payments
system. Based on data from 2007–08, only 2 percent of the total population has a bank
account, and less than 0.5 percent use bank credit services. Consequently, cash transactions
predominate, and payment instruments are physically exchanged. Moreover, most small and
medium-size enterprises find it difficult to obtain credit, mainly because of lack of adequate
information on the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers, the unavailability of real
guarantees, and weak capacity of project preparation.
23.
The FSAP report is expected to guide reform in the financial sector. In
January 2009, staffs from the Fund and the Bank conducted the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) for Burundi. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment report was issued
to the Executive Board in October 2009. The authorities plan to use the FSAP report

14
findings to guide their financial sector reform strategy. Work in this area has been launched
with the creation of the National Strategy Committee by order of the ministry of finance.
24.
Consequent to the global financial crisis, the central bank took steps to enhance
banking supervision (MEFP, ¶12). Although the FSAP mission detected no obvious sign of
imminent systemic stress as a result of the crisis, the authorities have taken steps to
implement MCM recommendations on banking supervision, particularly those related to
risk-based supervision, and have raised minimum capital requirements. The central bank is
also taking steps to address concentration risk, a key vulnerability of the banking system
(Table 7). To mitigate this risk, the BRB will continue to scrutinize bank risk management
practices and lending standards and conduct stress tests, with the help of Central AFRITAC
TA.
Staff advice
25.
Staff emphasized the need to accelerate financial sector reform, drawing on the
FSAP report and consistent with EAC requirements. Priority reforms include:


Defining a strategy and policy for modernizing the infrastructure for the payment
system, in keeping with EAC action plans and international standards.



Modernizing the payment system’s legal framework.



Developing a complete clearing and settlement infrastructure, with the automation of
exchanges of small values (checks and automatic transfers) within an electronic
clearing system.

Authorities views
26.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment and policy advice. They
emphasized that the main objective of the financial sector reform is to broaden access to
financial services. With the newly established steering committee, work on financial sector
reform will accelerate, to enable the council of ministers to adopt a comprehensive strategy
in the first quarter of 2011.
27.
The authorities pointed out that urgent reforms are already underway, in close
coordination with World Bank technical and financial assistance. These urgent priorities
include: (i) modernizing the payment systems (which entails computerization of check
clearing); (ii) introducing electronic banking services; (iii) improving regulation and
supervision of commercial banks and microfinance institutions; (iv) setting up a credit
bureau to ensure effective assessment of borrowers’ creditworthiness; and (v) developing
domestic financial markets to provide long-term and stable sources of funds for banks.
D. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability While Achieving Progress Toward MDGs
Background
28.
To modernize the tax system, the government has introduced a series of major
reforms, including a VAT and the EAC common external tariff. However, given the
authorities’ limited administrative capacity and delays in setting up the Burundi Revenue

15
Authority (BRA), staff adopted a conservative revenue projection, until the gains from VAT
materialize. Staff will discuss the first-year implementation of VAT during the fifth review
and update the medium-term projections accordingly. At around 18.5 percent, the revenue to
GDP ratio is above the average of 17.3 percent of GDP for fragile states in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
29.
Expenditures are dominated by wages and security spending. At around
12 percent of GDP, the wage bill is above the authorities’ medium-term target of 11 percent
of GDP. Since recruitment in education and health sectors affects progress toward the
MDGs, the wage bill in these sectors will continue to grow owing to enormous needs for
teachers and health personnel. Achieving the medium-term target for the wage bill, while
continuing to recruit in priority sectors, will therefore hinge critically on reducing the size of
security forces.
Staff advice


Manage carefully the establishment of the BRA and broaden the tax base by
implementing the recommendations of recent FAD technical assistance. The BRA,
which was supposed to start operations in January 2010, is not yet fully functional
because of staffing delays. The authorities are taking all the necessary steps to
expedite the process, in order to safeguard government revenue.



In consultation with key donors including the World Bank, continue reforms of wage
and employment including wage policy and demobilization after the elections to
bring down the wage bill to sustainable levels.



Make spending more efficient by implementing recent PFM reforms and enhancing
governance and accountability in the use of public resources. Public tracking
expenditure surveys could help identify leakages and obstacles to effective service
delivery.



Implement the above policies in order to crowd in social spending and accelerate
progress toward achieving the MDGs.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment and policy advice and
emphasized that:


In coordination with the Department for International Development (DFID), steps
will be taken to shorten the transition from the old tax administration to the BRA. The
focus will be on quick staffing and a clear time-bound action plan.



Integration of former rebel groups has put pressure on the wage bill. They saw
demobilization as a critical component of their strategy to bring the wage bill down,
but cautioned that this has to be tackled with great care and only after elections, given
the political and social implications.



The medium-term debt profile could improve with future growth in the mining sector.

16
E. Other Article IV Issues
31.

The mission discussed other Article IV issues:



Trade policy. Significant reforms have been implemented to promote external trade.
These include external tariff reform in line with EAC requirements, a new investment
code consistent with best international practices, a new bankruptcy law, and a
commercial arbitration law. Looking forward, key priorities are easing administrative
obstacles to trade, establishing a single trade platform, and completing the reform of
the coffee and tea sectors.



Assessment of the exchange rate. Analysis of the official exchange rate suggests there
is no clear indication of significant misalignment. However, there is evidence that
structural factors are a constraint on competitiveness (Box 2). The mission informed
the authorities that MCM has reclassified their exchange rate system from “floating”
to “stabilized.” Staff urged the authorities to introduce more flexibility in the
exchange rate to help the economy adjust to external shocks and the EAC required
capital account liberalization planned for 2014.



Multiple currency practice subject to Article VIII issues. The authorities have
requested MCM and LEG TA to assist them to resolve the remaining multiple
currency practice.

32.
Serious shortcomings in data provision significantly hamper surveillance. While
some improvements in the fiscal area have been achieved, there are acute shortcomings in
national accounts and balance of payments statistics (Informational Annex, Supplement II)
that introduce uncertainty into estimates and projections. The statistical office suffers from
lack of qualified personnel and resources. With TA from the Fund and other donors, the
authorities are continuing efforts to strengthen economic and financial data.

17

Box 2. Burundi: Exchange Rate and Competitiveness Assessment
The general finding of the assessment is that there is no clear sign of significant misalignment of the
real exchange rate. However, there is substantial evidence that nonprice structural factors are a
major constraint on competitiveness.
Quantitative assessment of Burundi’s real
exchange rate (RER) is complicated by
data limitations in the national accounts
and balance of payments. The price and
volume volatility of the undiversified export
sector and the lack of an interbank foreign
exchange market further hinder the effort to
separate underlying trends from temporary
fluctuations.

methodology, staff estimates that the RER
was overvalued by 5.8 percent at end-2009 (Figure 1). Estimates based on the external sustainability
methodology generally confirm this finding. According to the latter approach, the medium-term
current account balance is approximately 1.3 percentage points of GDP below its underlying norm,
implying that the RER is modestly overvalued.

The authorities are taking steps to make the exchange rate more flexible. The recent launch of
symmetrical foreign exchange auctions and the creation of an interbank foreign exchange market in
the near future will increase the flexibility of the exchange rate.

Structural factors have been a major
constraint on competitiveness. Burundi has
one of the least friendly business
environments in the world, ranking 176 out of
183 countries in the World Bank’s 2010
Doing Business report and well below other
postconflict and EAC countries. Burundi
ranks particularly low on the efficiency of
procedures to trade externally (Figure 2).

Trading Across Borders

Integration to the EAC will help broaden the
market for exports and decrease the time and
costs associated with trading across borders.
Recent privatizations in the coffee sector
should increase productivity and realign
incentives.

18
IV. PROGRAM ISSUES
33.
Program implementation through March was generally satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks for end-March were met.
External assistance in the first quarter of 2010 was higher than programmed because of the
late disbursement of budget support initially planned for 2009. These disbursements were
used to pay down central bank advances temporarily extended in 2009 as bridge-financing
for delayed budget support.
34.
Fiscal policy in 2010 will continue to be geared toward addressing debt
sustainability concerns. Given Burundi’s high risk of debt distress and low capacity,
external financing of the budget will be limited to grants and highly concessional loans. The
fiscal reforms of the past three years will also help ensure debt sustainability. These include
the new budget law and the reforms of tax policy, revenue administration, expenditure
policy, treasury management, and debt management (IMF Country Report No. 10/75,
MEFP Table I.1).
35.
The authorities recognize that mobilizing domestic revenue is critical for fiscal
sustainability and increased poverty-reducing expenditure (MEFP, ¶16). The revised
revenue target for 2010 is 18.3 percent of GDP, 0.2 percentage point of GDP lower than
originally programmed because of delays in staffing the BRA. To safeguard the revenue
target, staff urged the authorities to continue their efforts to broaden the revenue base by
reducing exemptions and strengthening tax and customs administration. In particular, the
authorities will take all the necessary steps to expedite the staffing of the BRA.
36.
The primary objective of expenditure policy in 2010 is to significantly improve
the composition of public spending in favor of priority sectors (MEFP, ¶17).
Accordingly, propoor spending is expected to increase by about 1.8 percent of GDP. In line
with Burundi’s poverty reduction strategy, MDRI resources will be spent on agriculture,
water, rural infrastructure, health, and education.
37.
The program for 2010 has been revised (Table 3) to take into account: (i) a new
law to address the security forces’ dissatisfaction with pay; (ii) the government’s
contribution of 0.8 percent of GDP to the cost of the 2010 general elections (3.3 percent of
GDP); (iii) drought-related emergency spending; and (iv) the authorities’ decision to issue
domestic bonds to clear during 2010–11 the liability (2.4 percent of 2010 GDP) from
retroactive implementation of the civil servant statutes (IMF Country Report No. 10/75;
MEFP, ¶17).
38.


Staff and authorities agreed on the following:
Finance the impact of the new law on the security forces’ pay (about 0.7 percent of
GDP) by using the budgeted reserve fund (0.5 percent of GDP) and by cutting
nonpriority spending on goods and services (0.2 percent of GDP) while guarding
against accumulation of arrears.

19


Accommodate drought-related emergency spending of 0.5 percent of GDP through
increased domestic borrowing.



Accommodate domestically financed elections spending of 0.8 percent of GDP. It is
likely that additional donor financing for the elections will be provided, thus reducing
the government’s contribution. Staff urged donors to honor their commitments to
finance most elections-related spending to avoid crowding out domestic funding for
high-priority spending.



The macro framework incorporates the authorities’ decision to issue domestic bonds
to clear during 2010–11 the liability (2.4 percent of 2010 GDP) from retroactive
implementation of the civil servant statutes. This one-time operation was motivated
by the need to: (i) end more than two months of strike by teachers and to forestall
social instability ahead of the elections, and (ii) cement peace after 17 years of
conflict. This reinforces the need to pursue structural reforms to bring down the wage
bill.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

39.
In a difficult postconflict environment, Burundi has made steady, though
uneven, progress. Most monetary and fiscal reforms have progressed. However, structural
reform has generally been slow, because of limited institutional capacity and political
instability.
40.
Burundi’s medium-term economic outlook is positive as long as the security
situation continues to improve. Near-term growth is projected to rise, supported by a good
coffee harvest, though inflation would remain high, driven by rising food prices. Economic
growth in the medium term would be markedly higher, propelled by improved political
conditions, EAC membership, and increased donor assistance.
41.
Staff urges the authorities to anchor medium-term fiscal policy to debt
sustainability. Given the high risk of debt distress and low capacity, the budget should be
financed only by grants and highly concessional external financing. Improvements in
governance will be critical for donor support. In this regard, the authorities should further
strengthen PFM and manage public expectations of a peace dividend, especially for public
employees.
42.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue their efforts to reform the financial
sector by improving banking supervision, modernizing the payment system, and addressing
weaknesses in the banking system, notably concentration risk.
43.
Sustained growth depends on accelerating structural reforms. Staff urges the
authorities to pursue appropriate growth-enhancing reforms by refocusing capital spending
on key infrastructure, accelerating EAC integration, and advancing financial sector reform.
44.
The exchange rate seems to be broadly in line with its equilibrium rate. Analysis
of the real exchange rate suggests there is no clear indication of significant misalignment,

20
but there is significant evidence that structural factors are a major constraint on
competitiveness.
45.
Burundi maintains one multiple currency practice inconsistent with
Article VIII, Section 3. The authorities have not sought, and staff does not recommend,
approval.
46.
The data provided to the Fund are generally inadequate for effective
surveillance, especially national accounts and balance of payments data. Priority should be
given to improving statistics in these areas.
47.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth review under the three-year ECF
arrangement based on Burundi’s performance and the strength of the program. Staff also
recommends approval of the modification of performance criteria, which stems from the
factors outlined in paragraph 38. Risks to the program can be mitigated by sound policies
and reforms, in coordination with Burundi’s development partners.
48.
The authorities’ intention to make public the staff report, the letter of intent,
and the MEFP is welcome. Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with
Burundi be held on the 24-month consultation cycle in accordance with
Decision No. 12794-(02/76) of July 2002, as amended by Decision No. 12854-(02/96) of
September 12, 2002, and Decision No. 13562-(05/85), October 5, 2005.

APPENDIX I
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
BURUNDI
LETTER OF INTENT
Bujumbura, July 7, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
On July 7, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
approved a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for the Republic of
Burundi. This agreement supports of the medium-term program (from April 1, 2008 to
March 31, 2011) to consolidate the macroeconomic stabilization process, reduce poverty,
promote structural reforms and strengthen governance. In accordance with the terms of this
arrangement, the government discussed program implementation for the fourth review under the
arrangement with a mission from the IMF. The discussions focused on the implementation of the
program during the period from October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010, as well as the outlook and
economic and financial measures to be implemented in 2010.
2.
On the political front, the government continues to make every effort to consolidate the
peace process. Within this framework and assisted by development partners, the government of
Burundi has taken all the necessary steps to ensure the success of the elections to be held
between May 24 and September 8, 2010.
3.
On the economic and social front, the government is pleased to report that
implementation of the program has been satisfactory, despite the difficult international situation
resulting from the global financial crisis, and the domestic situation marked by teachers’ strikes
and drought in the northern part of the country. In particular, all quantitative performance
criteria and the structural benchmark for end-March 2010 were met.
4.
The government is resolved to continue implementing the policies and measures
described in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Memorandum on Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) attached to this letter complements those preceding it since
June 24, 2008.
5.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of its program. It will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. The Burundian authorities will consult the IMF on the adoption of
such measures in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with IMF policies on such consultations.

31
6.
The government of Burundi will provide the IMF with such information as it may
request to monitor the progress made in economic and financial policy implementation. It will
also carry out reviews of the ECF-supported program with the IMF every six months. The fifth
review should be completed no later than January 2011 and the sixth and final review no later
than June 2011.
7.
In view of the considerable progress made in implementing the ECF-supported program,
the government is requesting completion of the fourth review and the fifth ECF disbursement in
an amount equivalent to SDR 6.6 million. The government is also requesting modification of
the end-September performance criteria to reflect the revised program.
8.
As in the past, the Burundian authorities wish to make this letter available to the public,
along with the attached MEFP and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), as
well as the IMF staff report on the fourth ECF review. We therefore authorize their publication
and posting on the IMF website, subject to Executive Board approval. These documents will
also be posted on the official sites of the government of Burundi.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
BURUNDI
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Bujumbura, July 7, 2010

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) complements the
preceding MEFPs since June 24, 2008. It reviews program implementation and updates the
medium-term outlook and economic and financial policies that will be implemented in 2010
within the framework of the program covering April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2011. The measures
and objectives contained in this MEFP are compatible with the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) published in September 2006 and the findings of the annual PRSP
implementation report sent to the IMF and the World Bank in December 2009.
2.
Economic policy will continue to be guided by the following objectives: (1) maintain
single-digit inflation; (2) improve the composition of public spending to the benefit of priority
sectors, while preserving fiscal sustainability; (3) strengthen public financial management
(PFM) and good governance; and (4) strengthen the internal control systems of the central bank.
3.
With the continued improvement in the security situation, the macroeconomic objectives
are as follows for the period of the ECF: (1) GDP growth should average approximately
5 percent over the medium term, compared to the 2007–09 average of approximately 4 percent;
(2) average inflation should slow to about 5 percent in 2014; and (3) gross official reserves
should stabilize at about six months of import coverage in the medium term, in accordance with
the convergence criteria of the East African Community (EAC).
II. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
4.
The global financial crisis has slowed Burundi’s economy and contributed to a strong
decline in inflation. Economic growth slowed to 3.5 percent in 2009 from 4.5 percent in 2008,
mainly due to a decline in remittances and foreign direct investments. In line with falling world
food and fuel prices, end-of-period inflation fell from about 26 percent in 2008 to about
4.5 percent in 2009. The current account deficit widened, reaching 14.5 percent of GDP, with
the delays in donor support outweighing the positive effect of lower food and fuel prices. Gross
official reserves in 2009 remained broadly stable, at about 6.5 months of import coverage.
5.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, including non-HIPC grants) is estimated at about
5.2 percent of GDP, above the target of 4.3 percent. Domestic revenues accounted for
18.6 percent of GDP, compared to the program target of 18 percent of GDP. Total spending was
lower than programmed by about 7 percentage points of GDP, due to lower externally-financed
spending. The 2009 wage bill was kept within the envisaged budgetary envelope.

33
6.
The monetary situation was characterized by stronger than expected growth of broad
money, due to strong growth in domestic credit. Reserve money was also larger than expected
because net foreign assets of the central bank declined by less than expected.
7.
Performance of the ECF-supported program was generally satisfactory. All indicative
targets for end-December 2009 were met, with the exception of the indicative target on reserve
money. All quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2010 were met.
8.
In close collaboration with development partners, the government is strongly pursuing
structural reform, notably the promotion of transparency and good fiscal management, financial
sector reform, coffee sector reform, and the improvement of the business environment. In
addition to the achievements described in the preceding memoranda, significant progress has
been achieved in all of these areas since the third review.
9.
In the area of PFM, the action plan of the PFM strategy for 2010 and 2011 has been
revised. In accordance with the new Organic Law on Public Finance, a new convention between
the government and the BRB has been signed and a draft General Regulation on Public Budget
Management has been finalized and sent to the Cabinet. To strengthen cash flow management, a
Cash Flow Management Committee has been created and the “Office of Cash Flow
Management” has been reorganized. This has allowed the regular preparation of monthly and
weekly cash flow plans, which are now harmonized with the commitment plan. Rationalization
of government accounts is making steady progress, without interfering with the smooth
operation of the units concerned. In this context, a new government account inventory operation
was launched, allowing identification of 55 accounts to be closed before end-June 2010 and
34 others to be closed by end-December 2010 at the latest. To modernize revenue
administration, efforts are under way to make the Burundi Revenue Authority (BRA) fully
operational. Specifically, 22 key posts have been filled, including those of commissioner
general and assistant commissioner general, as well as tax commissioners and customs
commissioners. With respect to customs, the SYDONIA++ computer system has been expanded
to other customs posts, and installation of the RADDEX system will allow better accounting of
customs revenues at the EAC level.
10.
Significant steps have been taken to continue to improve transparency in PFM. In the
area of public procurement, an Executive Director and support personnel have been named to
the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority. Moreover, annual plans for procurement have
been prepared to facilitate transparent budget implementation. Regarding budget classification,
a new nomenclature was introduced with the 2010 budget to make it consistent with the new
chart of accounts. In the areas of control and audit, the final report of the auditor general on
implementation of the 2008 budget has been finalized.
11.
In the financial sector, the process of developing the Financial Sector Reform
Strategy (FSRS) has been launched with the creation of the National Strategy Committee (NSC)
by order of the Minister of Finance. Adoption of the FSRS by the Cabinet is expected in the
first quarter of 2011. A plan to develop the financial market in Burundi is also being prepared.
In the area of foreign exchange, improvements have been made to the symmetrical foreign
exchange auction market (Marché des Enchères Symétrique en Devises (MESD)). Accordingly,
the central bank now systematically publishes complete information after each MESD session in

34
order to increase the representativeness of the exchange rate, reduce its rigidity and increase its
transparency. Likewise, the MESD room has been computerized to increase the efficiency of the
daily sessions. In the area of monetary policy, the central bank is preparing to introduce REPO
trading as an instrument of monetary policy. For this purpose, the associated regulatory texts
(Global Master Repurchase Agreement, Code of Conduct and Operations Guide) have been
drafted and discussed with the banks.
12.
In the area of banking supervision, on-site inspections are now conducted according to
risk-based supervisory procedures, but a detailed supervisory handbook remains to be prepared
to better guide the supervisors. All banks and all financial institutions respect the minimum
capital requirements of BIF 5 billion and BIF 4 billion respectively. Moreover, the process to
mobilize funds in order to increase capital to 10 billion BIF by end-December 2010 has
advanced. In the area of safeguard measures, an international auditor was recruited at end-June,
2010 to (1) track the complete implementation of all recommendations formulated by the
special audits of 2008, based on the September 2009 action plan prepared by the BRB and the
Ministry of Finance; and (2) perform special audits of the controls on important disbursements
and transfers on behalf of the government or its creditors during the first half of 2010.
13.
With respect to the reform of the coffee sector, invitations to bid for 117 coffee washing
stations, grouped together into 29 lots, were published on June 5, 2009, and the bids were
opened on August 6, 2009. Investors showed limited interest and only 13 washing stations were
sold as the result of this process. The government has already decided to reissue the invitations
to bid at the end of the current coffee campaign.
14.
Significant measures have been taken to improve the business environment. In
particular, the revision of the Commercial Code now underway is intended to facilitate business
by simplifying procedures and increasing alignment with international standards with regard to
business law. The competition law, which focuses on the required harmonization of taxes within
COMESA and the EAC, defines and provides sanctions for unfair practices in the conduct of
business. Finally, the creation of the Agency to Promote Investments (API) will contribute to
strengthening the confidence of national and foreign investors by guaranteeing respect for the
application of Investment Code directives.
III. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICIES FOR 2010
15.
The revised macroeconomic framework for 2010 is as follows: (1) GDP growth is
expected to pick up slightly to 3.9 percent; (2) end-of-period inflation is expected to be around
9.5 percent; and (3) gross official reserves are expected to stabilize at six months of import
coverage. The government will implement all tax, public spending, monetary and foreign
exchange and structural policies as described below and in the January 21, 2010, MEFP.
16.
It is essential to raise sufficient domestic revenue to ensure fiscal sustainability and to
increase poverty-reducing expenditures. Accordingly, the government will take special
measures to make the BRA fully operational as soon as possible. To ensure that the revenue
target is achieved, major fiscal and administrative policy measures will also be taken. In
particular, the government has already increased the VAT taxable base on petroleum products to
comply with the law on the VAT. The general tax base will also be expanded by: (1) rigorous
monitoring of exemptions; (2) establishment of the investigation and research unit;

35
(3) strengthening of cross-checking between customs and government procurement; and
(4) recovery of arrears and rigorous monitoring of tax filing obligations of enterprises. The
government will also expedite the implementation of IMF technical assistance
recommendations on VAT implementation. In the area of customs, the ex ante controls of
customs valuations and post-declaration audits will be strengthened with assistance from an
import verification firm.
17.
The primary objective of expenditure policy in 2010 is to significantly improve the
composition of public spending in favor of priority sectors in order to accelerate progress
toward the MDGs. Accordingly, pro-poor spending is expected to increase by about 1.8 percent
of GDP. To protect priority spending, the government has identified non-priority spending that
will be cut if there is a decline in revenues or financing.
18.
In consultation with IMF staff, the program has been revised to take into account: (1) the
new law on security force remuneration; (2) the cost of the 2010 general elections; and
(3) emergency spending due to the drought. These three elements have resulted in an increase in
public spending of about 1.2 percent of GDP compared to the initial program and in an increase
in domestic financing. The program revision also reflects the government’s decision to issue
bonds to eliminate the liabilities resulting from the retroactive implementation of the civil
service statutes (2.4 percent of 2010 GDP) during 2010–11.
19.
The 2010 government wage bill is currently expected to be 12.2 percent of GDP. The
government will continue its objective of bringing the wage bill below 11 percent over the
medium term. Since recruitment in the education and health sectors affects progress towards the
MDGs, the wage bill for these sectors will continue to grow, due to the enormous needs for
teachers and health personnel. Thus, achievement of the medium-term wage bill target will
depend on continued demobilization. In light of the political and social implications of this
operation, it may not be possible to address these issues until after the 2010 elections.
20.
In support of fiscal policy, the government will strengthen the implementation of the
sliding quarterly cash flow plan. Harmonization of expenditure commitment and cash flow
plans will take place at the beginning of each quarter and the results will be submitted to the
Minister of Finance for approval. In this context, all budget spending will require the prior
authorization of the Minister of Finance and be executed strictly on the basis of financing
availability. A quarterly budget allocation will be defined for each ministry, with strict
expenditure prioritization.
21.
Given the high risk of debt distress and low capacity, Burundi will seek only
concessional external financing or grants. The government will not contract any
nonconcessional foreign debt and will ensure that all loans contracted have a grant element of at
least 50 percent.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
22.
Program implementation will continue to be subject to half-yearly reviews, performance
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks as specified in Tables I.1 to I.4. The
information to be reported to the IMF and the definitions of the pertinent variables can be found

36
in the attached TMU. The government is also ready to adopt, in consultation with IMF staff, any
new financial or structural measures necessary for the program’s success.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH
BURUNDI
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Bujumbura, July 7, 2010

1.
This technical memorandum of understanding covers the agreements on monitoring
implementation of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
Arrangement. It sets out the definitions of program variables to monitor implementation of
the program and the reporting requirements for the government of Burundi and the Bank of
the Republic of Burundi (BRB). It defines quantitative performance criteria, indicative
targets, and applicable adjusters.
A. Quantitative Program Targets
Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
2.

The quantitative performance criteria for the program as shown in the MEFP
are as follows:
 net foreign assets of the BRB (floor);
 net domestic assets of the BRB (ceiling);
 net domestic financing of the government (ceiling);
 external payment arrears of the government (ceiling, continuous);
 stock of short-term external debt (maturity of less than one year) of the
government and the BRB (ceiling, continuous); and
 new nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government or the BRB (ceiling, continuous).

3.
The quantitative indicative targets for the program, shown in the MEFP, are as
follows:




accumulation of domestic arrears (ceiling);
propoor spending (floor); and
reserve money (ceiling).

42

Definitions and measurement
4.
The net foreign assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between (i) gross
official reserves (valued at market prices) and other claims; and (ii) foreign exchange
liabilities to nonresident entities (including the use of Fund resources, and liabilities arising
from the use of any SDR allocation). The gross official reserves of the BRB are defined as
those foreign assets that are liquid and freely available to the BRB.
5.
The net domestic assets of the BRB are defined as the difference between
(i) reserve money, comprising currency in circulation, reserves of commercial banks, and
other deposits held at the BRB; and (ii) net foreign assets of the BRB.
Adjuster for changes in the compulsory reserves coefficients
6.
The ceiling on net domestic assets of the BRB will be adjusted symmetrically for
any change in the compulsory reserves coefficient applied to deposits in commercial banks
by the amount of the new coefficient minus that stipulated in the program, multiplied by
bank deposits subject to compulsory reserves. The rate stipulated in the program is currently
3 percent.
7.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the change in
(i) outstanding loans, advances, and other credit to the government from the BRB and all of
Burundi’s commercial banks; (ii) plus the stock of all government securities held by the
nonbank public denominated in Burundi francs, including that held by nonresidents;
(iii) less government deposits held in the BRB or in Burundi’s commercial banks. The
coverage of government is defined as central government and any other special funds or
operations that are part of the budgetary process or have a direct impact on the government’s
financial position.
8.
The stock of external payment arrears for program monitoring purposes is defined
as the end-of-period amount of external debt service due and not paid within the grace
period defined by a creditor, including contractual and late interest, for which a clearance
agreement is not in place or for which arrears are not reschedulable. For arrears to exist, a
creditor must claim payment of amounts due and not paid. Amounts in dispute are not
considered arrears. Arrears for which a clearance framework has been agreed with the
creditor or which are subject to rescheduling or restructuring are not considered arrears for
program monitoring purposes. Program arrears would include any debt service due under
such agreements that has not been paid.
9.
The program includes a ceiling on new nonconcessional external debt contracted
or guaranteed by the government and the BRB. This performance criterion applies to the
contracting or guaranteeing by the central government, local governments, or the BRB of
new nonconcessional external debt (as specified below) with an original maturity of one
year or more, including commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received. Debt contracted by state-owned enterprises is included in the overall ceiling, if
guaranteed by the government. The term “debt” shall be understood as defined in the

43
Executive Board Decision No. 12274, Point 9 as revised on December 1, 2009,
(Decision No. 14416-(09/91). Debt rescheduling and restructuring are excluded from the
criterion. Included are financial leases and other instruments giving rise to external
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on nonconcessional terms. In determining the level of
concessionality of these obligations, the definition of concessional borrowing shall apply.
Concessional debt is defined as having a grant element of 50 percent or more. The grant
element of debt is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal
value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time
of contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due
on this debt. The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan
agreement, including maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and
management fees. For loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the 10-year average
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD should be used as the
discount rate for assessing the level of concessionality, while the 6-month average CIRRs
should be used for loans with shorter maturities. To both the 10-year and the 6-month
average CIRRs, the following margins should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods
of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and
1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The performance criterion is defined to exclude the use of
Fund resources and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents.
10.
The stock of short-term external debt with a maturity of less than one year owed
by the central government is to remain at zero under the program. Normal import credits are
excluded from this ceiling. Loans with an initial maturity, as recorded in the original loan
agreement, of one year or more are considered medium-term or long-term loans. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received (including
leases). Excluded from this performance criterion are rescheduling arrangements, borrowing
from the IMF, and any Burundi franc-denominated treasury securities held by nonresidents.
As of September 2007, the stock of short-term debt outstanding was nil.
11.
Consistent with the PRSP, the authorities’ definition of propoor spending is based on
three criteria: (i) social character of spending, based on the administrative classification of
spending (this includes “social services” spending and part of “general services” and
“economic services” spending if it has a social character component); (ii) consistency with
one of the four PRSP pillars; and (iii) propoor investment spending, financed by donors.
12.
The accumulation of domestic arrears is measured by the accumulation of nonexecuted payment orders older than 60 days.
External financial assistance adjustor
13.
The program provides for adjusters to allow higher than expected external assistance
to be spent (with a cap) and shortfall of external assistance to be financed domestically (with
a cap).

44
14.
Any financing excess up to US$60 million will be spent on expenditure priorities
defined in the PRSP. The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted
upward, and the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic
financing to the government will be adjusted downward to accommodate 100 percent of any
financing excess above US$60 million.
15.
The floor on the stock of net foreign assets of the BRB will be adjusted downward,
and the ceilings on the net domestic assets of the BRB and on net domestic financing to the
government will be adjusted upward to accommodate a financing shortfall up to a maximum
of US$60 million. External financial assistance will be converted to Burundi francs using
the program-specified BIF/US$ exchange rate. The average program exchange rate in 2010
is 1290.
16.
External financial assistance (measured in US$) is defined to include the following:
(i) nonproject loans and grants to the budget (including payments made through the multidonor trust fund managed by the World Bank for current debt service to multilaterals); plus
(ii) debt relief on current maturities; minus (iii) any cash payments for external arrears
clearance operations. Donor disbursements into blocked accounts for the purpose of clearing
arrears will not be considered foreign assistance for program monitoring purposes.
B. Provision of Information to IMF Staff
17.
To facilitate the monitoring of program implementation, the authorities will prepare
and forward to the IMF African Department a monthly progress report on the program,
within six weeks of the end of each month, containing
18.

The following weekly data:
 foreign exchange auction market (MESD) transactions;
 the balance sheet of the BRB (weekly statement) (BRB Research
Department).

19.

 a table on foreign exchange cash flow (BRB Foreign Banking Operations
Department);
 the monetary survey, including the breakdown of the BRB and of commercial
banks (BRB Research Department);
 monthly exchange-rate data (official and parallel markets, end-of-month and
monthly average) (BRB Research Department);
 a detailed breakdown of government revenue (Ministry of Finance);
 a detailed breakdown of government expenditure on a commitment basis,
including propoor spending (Ministry of Finance);
 a detailed breakdown of the servicing of domestic and external public debt,

and debt relief granted by Burundi's external creditors (Ministry of Finance); and
 an update on the implementation of structural measures planned under the
program (REFES).

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2010
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association

Sudarshan Gooptu and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
July 9, 2010
Based on the external Low Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),
Burundi faces a high risk of debt distress. The present value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio
exceeds the country-specific threshold throughout the projection period by a wide margin,
while alternative scenarios and stress tests suggest that all but one debt indicators will
breach indicative thresholds. The public DSA suggests that while Burundi is in a position to
service its public and publicly guaranteed debt, a worsening of the fiscal balance and lower
growth would lead to a considerable deterioration of debt indicators. Burundi should
continue to implement prudent borrowing policies, and accelerate structural reforms,
particularly in infrastructure development and export diversification, to mitigate risks to debt
sustainability.1
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The last LIC DSA conducted in 2009 concluded that Burundi faced a high risk
of debt distress.2 The PV of debt-to-exports ratio exceeded the country-specific policydependent threshold for most of the projection period, reflecting the country’s narrow export
base. In addition, all debt stock indicators and one liquidity indicator exceeded the countryspecific debt burden thresholds when subjected to stress tests.

Burundi’s domestic public debt accounts for an increasing share of total public debt.
At about 21 percent of GDP, domestic debt accounted for about 43 percent of total public
debt in 2009, compared with 13 percent in 2007. The main reason for the increasing
importance of domestic debt was the cancellation of external public debt as a result of HIPC
Initiative and MDRI debt relief. Most domestic public debt is owed to the central bank and
has been used to finance the government’s operations.
4.
External debt stock indicators at end-2009 varied modestly compared to projections
made at the time of the previous LIC DSA. Debt stock indicators were higher than projected,
while liquidity indicators were slightly lower (Text Table 2). The largest increase in debt
inidcators was for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio. The increase was primarily the result of
lower exports driven largely by lower coffee prices and the cyclical nature of coffee
production (Text Table 3). Lower borrowing helped moderate the increase in the PV of debtto-exports ratio.

General government, on a gross basis. As noted in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, debt
contracted by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with a government guarantee is included in debt limits and
therefore in the DSA.
4

Among multilateral creditors, agreements have been signed with BADEA, the EU, and the OFID Fund, while
negotiations are ongoing with IFAD. Among non-Paris Club creditors, agreements have been signed with
Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The People’s Republic of China cancelled all of its claims during
the interim period. The terms of some of the signed agreements were less favorable than those envisaged under
the HIPC Initiative.

continued consolidation of peace,
macroeconomic stability, improvements in the business environment, and Burundi’s
integration to the East African Community (EAC). Total investment is expected to average
about 22 percent of GDP, a level considered supportive of economic growth. Exports of
goods and services will be driven by investments in key export sectors over the medium term
(coffee, tea, sugar and horticulture). The external current account deficit, including grants,
will decline over time, despite lower donor support. Financing will continue to be in the form
of grants and highly concessional loans. Fiscal policy will be supportive of economic growth

49
and poverty reduction, while safeguarding debt sustainability. The fiscal deficit is expected to
gradually decline and reach fiscal balance during the later years. Revenue mobilization,
reinforced by the newly created Burundi Revenue Authority, will lead to a gradual increase
in government revenues, while expenditure will gradually decline to more sustainable levels.
7.
Investment spending will be critical for achieving higher growth. Important areas of
investment include infrastructure renovation (power, transport, and communications) and
export-generating activities such as tourism and mining. Key projects to be undertaken over
the short to medium term include the development of Burundi’s domestic hydroelectric
potential (Kaganuzi, Mpanda, Kabu 16) and provision of adequate power lines with
necessary substations to all provincial capitals. The rehabilitation and maintenance of
national highways and community and rural road networks will also contribute to improving
Burundi’s infrastructure gap. Implementing fundamental structural reforms—which has
already begun—is needed to facilitate the necessary increase in private investment. These
reforms include measures to improve the business regulatory environment and increase
competition.5 There is scope for a significant increase in growth in the medium and long
term, should potential investments in the mining sector materialize.6
8.
Four essential differences underpin the current macroeconomic framework compared
to the one used in the previous LIC DSA: (i) real GDP growth is lower over the medium
term reflecting the impact of the global crisis, but catches up to the trend growth of 5 percent
assumed in the previous LIC DSA by 2013; (ii) exports and imports of goods and services
are assumed to grow at a somewhat slower pace over the projection period, partly from lower
WEO prices; (iii) nominal GDP is lower owing to the decline in inflation in 2009; and
(iv) the PV of debt, everything else the same, is higher because of a lower discount rate.
9.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are significant. A worsening of the political,
social and security situation would endanger donor support and lead to a rapid deterioration
of debt indicators. Exogenous shocks, for instance higher oil and food prices, and lower
donor support would further worsen debt indicators.

5

The 2010 World Bank Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) for Burundi provides detailed
recommendations to overcome supply-side constraints, continue to improve the regulatory environment,
increase competition, enhance the country’s image as a business and investment destination, and strengthen the
dialogue between the government and the private sector.
6

The development of mining will require a substantial infrastructure investment. The 2010 CEM estimated that
the impact of increased infrastructure spending (as reflected in the Infrastructure Action Plan) combined with
accelerated growth reforms could potentially lead to higher growth rate averaging about 8.5 percent for the
period 2010–15.

50
Box 1: Burundi: Main Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2010–30
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 5 percent over the medium term reflecting the
consolidation of peace, the easing of infrastructure bottlenecks, the reform of the coffee sector,
and EAC integration. Average growth over the projection period is expected to be about
4.9 percent, compared with an average of 4.2 percent during 2006–09. Investment is expected to
average about 22 percent of GDP, a level considered to be supportive of long-term economic
growth. Key areas include infrastructure rehabilitation (power, transport, and communications)
to address existing bottlenecks and export-generating activities such as tourism and mining.
Inflation is assumed to decline gradually over the medium term and stabilize at about 5 percent
over the long term, in line with the EAC convergence criterion.
Fiscal policy would be supportive of economic growth and poverty reduction, while safeguarding
debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability.


Revenues, excluding grants, are projected to increase gradually to about 21 percent of GDP
over the end of the projection period. This increase reflects primarily a widening of the tax
base as a result of continued tax administration reforms.



Primary expenditure is expected to gradually decline over time to about 31 percent of
GDP. This path is consistent with a gradual reduction of current spending in favor of higher
pro-poor spending. Public investment is expected to gradually decline over time to about
15 percent of GDP while private investment gradually rises as the private sector becomes
the engine of growth.

Exports of goods and services are projected to increase by an average of 12.4 percent over the
medium term reflecting the impact of coffee sector reforms; they are projected to increase by
8 percent over the longer term as investment in new export sectors (horticulture, mining, and
tourism) begins to yield results. In volume terms, exports of goods are projected to stabilize at
about 5.5 percent over the medium term, before gradually declining to about 4.5 percent in the
later years.
Imports of goods and services will decelerate from an average of about 7 percent over the
medium term to the more sustainable rate of about 3 percent over the longer term. With
emergency and reconstruction-related imports winding down, merchandise import volumes are
expected to move broadly in line with real GDP growth in the later years.
The current account deficit, including grants, is expected to stay at about 10 percent of GDP
over the medium term. It will subsequently deteriorate as official transfers begin to wane, before
declining gradually to about 8 percent at the end of the projection period. Excluding transfers,
the current account deficit is expected to decline from 29 percent of GDP in 2010 to about
11 percent at the end of the projection period. The authorities will rely largely on grants and
highly concessional loans to finance the current account deficit.
External financing will rely increasingly on loans in the long term, as grants’ share of total
financing gradually subsides. Grant support is assumed to decline from 28 percent of GDP in
2010 to about 20 percent in 2016 as humanitarian assistance gradually declines. Loans are
assumed to gradually decline from about 3 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 1 percent in the later
years. Borrowing is assumed to be on highly concessional terms.

III. EXTERNAL DSA
10.
Under the baseline scenario, there is a protracted and sizable breach of the PV of debtto-exports indicative threshold. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio will remain well above the
100 percent threshold throughout the projection period.7 During 2011–13, this ratio will exceed
the indicative threshold by at least 100 percentage points. In contrast, the PV of debt-to-GDP,
the PV of debt-to-revenues, the debt service to exports ratio, and the debt service to revenue
ratios are expected to remain well below the indicative country-specific thresholds throughout
the projection period (Text Table 5 and Table 1).8

11.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests highlight the risk of further deterioration in the PV
of debt-to-exports ratio. The most severe breach of the indicative threshold for the PV of debtto-exports ratio occurs under a combination of growth, export, inflation, and FDI/transfers
shock (Table 2, test B5). Under these circumstances, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio at the end
of the projection period is higher by about 120 percentage points compared to the baseline
scenario. This result underscores the importance of improvements in the business environment
to encourage investment flows, continued governance reforms to safeguard donor support, and
export diversification to reduce vulnerability to shocks. The alternative scenario based on new
borrowing at higher interest rates (Table 2, scenario A2) shows that there is a protracted
deterioration in Burundi’s PV of debt-to-exports ratio compared to the baseline scenario. This
result underscores the need for continued reliance on grants and highly concessional financing.
Finally, the historical scenario (Table 2, scenario A1) suggests a sizable and protracted

52
deterioration of the PV of debt-to-exports ratio. While important, the results of the historical
scenario should be interpreted with caution, given Burundi’s history of conflict.9
12.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests suggest that almost all other debt indicators will
exceed their indicative debt burden thresholds. The threshold for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
will be breached under the lower non–debt-creating flows, and combination stress tests
(Table 2, tests B4 and B5) by a modest amount over a protracted period. The threshold for the
PV of debt-to-revenues ratio will be breached marginally under a combination stress test
(Table 2, scenario B5) for one year only. The indicative threshold for the debt service to
exports ratio will be breached by a small margin during 2013–16 under the combination stress
test (Table 2, scenario B5). A similar breach occurs under the historical exports stress test
(Table 2, scenario B2).10 Finally, the indicative threshold for the debt service to revenues ratio
is the only one that is not breached under any alternative scenario and stress test.
13.
Improving Burundi’s export capacity is critical for debt sustainability. To illustrate the
steps needed to achieve debt sustainability, staffs prepared a customized scenario
(Table 2, scenario A3) based on higher donor support to finance export generating projects.
More specifically, the scenario assumes an increase in project grants by 1 percentage point of
GDP relative to the baseline scenario during 2010–15. As a result of the additional capital
investment, export volume increases by an average of 7 percent throughout the projection
period, leading to an increase in real GDP growth by about 0.2 percentage point of GDP.
Under this scenario, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio falls below the indicative threshold by
2019. By the end of the projection period, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is lower by about
40 percentage points compared to the baseline scenario. All other stock and liquidity indicators
remain well below their indicative thresholds.
14.
In staffs’ view Burundi faces a high risk of debt distress. The preceding analysis
suggests there is a sizable and protracted breach of the PV of debt-to-exports threshold under
the baseline scenario, while alternative scenarios and stress tests suggest that all but one debt
burden thresholds are likely to be breached under less favorable scenarios and shocks.11
15.
The authorities broadly share staffs’ assessment. They have expressed their
commitment to continue to rely on highly concessional loans and grants to meet their financing
needs, while advancing structural reforms to boost export capacity.
9

This argument applies also to stress tests. In particular, the standardized stress test assuming export value growth
at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2011–12 results in a sharp reduction of exports. The reason
is the large standard deviation of exports reflecting the country’s conflict, and export cyclicality (primarily owing
to the old age of coffee trees).
10
11

See footnote 9.

Remittances cannot be used as a determinant of the risk of debt distress because the breach of the PV of debtto-exports ratio under the baseline scenario is protracted.

53
IV. PUBLIC DSA
16.
Public debt indicators are expected to gradually improve under the baseline scenario.
The improvement is due primarily to a decline in the public sector borrowing requirement,
reflecting the widening of the revenue base and the gradual decline in government spending in
the post reconstruction period. The ratios of the PV of public debt to GDP and public debt to
revenues are low reflecting Burundi’s reliance on grants and highly concessional loans to
finance reconstruction and poverty reduction.
17.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests show that public debt indicators can worsen
rapidly, especially in the absence of fiscal consolidation, and lower economic growth. Under
the scenario of an unchanged primary balance from 2010 (Table 4, scenario A2), the PV ofdebt-to revenues and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios at the end of the projection period will be
more than double the corresponding ratios under the baseline scenario. This result highlights
the need for fiscal prudence and avoidance of past unsustainable borrowing policies.
Preparation of a medium-term debt strategy will be essential for anchoring future policy.
Similarly, under a permanently lower growth scenario (Table 4, scenario A3), the PV of debtto-revenue and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios at the end of the projection period will be nearly
double the corresponding ratios under the baseline scenario. Similar results are evident when
growth is lower than the average historical rate (Table 4, test B1), and when lower growth is
combined with a higher primary deficit (Table 4, test B3).12 The debt service to revenue ratio is
not significantly affected by alternative scenarios and shocks because additional borrowing is
on highly concessional terms.
V. CONCLUSION
18.
Burundi will continue to face a high risk of debt distress. The PV of external debt-toexports ratio will exceed the country-specific debt burden threshold by a wide margin
throughout the projection period. In addition, under alternative scenarios and stress tests all but
one debt indicators exceed the country-specific debt burden thresholds. To mitigate risks to
debt sustainability, staffs encourage the authorities to continue to rely on grants and highly
concessional loans to meet financing needs, and further strengthen debt management. In
addition, staffs advise the authorities to intensify structural reforms in order to diversify the
export base, address existing infrastructure bottlenecks that hinder growth, and encourage
private sector development by improving the business environment. Finally, staffs urge the
authorities to continue efforts to improve tax administration and widen the tax base to reduce
reliance on foreign financing.

12

The caveat concerning the suitability of the historical scenario in a country marred by conflict applies.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
The large residual in 2009 reflects the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the past 10 years.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief. Concessional loans are defined as having a grant element of at least 50 percent, as currently mandated under the ECF-supported program.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ The standardized stress test of assuming export value growth at historical average minus one standard deviation is not relevant for a country like Burundi which
experienced conflict and whose exports suffer from cyclical factors.
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments
An update assessment of the Banque de la République du Burundi (BRB) was completed in
June 2008 and found that since the previous assessment certain safeguards had been strengthened
(e.g., external audits have been completed on a timelier basis and audited financial statements
comply with IFRS and are published). However, the 2008 assessment also identified significant
control weaknesses and recommended more robust controls over domestic disbursements to the
government and its creditors, including contracting an external auditor to review such controls
(Prior Actions for the approval of the arrangement). Other key safeguards recommendations
include a system to monitor the status of audit and safeguards recommendations and issuing
guidelines for investment operations. The authorities have already taken steps to implement these
recommendations.

VIII. Exchange Arrangements
The exchange rate has been reclassified from floating to stabilized. The U.S. dollar is the
intervention currency. On June 21, 2010, the official exchange rate was BIF 1230.4 to the dollar.
In 2003 the central bank eliminated most remaining exchange restrictions on current
international transactions and delegated authority to commercial banks to approve standard
transactions. In early 2004, the surrender requirement was lowered to 50 percent and in early
2005 it was eliminated. The central bank has admitted foreign exchange bureaus to the weekly
auctions. Most external arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors were cleared by the end of
2005. In December 2006 the government published a new foreign exchange regulation that
liberalized foreign exchange for current transactions and removed one multiple currency
practice.
Burundi availed itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV when it joined the Fund in
1962 but no longer maintains any exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices that relate
to that article. It does have one multiple currency practice that is inconsistent with Article VIII,
Section 2(a): the exchange rate used for government transactions may differ by more than
2 percent from market exchange rates. Burundi maintains certain foreign exchange restrictions
for security reasons and has notified the Fund of those restrictions pursuant to Decision 144(52/51). The authorities have not requested, and staff does not propose, approval of the multiple
currency practice.
IX.

Article IV Consultation
In accordance with Decision 12794-(02/76), as amended by Decision 12854-(02/96), Burundi is
on the 24-month Article IV cycle. The 2008 Article IV consultation was completed by the
Executive Board on July 7, 2008, (IMF Country Report No. 08/282), along with the request of a
new PRGF arrangement.
In concluding the 2008 consultation, Executive Directors acknowledged the commendable
progress that Burundi made in implementing its first PRGF-supported program in a difficult
postconflict environment. They agreed that fiscal sustainability in the face of a heavy debt

65
burden will depend on broadening the revenue base and improving the composition of spending
while financing the budget though grants and highly concessional external resources.
Recognizing the recent acceleration of inflation deriving from rising international food and oil
prices, Directors encouraged the monetary authorities to act to anchor inflation expectations and
contain second-round effects of food and oil price shocks. Directors also saw the need to
accelerate structural reforms, especially in the coffee sector, and welcomed Burundi’s
membership in the East African Community.

APPENDIX III
BURUNDI
RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of June 20, 2010)
Burundi has been a member of the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group since the group was
founded in 1964. AfDB grant and loan operations with the country were interrupted by the outbreak of
civil strife in 1993. On July 19, 2004, the AfDB Boards approved general policy guidelines to help
postconflict countries clear their arrears and created a facility, the PCCF, initially funded with about
SDR 100 million in AfDB funds, to provide financial assistance to qualifying countries. The policy
guidelines call for a three-way burden-sharing formula among the country, donors, and the PCCF. On
October 27, 2004, the AfDB Boards endorsed an arrears clearance proposal for Burundi whereby the
balance of arrears was settled with the help of donors and the PCCF before the decision point for the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.
On 21st April 2009, under the enhanced framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative, the Board of Directors of AfDB approved AfDB’s share of the HIPC debt relief in an amount
equivalent to USD 150,200,000 in Net Present Value (NPV) terms as of the end of 2004. The Board of
Directors also approved Burundi’s qualification for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), in an amount of US$ 15.38 million, (UA 10.48 million), in nominal terms.
In support of the Government’s economic and social program, the Board approved the Country Strategy
Paper (CSP) in October 2008. The CSP covers the period 2008 to 2011 and focuses on 2 pillars of the
CSLP namely, (i) support to effective government by improving economic governance and the
functioning of key public sector institutions, and (ii) increase employment opportunities through
developing infrastructure and targeted interventions in the agricultural sector. The Bank Group current
portfolio of a total commitment of USD 113.67 million (77.1 million Unit of Account), comprises 10
ongoing operations, out of which 3 are regional in scope (one study and two road projects). The Bank
Group intervenes actively in infrastructure (transport, water and sanitation, and energy), agriculture,
governance and social sectors. The Bank Board of Directors recently approved a grant of 10 million UA
for the third phase of Burundi’s Programme d’Appui aux Reformes Economic (PARE III).
A stepping stone towards reinforcing Burundi’s commitment to further its infrastructure development
and economic integration was underpinned through an integrated analysis of transport, power,
telecommunication and mining carried out by the Bank in collaboration with the Government of Burundi
and other development partners. The study entitled “An Infrastructure Action Plan for Burundi:
Accelerating Regional Integration”, which is aligned with both national objectives and regional
infrastructure developments, is designed as a reference for policy dialogue between stakeholders.

APPENDIX IV
BURUNDI
STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 20, 2010)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
The most serious shortcomings affect national accounts, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics. Insufficient funding, staffing shortages and lack of equipment, along with
coordination difficulties among responsible institutions, impede the timely production and
dissemination of macroeconomic statistics. Burundi could benefit from participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), as a framework to improve its macroeconomic
statistics and coordination between institutions.
Real sector statistics: Serious deficiencies in real sector data compilation hamper economic
analysis and management. National accounts statistics are compiled infrequently by
ISTEEBU, the national statistical office. Source data on agriculture, the most important
economic activity, is inadequate. Consequently, there is a high degree of uncertainty
regarding estimates of the level and the growth rate of GDP, components of expenditure, and
all ratios to GDP. Annual national accounts estimates provided to the Fund, are not compiled,
but rather, are derived from a macroeconomic projection model and certain base year
estimates for 1998 and 2005. The monthly consumer price index, features expenditure
weights derived from a dated 1991 household expenditure survey and covers only the capital
city, leading to inaccurate measurement of inflationary pressure. No producer price indices
are compiled. Limited labor market statistics are available, thus hampering surveillance.
Government finance statistics: Burundi has benefitted from technical assistance provided
by the World Bank and FAD in the areas of public financial management information
systems and public expenditure management, as well as STA training in the compilation of
government finance statistics. Nevertheless, government finance statistics continue to suffer
from weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness.
Monetary and financial statistics: The monetary and financial statistics are now compiled
following the recommended methodologies of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics

72
Manual (2000), and are broadly adequate for both surveillance and harmonization with the
monetary statistics of other East African Community member countries. Transactions with
the IMF are reflected incorrectly—the amount of loans received from IMF differs from the
IMF records, misrepresenting foreign liabilities of the central bank. STA informed the central
bank of the issue, the resolution of which is pending. Because of the current payment system,
there are differences between the central bank and ODC records. Normally, transactions
between the central bank and ODC show up in ODC balance sheet with one-day lag that
affects OIN in the Depository Corporation survey. The liabilities of three banks in liquidation
are shown in the central bank balance sheet; however, the information on these banks is not
included in the summary of ODC data.
External sector statistics: Annual balance of payments and international investment position
statistics are compiled by the BRB according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). However, severe coverage and measurement difficulties impart a high
degree of uncertainty to external sector statistics and surveillance. For example, there are
significant unrecorded imports and exports (particularly coffee and tea) of merchandise and
services, and while adjustments are made, the uncertainty remains. For both services and
income, the accuracy of the source data is not routinely assessed against other data sources.
Similarly, measurement of capital and financial account transactions relies on Burundi’s
International Transaction Reporting System, which is known to have incomplete coverage.
Further actions are required to improve the accuracy and reliability of external sector data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Burundi does not participate in the GDDS.
III.

No data ROSC is available.

Reporting to STA

Summary government finance transactions data are reported for publication in International
Finance Statistics (IFS). The BRB has completed migration to the Standardized Report
Forms for the submission of its monetary statistics to the Fund; detailed monetary statistics
are published in the IFS. Balance of payments and international investment position data are
published in IFS and in the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation for the
Republic of Burundi
On July 23, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Burundi. 1
Background
Burundi is emerging from more than a decade of civil conflict. The power-sharing agreement
signed in December 2008 by the government and the last rebel group (FNL), paved the way for
national elections, which run from May 24 to September 8, 2010. Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita is about US$140, and more than two-thirds of the population lives below the
poverty line. Although the country is making some progress toward the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), it is unlikely that any of the targets will be achieved by 2015.
Economic growth moderated to 3.5 percent in 2009, from 4.5 percent in 2008, mainly because
of lower private transfers and foreign direct investment. Because of lower international oil and
food prices, headline inflation (end of period) declined from about 26 percent in 2008 to about
4.5 percent in 2009, well within the single-digit level targeted under the program.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

75
Fiscal performance in 2009 was broadly satisfactory. Despite the global financial crisis, total
revenue was 0.6 percent of GDP higher than programmed, reflecting improved collections of
income and indirect taxes. Total spending was contained below the programmed level, as
externally-financed spending was lower than planned. The wage bill was also kept within the
envisaged budgetary envelope. Overall, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) was lower than
expected. Adjusted for the shortfall in external nonproject financial assistance, domestic
financing of the budget was well within the program target.
Despite the food and oil shock and the global financial crisis, the external position was
supported by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives
(MDRI) and the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation. Notwithstanding the negative impact
of the food and oil crisis on the trade balance, the external current account deficit improved in
2008 because of high donor support to mitigate the effects of the shock. In contrast, in 2009 the
external current account deficit worsened, even as the terms of trade improved, because of
lower donor support. Overall, the balance of payments position was supported by HIPC and
MDRI debt relief and the SDR allocation. Gross reserves remained at a comfortable level of
6.5 months of import cover.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the satisfactory implementation of their ECFsupported program against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and a difficult post-conflict
environment. While Burundi’s economic outlook is positive, risks remain, and it will be important
to make decisive progress on structural reforms to accelerate growth and reduce poverty, while
continuing efforts to improve security conditions.
Directors agreed that debt sustainability should anchor medium-term fiscal policy. Given the
high risk of debt distress and low capacity, they concurred that the budget should be financed
through grants and highly concessional financing. Improvements in governance, including
strengthened public financial management, will be important for sustaining donor support.
Directors called for caution to ensure that expectations of a peace dividend do not give rise to
public sector wage increases. They noted that achieving the medium-term target for the wage
bill while continuing to recruit in priority sectors hinges on reducing the size of the security
forces. Directors supported the authorities’ intentions to further align spending with the priority
sectors outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and to enhance their capacity
to deliver social services. On the revenue side, Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue
their efforts to broaden the revenue base and improve tax and customs administration, including
by making the revenue authority operational.
Directors considered the authorities’ monetary policy to be appropriately aimed at price stability
while allowing scope for economic growth. They emphasized the need for close coordination of
monetary and fiscal policies, as well as efforts to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy
instruments.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. They recommended greater exchange rate flexibility to help the economy adjust

76
to external shocks, and stressed the importance of structural reforms to improve Burundi’s
competitiveness. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to refocus capital spending on key
infrastructure to relieve major bottlenecks. They encouraged the authorities to improve the
business and investment climate, continue to reform the coffee sector, and accelerate
integration into the East African Community.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to use the Financial Sector Assessment Program
recommendations to guide reforms in the financial sector. Efforts should be stepped up to
improve banking supervision, modernize the payment system, and address weaknesses in the
banking system, notably concentration risk.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve statistics in collaboration with Techncial
Assistance partners, particularly in the areas of the national accounts and the balance of
payments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under ECF Arrangement for Burundi
and Approves US$10 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Burundi’s economic performance under a program supported by the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF)1. The Board’s decision enables the government to request a
disbursement for an amount equivalent to SDR 6.6 million (about US$10 million), bringing
total disbursements to Burundi under the program to an amount equivalent to
SDR 33 million (about US$49.9 million). The Executive Board also approved the
modification of performance criteria.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation. Details of the
findings of the Article IV will be published in a Public Information Notice in due course.
The ECF arrangement for Burundi was approved in July 2008, (see Press Release No.
08/167) for an amount equivalent to SDR 46.2 million (about US$69.9 million).
At the conclusion of the Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Burundian authorities are to be commended for the strong performance under their
ECF-supported program against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and a difficult
post-conflict environment. Burundi’s economic outlook is positive, supported by
strengthened reforms and governance, as well as efforts to continue to improve security
conditions. Solid policy implementation will be key to meeting Burundi’s economic
1

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the Fund’s main
tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a higher level of access to financing, more
concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features, and more focused streamlined conditionality. Financing
under the ECF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10 years. The
Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all concessional facilities every two years.

79
challenges over the medium term, and continued donor assistance will be necessary to
support the authorities’ efforts.
“Given the high risk of debt distress, it is important to anchor medium-term fiscal policy to
debt sustainability and rely on grant and concessional financing. Improvements in
governance, including strengthened public financial management, will be critical. The
authorities plan to further align spending with the PRSP priority sectors and enhance capacity
in social services delivery, with support from the international community.
“Decisive progress on structural reform will be critical to raise Burundi’s competitiveness
and achieve sustained growth and poverty reduction. The authorities’ plan to refocus capital
spending on key infrastructure is appropriate. It will also be important to enhance the
business environment, strengthen the financial sector, continue reforms in the coffee sector,
and proceed with integration into the East African Community”, Mr. Portugal added.

STATEMENT BY MR. ITAM
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR BURUNDI
JULY 23, 2010
1.
My authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies, deepened structural reforms, and
perseverance with the post-conflict reconstruction, enabled Burundi to weather the storm of
the global economic crisis. They remain confident that with this macroeconomic framework,
a successful transition to the second government of the post-conflict period and further
improvement in the external environment, Burundi stands a chance of lifting its economic
growth trajectory.
2.
My authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s constructive engagement and support
under the ECF. Going forward, they are determined to further strengthen their
macroeconomic framework, and achieve key national and regional objectives as set out in
their PRSP and the East African Community (EAC) protocol. In this regard, the authorities
appreciate the constructive engagement and support of the Fund, the World Bank, the
African Development Bank, and the donor community, and thank staff for their candid
policy dialogue and advice under the program. The support and dialogue have been
invaluable in addressing many challenges.
3.
The authorities’ efforts in consolidating peace and implementing the ECF-supported
economic program have enhanced macroeconomic stability. To that end, all end-March 2010
quantitative performance criteria and the structural benchmark were met. In view of the
strong performance under the program, the authorities request Directors’ support for the
completion of the fourth review of the ECF arrangement, and the modification of
performance criteria to take into account more fully recent developments.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Burundi’s strong macroeconomic performance, which had been uninterrupted since
2006, reflects deepened economic reforms, good coffee harvest and increased donor funded
investment projects. This performance came under threat from the adverse effects of the
global economic downturn. Real GDP growth declined from 4.5 percent in 2008 to
3.5 percent in 2009 mainly as a result of severe decline in receipts from coffee exports, lower
private transfers and foreign direct investment. Deterioration in the external environment has
since subsided, aided by the decline in the global prices of food and fuel, increased donor
flows, the HIPC and MDRI relief, and the SDR allocation. Gross official reserves have since
rebounded to 6.5 months of imports cover.
5.
The fiscal outturn in 2009/10 reflects the challenges the country is facing. Revenue
collection improved marginally relative to GDP, despite the authorities’ efforts to broaden
the tax base, implement structural reforms, and strengthen customs and tax administration.
The authorities’ support for the economic recovery through increased spending under the
development and recurrent expenditure was only partially successful due to lower-thanprogrammed externally-funded spending.

81
6.
My authorities’ monetary framework continued to be guided by the objective of price
stabilization, while allowing sufficient scope to support economic recovery. The central
bank’s monetary policy included a mix of instruments for liquidity management. As a result,
reserve money growth remained on track, and the banking system continued to meet the
demand for private sector credit. Inflation, which had edged up in 2008 due to the surge in
global food and fuel prices, declined considerably in line with global price developments.
7.
The country’s financial system remained resilient to the global financial crisis, mainly
due to its limited exposure and well supervised and capitalized banks. This resilience was
confirmed by the 2009 Bank-Fund FSAP mission that detected no obvious signs of imminent
systemic stress. Nonetheless, the authorities remained vigilant and ready to take necessary
measures to protect the stability of the financial system.
8.
The authorities’ dedication to the peace process is unwavering. The process came
under heightened security alert at the start of the 2010 elections in May but has stabilized
after the June 28 Presidential elections. The authorities are determined that the final phase of
these elections—the legislative elections on July 23—will be successful; paving the way for
consolidated peace in the country. To that end, the authorities are grateful for the continued
support of their development and EAC partners.
II. POLICY FRAMEWORK GOING FORWARD
A. Fiscal policy
9.
The fiscal framework will continue to support economic growth. Current expenditure
as a percentage of GDP will be consolidated, while maintaining the tempo for priority sectors
in line with the country’s PRSP. Spending would target basic social services, particularly
education, health, and public access to water, electricity and roads. Further, the authorities
intend to scale-up investment in infrastructure to enhance productivity in the primary sectors.
10.
Mindful of the country’s high risk of debt distress, the authorities will aim at limiting
debt-creating domestic financing and mobilizing concessional external financing. However,
they recognize the limits of concessional financing for infrastructure investment and would
consult staff when the need and opportunity for non-concessional financing arise. To ensure
budget credibility and make public spending more effective, the authorities have reaffirmed
their commitment to strengthen their public financial management framework.
11.
The authorities are confident, that domestic revenue mobilization would improve if
current efforts are sustained and the external environment improves. This would also entail
broadening the tax base, strengthening fiscal controls, and reducing discretionary tax
exemptions. The authorities will continue to implement the modernisation program for tax
revenue administration, including the value-added tax and the EAC common external tariff
(CET). With the support of development partners, the authorities are vigorously pursuing the
operationalization of the Burundi Revenue Authority (BRA).

82
B. Monetary policy
12.
To achieve the objective of anchoring monetary policy on low and stable inflation,
the central bank will bolster its open market operations, maintain a flexible exchange rate,
rely substantially on foreign exchange sales for sterilization, and improve liquidity
forecasting. The authorities reaffirm their commitment to target base money growth for
containing inflation as an appropriate policy framework. Monetary policy stance will also
help sustain the current level of credit to the private sector.
C. Financial sector reforms
13.
The central bank will strengthen its supervisory and regulatory services to the
financial institutions to stem concentration of loan portfolio. The regulatory framework for
financial institutions will be in line with the FSAP/MCM recommendations. In fostering
financial sector reforms, the authorities are broadening access to financial services. This
effort will capture staff advice on modernizing the infrastructure and legal framework for the
payments system. The central bank will strengthen its internal control and risk management
system, and align its open market operations to best practices.
D. Other structural reforms
14.
My Burundian authorities have made impressive progress in implementing their
structural reform agenda, including the reform of the financial sector, privatizing the coffee
sector, and promoting public accountability. Improving the stock and quality of physical
infrastructure remain a priority. The authorities intend to build on the recent reforms of the
public financial management and the rationalization of government bank accounts.
15.
The authorities will persevere with reforms on the trade front, and deepen the EAC
regional integration framework. To that end, they are, together with their partners in the
EAC, advancing the implementation of the Customs Union and Common Market protocols.
III. CONCLUSION
16.
The authorities’ macroeconomic fundamentals and continued commitment to strong
policies helped the country weather the global economic crisis better than earlier envisaged.
The implementation of the ECF-supported program has remained solid with the
end-March 2010 program performance being very impressive. The authorities are aware of
the remaining risks and have, therefore, maintained an appropriate mix of fiscal and
monetary policies, as well as deepened structural reforms to consolidate the economic
recovery. In the near term, the authorities are determined to ensure that the program focuses
on sustaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing domestic resource mobilization, promoting
broad-based and pro-poor growth, and increasing investment in agriculture, infrastructure
and core MDG clusters. The authorities are confident that going forward, continued
engagement with the Fund and the support of the development partners will enable them to
achieve their development goals and consolidate the peace process.
