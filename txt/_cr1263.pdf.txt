Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Requests for a Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility, and for Additional Interim
Assistance Under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by
Seán Nolan and Jan Kees Martijn
February 13, 2012
Background: Guinea is emerging from a prolonged period of social unrest and from military
rule during 2009–10. Following presidential elections completed in December 2010, the new
government adopted an economic stabilization program for 2011 that was monitored by Fund
staff. Key economic objectives of the government are to create an environment conducive to
development of the country’s abundant natural resources to support sustained higher growth
and poverty reduction and to reach quickly the completion point under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The exchange rate system is a managed float and
Guinea has accepted the obligations under Article VIII. Guinea continues to have a multiple
currency practice arising from the absence of a mechanism to prevent a potential deviation of
the exchange rate used by the central bank for its transactions with the government from those
used by the commercial banks.
Program Issues: Performance under the 2011 SMP has been good. The authorities are
requesting a three-year (2012–15) arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an
amount equivalent to SDR 128.52 million (120 percent of quota) and an allocation of interim
HIPC assistance of SDR 1.2852 million.
Mission: The staff team, comprising Messrs. Snoek (head), Ladd, Razafimahefa and Orav
(all AFR), Dicks-Mireaux (SPR) and Wane (Resident Representative), visited Conakry
during November 3–22, 2011 and the discussions were completed by video conference on
January 31, 2012. The mission met with President Condé, Prime Minister Fofana, Ministers
Yansané (Economy and Finance), Cissé (Planning) and other Cabinet members, along with
Governor of the Central Bank of Guinea Nabé, other senior officials, and representatives of
civil society, the press, and the donor community. Mr. Bah (OED) also attended the meetings.
Publication: The authorities have agreed to the publication of the staff report and the Letter of
Intent, including its attachments.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Guinea’s outlook improved substantially during 2011 as the political situation
stabilized, severe macroeconomic imbalances were reduced, and improved governance
resulted in large windfall revenue from the mining sector and new investment in mining
projects. Growth picked up, the rise in inflation was halted, and international reserves
increased. Following sizeable depreciation early in the year, the official exchange rates
stabilized and the gap between the official and market exchange rate narrowed.



The macroeconomic improvement in 2011 was mainly due to sharp fiscal
adjustment. The deficit on the budget’s basic balance was reduced from 13 percent of
GDP in 2010 to an estimated 2.5 percent, while monetary financing of the budget was
avoided in an effort to reduce excess liquidity stemming from large central bank
advances in 2009–10.



Performance under the 2011 staff-monitored program has been good. The
quantitative targets for June and September were met with wide margins, while
provisional data indicate that performance was close to program targets for
end-December despite a shortfall in budget support and higher public investment
spending under a revised budget prepared in consultation with the staff. The adjustment
in current spending was larger than envisaged. There was good progress with structural
reform, including the adoption of a new mining code.



Key medium-term challenges are to reduce inflation while preparing the economy
for an expected substantial increase in mining activity. Planned new investment in
the mining sector of 40 percent or more of GDP per year during 2012–14 should result
in much higher levels of output and government revenue by the middle of the decade.



Medium-term fiscal policies aim at avoiding the use of domestic bank credit while
ensuring (post-HIPC) debt sustainability. Key objectives are to raise the revenue
effort and redirect expenditure to the priority sectors while using the windfall revenue
to increase public investment, especially in electricity and roads.



The government’s medium-term structural reform agenda aims at developing
Guinea’s abundant natural resources in mining, hydroelectricity, and agriculture,
while improving government services, including utilities, and the business climate.



Staff supports the authorities’ request that the Fund support their program for
January 2012–December 2014 under the ECF for an amount of SDR 128.52 million
(120 percent of quota). Good performance under the program may allow Guinea to
reach the completion point under the HIPC Initiative later in the second half of 2012.

6
I. A NEW BEGINNING
1.
Guinea’s outlook has improved significantly over the course of 2011. During
2010, the country transitioned from a military regime and underwent a tense election process.
The new government inherited a stagnating economy and serious macroeconomic
imbalances. One year later, an improved political environment and strong stabilization efforts
have contributed to resurgent growth, a sharp decline in the fiscal deficit, and an improved
international reserves position. The resolution of a long-standing dispute with a foreign
mining company resulted in a one-off payment ($700 million, some 15 percent of GDP)1 in
2011, improving the government’s ability to start addressing urgent public-sector investment
needs. The positive outlook for political stability and better governance has led to the start of
large new private investment in the mining sector, raising the prospect that economic activity
will expand sharply following the start of production by the middle of the decade.
2.
But major challenges remain. A legacy of weak governance and intermittent
periods of domestic unrest has left Guinea among Africa’s poorest countries (Figure 1),
a fragile state with weak institutions and limited technical capacity. The transition toward full
constitutional rule remains to be completed by legislative elections; the consolidation of
political stability also depends on security sector reform. Reducing still-high inflation will be
important to maintain support for the stabilization and reform effort. Over the medium term,
the recent windfall revenue and the expected boom in the mining sector present major
challenges for Guinea to ensure that its natural resource wealth translates into broad-based
poverty reduction and sustained and diversified economic growth.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The government’s main macroeconomic objective for 2011 was to sharply
reduce the imbalances. The abandonment of fiscal control under the 2009–10 military
regime resulted in a large fiscal deficit, sharp monetary expansion, and external arrears. By
end-2010, annual inflation was over 20 percent and climbing, the market exchange rate was
depreciating rapidly, and external reserves covered less than 1 month of imports (Figure 2;
Tables 1-4). In its economic program for 2011, which was monitored by Fund staff, 2 the
government’s stabilization policies focused on bringing inflation and the fiscal deficit under
control, and on tightening monetary policy. Structural reform priorities included improving
public financial management and governance in the mining sector.

Policies (MEFP—Attachment I of Appendix I).

The staff-monitored program (SMP), which covered the period January–December 2011, was approved by
IMF Management on June 30, 2011 and issued to the Executive Board for information on July 1, 2011.

4.
Performance under the SMP has been good. Real GDP growth rebounded on the
back of the improved political situation and a sharp increase in agricultural production, the
latter reflecting good climatic conditions and renewed government support for the sector.
Strong adjustment and prudent use of the windfall revenue resulted in a sharp decline in the
2011 fiscal basic balance.3 The program’s indicative targets for June and September were
met with considerable margins (Table 5); provisional data indicate that, because of a shortfall
in expected budget support of about 0.8 percent of GDP and higher-than-programmed
expenditure on capital projects, the outcome for end-December deviated slightly from the
program targets. Inflation, at 19 percent (year-on-year), was slightly lower by December than
at the same time in 2010. Reflecting the windfall revenue, gross official reserves increased to
the equivalent of about 5 months of imports of goods and non-factor services by end-2011.
5.
Fiscal adjustment was stronger than programmed for the first nine months
of 2011 (Text table 1; MEFP ¶ 6-7). Several tax measures were taken early in the year but
revenue was lower than projected because of a delay in adjusting domestic fuel prices to
higher import costs from July to October.4 The suspension of large non-competitively
tendered procurement contracts for goods and services and investment projects committed
during 2009–105 and the elimination of low-priority spending through cash-based
expenditure management, resulted in a sharp reduction in expenditure compared to 2010.
Furthermore, the wage bill was less than anticipated because of a delay in new recruitment
while strict application of public procurement regulations delayed the start of some capital
projects. The contraction of expenditure more than offset the revenue shortfall, with the
result that the budget’s basic balance was in surplus by 0.5 percent of GDP during
January–September, compared to a program target of a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP (and
a deficit of 8 percent of GDP during the same period in 2010).

3

The fiscal basic balance is calculated as revenue excluding grants minus expenditure excluding interest on
external debt and foreign financed investment. The windfall revenue was recorded as non-bank financing.
4

In case the government-set retail prices are below the calculated cost price (import costs and all applicable
taxes), the government budget absorbs the difference by means of lowering the tax take, which is calculated
monthly (see SPM, Box 2, page 9 http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11251.pdf .)
5

During 2009–10, the military government concluded multi-year procurement contracts amounting to about
40 percent of GDP; a World Bank-financed audit indicated that most were engaged on a non-competitive basis,
overpriced, and poorly executed (SPM, Box1 page 7 http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11251.pdf .)

Fiscal adjustment continued during the last quarter notwithstanding a pickup in
capital expenditure. In October, the interim parliament adopted a revised 2011 budget
allowing the use of some of the windfall revenue to address urgent infrastructure needs,
especially serious power shortages (MEFP ¶ 9).6 However, actual use was lower than
budgeted and current expenditure continued to be constrained during the last quarter.
Revenue was boosted by a 27 percent increase in fuel prices in mid-October (reducing the
gap between retail prices and calculated cost to about 10 percent) and stepped-up revenue
collection efforts. As a result, the deficit on the basic balance is estimated at around
2.5 percent of GDP for 2011, somewhat higher than envisaged under the SMP but
considerably lower than the revised budget target of 4.9 percent of GDP that had been
discussed with staff. In the end, investment expenditure was higher than programmed under
the SMP, but the adjustment in current spending is estimated to have been stronger than
initially envisaged.
7.
The good fiscal performance supported a tight monetary policy stance. Despite
sharp increases in the central bank rate and in the reserve requirement in March and October
(MEFP ¶ 11), liquidity in the banking system remained high. As the political situation has
stabilized, currency in circulation has gradually been converted into bank deposits. Credit to

6

The revised budget was prepared in consultation with the staff. Initially, the authorities intended to request a
revision of the SMP’s targets for end-December to reflect the impact of the revised budget. Given the short time
left until year-end and indications that the overruns compared to the original targets under the SMP would be
small, it was decided not to proceed with a formal revision.

11
the private sector almost doubled (from a very low level in 2009–10), but this expansion was
more than offset by the decline in the banking system’s net credit to the government. Broad
money growth is estimated to have remained much below the increase in nominal GDP,
reducing the liquidity overhang.
8.
After a rapid depreciation early in the year, the exchange rate stabilized
(MEFP ¶ 11). The market exchange rate (the rate quoted by the exchange bureaus—Box 1)
depreciated by almost 20 percent in the first two months of 2011. In March, the BCRG issued
new regulations governing the bureaus following their temporary closure and started weekly
foreign exchange auctions. Thereafter, the market rate appreciated and the official rate
depreciated, reducing the gap between the two rates to about 2–3 percent by year-end; the
real effective exchange rate is estimated to have remained broadly constant.
Box 1. The Foreign Exchange System
Guinea’s foreign exchange system consists of the BCRG, thirteen commercial banks, and some
30 foreign exchange bureaus.


The BCRG conducts the exchange transactions for the government using the daily official
foreign exchange rate (called the reference rate), which is determined as the weighted average
of the previous day’s rates charged by commercial banks. Since March 2011, it also conducts
weekly foreign exchange auctions of around $5 million, open to all commercial banks; the
auction rate is the weighted average rate of winning bids.



The commercial banks conduct foreign exchange transactions for their clientele. Banks often
have insufficient resources, in which case, lacking an interbank market, clients have to buy
foreign exchange from the exchange bureaus so that the bank can execute the foreign transfer.
The commercial banks’ buying and selling rates are to remain within a band of 3 percent
around the auction rate.



The exchange bureaus conduct the bulk (by amount) of the foreign exchange transactions in
Guinea, although they are limited to cash transactions. Important suppliers of foreign
exchange are informal gold and diamond exporters. The exchange bureaus set their own
buying and selling rates.

9.
Guinea’s relations with external donors and creditors improved in 2011.
All arrears with multilateral institutions were cleared (MEFP ¶ 10), allowing the resumption
of budget support and project assistance. Guinea deferred the clearance of arrears and
payment of current debt service to bilateral creditors until these obligations can be addressed
in the context of a Paris Club rescheduling and the HIPC Initiative.
10.
The authorities made good progress with structural reform (MEFP ¶12). A key
achievement was the adoption of a new mining code compatible with international standards
in September 2011; the new code, prepared with donor assistance, increases transparency and
is expected to raise Guinea’s future revenue share. Progress was also made in preparing for
reforms in the electricity sector. Helped by a broad group of external partners, including the
Fund and AFRITAC West, the government started a major effort to strengthen public

12
financial management, including the adoption of legislation to establish a single treasury
account. Progress was also made in cleaning up the civil service database and reform efforts
were started in the judiciary and the security sector.
III. OUTLOOK AND KEY CHALLENGES—CONSOLIDATING MACROECONOMIC
STABILIZATION AND PREPARING FOR THE MINING BOOM
11.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the measures needed to
consolidate macroeconomic stabilization and lay the basis for accelerated and
diversified growth. The authorities and staff agreed that short-run policies should remain
focused on bringing down inflation, important not only for growth but also for social stability
and poverty reduction. For the medium term, the main challenge is to prepare the economy
for a substantial increase in mining activity and revenue later in the decade, with special
regard to ensuring that the natural resource wealth translates into inclusive growth and
poverty reduction.
A. The Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook and Framework
12.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is driven by large investments in the
mining sector (MEFP ¶19). Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector (Box 2),
which could be as high as 40 percent of GDP or more per year during 2012–14, will raise
output, imports, and the external current account deficit, and should boost employment with
the construction of infrastructure such as railroads and ports. By 2015, investment is set to
taper off and production to start, resulting in a sharp turnaround in the current account and
higher government revenue, while mining-related employment will stabilize at a lower level.
Against this background, the baseline scenario assumes real GDP growth in the range of
4–5 percent per year during 2012–14; a drop in inflation to the single digits; and maintenance
of gross official reserves at a level at least equivalent to 2.5 months of imports (excluding
imports for large mining projects).

Guinean basic (mine gate) price for bauxite and alumina. Import price (CIF Tianjin) for iron ore.

Approved projects in bauxite, alumina, and iron ore would entail some $40 billion in capital
spending; the government is considering project proposals totaling a further $9 billion.
There is scope for increased output of bauxite and alumina within current capacity, and firms
have increased production by 6 percent in 2011 (to October). The leading bauxite producer,
Compagnie de Bauxite de Guinée (CBG), is undertaking a $300-million extension to its
operation, adding 18 percent to its capacity by 2018. Other firms hold permits to explore
nearly 100,000 km2 for additional bauxite.
New iron ore mining investment and production are set to reshape the Guinean economy over
the medium term. Construction of the first major iron ore project, on the northern concession
of Mt. Simandou, is underway. The latest cost estimates, $13 billion (1/3 for mining and
2/3 for railroad and port transportation), amount to three times 2011 GDP and entail a surge in
FDI-financed imports in the near term. Production is expected to begin in 2015, raising real
GDP by 15 percent initially; with peak production set to be reached by 2020. Output would be
higher if other approved or proposed projects were implemented. Other firms hold permits to
explore over 50,000 km2 for additional iron ore. That said, the value of mining exports and
fiscal revenues will depend on prevailing prices; Guinea’s output prices for bauxite and
alumina, largely determined in long-term contracts, have been stable, but the international
price of iron ore is volatile.

14
13.
The baseline scenario assumes a strong increase in public investment, mainly to
remove infrastructure bottlenecks. In addition to donor project assistance, the authorities
intend to use part of the 2011 windfall revenue to boost investment, focused on electricity
and roads. They shared the staff’s concerns about ensuring effectiveness and sustainability of
expenditure financed by one-off resources: (i) the windfall revenue will be used primarily for
investment and spread over several years, during which its share in the financing of
investment outlays will gradually decline; and (ii) the authorities are setting up a special
investment fund (Box 4) to hold part of the 2011 windfall revenue and possible new such
revenue to assist in its management. Given the uncertainties about possible government
contributions to investments in the mining sector, the baseline assumes that all such
investment is foreign financed.
14.

The outlook has both downside and upside risks:



The main risk is renewed political instability, especially in the run-up to legislative
elections expected in 2012. Social unrest would affect both short- and long-term
growth and complicate the implementation of the reform agenda. However, as
indicated in the Letter of Intent (Appendix I), the authorities launched security sector
reform and instituted political dialogue to reduce these risks.



Guinea remains vulnerable to developments in international markets. Mineral exports
account for more than 90 percent of total exports and about 20 percent of government
revenue; two-thirds of non-mining imports are fuel and food. Given the uncertain
international economic outlook, the risk of a decline in mineral prices is high, but the
authorities indicated that existing long-term contracts would reduce the immediate
impact on Guinea. The government’s medium-term economic program, including the
planned policies with regard to the automatic adjustment of fuel prices and the
promotion of agricultural production, is an important mitigation against these risks.



Guinea’s much improved fiscal and international reserves positions have
strengthened its ability to deal with adverse shocks. While the use of one-off revenue
for financing a large deficit would be unsustainable in the long run, it does allow a
gradual and efficient adjustment over the medium term.



Additional large one-off revenue from an ongoing review of contracts in the mining
sector would further strengthen the external position. Additional spending could
aggravate bottlenecks because of limited implementation and absorptive capacity; the
special investment fund is intended to mitigate this downside risk.
B. Short-Term Stabilization

15.
Reducing inflation remains a key objective for short-term macroeconomic
policies (MEFP ¶ 21). This will require a careful coordination of fiscal, monetary, and
structural reform policies. Fiscal policy aims at avoiding taking up new credit from the
banking system, but drawing down the savings from the 2011 windfall revenue may add to

15
domestic liquidity. While a large part of these funds will finance imports, the BCRG stated
that it stands ready to offset possible effects on domestic liquidity by selling foreign
exchange to the market.
16.
The BCRG agreed with staff on the importance of a market-determined
exchange rate. The staff recommended a sizable widening of the band around the auction
rate within which banks are free to set their buying and selling rates. However, the authorities
felt that the stable market exchange rate and the sharp decline in the gap between the official
and market exchange rates indicated that their more cautious approach was effective. They
plan to further improve the efficiency of the foreign exchange market, helped by Fund
technical assistance, which could include a widening of the banks’ trading band later in the
year. The authorities shared the staff’s exchange rate assessment (Box 3), stating that, in their
view, structural weaknesses were the primary factor constraining external competitiveness.
C. Strengthening Public Financial Management and
Increasing Priority Sector Spending
17.
The government’s medium-term fiscal policy aims at (i) containing the budget
deficit to facilitate inflation reduction and maintain debt sustainability; (ii) improving
public financial management and the quality of spending while increasing allocations to
priority sectors (MEFP ¶23–36). Guinea’s public investment needs will remain high to
remove infrastructure bottlenecks and, in line with the objectives of the poverty reduction
strategy, to boost public services delivery. Given financing constraints, the authorities intend
to increase available resources by raising the ratio of (non-mining) revenue to GDP to the
regional average level, by reforming the tax system and improving tax administration. The
authorities and staff agreed that it would also be important to contain the wage bill
(employment has almost doubled since the mid-2000s), limiting subsidies by improving the
efficiency of public utilities and reforming support to the agricultural sector, and reducing
military expenditure through security sector reform. Outlays to the social sectors are
expected to benefit from debt relief.
18.
Strengthening public financial management remains a high priority
(MEFP ¶ 35–36). In this regard, the authorities intend to implement a comprehensive reform
and capacity building strategy in close coordination with external partners, including the
Fund and AFRITAC West.

16
Box 3. Assessing External Competitiveness in Guinea
Guinea’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has somewhat depreciated since the last Article
IV consultation in 2007. The nominal effective rate (NEER) has depreciated by more than
50 percent since 2007 but its effect on the REER was almost completely offset by the acceleration in
inflation in Guinea after 2009.

1/ Elasticities from the CGER analysis.
Quantitative estimates of Guinea’s REER based on the CGER methodologies suggest some
overvaluation of the real exchange rate, although the results differ significantly across the three
approaches.1 In 2007, the calculations suggested that the exchange rate was broadly in line with the
economic fundamentals; the present projections suggest overvaluation in the range of 16–39 percent.
Interpretation of these results is, however, complicated by the surge in imports and direct foreign
investment in the mineral sector, which produces temporarily inflated (but financeable) current
account deficits during 2012–15 that, in turn, explain the estimates of overvaluation. The staff
assessment is that there is not serious misalignment of the real exchange rate at this juncture,
although the situation will need to be kept under review over time. The fact that the premium
between the market and official rates shrank from 30 percent in early 2011 to almost nil at year-end
provides supporting evidence that the exchange rate is not seriously over-valued at this juncture.
Beyond the assessment of the exchange rate, structural bottlenecks are considered to be a key
element in holding back Guinea’s competitiveness. The country’s long history of weak governance
has played an important role in slowing the pace of development of Guinea’s rich natural resource
endowment. This is compounded by a poor infrastructure, including severe power shortages and an
inadequate road network. Reflecting these factors, out of 183 countries, Guinea ranked 164 on the
Corruption Perception Index and 179 on the Doing Business Indicator in 2011. It also ranked last in
the sub-Saharan Africa region on investor protection.
1/

The MB methodology compares the projected medium-term current account balance with a “current account
norm” estimated from the macroeconomic fundamentals; the EREER methodology estimates an equilibrium
real exchange rate as a function of the macroeconomic fundamentals; the ES methodology employs as a
benchmark the current account balance required to stabilize the net foreign asset position at its current level.

17
D. Structural Reform: Improving the Business Climate and Mobilizing Guinea’s
Natural Resources Wealth
19.
Discussions on structural reform focused on preparing the country to manage
the prospective large inflows of mining resources (MEFP ¶ 22, 44). Staff and authorities
concurred that, to avoid Dutch disease-type effects of large mining sector inflows and foster
inclusive growth, structural reforms should focus on removing deep-rooted bottlenecks to
investment and growth, including poor governance arrangements and a weak judicial system,
severe power shortages, and an inadequate road infrastructure. In addition to increasing
spending on education and health and strengthening government services, including by
utilities (MEFP ¶48–50), the authorities intend to implement a comprehensive action plan to
improve the business climate and governance (MEFP ¶53). The authorities noted that the
reform agenda was ambitious but took adequate account of the existing weaknesses in
administrative capacity.
20.
Government policy focuses on developing Guinea’s large potential in mining
(MEFP ¶45-47), hydroelectricity (MEFP ¶ 48–49), and agriculture (MEFP ¶51–52).
While it will take time to strengthen institutions and technical capacity, these sectors offer
“quick-wins” for economic growth, government revenue and employment. In the mining
sector, reforms aim at raising its contribution to government revenue and at enhancing its
attractiveness to foreign investors by improving transparency and ensuring a level playing
field. Electricity sector reform will focus on improving supply and strengthening
management and financial viability of the EDG and developing Guinea’s large hydroelectric
power potential. Reform efforts in the agricultural sector—which provides employment and
income to the bulk of the population—will aim at ensuring food security and improving its
competitiveness.
21.
The government also believes that Guinea’s financial sector needs to play a
larger role in the economy. Credit to the private sector stagnated at around 5 percent of
GDP for much of the last decade. During the second half of 2011, private sector credit
growth accelerated sharply to around 70 percent year-on-year, largely due to an increase in
demand for trade credit. While the level of nonperforming loans remains modest, the
foundations of the banking system are weak, as reflected in preliminary financial soundness
indicators prepared by the BCRG (Table 6), which show several banks failing to meet
minimum capital requirements and high levels of risk concentration, particularly to oil
importers. Staff supported efforts to quickly rebuild banking supervisory capacity and
strengthen the regulatory framework (MEFP ¶ 41), with technical assistance from the Fund
and Banque de France. The BCRG is to develop a comprehensive financial sector
development plan during 2012. In the context of weak governance and institutions, and
significant production of precious minerals, an effective implementation of the AML/CFT
regime would contribute to improve the business climate and to enhance transparency and
revenue collection in the gold and diamond sectors. Guinea’s AML/CFT regime will be
assessed by GIABA, a FATF-style regional body, in June 2012.

18
E. Debt Restructuring and Debt Sustainability
22.
The authorities attach great importance to attaining the HIPC completion point
as soon as possible. The updated debt sustainability analysis for low income countries
(LIC DSA)7 shows that, while Guinea has been in debt distress, the anticipated debt relief at
the completion point would reduce the debt stock to a sustainable level. Following approval
of the ECF arrangement, the authorities intend to seek a rescheduling from Paris Club
creditors and other external official bilateral and commercial creditors, and have initiated
discussions to that end.
23.
Guinea has made good progress with the implementation of the HIPC
completion point triggers (MEFP ¶15). The PRSP 2007–10, as extended for 2011–12, has
been implemented since early 2011 and informed the government’s medium-term policies; a
full-year report on its implementation is expected to be completed by end-March 2012.8 Two
remaining measures—the audit of large public procurement contracts and an update of the
poverty database—are being completed with support from the World Bank and other donors.
The completion point could be reached later in the second half of 2012 following at least six
months of satisfactory performance under the ECF arrangement. By that time, the authorities
also intend to have prepared a new PRSP covering the period 2013–15, preparations for
which have started.
24.
The authorities stated that they have not yet made a decision on government
participation in mining-related projects, which could involve very large financing
needs. Admitting that it would be difficult to find concessional financing for such large
amounts, they indicated that they were investigating the possibility of public-private
partnerships. The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of maintaining
medium-term debt sustainability and on ensuring that the terms on any new debt should be
concessional; they are committed to discussing possible new large borrowings, including for
hydroelectricity projects, with the staffs of the Fund and the World Bank to ensure that
post-HIPC debt sustainability indicators are met (MEFP ¶ 56).
IV. DISCUSSIONS ON AN ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
25.
The government’s medium-term program (January 2012–December 2014),
for which it requests support under the ECF, seeks to address the development
challenges outlined in Section III. Building on the progress made under the SMP in 2011,

See supplement on Debt Sustainability Analysis.

Work on an extension of the PRSP started in 2010 with support from the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and the World Bank. The new government accepted the extended PRSP as the basis for its
development policies in January 2011 and the document was presented to the interim parliament and the social
and economic council in February and is published on www.srp-guinee.org.

19
fiscal and monetary policy aim at achieving a rapid decline in inflation to 12 percent
year-on-year by end-2012 and a gradual decline into single digits thereafter. International
reserves, which were boosted by the 2011 windfall revenue, will be negatively affected by
the subsequent use of these resources over the program period, which will be partly offset by
the support under the ECF; gross official reserves are targeted to remain at a level at least
equivalent to 2.5 months of imports by end-2014. With regard to structural reform, many of
the sector action plans will be completed during 2012 with implementation in ensuing years.
A. Fiscal Policy
26.
Fiscal policy will be guided by the need to maintain expenditure within the
constraints of the objective for net domestic financing and limited availability of
external financing while ensuring (post-HIPC) debt sustainability (MEFP ¶ 23–24,
Text Table 2). Revenue is expected to benefit from the implementation of a plan for
reforming tax policy and tax administration (a structural benchmark for end-June 2012), to be
adopted by the government by mid-2012 (MEFP ¶ 25–26). On the expenditure side, policies
aim at (i) containing the wage bill by reforming the civil service, supported by the World
Bank (MEFP ¶ 29–30); and (ii) reducing subsidies (MEFP ¶ 31–32) while using the windfall
revenue to increase infrastructure spending (MEFP ¶ 33). Driven by a sharp increase in
domestically-financed investment expenditure and higher outlays on subsidies, the budget’s
basic balance deficit is projected to increase in 2012. Staff is of the view that, while there are
some risks, the temporary increase is warranted given Guinea’s urgent need to rebuild
infrastructure and boost output and employment in agriculture. For one, the two large
electricity sector projects that account for the sharp increase in investment outlays in 2012
are a key component of a donor-endorsed reform of the electricity sector, while allocations
for subsidies are inflated by one-off outlays for legislative elections and transfers to the
electricity company and agricultural subsidies that are the subject of reform measures during
2012. The basic balance deficit is projected to fall sharply in 2013 (by 3 points of GDP) as
these exceptional outlays end.
27.
The overall deficit (including grants), moving largely in line with the basic
balance, would decline sharply to 3.4 percent GDP in 2013 and remain at about that
level over the medium term. The projected deficit should be financeable from
disbursements of existing loans, new concessional resources, debt relief, and the
drawdown of bank deposits. This would help ensure fiscal and external sustainable
positions; to anchor fiscal policy, a small basic primary surplus is projected beginning in
2013, which would generate resources to service interest payments. Net domestic bank
financing will be limited to the drawdown of deposits from mining sector windfall revenue.
Attainment of the HIPC completion point is estimated to result in debt relief of about
2.6–2.7 percent of GDP in 2013–14.

28.
The budget for 2012 was approved in line with the program (prior action)9 by
the interim parliament in December. The main features are:


An increase in revenue in percent of GDP, helped by the gradual closing of the gap
between retail fuel prices and costs and the re-instatement of the monthly automatic
adjustment mechanism for fuel prices by mid-2012 (structural benchmark for
July 1, 2012). Administrative reforms planned for 2012 (MEFP¶ 27) are expected to
boost revenue in following years.



The wage bill is to decline slightly as a share of GDP. The effect of a general wage
increase of about 10 percent in January 2012 and some planned new hiring in priority
sectors is partly offset by savings from the retirement of almost 4,000 military in
December 2011 and the removal of some 2,000 ghost workers from the payroll.



The increase in outlays on subsidies and transfers mainly reflects additional subsidies
to the electricity company and the agricultural sector (MEFP ¶ 31–32). Pending
reform of the state-owned electricity company Electricité de Guinée (EDG)
(MEFP ¶ 48–49), the government plans to provide a subsidy of about 0.6 percent

9

Adoption of the 2012 budget as agreed with staff constituted a prior action for Board approval of the
ECF arrangement.

21
of GDP in 2012 to finance the operating costs of additional thermal generating
capacity. Subsidies to the agricultural sector are budgeted to increase by more than
30 percent, to almost 0.9 percent of GDP. However, reforms to be developed with
external partners could lead to substantially lower net subsidies to the sector later in
2012 (MEFP ¶ 32, 51–52).


The budget includes a sharp increase in capital expenditure, financed by the 2011
windfall revenue and by renewed donor support. Almost two-thirds of
domestically-financed investment in 2012 (equivalent to $214 million) is to be
financed from the 2011 windfall revenue; the bulk of this is in the electricity sector.
Project financing by donors, notably the European Union (EU) and the World Bank,
is also expected to rise sharply.10

29.
The deficit on the basic balance of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2012 is expected to be
financed mainly by domestic resources and debt relief (MEFP ¶ 34):


Total domestic financing amounts to 5.7 percent of GDP. Of this, 3.8 percent of
GDP reflects the use of some of the 2011 windfall revenue (with a further
amount—$250 million—of this revenue to be deposited in the Special Investment
Fund—Box 4). The authorities expect additional exceptional mining sector revenue
of at least $250 million (4.5 percent of GDP), half of which will, in the absence of
external budget support, be used to finance the deficit, and the other half will be
deposited in the Special Investment Fund.11



The 2012 budget does not anticipate new external budget support, which amounted to
2.3 percent of GDP in 2011.



External debt service due in 2012 before new debt relief is projected at 4.1 percent of
GDP. Including the clearance of outstanding arrears, the overall financing gap would
be 8.8 percent of GDP, which is expected to be filled by new debt relief (including
HIPC and MDRI).

10

A small part (about 15 percent) of the EU assistance is conditional upon the holding of parliamentary
elections, which is also an important condition for the organization of a donor conference.

11

The program targets will be partially adjusted in case of excess or a shortfall of new exceptional revenue
(Technical Memorandum of Understanding, ¶ 20).

22
30.
With regard to public financial management, the government intends to bring its
legislative and legal framework in line with international and regional practices
(MEFP ¶ 35–36). Drawing on recent technical assistance, measures planned for 2012 include
the preparation of a new framework budget law; a new public procurement code; and new
general government accounting regulations and chart of accounts.
Box 4. Public Investment and the Special Investment Fund (SIF)
The Guinean authorities face a challenge particular to low-income countries with large,
non-renewable natural resource revenues: how to balance savings, investment, and
consumption to maximize growth, while respecting the constraints on both the government’s
capacity to identify and execute high-return investment projects and the absorptive capacity
of the economy in the short term.
The government collected an unexpected windfall of $700 million of one-off mining revenue
in May 2011. Of this sum, the government committed $185.5 million in the 2011 budget,
$145 million of which for urgent public investments, mostly in the electricity sector. The 2012
budget provides $214 million of these resources for public investment, again primarily in
electricity. Also, $50 million may be committed to a possible recapitalization of the BCRG
later in 2012. The authorities intend to reserve the remaining $250 million to help finance their
medium-term public investment program (PIP) which is to be finalized by end-September 2012
(a structural benchmark under the ECF-supported program).
To strengthen control over the balance of the 2011 one-off revenue, and possible future
one-off revenue, the 2012 budget law created a Special Investment Fund (SIF—MEFP Box 2).
The SIF will take the form of a budgetary account in Guinea francs at the central bank; the
counterpart in foreign exchange will be an integral part of the BCRG’s international reserves.
The SIF will be a source of funds for on-budget public investment projects, subject to
additional governance and transparency requirements, beyond the general rules of public
financial management.
The authorities, in consultation with Fund and World Bank staff, plan to adopt implementing
texts that set criteria for SIF operations (structural benchmark for end-March 2012), including
rules on deposits and commitments after 2012. The government will establish a SIF Steering
Committee, with representatives of civil society and donors, to provide an additional check on
the cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability of proposed projects. Foreign reserve
management will take the projected use of the SIF financing into account (for which the BCRG
has requested technical assistance from the World Bank). Once the implementing texts are
adopted, the remaining $250 million of the 2011 one-off revenue will be transferred to the SIF.
The 2012 budget foresees additional one-off mining revenue of $250 million. The first
$125 million collected will be available for general budget financing and the next $125 million
will be transferred to the SIF. In the event that one-off revenues exceed the budget forecast, at
least 75 percent of any amount beyond $250 million would also be transferred to the SIF.

23
B. Monetary and Exchange Policy
31.
The main objective of the BCRG’s monetary policy is to reduce inflation
through an orderly unwinding of the economy’s remaining excess liquidity
(MEFP ¶ 37). Developments in inflation and the stabilization of the market exchange rate
by end-2011 indicate that the present policy stance is adequate. Nevertheless, the stock of
broad money remains at historically high levels in relation to GDP and the BCRG stands
ready to further tighten policy to achieve the inflation target, guided by its objective to
achieve a decline in reserve money during 2012. To this end, in addition to using foreign
exchange sales to absorb excess liquidity, the BCRG intends to further develop its range of
instruments (MEFP ¶ 38). The authorities also plan to strengthen the BCRG’s capital
position in conjunction with accounting improvements and adoption of the International
Financial Reporting Standards (MEFP ¶ 43).
32.
The much improved level of international reserves has increased the scope
for their use to support monetary policy (MEFP ¶39–40). In determining the size of
the weekly foreign exchange auctions, the BCRG intends to take into account the possible
need to offset the effect on domestic liquidity of the drawdown of the government
deposits stemming from the 2011 windfall revenue, within the constraints of its international
reserve target and Guinea’s external competitiveness.
C. Structural Reforms
33.

The reform agenda, which is in line with the extended PRSP, includes:



In the mining sector (MEFP ¶ 45–47), the process of adoption and publication of
the implementing orders for the new mining code and a standard binding contract is
to be completed by June 2012 (structural benchmark); there would be consultation
with Fund staff before adoption of any amendments to the new mining code that
would affect tax revenue (structural benchmark). The authorities will review and may
renegotiate the existing mining concessions. Guinea is also pursuing its reintegration
into the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative process.



In the electricity sector (MEFP ¶ 48–49), the authorities’ first priority is to reduce
the severe shortages by adding generating capacity and strengthening the EDG.
Following the recent round-table conference with donors to define the sector reform
program (prior action), the government expects to adopt a comprehensive plan for the
sector by end-March 2012 (structural benchmark). This plan will also focus on
developing Guinea’s abundant hydroelectric potential, including by reforming the
institutional and legal framework by upgrading the law on public-private partnerships
to international best practices.



Reform in the agricultural sector will be based on a National Plan for Agricultural
Investment and Food Security (PNIASA) (MEFP ¶ 51–52). This plan is expected to

24
be approved by government early in 2012 and aims at ensuring food security by 2014
and becoming a food exporter thereafter. The authorities intend to gradually reduce
input subsidies through harmonizing methods and procedures for assistance to the
agricultural sector with those used by the World Bank and IFAD, staring with the
2012 agricultural season (structural benchmark for end-March 2012).
34.
Other reforms will be geared toward improving Guinea’s general business
environment (MEFP ¶ 53). The authorities attach great importance to raising Guinea’s
ranking under the World Bank Doing Business Indicators (179 out of 182). Policies will aim
at streamlining the investment approval process; promoting private sector investment;
reinforcing the judiciary by increasing its independence and through training; and the
National Governance and Anti-Corruption Agency by adopting the anti-corruption law.
V. PROGRAM DESIGN, FINANCING, AND RISKS
A. External Arrears and Program Financing
35.
Guinea has arrears to official bilateral and commercial creditors, which it
intends to regularize, and the program assumes a treatment of all arrears
(MEFP ¶10, 55). Guinea cleared its external debt service arrears with multilateral
creditors during the first three quarters of 2011.12 Discussions between the authorities and
Paris Club creditors are underway, paving the way for negotiations with the authorities on a
rescheduling of external debt service arrears and maturities by the end of April, and the staff
is of the view that financing assurances for the program will be in place by mid-February.
The authorities are also to approach other official bilateral creditors for a rescheduling of
maturities and arrears on terms comparable to Paris Club creditors and in the context of the
HIPC initiative. The government continues to be committed to engaging in good faith and
collaborative discussions with it external commercial creditors with a view to reaching
agreement on debt relief through an open and transparent dialogue based on the principle
of inter-creditor equity. Staff believes that the government’s strategy is consistent with the
“good faith” criterion of the Fund’s lending into arrears policy.
36.
External financing difficulties reflected, in part, the need to clear arrears with
multilateral creditors and to rebuild official reserves from the very low level at
end-2010. While the international reserves position improved substantially in 2011 because
of the windfall revenue, these resources will be depleted again over time as they are used to
finance much needed public investment in support of the poverty-reduction policies. As a

12

Guinea obtained financing assurances from the European Commission regarding remaining arrears on a
European Development Fund loan managed by the European Investment Bank, which provides for their
clearance when the HIPC completion point is reached.

25
result, notwithstanding a resumption of external financial support, primarily from multilateral
creditors, external debt service arrears continued to be accumulated by the authorities.
37.
Looking forward, financing gaps during 2012–15 are expected to be filled
by debt rescheduling and multilateral support. Following substantial external budget
support in 2011 from multilateral creditors to facilitate arrears clearance operations, support
is expected to be primarily in the form of budget project grants and loans in the coming
years. The bulk of debt relief is expected in 2012, reflecting the restructuring of arrears, and
thereafter the projected HIPC completion point and provision of relief under the MDRI in the
latter half of 2012. Some 90 percent of external debt (including arrears) is held by
multilateral and Paris Club creditors who have signaled their intention participate under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative. For other creditors, some have already signaled their willingness
to participate and the authorities are engaging in a collaborative approach with the remainder
to obtain their participation. With respect to the HIPC completion point triggers, those that
still have to be met, including satisfactory performance under the program, are expected to be
met in the latter half of 2012 (MEFP ¶15, 54). The remaining financing gaps are expected to
be filled by disbursements under the ECF arrangement, and interim HIPC assistance
(50 percent of eligible ECF principal repayment obligations in 2012).
B. Program Modalities
38.
The authorities have requested a three-year (2012–15) arrangement under the
ECF. Access is proposed at 120 percent of quota (SDR 128.52 million). This access is based
on the staff’s assessment of the overall financing needs (Table 7), and is consistent with the
access norm for a country with outstanding credit below 100 percent of quota (Guinea’s
current outstanding credit is 25.3 percent of quota). Disbursements would be phased in equal
semiannual tranches subject to completion of reviews (Table 8). Fund support would help
maintaining an adequate reserve level as the 2011 windfall revenue is gradually used for
growth-enhancing investment and catalyze support from donors, including through debt
relief, and would permit the resumption of interim HIPC assistance from the IMF. The
authorities have requested an allocation of interim HIPC assistance in the amount of
SDR 1.2852 million, which would cover eligible debt service in 2012. Guinea has a track
record of meeting its obligations to the Fund and an adequate capacity to pay (Table 9),
which would be further strengthened, provided the country takes the needed action to
secure HIPC debt relief. Program performance would be monitored on the basis of
quantitative indicators (Table 10) and structural benchmarks (Table 11).
39.
The main risks to the program are domestic and reflect the post-conflict
environment. Progress has been made in returning to constitutional rule and improving the
security situation. Nevertheless, the political situation remains fragile and the successful
completion of the election cycle will be important. The government has tight financial
constraints yet faces large potential resource needs to address urgent energy sector and
infrastructure needs. In addition, tangible benefits from improved fiscal management and

26
reining in inflation are only beginning to emerge, testing the public’s demanding
expectations.13 In this regard, the recent progress in expanding electricity supply and
prospective decline in inflation bodes well. Lack of policy coordination and weak technical
capacity will test the government’s capacity to implement its ambitious development plans.
However, the government has demonstrated a willingness to involve the donor community in
its investment plans and is benefiting from the resumption of large-scale technical assistance,
including from the Fund. Guinea also remains vulnerable to external shocks, particularly in
the mining sector, food price increases, and a prolonged global slowdown in growth.
40.
Preliminary findings of an update of the 2007 safeguards assessment indicate
that the governance and safeguards frameworks of the BCRG continue to require
strengthening. The January 2012 safeguards mission found limited capacity and
infrastructure to manage reserves, a weak internal control environment, and shortcomings
related to monetary data compilation. The mission proposed that, to mitigate risks to the
prospective ECF-supported program, external auditors should continue to verify monetary
data at test dates, the BCRG should publish audited annual financial statements within
statutory deadlines (immediately for 2010—prior action), and the Board should approve an
investment policy and guidelines (structural benchmark).
41.
Guinea’s data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. The authorities are resuming efforts, interrupted in 2009, to improve their
capacity to compile and disseminate data. Data deficiencies include delays in the monetary
survey (specifically, commercial banks), discrepancies between the monetary survey and the
monthly fiscal accounts (which introduce uncertainty regarding the policy stance and
routinely require considerable staff effort to reconcile), and the lack of standard financial
soundness indicators. Guinea participates in the GDDS.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The authorities have made strong progress in addressing the serious imbalances
inherited from the 2009–10 military regime. The new government’s immediate and
decisive actions to bring the fiscal situation under control were crucial in stabilizing inflation
and the exchange rate. The improving political and governance environment was a major
factor in the resumption of economic growth and renewed investor interest in developing
Guinea’s abundant natural resources. As a result, the country’s medium-term outlook
improved significantly during 2011.

13

The World Bank is preparing a social safety net operation consisting of (i) income generating activities
through labor intensive public works programs; (ii) addressing child malnutrition and girls’ school dropouts;
and (iii) institutional capacity building.

27
43.
Performance under the SMP has been good, notwithstanding some
implementation difficulties. While capacity constraints at times tested the authorities’
ability to hold firmly to the goals of the SMP, performance remained on track: quantitative
targets for June and September were met with substantial margins and the authorities made
good progress with structural reform. Despite a shortfall in budget support and
notwithstanding urgently needed additional investment expenditure, provisional data
indicate that performance was also close to the program targets for end-December, while
the adjustment in current expenditure—weeding out the excesses from 2009–10—was better
than projected for 2011.
44.
Short-term policies rightly focus on reducing the still-high inflation rate. Key in
this regard will be close coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Fiscal policy should
aim at limiting net domestic bank financing of the government to the gradual drawdown of
the deposits of the 2011 windfall revenue. The central bank should stand ready to counter a
possible resulting increase in domestic excess liquidity by associated foreign exchange sales.
45.
The authorities should continue to improve transparency in the determination
of the exchange rate and eliminate the existing multiple currency practice. This will help
build confidence in the Guinean franc and create a sound basis for successful reform of the
foreign exchange market. Over the medium-term, the adoption and implementation of a
comprehensive financial sector development plan will be important for supporting diversified
economic growth. In this regard, the central bank’s progress in rebuilding its capacity in
banking supervision is encouraging.
46.
There is an urgent need for structural reforms that would allow Guinea to reap
the maximum benefits from the development of its abundant natural resources. The
large new investments in the mining sector raise prospects of higher economic growth but
Guinea’s weak institutions and technical capacity could constrain the contribution of this
growth to wide-spread poverty reduction. The government’s structural reform agenda aims
at removing bottlenecks in the economy to minimize the effects on competitiveness of other
sectors once revenue from mining takes off. Given the limited implementation capacity, it
will be important for the authorities to prioritize reforms, favoring those that provide quick
returns for growth and poverty reduction; in this regard, a strong technical assistance effort
by the development partners is essential.
47.
The 2011 windfall revenue and possible new such revenue in the future should
be used cost-effectively and sustainably. The recent establishment of a special investment
fund was an important step as it should increase scrutiny of large investment projects. Staff
stands ready, in coordination with the World Bank, to assist the authorities in developing the
regulatory framework for the fund; this framework should cover all substantial windfall
revenue and include clear rules for its use to help ensure transparency and good governance.
Given Guinea’s infrastructure needs, staff supports the gradual use of this revenue over the
medium-term. The authorities are working closely with development partners to develop

28
sectoral action plans, most recently in the case of the electricity sector. Staff encourages the
authorities to develop a comprehensive medium-term public investment program during 2012
in the context of a new PRSP.
48.
The authorities’ ambition to participate directly in the large new mining and
related infrastructure projects is understandable. Nevertheless, the potential financing
needs for government participation over and beyond a non-contributing share in these
projects, as well as for large prospective hydroelectric projects, are very large and
concessional financing will be difficult to find. It is vital that the authorities avoid
non-concessional financing and maintain medium-term debt sustainability and staff
recommends that the authorities seek assistance from the Fund and the World Bank before
committing to possible new large debt. Given the challenges, the authorities should give
high priority to strengthening debt management.
49.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for assistance under the ECF in the
amount of 120 percent of quota and for further interim HIPC assistance. The ECF
arrangement will allow Guinea to maintain an adequate level of international reserves as the
2011 windfall revenue from the mining sector is being used over the medium-term to finance
urgently needed public investment. Guinea is a fragile state and there remain considerable
risks of political instability in the run-up to legislative elections in 2012 and as long as the
reform of the security sector is not completed. Moreover, Guinea remains vulnerable to
declines in mineral prices, which would reduce government revenue and might delay the new
investment in the sector. Nevertheless, the authorities’ commitment to strong fiscal
management and the much improved external reserves position mitigate these risks.
50.
It is proposed that during the ECF arrangement Guinea stay on a 24-month
Article IV cycle in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles.14

1/ For 2011, the program assumed toleration of arrears by Paris Club and other bilateral creditors.
For the columns 2011 Est. Sep and 2011 proj, figures show actual accrual of arrears.
2/ For 2012 and following years, assumes Paris Club debt relief for end-2011 arrears and maturities falling due in 2012-14 on terms similar to those
under the 2008 Paris Club agreement. Comparable terms are assumed for other bilateral creditors. HIPC/MDRI relief is assumed to be delivered
effective October 2012.

6/ External debt contracted or guaranteed other than with a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more, calculated using a discount rate based
on the OECD commercial interest rates. Excludes borrowing from the IMF.
7/ The end-december 2011 estimates are based on discussions between the authorities and staff during the November mission. Staff expects to receive updated figures during February 2012.
Although the current estimates show some overruns compared to program targets, if the additional investments financed with the exceptional revenue and already discussed with staff are excluded,
the performance is stronger than that envisaged under the program. On the basic fiscal balance, if those investments are excluded, the end-Dec 2011 figure would be a deficit of GNF 356 billion,
smaller than the deficit envisaged under the program. For the net domestic assets of the central bank, the domestic bank financing of the government, and the reserve money, the valuation of the
exceptional revenue uses the program exchange rate.

APPENDIX I—GUINEA: LETTER OF INTENT

Conakry, February 11, 2012

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C.
Madame Managing Director,
1.
The government issued from the 2010 presidential elections, the first free and
democratic elections in Guinea, acted quickly and decisively to reverse the catastrophic
situation inherited from the military regime. To usher in peace and social cohesion, it
launched a reform of the defense and security forces and instituted political dialogue to
prepare for transparent legislative elections. During 2011, the government implemented
significant structural reforms and corrective economic and financial measures that served to
improve governance, accelerate real economic growth, halt the inflationary spiral, rebuild
international reserves, and stabilize the Guinean franc exchange rate. In the area of public
finance, it reduced the government deficit by over 10 percentage points of GDP. Finally, it
established a new mining policy to promote transparency and discipline in the management
of Guinea's natural resources, which encouraged investments in the mining sector. These
unprecedented corrective measures were supported by the international community,
including through an IMF staff-monitored program; budget support from the African
Development Bank, the World Bank, and the European Union; and technical assistance
from other partners.
2.
Despite the progress achieved, significant challenges remain for the years
ahead. Inflation, while stabilized, remains a matter of concern and the main short-term
macroeconomic challenge. The heavy burden of external public debt and weak
infrastructures, particularly in the electricity, water, transportation, and communications
sectors, represent formidable challenges for the recovery of growth. Structural reforms
are expected to prepare the Guinean economy for the massive investments expected in the
mining sector in the coming years and increased mining production beginning in the middle
of the decade.

45

3.
To consolidate the results achieved under the staff-monitored program, restore
growth, and reduce poverty, the government has prepared an economic and financial
program covering the period 2012–14. The program is intended to reduce inflation and lay
the groundwork for rapid and diversified growth. It will serve to realize the government's
economic vision of mobilizing Guinea's agricultural, hydroelectric, and mining potential;
increase the economy's competitiveness by improving the business climate, infrastructures,
and social services; and strengthen good governance and anticorruption efforts.
4.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) describes
the economic vision and policies the government is determined to implement during
the program period. The authorities request that the IMF support their three-year economic
and financial program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). We request the IMF’s
financial support for this program equivalent to 120 percent of our quota share, or
SDR 128.520 million, and a first disbursement of SDR 18.36 million (17.1 percent of quota)
following Board approval of the arrangement. The government also requests continuation of
the interim assistance provided by the IMF under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative, in the amount of SDR 1.2852 million.
5.
The government is determined to achieve the completion point under the
HIPC Initiative without delay. It counts on the support of the development partners to
substantially reduce the external debt burden at the completion point in order to ensure
the sustainability of public finances, normalize Guinea's relations with its creditors, and
refocus the government's budget priorities on poverty reduction spending. The government
will spare no effort to achieve the structural completion point triggers soonest, with support
from the development partners.
6.
The government is convinced that the policies and measures set forth in the
attached memorandum will serve to achieve the program objectives. However, it will
take any additional measures that prove necessary to that end. The government will consult
IMF staff with respect to the adoption of such measures, either on its own initiative or at the
request of the IMF Managing Director, before adopting such measures or before modifying
the policies set out in the memorandum, in accordance with IMF policy regarding such
consultations. Furthermore, the government will refrain from assuming obligations that
would compromise debt sustainability or the HIPC Initiative, including contracting or
guaranteeing debt under non-concessional terms or more generally under terms that would
jeopardize achievement of the objectives of debt sustainability after the HIPC Initiative
completion point. The government agrees to provide the IMF with any information required
to monitor the implementation of measures or the achievement of program objectives.

46
7.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached MEFP and
technical memorandum of understanding, as well as the IMF staff report on the Article IV
consultation and the request for an arrangement under the ECF.

Very truly yours,

ATTACHMENT I—GUINEA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR 2012–14
Conakry, February 11, 2012
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The military regime’s lax economic, fiscal, and foreign exchange management
during 2009–10 led to a disastrous situation marked by severe macroeconomic
instability and the weakening of governance. Insecurity and social tensions undermined
confidence and put a damper on private investment and economic growth. The already weak
economic and social infrastructure further deteriorated, social indicators worsened, and
poverty became more acute. Governance problems led to loss of control over government
revenue and expenditure. The basic fiscal balance declined from a surplus of close to
2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to a deficit of almost 13 percent of GDP
in 2010, which was entirely financed by money creation and the accumulation of external
payments arrears. The rate of inflation spiraled to almost 21 percent by end-December 2010;
international reserves almost depleted to less than one month of imports, the domestic
currency depreciated considerably, and the gap between the official and parallel market
exchange rates widened to close to 20 percent.
2.
The government of President Alpha Condé, resulting from the first free
democratic elections in Guinea, acted quickly and decisively to correct the situation.
Since January 2011, it has undertaken significant structural reforms and unprecedented
economic and financial recovery measures. To implement lasting peace and social cohesion,
the government launched the reform of the security sector and engaged in dialogue on
national reconciliation. To complete the transition to a normal constitutional situation,
discussions are underway to organize legislative elections as soon as possible in 2012.
A new mining code was adopted to improve transparency in the sector and to increase
Guinea’s share in mining resources. Public expenditure was controlled through rigorous
implementation of a cash-based government expenditure management system through a
monthly cash flow plan approved by a Treasury Committee chaired by the Prime Minister.
This made it possible to avoid further advances to the Treasury by the Central Bank of the
Republic of Guinea (BCRG). Furthermore a prudent monetary policy and proactive exchange
policy halted spiraling inflation and curbed exchange rate fluctuations. These efforts were
supported by the international community. To that end, discussions had been initiated with
the International Monetary Fund for a Rapid Credit Facility program starting in early 2011.
After some modifications resulting from the receipt of windfall mining revenue (see Box 1),
these discussions finally resulted in the staff-monitored program covering the period
January–December 2011, approved by IMF management on June 30, 2011 and presented
for information to its Executive Board on July 1, 2011.

48

Box 1. Windfall Mining Revenue in 2011
On April 22, 2011, the government signed an agreement with the mining company
Rio Tinto concerning the Simandou south concession (Blocs 3 and 4). Within the
framework of that agreement, and in order to resolve all pending issues and finalize
the new terms of the investment agreement, the Rio Tinto subsidiary SIMFER paid
US$700 million to the Treasury in May 2011. This amount is deposited in an account
with the BCRG. For 2011, the government committed to use US$145 million of these
resources for priority and urgent investments, 70 percent of which in the electricity
sector. US$40 million was intended for financing other budgetary spending under the
supplementary budget approved by the CNT on October 15, 2011.
3.
The government’s vision for the medium term is to consolidate economic and
financial stabilization and to lay the foundations for sustained and shared real growth.
The consolidation of economic stabilization undertaken in 2011 is expected to promote better
use of Guinea’s mining, hydroelectric, and agricultural potential in the years to come. This
requires major public investment efforts, to equip the country with essential infrastructure
and build a solid foundation for private investment. These investments may be financed in
part through mobilization of windfall mining revenue, which will be allocated on a priority
basis to increasing the capacity to produce electrical energy and to developing the agriculture
sector and transport infrastructure. Supplemented by other structural measures designed to
improve the business climate, these investments could help diversify the Guinean economy
and mitigate the adverse impact the rapid development of the mining sector could have on
the other sectors of the economy through the “Dutch disease” syndrome.
4.
The government is determined to lay the foundations for strong economic
growth to significantly reduce poverty. To that end, the following specific goals will be
pursued within the framework of implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy:


consolidate social peace by organizing peaceful elections and completing the reform
of the security sector;



reform the public sector to improve its productivity and intensify the efforts to
improve governance and the business climate, including combating corruption and
strengthening the judicial system;



restore the confidence and credibility of the economic, financial, and monetary
institutions by stabilizing inflation and the exchange rate;



develop the potential of the mining sector and its synergistic growth with the other
sectors of the economy;



improve infrastructure by developing and implementing a public investment program
in concert with development partners;

49


increase agricultural production to attain food self-sufficiency in the medium term, to
reduce the country’s dependence on imports, and to increase agricultural exports in
the long term;



enhance the production and distribution of electrical energy by tapping the country’s
hydroelectric potential.

5.
This Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies describes performance
under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program in 2011 and the government’s economic vision
for the medium-term. It gives greater details about the objectives of the economic and
financial program for 2012 and describes medium-term financing and technical assistance
needs, as well as program indicators and monitoring arrangements. The government is
determined to reach completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC Initiative) in 2012, one of the triggers of which is performance with regard to
macroeconomic stability. The government also expects to complete implementation of the
other triggers during the first quarter of 2012. In addition, it will continue to implement the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which has been extended to cover the
2011–12 period.
II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM IN 2011
6.
Performance under the Staff-Monitored Program has been very satisfactory. All
the quantitative and structural program benchmarks for end-June and end-September 2011
have been met (Tables 1 and 2). On the macroeconomic front, real growth increased to
almost 4 percent in 2011, up from 1.9 percent in 2010, reflecting the normalization of the
political and social situation and very good performance in the agricultural and mining
sectors. The government accomplished fiscal consolidation and reduced its basic fiscal
deficit, excluding investments funded with its windfall mining revenues, from 13 percent of
GDP in 2010 to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2011. This unprecedented adjustment was
made possible by the implementation of a rigorous fiscal policy and cash-based expenditure
management system. Moreover, provisional data indicate that the money supply expanded by
less than 10 percent during 2011 compared to 74 percent in 2010. These strict policies halted
the upward trend in inflation by stabilizing the rise in the consumer price index at 19 percent
at end-December 2011, year-on-year, and halted the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate.
With the windfall mining revenue, international reserves were replenished to 4.5 months of
imports of goods and services.
7.
Fiscal consolidation was the cornerstone of the government’s macroeconomic
stabilization policy. In addition to cash-based budget execution, several other measures were
vigorously implemented to increase revenue, control expenses, and take back control of the
budget, in particular:


With respect to revenue, ad hoc exemptions from customs tariffs were eliminated and
the list of products subject to import verification was extended; excise taxes on beer

50
and tobacco were increased; efforts to collect back taxes were intensified; and control
of contributions from autonomous revenue-collecting agencies was strengthened,
inter alia, through strict enforcement of the terms of contracts and licenses, enabling
the government to recover exceptional nontax receipts in non-mining sectors
representing more than 1 percent of GDP.


A very important measure taken in early 2011 to control expenditures was the freeze
of 2009–10 government contracts—totaling over 40 percent of GDP—that had been
signed in violation of the government procurement code and overbilled. This step was
taken following a World Bank-funded audit by experts from the French Audit Court.
This financial support and technical assistance was provided as part of the work of the
settlement committee that was established to review the contracts in question and
make recommendations to the government on the final handling of the contracts
concerned.



In order to improve budget control, the government reinstated the procedure of
competitive selection as the normal process for awarding government contracts
(Ministerial Decree of March 11, 2011), and prohibited the signing of contracts
without budget appropriation caps and without the signature of the Finance Minister.



The government began to apply the law establishing the Treasury Single Account
to all public structures, including government-owned companies.

8.
Budget execution at end-September 2011 was in line with the IMF staffmonitored program. The budget approved in April 2011 by the interim legislative body, the
National Transition Council (CNT), projected a deficit in the basic fiscal balance of 2 percent
of GDP in 2011 and net bank financing of 3.6 percent of GDP. At end-September, the basic
fiscal balance for the first nine months of the year was a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP and
the government reduced its net debt to the banking system, a key component of the
authorities' efforts to control inflation, by over 1 percent of GDP excluding deposits of
windfall revenue. These achievements exceed the program targets and benchmarks at that
date by a wide margin.
9.
In October 2011 the CNT approved a revised budget authorizing the use of a
portion of the windfall mining revenue in 2011, in particular, for investment projects in
the electricity sector. This was in response to citizens' high expectations for immediate
improvements in living conditions as well as urgent needs. However, indications are that the
government succeeded in reducing the basic fiscal deficit for 2011 to less than 1 percent of
GDP, below the initial budget objective, excluding investments financed from windfall
revenue, and to 2.5 percent of GDP if these investments are included. These results reflect a
larger budget adjustment (excluding investments financed from windfall revenue) than
provided in the staff-monitored program. To achieve those objectives, the government took
a number of measures including (i) increasing fuel prices by 27 percent in October,

51
substantially reducing tax revenue losses generated by the gap between the cost of imports
and retail prices; (ii) intensifying efforts to increase the financial contribution of autonomous
revenue-collecting agencies to the government budget; (iii) reducing budget appropriations
for current expenditures; and (iv) postponing several investment projects to 2012–13.
Furthermore, although the budget support from the World Bank planned for the second half
of the year (equivalent to nearly 0.8 percent of GDP) was not received, the government
reduced its net borrowing from the banking system (excluding deposits of windfall mining
revenue) in line with the staff-monitored program objective.
10.
Following normalization of Guinea’s relations with its development partners,
external budgetary assistance was resumed. In 2011, after accumulating new arrears
during the period 2009–10, the government began to normalize its financial relations with
foreign creditors, despite funding constraints. The arrears owed to multilateral financial
institutions were cleared in 2011. Arrears payable to the World Bank were cleared using its
budgetary support. Some arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) were cleared with a
grant. An agreement also was reached to clear the remaining arrears in order to reach the
completion point under the HIPC Initiative. These actions, and the normalization of relations
with Guinea’s partners in general, made it possible to resume budgetary support and project
assistance.
11.
The objectives of monetary and exchange policy were to mop up excess liquidity
of the 2009–10 period and to stabilize inflation and the exchange rate of the Guinean
franc. The BCRG took a number of measures to achieve these goals, in particular:


raising the policy rate from 16.75 to 22 percent on March 23, 2011, and increasing the
reserve requirement rate by 7.5 percentage points, to 17 percent on March 23, and by
an additional 5 points to 22 percent on October 19, 2011.



improving the regulations for exchange bureaus. After the bureaus were closed in
early March, the conditions for practicing the money changing profession were
clarified (Instruction 025 of April 29, 2011) and the BCRG reopened the exchange
bureaus on April 7. Since then, the exchange rates of these bureaus have been freely
determined and the BCRG’s official rate has been determined as the average of the
commercial banks’ rates for the preceding day; and



reviving the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) in March 2011, allowing the
allocation of about US$170 million to the banks to finance imports during 2011.

The BCRG set up a monetary programming committee to better monitor the evolution of the
monetary situation. A monthly monetary and exchange policy bulletin has been prepared
since June, with the intention to publish it in the press. The BCRG also began to build its
banking supervision capacity with the assistance of the IMF Regional Technical Assistance
Center for West Africa (West AFRITAC).

52
12.
In the area of structural reforms, the government has taken important measures
to create the conditions for sound economic and financial management in the medium
term. Therefore:


The government has implemented a new mining policy to ensure more transparent
and stricter management of the country’s natural resources. To that end, on
September 9, 2011, it adopted and promulgated a new mining code conforming to
international standards, with support from the Agence Française de Développement
(AFD) and other development partners. The implementing texts and a standard
contract are expected to be finalized in 2012. Furthermore, on March 1, 2011, Guinea
resumed participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI
Initiative), which it had voluntarily suspended in 2009, and the steering committee
action plan is currently being implemented to complete the process of validating
Guinea’s EITI.



With support from the World Bank and the AFD, an institutional audit of the energy
sector was completed and submitted to stakeholders in September 2011 and will be
used to define a sector reform program following the roundtable organized for this
purpose on January 16–17, 2012. Discussions are under way with French utility
Electricité de France (EDF) with a view toward providing technical assistance to its
Guinean counterpart Electricité de Guinée (EDG).



The reform of the justice and security services sectors was launched in 2011 through
the organization of the forum on justice and the adoption of a program to restructure
the armed forces, gendarmerie, and police. This restructuring includes, inter alia,
a biometric census of the military, completed for the Conakry garrisons in
October 2011 and in progress for garrisons in the interior; the retirement of
3,928 military personnel in December 2011; and the creation of a judicial
framework for the military and adoption of the corresponding statute.



The government launched a broad agricultural sector recovery program with a view
to attaining food self sufficiency in the medium term and developing agricultural
exports in the long term. It reinstated the structures for agricultural training and
extension services and executed a major program to distribute inputs, seeds, and
agricultural materials.



With support from the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
reforms were undertaken to promote the private sector in order to attract investors and
facilitate the establishment of enterprises. To that end, a framework for public-private
sector dialog became operational in May 2011 with the organization of a
public-private roundtable. A private investment promotion agency (APIP) was
established in November 2011 and implemented a one-stop window for creating
enterprises in early December 2011. These actions will improve the business climate

53
and therefore Guinea’s ranking in the next “Doing Business,” which will make
Guinea eligible for support from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA). The
export sector also benefitted from renewed access to the US markets, which had been
suspended at end-2009, under the “African Growth and Opportunity Act” (AGOA)
in October 2011.


In the hotel and tourism sector, three hotels were privatized (Hôtel Kaloum, Hôtel du
Niger and Hôtel Camayenne), thereby paving the way to increasing sector capacity
within the next 18 months.

13.
In the context of poverty reduction, since it took office, the government has
established an emergency program based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). The PRSP II (2007–10) was extended to cover the period 2011–12 in order to
achieve certain objectives that had not been reached under the military regime of 2009–10.
The extension was presented to the members of government at a governmental seminar in
January 2011 and to the interim legislature (Comité National de Transition—CNT) in
February 2011. An implementation report covering the first half of 2011 was produced and
shared with the Bretton Woods institutions. The PRSP III and a new poverty survey are being
prepared.
14.
During 2011, the government took steps to address the urgent needs of the
population. In particular, the government established a system to facilitate access to some
essential goods at affordable prices, such as rice, flour, sugar, and vegetable oil. This system
operates in parallel with private sector operations. It includes imports and/or distribution
services, which were initially provided by the government alone but are gradually being
performed in partnership with the private sector. Over time, the government intends to divest
these operations. Measures taken also include the ad hoc and temporary waiver of duties and
taxes on the government’s imports of these goods.
15.
Efforts to implement the structural triggers for the completion point under the
HIPC Initiative are continuing with the help of the development partners (Table 3). The
quarterly audits of public contracts through June-2009 have been completed. Contract audits
for the second half of 2009 and for 2010 have mostly been completed, with the support of the
World Bank and experts from the French Audit Court; work is underway with the aim to
complete the remaining by February 2012. The government has launched the audit of
contracts concluded in the first half of 2011. The Anti-corruption Agency reports through
end-2010 have been produced and published on the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
website and the report for 2011 will be prepared and published by end-March 2012. With
respect to health indicators, Ministry of Health and World Bank data have been harmonized
thereby enabling Guinea to achieve this trigger of the HIPC completion point.
16.
Despite the progress made in 2011, major challenges lie ahead. Despite the
stabilization in 2011, inflation remains a matter of concern and the main macroeconomic
challenge in the short term. The very heavy burden of the external public debt and weak
infrastructure, particularly in the electricity, water, transport, and telecommunications

54
sectors, are major handicaps to the revival of growth. Structural reforms in particular are
needed to prepare the economy for the massive investments expected in the mining sector in
the coming years.
III.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2012–14

17.
The government intends to adopt and implement an economic and financial
program covering the period 2012–14 to consolidate the results obtained in 2011 under
the Staff-Monitored Program, to resume growth, and to reduce poverty. This program
seeks to reduce inflation and to lay the foundations for accelerated and diversified growth.
It is in line with the extended PRSP for 2011–12 and the 2011–15 five-year plan, which
will serve as the basis for the PRSP III for 2013–16, now under preparation, which will
establish the operational pillars for the support from Guinea’s development partners.
The government’s economic vision consists of mobilizing the country’s agricultural,
hydroelectric, and mining potential, increasing the competitiveness of the economy by
improving infrastructure and social services (education, public health) and by strengthening
good governance and anti-corruption efforts.
18.
The government will continue to make every effort to receive the support of the
international community for the program. This support could take the form of enhanced
technical and financial assistance and reduction of the foreign debt burden upon reaching the
completion point under the HIPC Initiative.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Objectives
19.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework is heavily influenced by mining
sector megaprojects. Foreign direct investments in the sector, particularly for the
development of iron deposits, could represent over 40 percent of GDP per year on average
during 2012–14. During that period, the economic impact of these investments will
essentially produce a substantial increase in imports and the external current account deficit.
When production and exports from the megaprojects begin in 2015, these deficits should
decline markedly, while the real growth rate and government revenue should sharply
increase.
20.
The main macroeconomic objectives of the program are to: (1) achieve real
growth of 4.7 percent in 2012—based on large investments in the mining sector, the effects
of the recovery efforts and of public investment in the energy sector, support for the
agricultural sector, and continued normalization of the political and social situation—and an
average rate of 4–5 percent in 2013–14; (2) reduce inflation to an annual average of
15 percent in 2012 and close to 12 percent year-on-year by end-2012, and gradually aim for
levels well below 10 percent in 2014; and (3) in order to protect against exogenous shocks,
maintain the level of exchange reserves above 2.5 months of imports (excluding imports for
megaprojects financed by foreign investment).

55
21.
Macroeconomic policy will hinge on strengthening economic and financial policy
coordination. In the area of public finance, emphasis will be placed on mobilizing
government revenue and strengthening public expenditure management. Given the weakness
of the financial markets, fiscal policy will continue to play a key role in the strategy to reduce
inflation. The budget deficit will be constrained by the goal to avoid net domestic bank
financing (excluding the use of deposits of exceptional resources), the availability of
financing from development partners, and the need to maintain debt sustainability both
before and after reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative. The budget’s
windfall resources from the mining sector will be used mainly to finance infrastructure.
Given the limited absorptive capacity of the economy, resource use will be planned over the
medium term by continuing to adjust the basic fiscal balance to levels compatible with
available funding. Monetary policy should also be tightened to mop up excess liquidity and
curb inflation. A proactive exchange policy should limit erratic fluctuations and prevent
mining investments from driving up the real exchange rate and diminishing the
competitiveness of the non-mining sectors of the economy.
22.
Structural reforms will be continued to ensure good governance and improve the
economy’s capacity to manage the mining boom. The reform of the mining sector will be
pursued in particular by renegotiating mining contracts in a spirit of partnership. Far-reaching
reforms of the energy sector will be undertaken with a view to increasing the supply of
electrical energy while strengthening technical, commercial, and financial management of
the EDG, including a tariff adjustment. The government will also conduct sector studies
with a view to reorganizing public enterprises, including those in the transportation and
telecommunications sectors, and implement a credible, realistic public investment program
in the medium term in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the five-year plan. The
business climate will also be improved by strengthening the judicial system and the legal and
institutional framework of the private sector. With support from the development partners,
reform of the defense and security forces will continue through retirement programs followed
by support and training measures. The government reform and modernization program will
continue, notably with improved procedures, government-wide automation, and capacity
building and efforts to increase the proportion of young and female employees. Finally, the
agricultural sector will be developed, in collaboration with the development partners, with a
view to achieving food self-sufficiency and to developing agro-industry.
B. Fiscal Policy
23.
The government’s fiscal policy will reflect three basic pillars: (i) increased
mobilization of government revenue; (ii) control and improvement of the quality of
public spending and its reorientation towards the priority sectors, within the limits of
available resources; and (iii) caps on the budget deficit and debt while maintaining
fiscal and public debt sustainability. With respect to revenue, the goal is convergence
towards the ECOWAS standard in 2014, i.e., a tax ratio of 20 percent of GDP, compared
with close to 17.5 percent in 2011. After an increase in 2012, current expenses should

56
decrease slightly as a percentage of GDP by 2014. By contrast, investment expenses will
increase sharply in 2012 and remain at a high level above 10 percent of GDP in 2013–14,
reflecting the use of the windfall revenue collected in 2011 and a resumption of assistance
from development partners. Mainly as a result of the increase in domestically-financed
investment, the basic fiscal deficit will increase from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to
3.8 percent in 2012, but will fall to around 1 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014.
24.
With respect to financing, the objective is to prevent budget-based monetary
expansion—other than the growth associated with the use of deposits of windfall
revenue—and to maintain the public debt at a sustainable level. In order to support
efforts to reduce inflation as quickly as possible, the budget will not be financed with
advances from the BCRG, and the proceeds of bond and debt issues will be used to reduce
the outstanding balance of these advances. Deposits of the windfall earnings of 2011 will be
gradually used over the medium term. The medium-term macroeconomic framework is based
on the principle that, after IMF approval of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement,
Guinea’s remaining arrears on its external debt and its debt service obligations falling due
during the program period will be rescheduled by its Paris Club creditors. The government
also expects comparable treatment from other bilateral creditors within the framework of the
HIPC Initiative. The residual financing requirement should be met after reaching the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in 2012. After the legislative
elections—which should mark the end of the transition to a normal constitutional
situation—a donor conference is expected to mobilize additional external resources.
Revenue
25.
The tax ratio will be increased through strict compliance with the existing laws
and regulations combined with reforms of tax administration and policy. Concerning tax
revenue from the mining sector, the government will implement the new mining code strictly
and transparently and the standard mining contract after its completion in 2012 (see
paragraph 47). This is expected to stabilize current mining revenue at around 4 percent of
GDP by 2014. Fuel taxes—which contribute close to 15 percent of revenue—will be
safeguarded by the controlled implementation of a system of flexible prices at the pump,
in an attempt to gradually eliminate petroleum product revenue losses.
26.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will develop a plan to implement
tax reforms by end-June 2012 (structural benchmark) based on technical assistance
received in 2011 from development partners, including the IMF. These reforms will consist
of enhancing the efficiency of tax policy and tax administration.


The steps for reforming tax policy will include mainly: (i) simplification of the tax
system by consolidating certain duties and taxes, taking their yield into account;
(ii) changing the tax brackets for taxpayers; (iii) making the minimum income tax
progressive; (iv) expanding the VAT to medium-sized enterprises; (v) making payroll

57
taxes consistent with corporate taxes; and (vi) gradually decentralizing taxation based
on capacity at the local level.


Tax administration reforms will be based on: (i) greater segmentation of the taxpayer
population through the creation of large, medium-sized, and small enterprise
directorates; (ii) transition from a system of administrative assessment to a system of
voluntary filing; (iii) restructuring of the tax and customs administration to separate
the management, steering, and monitoring of operational functions; (iv) strengthening
of reporting, survey, and supervision activities to combat tax fraud and tax evasion;
(v) enhanced auditing of autonomous government agencies to guarantee that they
contribute to the government budget; (vi) accelerated computerization and connection
with offices outside Conakry and with users (VERITAS, carriers, importers); and
(vii) redeployment of customs officers to land border stations. The objectives of these
reforms are listed in the performance contracts and are accompanied by the relevant
audited performance indicators to measure the efforts made by the various units
independent of the economic situation.

27.

For 2012, the government will take the following measures:



The mechanism for regularly adjusting fuel prices based on changes in international
market prices and in the exchange rate will be reintroduced starting July 1, 2012
(structural benchmark) after gradually reducing losses from the beginning of the
year. This will help considerably reduce revenue losses, which were estimated at over
3 percent of GDP between January and September 2011.



The unit in charge of the investment code will be revived to closely track
implementation of the code. It will draw up an exhaustive list of companies benefiting
from the code and their tax advantages by end-March 2012, will terminate the
benefits for companies for which the duration of eligibility has expired, and will
revise the code for adoption by the government by end-August 2012 (structural
benchmark) to limit the tax revenue cost while remaining competitive.



Proposals for changing the rate and scope of certain taxes will be submitted to the
government and parliament. The increase in fixed-rate and prorated business taxes
will be adopted in the context of the general tax code. The rate of withholdings at
source on nonwage income has already been raised from 10 to 15 percent in the
context of the 2012 budget law.



The system for reimbursing VAT credits will be improved to reduce complaints,
accelerate refunds, and avoid impairing corporate cash flow.



Regulatory and contractual exemptions will be reviewed by end-June 2012 to
eliminate all exemptions that no longer serve the purposes for which they were
granted. The government will refrain from granting exemptions other than those
provided under ordinary law.

58


A mobile scanner will be installed at the port of Conakry and a pallet scanner at the
Conakry airport.



The technical framework will be improved: secure and computerized taxpayer census;
computerization of tax units and revenue stations and their online connection with
other administrations.



The government will conduct an institutional and regulatory audit of all
revenue-generating services. The MEF will prepare an exhaustive list of these
services and, by end-September 2012, will draw up performance contracts with the
revenue authorities under the aegis of the ministries to which they are attached. The
share of the revenue of autonomous agencies in the semi-public sector accruing to the
government budget will be revised by end-December 2012, taking care to safeguard
the financial equilibrium of these entities.



The complete inventory of government-owned buildings will be completed by
end-September 2012 and the approach to their management will be changed to ensure
that the revenue they produce reaches the Treasury. The government will submit to
parliament a draft law reviewing all texts allocating revenue from end-September
2012, with a view to placing them under the responsibility of the Finance Minister
based on the “single pot” principle, while preserving the financial autonomy of the
recipients.



The tax audits begun in 2011 in partnership with the AFD will be completed with
respect to effective collections and resolution of disputes. A complete list of
delinquent taxpayers owing more than GNF 1 billion will be published every six
months. To complete the legal mechanism of these verification actions, the tax appeal
commission will come on stream during the first half of 2012. The investigation and
research units at the National Tax Directorate and the General Customs Directorate
will be strengthened in terms of their administrative positioning and the human and
material resources made available to them.

Expenditure
28.
The government will continue efforts to control public expenditure, to improve
the quality of expenditure, and channel spending toward priority social and economic
sectors. The increase in operating expenses will be mitigated, mainly by the expected
increase in revenue. Key elements will be the stabilization (as a percentage of GDP) of the
wage bill (which has almost doubled as a percentage of GDP since 2005) and rationalization
of subsidies. The reform of the security sector should help redirect spending towards such
priority sectors as health, education, justice, and infrastructure. Windfall mining revenue
significantly increases investment potential. Aware of the challenges posed by these
resources, the government has created a Special Investment Fund (SIF) to manage them
(Box 2). Investments will also benefit from renewed aid inflows from development partners.
The government attaches great importance to public financial management reform. With the

59
technical assistance from Guinea’s partners, the medium-term objective is to revamp the
legal, organizational, and technical framework of public financial management so that it can
meet the challenges Guinea must face in managing macroeconomic and revenue volatility,
to secure the allocation of public resources to economic growth and poverty reduction.
29.
The government will institute reforms to contain the public sector wage bill.
During the period 2012–14, the wage bill will be limited to around 5.3 percent of GDP.
Based on the Government Reform and Administrative Modernization Program (PREMA)
to be approved during first quarter 2012, the government will adopt, by end-2012, a civil
service reform plan for the following years aimed at controlling the number of government
employees and enhancing civil service productivity. These measures will create the fiscal
space to address the increasingly pressing social demands for new hiring in the basic public
services—health, education, roads, water, energy, sanitation, etc.—while stabilizing the wage
bill as a percentage of GDP.
30.
The budget for 2012 includes a 16 percent increase in the wage bill, which would
allow for partially adjusting wages to the increased cost of living. That notwithstanding,
controls on staffing and hiring restrictions based on the government’s financial capabilities
will help stabilize the wage bill as a percentage of GDP. The measures implemented in 2011
will be continued, particularly the biometric census, the elimination of duplicate records and
deceased persons from the payroll, the effective implementation of provisions concerning
retirement, and the harmonization of civil service staff and payroll files and their availability
online. The government will also launch priority actions under the PREMA, namely:
(i) redefining the government’s missions; (ii) streamlining public administration;
(iii) enhancing the coordination and effectiveness of government work; and
(iv) consolidating the decentralization process.
31.
The government will continue to rationalize subsidies. Spending on subsidies and
transfers has risen considerably since 2008. In the medium term, financial support from the
government will be allocated mainly to mitigating the negative impact of the reforms on the
underprivileged population and reducing inequalities. Social safety nets will be developed
through targeted spending on poverty reduction and the development of human capital.
Although spending on subsidies and transfers will once again increase in 2012, to 4 percent
of GDP, because of agricultural subsidies and transfers to the electricity company (EDG), the
government proposes to stabilize them at around 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013–14 based on the
expected results of security reform, the cleanup of the student subsidy register, rationalization
of government interventions in the agriculture sector, and reform of the electricity sector.
32.
Two important components of the government’s policy to streamline subsidies
will come from reforms in the electricity and agricultural sectors.


Given the operating conditions of the semi-public electricity company (EDG), the
government should subsidize the cost of operating new thermal plants, estimated at
0.6 percent of GDP in 2012 (see paragraph 49 electricity sector reform). Because of

60
the magnitude and urgency of the power supply problem, the government organized a
roundtable on January 16–17, 2012 with its main development partners to draw up
measures to overhaul the management of the EDG. The government will adopt the
action plan resulting from this round table by end-March 2012, including the increase
in electricity rates to keep subsidies in 2012 at the amount indicated above.


The methods and procedures for assistance to the agricultural sector (distribution of
inputs, seeds, and agricultural materials), as well as the extension and collection of
agricultural loans will be harmonized, based on advice provided by the World Bank
and IFAD by the start of the 2012 crop year (April 2012) with a view to controlling
agricultural subsidies and improving the rate of collection of producer loans
(structural benchmark).

33.
Investment expenditures are projected to remain high in the years to come to
meet urgent needs, particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors. Investment
financed domestically will rise to an average of 6 percent of GDP per year from 2012 to
2014, about two thirds of which are expected to be financed with windfall mining revenue in
2012–13 and one third in 2014, including the SIF (Box 2). In keeping with the PRSP and the
five-year plan, investments will be mainly geared towards the electricity and infrastructure
sectors. With the resumption of relations with the development partners, spending on
investment projects financed with external resources is expected to increase rapidly in
2013–14.
34.
The government estimates that the 2012 budget can be financed. In a context of
declining budgetary assistance, financing requirements will be met with domestic resources
and external debt relief (see paragraph 55 below). There will be no change in the Treasury’s
net position vis-à-vis the banking system during 2012 except for the use of deposits of
windfall revenue. The 2012 budget provides for the use of US$215 million (about 4 percent
of GDP) of the windfall revenue collected in 2011 and deposited with the BCRG. Also, of
the US$250 million in windfall revenue anticipated in 2012, half is earmarked for financing
general budget expenditure and the other half will be deposited in the SIF and will improve
the Treasury’s net position vis-à-vis the BCRG. For the purpose of developing the monetary
and financial markets, the government intends to increase the balance of Treasury bills
(usually subscribed by the commercial banks) by GNF 300 billion and will also issue bonds
of GNF 300 million. To maintain zero banking system financing of government financial
operations other than the use of deposits representing windfall revenue, the government will
use those funds for an additional GNF 600 million in repayments to the BCRG.
35.
With respect to structural measures, public financial management will be
modernized. To that end, the government will review its legislative and regulatory
framework to align it with international or regional standards. A new framework budget law
will be drafted in 2012, adopted, and submitted to the parliament by end-June 2012; the new
public procurement code will be approved and implemented by end-2012; the general
government accounting regulations will be adopted by end-September 2012; a new budget

61
nomenclature will be prepared by end-September 2012 and a new government chart of
accounts will be prepared by end-December 2012 for implementation in time for preparation
and execution of the 2014 budget law; the general tax code will be revised; the book on tax
procedures will be drafted; the customs and investment codes will be adapted to the changing
national and international economic environment. All these reforms will be supported by
capacity-building actions with assistance from the IMF, West AFRITAC, and other
development partners.
36.
The government continues to ensure that government contracts are awarded
transparently through competitive bidding processes. To prevent the disastrous problems
of 2009–10, public procurement regulations were strictly enforced in 2011. However, during
the last quarter of 2011, the government was compelled by serious problems, urgent needs,
and high expectations of populations in the agriculture and energy sectors to award two
2 major contracts through direct negotiation. The contracts related to the procurement of
thermoelectric generators from Brazil to alleviate the shortfall in electricity product with
respect to demand, and to the acquisition of tractors, combine harvesters and other agricultural
equipment for the harvest. In 2012 and hereafter, the government will refrain from any
negotiated transactions that violate the procurement code. With respect to the government
contracts signed in 2009–10 that were frozen, the government decided to cancel those for
which execution had not begun, and a contract adjustment committee was created to reclassify
the others to make them compatible with budget provisions and subject to strict specifications.
C. Monetary and Exchange Policies
37.
The first priority of medium-term monetary policy will be to control inflation
by regularly mopping up excess liquidity. To that end, the BCRG will maintain a very
rigorous monetary policy, limiting growth of base money to the inflation reduction target,
including through revitalizing market instruments and interventions on the foreign exchange
market. The BCRG will do everything possible to curb any inflationary pressures that may
result from the rapid acceleration of mining megaprojects in 2012, in particular by sterilizing
the equivalent amount in Guinea francs of inflows of foreign exchange intended to cover the
local expenses of those projects. The BCRG will continue to increase the efficiency of the
foreign exchange market and, more generally, develop the financial system, including its
supervision. The government attaches great importance to the independence of the BCRG
and will take necessary steps to strengthen its financial position following the excesses
of 2009–10.

62

Box 2. Special Investment Fund
The 2012 budget law established the Special Investment Fund (SIF) to promote the
efficient and sustainable use of the windfall mining revenue. The SIF will take the form of
a special (fiscal) Treasury account at the BCRG denominated in Guinea francs. SIF funding
will come mainly from windfall mining revenue, although development partners and other
sources may also contribute to jointly finance projects. The SIF will finance projects in the
Public Investment Program. This financing and the projects concerned will be subject to the
general provisions of public financial management and will be part of the annual budget
approved by the parliament. The government will establish an SIF Steering Committee, which
will provide opinions on the quality of the projects proposed by the ministries for financing by
the SIF, in particular in accordance with the public investment program and the objectives
established for the five-year plan and PSRP, their efficiency and sustainability over the
medium term. The Steering Committee will include representatives of the BCRG, government
agencies, partners contributing to SIF-funded projects, and civil society. SIF counterpart funds
in foreign currency will be managed by the BCRG in accordance with best international
practices for asset management as part of its portfolio of foreign assets. The authorities intend
to request technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank with a view to adopting
implementing texts and general terms and conditions of operation for implementation of the
SIF by end-March 2012 (structural benchmark).
In March 2012, the SIF will receive the equivalent of US$250 million in start-up funds from the
2011 windfall mining revenue. In the 2012 budget, the government projects additional windfall

revenue of US$250 million, half of which will also be used to fund the SIF. Given the limited
absorptive capacity of the economy and government agencies, and the increasing complexity
of sustainability issues, the challenges of efficient management of windfall revenue will
increase in proportion with the amounts. If the government were to collect more than the
expected US$250 million in windfall revenue in 2012, at least 75 percent of the additional
amounts would be transferred to the SIF. In the event that this additional revenue should
materialize, program objectives would be adjusted by 80 percent of the additional amount for
net foreign reserves (upwards), for net domestic bank financing of government (downwards),
and for net domestic assets of the BCRG (downwards), allowing for the immediate use of
20 percent of this revenue. In that connection, the government, based on advice provided by its
development partners, will adopt a medium-term public investment program by endSeptember 2012 (structural benchmark), which will provide a portfolio of projects held in
reserve for possible financing through the SIF. Notwithstanding this provision, the government
will consult with IMF staff before using the additional windfall revenue in excess of the
US$250 million provided in the 2012 budget to ensure that use of the revenue remains aligned
with overall program objectives. If the government earns even more windfall revenue, it will
prepare more comprehensive rules for allocating these receipts to the SIF.

63
38.
In 2012, the BCRG plans to strengthen its capacities to define and execute its
monetary policy. Following the increase in the required reserves ratio to 22 percent in
October 2011, the BCRG intends to resume its interventions using its own financial securities
(monetary regulation securities—TRM). Moreover, in close cooperation with the MEF, it
will prepare a study on the consolidation and conversion of BCRG advances into Treasury
bills and the use of Treasury securities to implement monetary policy. With IMF technical
assistance, the BCRG plans to develop its tools for an improved assessment of liquidity
conditions in the economy and thus better inform monetary policy. It will also continue
providing better information to the economy through the monthly publication of its balance
sheet and an analysis of the evolution of the monetary situation on its website and in the local
newspapers.
39.
The exchange policy objective will be to improve the determination of rates by
market forces, minimize daily fluctuations, and reduce the exchange premium between
the official and informal markets. The improved international reserves level will facilitate
increased intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), although the BCRG
is aware of the need to preserve external competitiveness. Moreover, to strengthen the
Guinean economy's capacity to absorb external shocks, the monetary authorities will
maintain gross international reserves at a level equal to at least 2.5 months of goods and
services imports (excluding imports for major mining sector projects financed by foreign
direct investment).
40.
The BCRG will continue to improve the operation of the foreign exchange
market with a view to unifying the official and parallel markets and eliminating
multiple exchange rates. To better reflect market forces, further reduce the premium
vis-à-vis the parallel market, and attract transactions to the formal market, the monetary
authorities plan to initially expand the band around the reference rate within which the banks
are required to buy and sell foreign exchange and subsequently eliminate it. The reference
rate will continue to be determined as the weighted average of commercial bank rates. Based
on the technical assistance recommendations of the IMF, the BCRG will increase the
transparency of transactions in the weekly auctions (IFEM). It will also draft a memorandum
clarifying the operating regulations for the IFEM (method of allocation and the fixing of
exchange rates) approved by the Foreign Exchange Commission—by end-March 2012. It
will ensure that the foreign exchange positions of primary banks comply with the regulations
in force. The BCRG also plans to amend the foreign exchange regulation with IMF technical
assistance. It will request further IMF technical assistance with a view to proposing new
measures to eliminate the multiple currency practice. To ensure the success of its foreign
exchange policy, the BCRG will seek to strengthen operational foreign exchange capacities
through the establishment of a foreign exchange trading room and personnel training. To this
end, a request for technical and financial assistance has been submitted to the World Bank.
The BCRG attaches great importance to strengthening bank supervision. With
41.
technical assistance from West AFRITAC, the BCRG increased the staffing of the financial

64
institutions supervision directorate by hiring 18 inspectors at end-2011. It will focus on
training its personnel in 2012, with support from West AFRITAC and Banque de France.
Implementation of this training program will quickly bring the BCRG’s bank supervision
capacity up to standards. The BCRG has also requested technical assistance from the IMF
and West AFRITAC to strengthen the regulations governing bank supervision. In 2012, the
BCRG plans to prepare a comprehensive financial sector development plan, including with
a view to preparing for stronger economic growth in the second half of the decade, following
the start of production of new mining reserves.
42.
The BCRG will continue its policy of modernization and increased transparency
in the conduct of its operations. The external audit of the BCRG 2011 financial statements
will be completed by end-June 2012 and the results, including the auditor’s opinion, will be
published on its website by end-August 2012. During the program period, an independent
external auditor will certify the accounting and the statistical data on the program
performance at test dates submitted to the IMF by the BCRG. The audit of the information
system was carried out by an independent firm and steps were taken to correct the
shortcomings identified. In particular, a technical assistant was hired in November 2011 to
assist the BCRG in reorganizing the IT directorate and strengthening the governance of
the information system. In addition, a new IT master plan was adopted in December 2011.
43.
The BCRG will also continue to strengthen management and the financial
position. Following the January 2012 IMF mission to update the 2007 safeguards
assessment, the BCRG will implement most of the recommendations during 2012, in
particular, revitalization of the audit committee, the publication of audited financial
statements, and strengthening of the external audit mechanism. Furthermore, the BCRG
board of directors will approve an investment policy and guidelines by end-December 2012
(structural benchmark). To strengthen capacity for the management of external assets—on
the rise owing to windfall mining revenues—the BCRG requested technical assistance from
the World Bank under its Reserve Advisory and Management Program (RAMP). Finally, the
BCRG will request technical assistance to modify the accounting system to comply with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This could necessitate an increase in the
bank’s capital, partly to cover the losses resulting from huge banknote orders in 2009–10.
Pending the conversion of the financial statements to the IFRS, the government intends to
recapitalize the BCRG by US$50 million during the second half of 2012. This amount will be
drawn from windfall mining revenue.
D. Other Structural Reform Measures
44.
The principal medium-term objective in the area of structural reforms is to
create an environment favorable to diversified economic growth by preparing the
economy for the mining boom in the years ahead. Following the normalization of the
political and social situation and based on the fundamental improvement in governance the
government is determined to achieve, foreign investors’ interest in the development of
Guinea’s rich natural resources has quickly returned. Major investment projects to exploit

65
iron ore and convert bauxite into alumina are in the execution phase or in the advanced stages
of preparation. The volume of investment in these megaprojects during the period 2011–14,
including transportation infrastructures, is estimated at US$25 billion, or more than 5 times
the 2011 GDP. The start of production, expected to occur toward the middle of the decade,
will transform the Guinean economy. The challenge for these structural reforms will be to
ensure that this transformation reduces poverty and contributes to improved living conditions
for the Guinean people. The main reforms concern the mining sector, the energy sector, and
promotion of the agricultural sector, as well as improvement of the business climate.
Mining policy
45.
Medium-term prospects for the mining sector depends on megaprojects
currently under way to exploit iron ore and convert bauxite into alumina. The
longer-term development of the sector requires diversification of exploitation to other natural
and nonrenewable resources such as petroleum, gold, uranium, nickel, and rare earths. The
government's approach to development of Guinea's mining sector is based on the concept
of Mines and Sustainable Integrated Development, which is based in turn on four pillars:
(i) development of agriculture and the industrial fabric in mining zones and along the
transportation routes for mining projects; (ii) protection of the environment through close
monitoring of environmental management plans and appropriate control of the escrow fund
for environmental protection; (iii) community development through institutional capacity
building for local governments to ensure sound management of the mining companies'
contribution and the preparation of community development agreements to be executed by
mining companies and local governments; and (iv) regular surveillance of mining activities
with a view to improving government revenue. In the petroleum sector, drafts of the revised
petroleum code, the standard production-sharing contract, and the implementing regulations
have already been prepared; the government expects to work with a prominent firm to
finalize the texts by end-September 2012.
46.
The new mining policy is intended to ensure that the Guinean people benefit
from the country's mining resources and to promote synergies with the rest of the
economy. The strategy for development of loading infrastructures for mining products will
be implemented by positioning the government as owner of the loading infrastructures and
integrating mining companies into the master infrastructure development plan prepared by
the government, in order to achieve coherent economic development on the national scale
and pool the use of infrastructures to ensure financial and economic profitability and promote
economic integration of the areas where they are located. In view of their complexity and
capacity, the megaprojects will require the government to train personnel in order to develop
managers and technical teams capable not only of supervising and monitoring mining activity
but also of directing or executing the construction and operation of mining projects. The
government will improve governance through adherence to the principles developed by the
international organizations active in this area. Guinea will strive to fully implement the
principles of the EITI and the Kimberley Process to increase transparency and build

66
credibility in the management of mining revenue and ensure traceability of diamonds
produced in Guinea in international trade. The practice of transparency and good governance
will be maintained and reinforced with the development of megaprojects.
47.
In 2012, the mining policy will focus on: (i) finalizing the implementation of the
new mining code through the adoption of implementing texts; (ii) auditing and revising
existing contracts to comply to the extent possible with the new mining code; and
(ii) rehabilitating the mining cadastre.


In the context of implementing the new mining code, the government, with technical
assistance from partners including the IMF, will finalize the implementing
regulations. To ensure that the government obtains an equitable share of the revenues
from the exploitation of mining resources, implementing decrees for the new mining
code, as well as a standard mining contract for Guinea, will be adopted and published
by end-June 2012 (structural benchmark). To that end, the standard mining contract
drafted in 2008 will be harmonized with the provisions of the new mining code. In
view of the mining sector’s significant role in Guinea’s fiscal revenue and economy,
the government will consult with the IMF before approving any modification of the
new mining code or implementing regulations that could have an impact on tax
revenue (continuous structural benchmark).



The existing mining contracts will be revised, based on mutually agreeable
conditions, to ensure that all investors are treated equally under the country’s mining
legislation. The prompt recruitment of specialized firms to advise the government on
the revision of mining contracts will reassure companies currently operating in the
sector and avoid penalizing the development of projects in progress. In this regard,
the authorities selected independent firms to conduct an audit of the mining
companies to ensure that their past activities were in compliance with all the
provisions of the existing contracts. The audit is expected to be completed by
end- 2012.



The mining cadastre will be audited and corrected to facilitate more rational
management of mining resources to promote effective development of the sector.
The overhaul of the cadastre aims to establish a natural resources data file enabling
the government to access information on the mining reserves identified. The file
should support tracking of mining activities in order to inform users of all
transactions in the sector. Following a competitive bidding process complying with
the public procurement code, an independent external firm was selected to conduct
the mining cadastre audit. The technical teams will soon be operational, and the audit
is scheduled to be completed by end-June 2012.

67
Energy sector
48.
The medium-term policy for the energy sector is based on two components:
(i) restructuring and rehabilitation of the sector, including the EDG semipublic
monopoly; and (ii) development of Guinea’s enormous hydroelectric potential.
Lack of maintenance and technical and commercial losses of more than 43 percent of
production have led to the near-total unavailability of electricity in most areas of the
country. Reform of the sector is one of the government’s most important priorities, given
the disastrous effect on economic growth and on living conditions in Guinea. Pending
implementation of those reforms, the government has already begun to launch one of the
major hydroelectric projects identified long ago, the Kaléta dam on the Konkouré River
which, together with micro-dam projects, will not only increase the local availability of
power but also offer the opportunity to export electricity to neighboring countries.
49.
In 2012, the emphasis will be on rehabilitating and restructuring the sector.
Following the energy sector audit, the government, with the support of development partners,
will undertake an in-depth reform of the sector designed both to increase the supply of
electric power and to strengthen the technical, commercial, and financial management of
EDG, including the adjustment of tariffs. A recent sector roundtable with the development
partners organized in Conakry on January 16–17, 2012 reviewed the consultant’s audit report
and the 2011–14 energy sector investment program, as well as the structure of governance
and management of EDG. At the conclusion of this roundtable an action plan including the
investment program, a tariff adjustment calendar, and rehabilitation measures aimed at
reducing technical and nontechnical losses and strengthening the commercial and financial
management of EDG was agreed. The government plans to adopt a comprehensive plan for
reform for the sector by end-March 2012 (structural benchmark); this plan will include a
tariff adjustment to ensure that budgetary support to EDG remains within the limit
established in the budget law. The government will also choose a strategic partner to provide
technical assistance for management.
50.
The government also intends to rehabilitate and improve management of the
water sector. To that end, an institutional audit of the sector is planned during 2012 and a
roundtable of partners will be held thereafter with support from the AfDB and World Bank.
As in the electricity sector, the process is expected to lead to the definition of a program for
restructuring and investment in the water sector, including the selection of a strategic partner
for technical assistance.
Agricultural sector
51.
The government’s agricultural policy aims to ensure food security by 2014 and
ultimately position Guinea as an exporter of agricultural products. The government
intends to make this vision a reality by modernizing family farms and promoting the
agricultural private sector. The government’s interventions, including financial support to

68
the agricultural sector, will be guided by the desire to improve economic efficiency and
social equity in that sector. The main actions envisaged are:


promote the development of a dynamic agricultural private sector by putting in place
sustainable mechanisms for financing the sector;



in cooperation with the development partners, strengthen agricultural infrastructures
with a view to facilitating private investment in agro-industry;



diversify food production beyond rice while sustainably developing rice cultivation
by improving control of water resources; and



increase productivity and yields per hectare in agricultural operations through a
policy to encourage the use of improved inputs and seeds and the introduction of
appropriate mechanization.

52.
The main policy objective for agriculture in 2012 will be to enhance the
sustainability of assistance measures initiated in the sector in 2011. In collaboration with
the development partners, the Ministry of Agriculture drew up a National Agricultural
Investment Plan (PNIA), soon to be adopted by the government. With the assistance of the
World Bank, the government will continue refocusing public expenditure in accordance with
the priorities of the PNIA. In addition, the current system for facilitating access to
agricultural inputs will be gradually adjusted to ensure the effective competitiveness of the
sector and optimize the use of budget subsidies. Initially, while also prefinancing and
subsidizing seeds, fertilizer, and agricultural equipment, the government will ensure recovery
of the producer’s share. Thereafter, the government will gradually reduce subsidies as
agricultural production expands so as to reduce the fiscal burden and avoid supporting
artificial competitiveness, which would be detrimental to the optimal development of the
economy as a whole.
Improving the business climate
53.
The government is also in the process of finalizing an action plan to improve the
business climate. In 2011, Guinea was ranked 181 out of 183 countries worldwide in the
Doing Business index. The objective is to improve Guinea's ranking by at least 10 places in
the next three years. To this end, the government will:


facilitate economic activity by promoting competition and public-private partnerships
to establish key enterprises in strategic sectors such as energy. In 2012, it plans to
strengthen the institutional framework for private investment, in particular by:
(a) initiating the operations of the private investment promotion agency (APIP) and
the one-stop window and building the respective capacities to respond to investor
requests; and (b) streamlining private sector professional organizations. The
government has requested technical and financial assistance from the World Bank
and the IFC to carry out the reforms needed to promote the private sector, improve
the business climate, and encourage investment in non-mining sectors of the

69
economy. To this end, a policy letter for the promotion of private investment will
be prepared with assistance from the development partners and adopted by the
government by end-September 2012. At the same time, a coordination unit for
private sector reforms will be established within the Ministry of Industry and Small
and Medium Enterprises;


enhance the credibility and authority of the judiciary with a view to increasing its
independence, integrity, and accessibility to all. In 2012, the government will put
in place a continuing education program for judges and judiciary personnel and
strengthen capacities of associations of attorneys, auctioneers, and other officers
of the court to execute court decisions.



continue the practice of quarterly audits of major government contracts and
strengthen the National Governance and Anti-Corruption Agency by adopting and
promulgating the anti-corruption law transposing the anti-corruption provisions of
the United Nations and African Union conventions in national laws. In 2012 the
government will initiate a second survey to assess the extent of corruption in the
country.



Institute reforms of public enterprises and implement an improved monitoring
mechanism. The government will adopt a strategy for withdrawal of the government
from businesses by end-December 2012. A list of enterprises to be privatized will be
drawn up by end-June 2012. The method of managing the 19 enterprises returned to
the government’s portfolio in 2011 will be redefined.

HIPC initiative
54.
The government attaches high priority to reaching the HIPC Initiative
completion point as soon as possible. It will make every effort to quickly meet the
remaining triggers, including the satisfactory implementation of a program supported by the
IMF under the ECF. Updating the poverty profile with data from the ongoing household
survey will enable the authorities to fine-tune their policies to better protect the poor, while
the publication of audit reports on government contracts exceeding GNF 100 million will
further establish the culture of transparency in public financial management.
E. External Financing
55.
To fulfill its financing requirements in 2012 and normalize relations with
external creditors, the government plans to seek debt relief from its creditors. Following
approval of the program by the IMF Executive Board, the government will approach Paris
Club creditors to request debt rescheduling on exceptional terms similar to those accorded in
2008. With respect to bilateral non-Paris Club creditors with which arrears have been
accumulated, the government plans to initiate discussions to reach agreement on treatment
of the debt on terms comparable to those of the Paris Club and in the context of the HIPC

70
Initiative. Reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point will also permit coverage of a
portion of the program financing requirements. Moreover, the government will request
resumption of the interim assistance granted by the IMF under the HIPC Initiative, which
will represent the fourth tranche of that assistance, amounting to SDR 1.2852 million. In the
meantime, disbursements linked to the ECF-supported program will cover the remaining
balance of payments requirements.
56.
To ensure prudent debt management, the authorities will mobilize only grants
and concessional debts. The project for the development of iron ore deposits in the
Simandou 3 and 4 blocks provides for a government interest of up to 51 percent government
in the infrastructure company associated with the project, which could require a contribution
of over US$4 billion in financing from Guinea; the government will provide IMF staff with
details on the financing of its contribution before end-June 2012. To ensure debt
sustainability both before and after reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point, the
authorities agree to submit any proposed new debt agreements or debt guarantees to the
National Debt Directorate to ensure that the terms are concessional. The government further
agrees to consult with IMF staff on the terms and concessionality of any new proposed debt
agreements before contracting or guaranteeing any external debt. Regarding the service of
debt to the IMF, the BCRG will keep a sufficient balance in its SDR account with the IMF
to cover all payments falling due during the next quarter.
IV. STATISTICS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS
57.
The government intends to pursue its efforts to improve the statistical system
with a view to ensuring the regular production and provision of high-quality statistical
data. This will include the implementation of the National Statistics Development Strategy
(SNDS). In particular, the authorities will pursue institutional reforms by finalizing the
establishment of the National Statistics Institute through the appointment of its board of
directors during first quarter of 2012. They will also work toward implementing the capacity
building programs negotiated previously with the development partners.
58.
The government has identified a wide range of technical assistance needs in the
area of macroeconomic management. Institutional capacities, already weak, declined
further during 2009–10, when normal procedures and regulations were largely bypassed. To
make a fresh start, the authorities requested technical assistance from the partners, including
the IMF and its regional center West AFRITAC. The latter two organizations have conducted
several missions; since February 2011, they have provided recommendations in the areas of
fiscal policy, tax and customs of ministration, public financial management, the foreign
exchange market, monitor policy, bank supervision, and the national accounts.
59.
The government is determined to improve the coordination of technical
assistance in order to maximize benefits. The recent appointment of a technical assistant
from the AFD to take charge of such coordination will allow for improved monitoring of
donor actions to prevent duplication and develop synergies. The authorities have already

71
asked the development partners to better coordinate their actions. In this context, the
European Union has joined with (i) the IMF, in regard to the modernization of the legal
framework and the improvement of accounting management; (ii) the World Bank, in regard
to the establishment of the public procurement regulatory agency; and (iii) France, for
strengthening of the supervisory body. Other projects in which the principal partners are
involved, in particular the AfDB, the World Bank, the United Nations Development
Program(UNDP), the European Union, and the United States agency for international
development (USAID) address crosscutting areas (training, automation of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, financial deconcentration and decentralization, capacity building with
respect to economic and financial coordination, government reform and modernization);
mobilization of domestic revenue (tax and customs) and external financing (debt and official
development assistance, crucial in this period of heightened emphasis on achieving the
triggers for the HIPC Initiative completion point and re-engaging with the international
community); macroeconomic framing and cash flow and budget management; and the
Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Mines and Geology; the Ministry of Labor and Civil
Service; and the High Commission on Government Reform and Administrative
Modernization.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING, ASSESSMENT, AND SUPERVISION
60.
To monitor the implementation of measures and the attainment of its program
objectives, the Guinean government has instituted a monitoring mechanism consisting
of a Reform Coordination Committee (CCR) and a Technical Support Committee for the
CCR, as well as a Program Monitoring Technical Unit (CTSP) created as a unit of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. With this mechanism, the government, the BCRG,
international financial institutions, and Guinea’s development partners will receive periodic
reports on the progress made, the outlook, and the measures envisaged.
61.
The program will be reviewed semiannually by the IMF Executive Board on the
basis of quantitative monitoring indicators and structural benchmarks (Tables 4 and 5
attached). These indicators are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU), attached as (Annex 1). The first year of the program covers the period
January to December 2012, and the first (second) program review based on the performance
criteria as at end-June 2012 (end-December2012) is expected to be completed no later than
October, 2012 (April 30, 2013).
62.
During the program period, the government agrees not to introduce or increase
restrictions on the balance of payments or transfers pertaining to current international
transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, enter into bilateral payment agreements
inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement, or impose or increase any
import restrictions for BOP balancing purposes. Furthermore, the authorities agree to adopt
— in consultation with IMF staff—any additional financial or structural measures that prove
necessary to the program’s success.

Although the current estimates show some overruns compared to program targets, if the additional investments financed with the exceptional revenue and already discussed with staff are excluded,
the performance is stronger than that envisaged under the program. On the basic fiscal balance, if those investments are excluded, the end-Dec 2011 figure would be a deficit of GNF 356 billion,
smaller than the deficit envisaged under the program. For the net domestic assets of the central bank, the domestic bank financing of the government, and the reserve money, the valuation of the
exceptional revenue uses the program exchange rate.

Assessment

Poverty Reduction
A full PRSP has been prepared through a
participatory process and satisfactorily
implemented for one year as evidenced by
the IMF/World Bank Joint Staff Assessment
of the country’s annual progress report.

Partially Implemented. The first PRSP was adopted in 2002. Its
implementation suffered as a result of macroeconomic instability and
poor governance. The authorities issued the second PRSP in 2007; its
implementation was interrupted by the military coup of December 2008.
The new government formed after the presidential election at end-2010
extended the PRSP-II to the 2011–12 period. A midterm report was
prepared in June 2011. The government will prepare a report of full
implementation for 2011 for review by the World Bank and the IMF.

Improvement of the poverty database and
monitoring resources by conducting a living
standards measurement survey making it
possible to define poverty thresholds and
formulate indicators based thereon;
establishment of a poverty monitoring system
with the participation of key stakeholders.

Partially Implemented. A comprehensive poverty survey was
conducted in 2002–03 (and finalized in 2004–05) followed by Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey (CWIQ), Demographic and
Health Survey 2007/2008. Based on the systems of household surveys,
conducted between 2002 and 2008, the poverty database was
improved and updated. Five income thresholds were established,
differentiated for rural and urban areas, together with poverty
thresholds ranging from 37 cents to 50 cents a day. Based on the
household survey, 54 poverty indicators were defined. The National
Statistical Office has completed the first phase activities of the CWIQ II
survey (in December 2011 ) and is working with the Bank/UNDP and
AfDB on the second phase activities (including production of primary
social statistics) to be completed no later than March 2012.

Maintain macroeconomic stability as
evidenced by satisfactory implementation of
the ECF-supported program.

Not Implemented. The PRGF-supported program approved on
December 21, 2007 went off-track after the first review. The
government built a strong track record under the IMF Staff-Monitored
Program. Negotiations on an ECF-supported program are under way.

Design and take steps to create an
appropriate regulatory framework for
microcredit institutions.

Implemented. A new law establishing an appropriate framework for
microcredit institutions was adopted in November 2005.

Governance and combating corruption
Make publicly available a one-year progress
report describing the resources and activities
of the National Anti-Corruption Committee
(CNLC).

Implemented. The 2002 and 2010 activity reports have been
published. The 2011 report is scheduled for publication in March 2012.

76
Table 3. Guinea: Status of HIPC Initiative Completion Point Triggers (concluded)
Audit all government contracts for amounts
greater than GNF 100 million and publish the
results of these audits on a quarterly basis.

Partially implemented. The authorities did not begin this action
promptly after the decision point. To make up for the delay, the
government commissioned a comprehensive audit of government
contracts for 2002–04; the final audit report was presented in 2007.
To support a more operational and less costly system, a system of
quarterly audits based on a sample of large government contracts
was put in place in 2008. The report covering 2007 was published in
October 2008. Reports on contracts signed in 2008 and the first six
months of 2009 have been completed. Most of the audits for the
second half of 2009 and for 2010 have been completed; the
authorities are currently working with the World Bank to complete the
remaining reports by February 2012. For 2011, the process has
already begun, and the audit of contracts signed in the first six months
is expected to be completed by end-March 2012.

Education
Increase the gross enrollment rate of primary
school students from 56 percent in 1999 to
62 percent in 2001 and 71 percent in 2002;
the gross enrollment rate of girls should be
40 percent in 1999, 51 percent in 2001, and
61 percent in 2002.

Implemented. Gross enrollment gradually increased after 2002,
reaching 79 percent in 2006 and 2007. Gross enrollment for girls
increased even more, reaching 71 percent in 2006 and 2007 and
significantly reducing the enrollment gap between boys and girls.
Provisional data from the 2009-2010 Education Statistics Yearbook
show that this target was also achieved during that period. The 2011
Education Statistics Yearbook is being prepared.

Increase the number of new primary school
teachers hired by at least 1,500 a year for
each year until the HIPC completion point,
from an estimated base of about 15,000
primary school teachers in 2000.

Implemented. On average 1,673 primary school teachers have been
trained and recruited each year from 2001 through 2007. In 2009–10,
given the significant delay in reaching the completion point, hiring
1,500 new teachers every year no longer corresponds to the country’s
education needs and priorities. However, the newly elected
Government has been working closely with Development Partners
including the World Bank under the Education for All–Fast Track
Initiative (EFA-FTI) to increase the number of primary school
tearchers (and about 1500 teachers were hired between 2009–11 on
average), thus meeting the trigger.

Health
Increase rates of immunization (against
diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough) for
children under age one from 45 percent in
2000 to 50 percent in 2001 and 55 percent in
2002.

Implemented. Immunization rates were 52 percent in 2001 and
58 percent in 2002. The rates continued to increase to 85 percent in
2007. The report on health data in 2008–2011 is being prepared.

Improve the percentage of pregnant women
benefiting from at least one prenatal
consultation from 70 percent in 2000 to
80 percent in 2001 and 85 percent in 2002.

Implemented. Review of the Health Information System by WB staff
(in 2012) shows that the trigger related to prenatal care consultations
has been met (at 88% in 2010).

ATTACHMENT II—GUINEA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
February 2012
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Guinean authorities and
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for the program supported under the ECF, as well
as the related reporting requirements.
2.
The quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and cut-off dates are detailed
in Table 4 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
II. KEY DEFINITIONS
3.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of the
Republic of Guinea and does not include local governments, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Guinea (BCRG), or any other public entity with autonomous legal personality,
notably administrative public entities (établissements publics administratifs).
A. Quantitative Performance Criteria
4.
The basic fiscal balance is calculated as the difference between government revenue,
excluding grants, and basic government expenditure. Definitions of bolded terms above are
consistent with the definitions in the government flow of funds table (TOFE), for which the
calculation method is described in Section IV below.
5.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BCRG are, by definition, equal to the difference
between reserve money (defined below) and net foreign assets (NFA) of the BCRG, both
calculated at the program exchange rate, as indicated below. NFA are equal to the difference
between the gross foreign assets of the BCRG, including foreign assets that are not part of
reserve assets, and foreign liabilities of the BCRG. (In other words, NDA = Reserve
Money – NFA, based on the BCRG balance sheet).
6.
Domestic bank financing of the government, or net domestic bank credit to the
government from banks, comprises: (i) central bank financing of the Treasury, i.e., the
change in the net position of the Treasury with the central bank (NTP1), including the HIPC
account and accounts for exceptional resources, such as the Special Investment Fund (SIF),
but excluding changes in the net position of “satellite” government accounts with the central
bank; and (ii) commercial bank financing of the Treasury, which includes changes in the
stock of Treasury bills held by banks, but excludes changes in the net position of “satellite”
government accounts held in commercial banks.

81
7.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BCRG are, by definition, equal to the
difference between the reserve assets of the BCRG (i.e., the external assets readily available
to and controlled by the BCRG as per the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual) and the foreign exchange liabilities of the BCRG to residents and nonresidents
(including the foreign exchange deposits of the local banks with the BCRG and off-balance
sheet liabilities). These foreign exchange liabilities, which are used to calculate the NIR, do
not include long-term liabilities, such as SDR allocations. In the context of the program, the
gold holdings of the BCRG will be valued at the gold price in effect on December 30, 2011
(US$1565 per oz.) for the first half of 2012 and at the price in effect on June 30, 2012 for the
second half of 2012. For the test dates, the U.S. dollar value of the reserve assets (other than
gold) and foreign exchange liabilities will be calculated using the program exchange rates in
effect on December 30, 2011, namely: for the first half of 2012, the exchange rates between
U.S. dollar and the Guinean franc (7089.53 GNF/US$), SDR (1.5353 US$/SDR), Euro
(1.2961 US$/EUR), and other currencies as published in International Financial Statistics;
and for the second half of 2012, the exchange rates in effect on June 30, 2012.
8.
Medium- and long-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government
or the central bank is defined as the amount of external debt (see Subsection C below)
contracted by the government or the central bank for a period of one year or more during the
period under review. Debt is considered concessional if it has a grant element equivalent to
35 percent or more of the net present value (NPV). The net present value (NPV) of the debt
is calculated using the average of the OECD commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) for
the previous 10 years for debts with a maturity of 15 years or more. For debts with a maturity
of less than 15 years, the average OECD CIRRs for the previous six months (January 1 to
June 30 or July 1 to December 31) are used to calculate the NPV. The same margins for
different repayment periods (0.75 point if the repayment period is less than 15 years, 1 point
if the repayment period between 15 and 19 years, 1.15 points if the repayment period is
between 20 and 29 years, and 1.25 points if the repayment period is 30 years or more) are
added to the two averages (over 10 years and over six month1 This definition does not apply
to financing granted by the IMF.
9.
Short-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government or the central
bank is defined as the stock as of a specific date of external debt contracted or guaranteed by
the government or the central bank with an initial contractual maturity of less than one year.
Excluded from this definition are normal import-related suppliers’ credits and foreign
currency deposits at the central bank.
10. New external arrears include all debt-service obligations (principal and interest)
arising from loans contracted or guaranteed by the government or the BCRG that are due but
not paid on the due date, and unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these loans.
1

A more detailed discussion of the concessionality concept and a calculator to estimate the grant element of a
financing package are available at the IMF website at http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/index.htm.

82
For the purposes of this performance criterion, an obligation which has not been paid within
30 days after falling due will be considered a “program” arrear. Arrears not to be considered
as arrears for the performance criteria or “non-program” arrears are defined as: (i) arrears
accumulated on the service of an external debt for which there is a request for rescheduling
or restructuring; and/or (ii) litigious amounts.
B. Indicative Target and Memorandum Item
11. Expenditure in priority sectors, an indicative target for the program, includes
spending under Title 2 (wages and salaries), Title 3 (goods and services), Title 4 (transfers
and subsidies), and Title 5 (domestically financed investment) by the Ministries of
(i) Justice,(ii) Agriculture, (iii) Fisheries and Aquaculture; (iv) Livestock; (v) Public Works
and Transport; (vi) Urban Planning, Housing and Construction; (vii) Health and Public
Hygiene; (viii) Social Affairs, Women Promotion and Children; (ix) Pre-University
Instruction and Civic Education; (x) Labor, Technical Education and Professional Training;
(xi) Higher Education and Scientific Research; (xii) Alphabetization and Promotion of
National Languages ; and (xiii) Energy and Environment. This expenditure also includes
spending under Title 6 (Financial Investment and Capital Transfers) by the Ministry of
Public Health as well as utility charges for water, electricity, and telephone (Title 3 of the
ministries listed above). However, they exclude spending under Title 4 of the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research.
12. Reserve money, a memorandum item, comprises local banks’ deposits and other
private sector deposits with the BCRG (including bank reserve requirements) denominated
both in Guinean francs and in foreign currencies, Guinean francs in circulation, and Guinean
francs in the vaults of local banks. The amounts in foreign currencies will be converted to
Guinean francs at the program exchange rate (as defined above in the paragraph on net
international reserves).
C. External Debt
13. The term “external debt” is understood as specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the
IMF on August 31, 2009.2 For purposes of the program, “debt” will be understood to mean
current, i.e., not contingent, liabilities, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires
the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. External debt can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being the following:
2

See “Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt”—IMF Executive Board Decision
No. 12274, as amended by Decision No. 14416-(09/91) (SM/09/215, Sup. 1, August 20, 2009).

83


loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ or suppliers’ credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements, official swap
arrangements, swaps, or leases);



suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and



leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified periods of time, which are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.
For the purpose of this memorandum, the debt is the present value (at the inception of
the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement, excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance
of the property.

14. Under this definition of debt, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are
debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this
definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
15. The government and the central bank agree not to contract or guarantee any
nonconcessional external debt under the conditions defined in paragraph 8 above, with the
exception of debt in the form of reschedulings. To this end, the government undertakes to
consult with IMF staff on the terms and concessionality of all proposed new loan agreements
before contracting or guaranteeing any external debt.
III. ADJUSTMENTS TO PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
16. The quantitative performance targets are calculated on the basis of projected amounts
of (1) net external assistance; (2) exceptional revenues of the mining sector (see table below);
and (3) the net change of “program” arrears. For program purposes, net external assistance is
defined as the difference between: (a) cumulative budgetary assistance (grants and loans), the
impact of debt relief granted by external creditors, , and the net change in “non-program”
arrears; and (b) cumulative payments of external debt service due after relief, for loans on
which debt relief is secured.

17. The floor for NIR, the ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank financing of the
government, and the floor for the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted if net external
assistance, the net change in “program” arrears, and/or exceptional mining revenues differ
from the projected amounts.3
18.

Adjustments for net external assistance:



If net external assistance exceeds the program forecasts, the floor for the basic fiscal
balance will be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the surplus external
assistance (allowing the entire surplus to be used for supplementary expenditures).
The floor for NIR and the ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank financing of the
government will not be adjusted.



If net external assistance is below program forecasts, the floor on NIR will be adjusted
downward by 80 percent of the shortfall, and the ceilings for NDA of the BCRG and
bank financing of the government will be adjusted upward by 80 percent of the
shortfall. The floor for the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted upward by 20 percent
of the shortfall (requiring a fiscal adjustment equivalent to 20 percent of the shortfall).

19.

Adjustment related to the net change in “program” arrears:



If the net change in “program” arrears exceeds program projections, the floor for
NIR will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the surplus net change in arrears.

3

The surplus or shortfalls will be calculated using the program exchange rates.

85
The ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank financing of the government will be
adjusted downward by an amount equal to the surplus net change in arrears. The floor
for the basic fiscal balance will not be adjusted.


If the net change in “program” arrears is below program projections, the floor on
NIR will be adjusted downward by 80 percent of the difference, and the ceilings for
NDA of the BCRG and bank financing of the government will be adjusted upward by
80 percent of the difference. The floor for the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted
upward by 20 percent of the difference (requiring a fiscal adjustment equivalent to
20 percent of the difference).

20.

Adjustments for exceptional mining revenues:



In the case of surplus exceptional mining revenues of up to US$500 million, the floor
for NIR will be adjusted upward and the ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank
financing of the government will be adjusted downward by 80 percent of the surplus,
while the floor for the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward by 20 percent of
the surplus (allowing the surplus to be used for supplementary expenditures up to the
amount of US$100 million or 2 percent of GDP).



For surplus exceptional mining revenues in excess of US$500 million, the floor for
NIR will be adjusted upward and the ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank
financing of the government will be adjusted downward by an amount equal to
100 percent of the surplus beyond US$500 million, while the floor for the basic fiscal
balance will not be adjusted (resulting in the saving of the surplus beyond
US$500 million pending a review of the budget outlook and a cost-benefit and
sustainability analysis before these excess revenues are committed).



In the case of shortfalls of exceptional mining revenues of up to US$125 million, the
floor for NIR will be adjusted downward and the ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and
bank financing of the government will be adjusted upward by the total amount of the
shortfall, while the floor for the basic fiscal balance will not be adjusted (the 2012
budget calls for a deposit of US$125 million from exceptional mining revenues, or
2 percent of GDP).



For shortfalls in exceptional mining revenues in excess of US$125 million, the floor
for NIR will be adjusted downward by the equivalent of 80 percent of the shortfall.
The ceilings on NDA of the BCRG and bank financing of the government will be
adjusted upward by the equivalent of 80 percent of the shortfall, while the floor for the
basic fiscal balance will be adjusted by the equivalent of 20 percent of the shortfall
(requiring a fiscal adjustment of up to the equivalent of 20 percent of the
US$125 million (or up to 0.5 percent of GDP), which is the amount of new
exceptional mining revenues that the 2012 budget has set aside for general budgetary
financing).

86
IV. DEFINITIONS FOR PURPOSE OF THE TOFE
21. Government revenue includes tax and nontax revenue. It does not include external
grants, the proceeds of privatizations, or exceptional mining revenues (the latter two being
recorded as financing). Tax and nontax revenue are defined in accordance with Section
IV.A.1 of the 1986 edition of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFS), using
the following categories. For tax revenue, the main categories are taxes on income, profit,
and dividends (Title 1); taxes on property (Title 2); taxes on international trade (Title 3),
including import duties, export duties, the surtax on consumption, the liquidation levy
(redevance de liquidation), and penalties related to international trade; taxes on goods and
services (Title 4), including general sales taxes, value-added taxes on domestic sales and on
imports, the single tax on vehicles (TUV), the business tax (TAF), taxes on petroleum
products, and export taxes on mining products, including the tax on mining products, taxes
on diamonds, and the tax on precious metals. Other tax revenues (Title 5) include stamp
taxes and registration fees. Tax receipts also include the taxes borne by the government for
the purchase of externally financed capital goods. Nontax revenue consists of royalties and
dividends (excluding revenue from the sale of telephone licenses), administrative duties and
fees, and fines and forfeitures (Title 6), other nontax revenue (Title 7), including incidental
revenues, and capital revenues (Title 8). Capital revenues include the proceeds from the sale
of government assets, but exclude privatization proceeds.
22. Government expenditure is measured at the stage of acceptance by the Treasury,
regardless of the execution procedure followed. In the case of both the regular procedure and
the simplified delegated spending authority procedure, expenditures are accepted by the
Treasury immediately after the payment order is issued. In the case of simplified procedures
and delegated spending authority or payments without prior issuance of a payment
authorization, the Treasury accepts the expenditure at the time that payment is ordered and in
such cases no expenditure is measured on the basis of the adjusting payment orders
(mandatements de régularisation) when the adjustment to a payment order basis is done. For
refunds of VAT credits, acceptance by the Treasury occurs when refund requests are
transmitted by the National Tax Directorate to the National Director of the Treasury.
Government expenditure includes all expenditure of the central government, including
subsidies and transfers to autonomous public entities, and loans granted or on-lent by the
government to public enterprises and other sectors of the economy, net of repayments on
such loans.
23. Basic expenditure is defined as total fiscal expenditure, less expenditure on interest
on the external debt and expenditure financed by external grants or loans or by counterpart
funds.
24. External financing comprises: (i) disbursements of external loans; (ii) principal owed
on government external debt; (iii) relief and rescheduling of government external debt, net of
HIPC assistance obtained from multilateral institutions, which is considered part of grants;
and (iv) the net change in external arrears (interest and principal, to be shown separately).

87
V. DATA REPORTING FOR PROGRAM MONITORING PURPOSES
25. The information on implementation and/or execution of the structural benchmarks
under the program (as specified in Table 5 of the SEFP) will be reported to the IMF’s
African Department within two weeks of the planned date of implementation. The status of
the implementation of other structural measures included in the program will be transmitted
within 30 days of the end of each month.
26. The authorities will report the information summarized in Table 1 below to the IMF’s
African Department by the deadlines set in this table. Barring any indication to the contrary,
the data will take the form mutually agreed upon by the authorities and the IMF. The
authorities will supply the Fund with any additional information that its staff may request
for program monitoring purposes.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked
to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

4
IX. Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
X. Safeguards Assessment
A safeguards assessment mission visited the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea
(BCRG) in January 2012 to update the findings of the 2007 assessment. Preliminary findings
indicate that the governance and safeguard frameworks continue to require strengthening.
In addition, the BCRG has limited capacity to manage reserves, the internal control
environment is weak, and the compilation of program data is performed via predominantly
manual processes. To mitigate risks, the mission proposed that external auditors continue to
verify monetary data at test dates, the BCRG publish audited annual financial statements
within statutory deadlines (immediately for 2010), and the Board approve an investment
policy and guidelines.
XI. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guinea is returning to a managed float system with no predetermined path, after an
interruption of the system during 2009–10; the de facto arrangement is classified as “other
managed arrangement”. The system includes a multiple currency practice as the value of the
official rate lags the weighted average commercial bank rate on which it is based by one day.
A technical assistance mission from the Fund (MCM) visited Conakry in 2011 and made

III. GUINEA: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, 2011–13
(As of January 2012)
1.
Lending Operations: UA 20 million was allocated for the first Pillar, through the
Budget Support Programme approved by the Bank’s Board in May 2011. Guinea also has
access to UA 2.50 million under FSF Window III that was allocated for implementing two
capacity building programmes. The available balance on ADF 12 for 2011–13 estimated
at UA 27.67 million was fully allocated to activities planned under Pillar II. In operational
terms, this translates into the implementation of three (3) regional projects. This choice
will enable the country to mobilize a supplementary UA 55.43 million in addition to the
ADF 12 allocation under the regional operations envelope, thereby increasing the total
amount accessible to Guinea over the 2011–13 period to UA 105.51 million (refer to
table 1 below).
2.
In the governance sector, the Bank has already approved budget support of
UA 20 million19 and FSF Targeted Support of UA 2.5 million, which will enable it to
improve the country’s public finance management while supporting the reforms aimed at
enhancing governance especially in the extractive sector. The targeted support will also cover
public administration capacity building, particularly in statistics and strategic planning.
3.
In the energy sub-sector, two projects are scheduled for implementation by end 2013.
The first is a contribution to financing the project of the Gambia River Basin Development
Organization (OMVG) involving the construction of a dam and a 240 MW hydro-power
plant at Kaleta. The second project is the Cote d’Ivoire-Liberia- Sierra Leone -Guinea power
interconnection project that will see the construction of 1 360 km of 225 kV transmission
lines and 12 sub-stations. Implementation of these two projects will result in: (i) an increase
in the average electricity access rate; (ii) a reduction in the kWh generating cost; (iii) a
reduction in the number of power outages; (i) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs;
and (vi) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
4.
In the transport sub-sector, the Bank intends to finance the Boké-Quebo Road which
is part of the ECOWAS Regional Transport Programme. Because of its integrative role,
construction of this highway is in line with the New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(NEPAD) Short-Term Action Plan, one of whose core objectives is to have interstate roads
without any impediment to the free movement of goods and persons. The completion of the
Boké–Quebo missing link should provide a year-round paved road link between Conakry
and Bissau.
5.
Non-Lending Operations: To deepen the analysis and understanding of the country’s
main challenges and fuel strategic reflexion, the Bank has already initiated economic and
sector works in collaboration with the UNDP, under the first FSF programme, on the
19

This programme was approved by the Bank’s Board in May 2011. The first tranche (UA 15 million) was
disbursed in September 2011 while the second (UA 5 million) is expected to be disbursed no later than
end 2011.

8
following themes: (i) private sector profile; (ii) Guinea’s Vision 2035; (iii) study on financial
sector reforms; (iv) study on the feasibility of the PPP framework; and (v) study on
Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA). Within this framework, the FSF is providing
support to: (i) build the PRSP III (2012–15) steering capacity; (ii) good governance
monitoring and promotion; and (iii) build aid mobilization and coordination capacity.
That component also includes support to the organization of the Guinea Partnership
Conference scheduled for early 2012 and aimed at mobilizing international community aid
around the following six themes: (i) rural development and food security; (ii) infrastructure;
(iii) education; (iv) social development; (v) mining, energy, water, environment and industry;
and (vi) macroeconomic framework and institutional development.
6.
Furthermore, a second FSF programme will support the National Statistics
Development Strategy (NSDS) and the conduct of the Third General Population and Housing
Census (RGPH-III). The Bank also intends to support mining sector governance through its
private sector window and legal support facility. This will entail: (i) support for Guinea’s
accession to the EITI, already initiated under PARCGEF; (ii) support to Mining Code
Reform, which includes a 15 percent State participation in all mining concessions, the
strengthening of transparency and introduction of penalties for non-compliance with the
legislation; (iii) support for the revision of mining agreements; (iv) involvement in the
operational audit of mining companies; and (v) the conduct of economic and financial studies
on mining contracts (their value, production costs and transfer prices, etc.).
7.
Trust Funds: In addition to the ADF and FSF allocations, the Bank could mobilize
supplementary Trust Fund resources to finance complementary operations in the sectors
covered by the 2012–16 CSP and that are important for the country’s development. For
example, through the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, a strategy could be
prepared in that area. Other instruments are also available: the Partial Risk Guarantee
Instrument; the Global Environment Fund; and Africa Carbon Facility and Green Fund.
8.
African Development Bank and Fund staffs collaboration: sharing of information
on the ECF-supported program, the macroeconomic situation, the budget, progress in
structural reform, planned missions, and mission reports.

V. GUINEA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Guinea’s data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Official data
provision was suspended during 2009–10 when the ability of the government agencies in charge of statistics to
collect data on government operations and private sector activities was seriously hindered. Following the return to a
normal functioning of the Guinean administration, the mechanism of data collection is being gradually restored and
the authorities are making efforts to resume data provision to allow Fund staff to restart surveillance.
National Accounts: Real sector statistics are incomplete, and published with insufficient timeliness to support
economic policymaking. Statistics on economic activities are published less frequently and less regularly; the
monthly bulletin of the Guinean economy is trying to include the limited available macroeconomic variables.
Monthly surveys of mining, industrial and agricultural production are produced with delays. Employment and
population statistics are only published annually. A program supported by international partners, expected to lead to
the production of annual input-output matrices, was interrupted in 2009. The regional technical assistance center
(West AFRITAC) has sent several missions to Conakry to work with the authorities on methodologies and
provisional estimates of national accounts for 2009–10.
Price statistics: The monthly consumer price index (CPI) is being published in a timely manner.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Economy and Finance compiles comprehensive monthly budgetary
central government data on a cash basis for revenue and on commitment and cash bases for expenditure. During
2009–10, many operations executed on behalf of the government were not recorded under the government financial
operations tables (TOFE). The new government took corrective measures to produce an accurate presentation of the
situation. Provision of monthly data to AFR has resumed, albeit still with some delays. AFR also receives the
treasury plan and is now requesting the document on a monthly basis. The budget includes the bulk of all
government operations, although it excludes a number of “satellite” accounts that are not directly incorporated into
the budget. Efforts are now underway to include those satellite accounts, including autonomous government
agencies, into the budget and the government finance statistics. The transparency of the government financial
operations is expected to improve significantly following the adoption of the Treasury Single Account law in 2011.
Monetary statistics: During 2009–10, many government accounts were created at the central bank and commercial
banks outside the control of the treasury, creating large inconsistencies between the government finance statistics
and monetary accounts statistics. The new government is closing these accounts and bringing all government
operations under the net position of the treasury (PNT). Central bank and deposit money bank accounts as well as
the monetary survey are compiled and shared with AFR on a monthly basis. Some delays have been experienced
with regard to data from the commercial banks, which still needs to be improved. Coordination between the central
bank and the ministry of finance is improving, leading to a system to reduce discrepancies between monetary and
fiscal data.
Balance of payments: The presentation of the balance of payments statement follows the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The issues on source data and compilation techniques, as well
as the conversion of the balance of payments statistics to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) methodology will be reviewed during an external sector statistics
mission that has been scheduled for March 2012. The Technical Committee on Balance of Payments Harmonization
has reportedly been reactivated. Results of the weekly foreign exchange auctions are reported regularly on line and
in the main newspapers in Guinea. Exchange rates are published daily

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
GUINEA
Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries1
Prepared by the Staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Sean Nolan and Jan Kees Martijn (IMF)
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (IDA)
February 17, 2012
Guinea has been in debt distress since 2007, as evidenced by the accumulation of external
debt service arrears. With approval of the proposed ECF arrangement and accompanying
bilateral debt relief, the risk of debt distress would shift to high risk. Under scenarios that
assume full delivery of relief on external debt under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) at the Completion Point
and of “beyond-HIPC” debt relief after the Completion Point, the debt burden would imply a
moderate risk of debt distress. The public sector debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates
that Guinea’s domestic debt is significant but is expected to decrease over the longer run and
does not alter the assessment. As the initial debt level is high, the debt position of the country
remains vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks, indicating the need for prudent fiscal policies
and debt management.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This DSA updates the analysis of the external and public debt of Guinea that
was considered by the Board in December 2007.2 The 2007 DSA found that Guinea was in
debt distress, as evidenced by the accumulation of external debt service arrears. Since then,
Guinea has continued to accumulate arrears. In the baseline scenario, it is assumed that these
arrears and debt service obligations falling due are rescheduled and debt service payments
resume. In this case, the risk of debt distress would be high, although debt dynamics would
improve over the medium and long terms.3 Staffs’ projections now include a new large
1

The DSA was prepared jointly by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in
collaboration with the authorities of Guinea. The fiscal year in Guinea is January 1 to December 30.

http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2008/cr0833.pdf

The DSAs presented in this document are based on the low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework. Under
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Guinea is rated as a weak performer, with an average
rating of 2.86 in 2008–10; the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators for countries in this category. See

mining project, which is expected to generate a significant increase in output growth and
fiscal revenues. In addition, the projections assume Guinea will reach a new Paris Club
agreement, following the approval of the proposed new ECF arrangement with the Fund.
2.
Guinea reached the decision point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in
December 2000, qualifying for US$545 million (in NPV terms) in debt relief. Since then
interim debt relief has been provided intermittently by most major creditors, reflecting
performance under the 2001 and 2007 ECF arrangements. Following the approval of the ECF
arrangement in December 2007, Guinea concluded an agreement with Paris Club creditors in
January 2008, and interim debt relief resumed. However, by 2008 the African Development
Bank (AfDB) had exhausted resources allocated for interim debt relief, and in May 2008
interim relief from IDA stopped after the statutory limit was reached. Moreover, interim
relief from Paris Club creditors was not activated during 2009–10, and was suspended by
the IMF and other creditors following the military coup in December 2008.
3.
At end-2010, Guinea’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt was
US$3,144 million, or 64 percent of 2010 GDP. The level of debt in nominal terms has been
broadly stable in recent years, reflecting a low level of new loans and debt service paid, but
with arrears accounting for a growing share (amounting to 10 percent of end-2010 debt
outstanding) Multilateral creditors accounted for 66 percent of the total, with the AfDB group
and IDA accounting for almost four-fifths of the multilaterals’ share. Paris Club creditors
accounted for 25 percent of total, while official bilateral non-Paris Club and commercial
creditors made up the rest.4
4.
External debt service arrears reached US$315 million at end-2010. Paris Club
creditors accounted for 33 percent of the arrears and multilateral financial institutions for a
further 30 percent, including 19 percent for IDA (there were no overdue obligations to the
IMF). Arrears to the Paris Club members accrued on both pre-cut-off and post-cut-off debts;
the cut-off date is January 1, 1986. HIPC interim assistance was discontinued by a majority
of creditors in 2009–10. During 2011, the government cleared its arrears with all multilateral
creditors, except the European Investment Bank, and resumed debt service payments to
them.5

Guinea has no debt service obligations falling due to commercial creditors, and arrears account for the
full amount of debt outstanding.
5
Arrears to the European Investment Bank (EIB) were partially cleared, and Guinea obtained financing
assurances from the European Commission regarding remaining arrears on European Development Fund
lending managed by the EIB, which provides for their clearance when the completion point is reached.

Public domestic debt increased considerably in 2009–10, mainly reflecting
advances by the central bank to the government. During the military regime, soaring
expenditures were financed by borrowing from the domestic banking system. The liabilities
of the government to the domestic banking system increased sharply from 13 percent of
GDP in 2008, to 19 percent in 2009, and 30 percent in 2010. Some three-quarters of
domestic debt were owed to the central bank, and the remainder in short-term treasury bills
to domestic banks.
II. BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
6.
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes a sizeable expansion in
economic activity, reflecting the impact of the start of large mining investments (Box 1).
The baseline assumes political stability, sound macroeconomic management, prudent
borrowing policies, and advancement in structural reforms over the medium term. It also
assumes a substantial rise in public investment, especially in long-neglected infrastructure
and the energy sector, as well as government support to develop agriculture and improve the
business climate. These policies would provide a foundation for an increase in private
investment, and would contribute to diversification of the economy and unlocking Guinea’s
long-run economic growth potential. Risks with regard to the macroeconomic projections
include renewed political instability, especially in the run-up to parliamentary elections
expected in 2012, developments in the global economic outlook and mineral prices, and the
possibility of projected mining production and revenues not materializing.

4

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2011–31
Real GDP growth: Reflecting the political crisis, real GDP growth stagnated during 2009–10 before
rebounding to 3.6 percent in 2011. Real output growth is projected to increase to almost 5 percent on
average during 2012–14, reflecting investor confidence and the start-up of construction-phase activities in
the mining sector. Growth is projected to jump to 18 percent on average during 2015–17, as production
from a major mining project begins and ramps up. Once mining production reaches full capacity, growth
tails off and after 2020 is expected to return to about 3 percent per year.
Mineral prices: For bauxite and gold, projections for 2012–17 are based on the Fund’s World Economic
Outlook (WEO), and for the long-run an average annual price increase is assumed of 1 percent for bauxite
and 2 percent for gold. The iron ore price projections are based on industry estimates, beginning 2015
when the SIMFER mine comes on stream (Text Figure 2). While WEO historical data for iron ore prices
show a steady upward trend to 2009 and a very sharp increase in 2011, they are projected to subsequently
decline by about 40 percent by 2015.
Inflation: As measured by the GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, inflation is projected to be around
3 percent in the long term, close to CPI inflation projections in Guinea and in neighboring countries.
Fiscal policy: Following a large deterioration in the primary balance in 2009–10, reaching 12 percent of
GDP in 2010, a sharp policy-induced correction reduced it to 1.3 percent in 2011. Thereafter the primary
deficit steadily declines and moves into surplus in 2023, leveling off at around 1.5 percent. Total revenues
(excluding grants) are projected to rise from 15.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 19.8 percent in 2014;
thereafter revenues from the mining sector rise sharply as new production comes on line, although given
the mining-related increase in GDP, revenues in terms of GDP rise only slightly. Following a sharp
contraction, from 27.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 22.4 percent in 2011, total primary expenditure rises to
around 25.2 percent by 2016, reflecting a rapid pick up in capital expenditures, and then gradually falls to
around 19 percent of GDP as capital expenditure level off and current spending as a share of GDP declines
slightly.
External current account balance (excluding official transfers): The current account deficit is expected
to expand sharply to 32.7 percent of GDP on average during 2012–15, as imports for the mega mining
project ramp up during its construction phase. Subsequently, the current account swings into a small
surplus by 2017 as mining sector investment declines and exports come on stream. In 2023 the balance
moves back into deficit, rising gradually to about 3 percent by 2031 as mining exports and imports
stabilize, while other imports continue to rise gradually.
External financing: After the suspension of virtually all official financing in 2009–10, loan and grant
disbursements resumed in 2011 and are projected to reach 5 percent of GDP in 2012, of which half takes
the form of grants. Although a scaling up is not foreseen, official financing is expected to continue at a
relatively high level in the medium term, averaging 5 percent of GDP per year, and is assumed to provide
financing for investment projects. Over time, the share of concessional loans is expected to decline, from
80 percent during 2011–15 to 60 percent during 2023–31.
Foreign direct investment: Net FDI is expected to surge temporarily to 32.8 percent of GDP per year on
average during 2012–15, owing to the rapid buildup in mining related activities. Subsequently net FDI
falls and over the long-run shifts between small net inflows and outflows. At the same time, net outflows
on the income account increase, as the repatriation and distribution of profits from the mining sector rises.

5
7.
The baseline scenario assumes interim HIPC assistance from Paris Club
creditors and the IMF. The debt burden would be reduced with attainment of a new
Paris Club agreement, covering the period 2012–14, on terms similar to those in the 2008
agreement; 6 debt relief on comparable terms is assumed for other bilateral non-Paris Club
creditors, including on arrears.

8.
An important element underpinning the baseline macroeconomic framework
and the surge in growth and mining exports is the SIMFER mining and infrastructure
project. The development of the SIMFER iron ore mine7 also includes the construction of
a railway and port to ship the iron ore. The ownership of the mining project and of the
infrastructure project involves two separate consortia, both including the government, that
are responsible for financing the total cost, estimated at about $13 billion (one-third mining
and two-thirds for infrastructure) in proportion to each shareholder’s equity stake. The mine
is projected to come on stream in 2015 and attain a maximum production capacity of
95 million tons by 2018. The government will receive a 15 percent stake in the mine at no
cost. It also has options to hold an additional 20 percent fully- contributing stake in the mine
and up to 51 percent in the infrastructure project. As of now the government has not
exercised either of the options for fully-contributing stakes. In the baseline and the first
alternative scenarios it is assumed that the government does not exercise these options,
and/or that it arranges financing through a PPP operation in which investment cost is born
by the private partner, with no contingent liabilities for the government. As a result, both
6

In 2008 Paris Club creditors agreed to provide debt relief on exceptional terms. Under the agreement precutoff-date arrears were either cancelled or rescheduled, while repayment of short-term and post-cut-off date
areas was deferred until after 2010, as was part of debt service falling due in 2008–10.

6
projects would not generate a financing need and additional borrowing, which is unlikely
to be available in the amounts needed (up to a maximum of about $4.6 billion) on
concessional terms.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO
9.
Under the baseline scenario, which assumes no HIPC completion point, Guinea
is at high risk of debt distress (Table 1a, Figure 1a). At end-2011, the debt burden
indicators related to PV of external debt are estimated to be above the policy thresholds.
More precisely, the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio is 41.3 percent (threshold: 30 percent);
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is 137 percent (threshold: 100 percent); and the PV of debt-torevenue ratio is 234 percent (threshold: 200 percent). The indicators relating to debt service
were just below the policy thresholds. In the baseline scenario, the PV of external debt-toGDP and PV of external debt-to-exports ratios are projected to remain above the threshold
for four years. Liquidity indicators embodying debt service fall, reflecting a strengthening of
revenue collection and debt relief from the assumed Paris Club agreement, although the fall
levels off as payments rise at the end of the consolidation period, and then decline rapidly to
2020 as deferred post-cut-off date arrears and debt service is repaid rapidly.
10.
Stress tests show that the external debt burden indicators are vulnerable to
adverse shocks (Figure 1a). If the main economic variables remain at their historical level,
and policy improvements and the expected growth dividend assumed under the baseline do
not materialize, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would remain above the policy threshold until
2027, and thereafter follow a declining trend. The other debt burden indicators also
deteriorate early in the projection period, exceeding their respective thresholds, before
declining below their respective policy thresholds over the longer run. The indicators are also
highly sensitive to exogenous shocks. Under most of the shocks considered in this analysis
the debt burden indicators would deteriorate significantly,8 the shocks on exports and on nondebt creating flows (such as net foreign direct investment) are particularly important. This
reflects the fact that the improvement in macroeconomic prospects depends heavily on the
projected large inflow of foreign direct investments in the mining sector and related jump in
mining exports.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
The inclusion of domestic debt in the debt sustainability analysis worsens the
debt burden indicators, although the domestic debt burden is expected to decrease over
time. Following the large increase in borrowing from the domestic banking system in 2009–
10, the authorities virtually eliminated new borrowing in 2011, and in 2012 there is no bank
financing planned for the budget. In addition, net repayments of domestic debt are expected
8

Simulations included shocks on GDP growth, export growth, inflation, non-debt creating flows, and exchange
rate depreciation.

7
to continue in the future.9 As a result, the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio (estimated at
51 percent at end-2011) is projected to decline in the medium term (Table 2a and Figure 1b).
12.
The public debt position is vulnerable to shocks, particularly to policy reversals
(Table 2b and Figure 1b). Under the fixed primary balance and the most extreme shock
scenarios, the public debt burden indicators would be at least twice as high compared to the
trajectories under the baseline scenario in the long term.
V. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY UNDER ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS WITH FURTHER
DEBT RELIEF

13.
Staff has examined two alternative scenarios: first, HIPC and MDRI relief; and
second, HIPC/MDRI debt relief and a higher level of government borrowing to finance
the SIMFER mine and infrastructure project (Figures 2a--2b). The assumptions and
macroeconomic framework under the first scenario corresponds to that envisaged in the
proposed ECF arrangement. Guinea is projected to reach the HIPC Completion Point in the
third quarter of 2012, assuming the country maintains a good macroeconomic track record
under an ECF-supported program in place in early 2012, and the structural reform program
remains on track.
14.
Guinea’s external debt position would improve significantly under HIPC and
MDRI debt relief.10 Debt stock and debt service ratios would immediately fall and remain
below their policy thresholds. The sharp drop reflects in particular the impact of HIPC and
MDRI relief from multilaterals, especially the World Bank, which holds the largest share
(61 percent at end-2010). If HIPC and MDRI debt relief is implemented from the fourth
quarter of 2012, Guinea’s outstanding external debt (in net present value terms) is estimated
to be cut from 41.3 percent of GDP to 20.3 percent at end-2012. 11
15.
The first alternative scenario assumes a similar level of public spending but a
lower financing gap, and the same composition of new borrowing as under the baseline.
This scenario assumes that the fiscal saving created by the reduction in debt service from
HIPC and MDRI debt relief would be used to lower the amount of foreign borrowing while
9

Under an agreement between the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the central bank, the government will
repay its advances over a period of 40 years, starting in 2020.

10

This scenario assumes participation by official bilateral creditors and commercial creditors. The staff
estimates for HIPC completion point and MDRI debt relief are based on authorities’ data and subject to loan
data verification and confirmation in the detailed pre-completion point debt analysis (HIPC DSA).

11

Staff also examined a scenario that included HIPC and MDRI relief and additional bilateral relief beyond
HIPC/MDRI provided by official bilateral creditors; the projected relief is based on treatments provided in other
HIPC Completion Point cases. With the additional debt relief, the net present value of external debt to GDP at
end-2012 is projected to be 13.4 percent compared with 20.3 percent under the HIPC/MDRI scenario, and the
trajectories of debt burden indicators would be somewhat lower, particularly during the first five years.

8
maintaining the same level of public spending as under the baseline scenario; the shares of
concessional and nonconcessional borrowing in external loans are assumed to be the same as
in the baseline. Consistent with this the growth projections are identical in the two scenarios,
and the lower financing need contributes to the improvement in debt dynamics.
16.
Under the second alternative scenario, it is assumed that the government incurs
new borrowing of $2.5 billion during 2013–15 to contribute to the financing of the
SIMFER mining and infrastructure project. Under this scenario, it is assumed that the
government purchases an additional amount of equity as compared with the baseline. It is
unlikely that such sizeable new borrowing would be available on concessional terms, and the
scenario assumes that 60 percent would be secured from official bilateral and 40 percent
from commercial creditors during 2013–15 ($1 billion in each of 2013 and 2014, and
$0.5 billion in 2015). The scenario does not, however, incorporate a rate of return (income)
accruing to the government from the equity stake/investment in the project, which would
mitigate the impact of the additional borrowing on the debt burden. Borrowing of this
magnitude, equivalent to 51 percent of 2010 GDP (45 percent of projected 2012 GDP),
would sharply raise debt burden indicators. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would
breach by a sizeable margin the threshold level during 2013–17, while the PV of external
debt-to-exports and to-revenues ratios would do so during 2013–15. Liquidity indicators
embodying debt service also rise substantially. The debt burden indicators would deteriorate
further if the government is assumed to participate in other possible projects involving
borrowing on similar terms. If, in addition, it is assumed that the government earns a return
on its participation, which would partly offset the burden of servicing the new borrowing, the
debt service ratios would remain at elevated levels, given the short grace periods (1–7 years)
and maturities (6–23 years) of the borrowing. The sizeable increase in debt service,
especially over the medium term, would put pressure on budgetary cash management and
crowd out other spending
VI. CONCLUSIONS
17.
Under the baseline scenario, the risk of debt distress would be high. Under the
external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP, the PV
of debt-to-exports, and the PV of debt-to-revenue are projected to stay above their indicative
thresholds over the next few years before falling below these thresholds over the projection
period. Stress tests indicate vulnerabilities in the external debt position, involving persistent
breaching of the thresholds for some indicators. However, debt service indicators are below
their indicative thresholds under the baseline. The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter
the assessment, even though it raises debt burden indicators moderately.
18.
A sustainable external debt position can be achieved with the delivery of HIPC
and MDRI debt relief backed by sound macroeconomic policies. With the assumption of
debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI, external debt would decline to a sustainable
level, although the debt burden indicators would remain vulnerable to adverse shocks and
policy reversals, leading to a breaching of the policy thresholds for a few indicators. The risk
of debt distress would shift to moderate. The stress tests highlight the importance of

9
developments in the mining sector for the sustainability of Guinea’s external debt; the
expansion of activity in this sector is key to boosting growth, exports, and revenues.
19.
Additional large-scale borrowing by the government on non-concessional terms
to finance SIMFER mining and infrastructure would result in a significant
deterioration in Guinea’s external debt position. In particular, three of the debt burden
indicators would breach the policy thresholds, even after HIPC and MDRI debt relief.
Furthermore, the impact of the stress tests in increasing the debt burden indicators would be
exacerbated, especially for the debt-service ratios, which rise close to or breach the policy
thresholds.
20.
This LIC DSA underscores the importance of sustained implementation of
sound macroeconomic policies, and prudent debt management, especially with respect
to new large nonconcessional borrowing. Without such policies, the expected growth
dividend may not be realized and projected post-HIPC completion point sustainability would
not be assured. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the modalities of the
government’s participation in the SIMFER mining project (and other potential large-scale
mining or hydroelectricity projects) should avoid significant borrowing on nonconcessional
terms.
21.
The Guinean authorities broadly concurred with the assumptions and
conclusions of the DSA.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 24, 2012
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on February 13, 2012. The new information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
Updated preliminary information indicates that all quantitative indicative targets
under the authorities’ staff-monitored program for end-December were met (Table 1).
Compared to the estimates for the end-December outturn included in the staff report, lower
fiscal revenue was more than offset by somewhat less current spending but especially by a
shortfall in capital spending. The latter reflected delays in spending on a large contract in the
electricity sector, which also contributed to higher net international reserves than estimated
for the end of the year. Inflation declined to 18.5 percent year-on-year in January 2012.
3.
The Guinean authorities have provided information confirming that they have
observed the continuous structural reform measures under the 2011 staff-monitored program
through end-December, 2011(Appendix I, Attachment I, Table 2 of the staff report). In
addition, all prior actions for the program to be supported under the Extended Credit Facility
have been completed.
4.
On February 17, 2012, Paris Club creditors provided financing assurances for the
medium-term economic program for which the Guinean authorities are requesting an
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility. Negotiations for a rescheduling of Guinea’s
outstanding external debt to Paris Club creditors are expected to be held in April 2012.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea
On February 24, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation with Guinea.1
Background
Guinea is emerging from a prolonged period of social unrest, and from military rule
during 2009–10. Following presidential elections in December 2010, the new
government adopted an economic stabilization program for 2011 that was monitored
by Fund staff. The government implemented structural reforms aimed at creating an
environment conducive to development of the country’s abundant natural resources.
It adopted a new mining code aimed at attracting foreign investment, and launched a
reform of the justice sector and of the security services. Guinea also began normalizing
financial relations with its development partners, by clearing arrears to multilateral
financial institutions, leading to a resumption of budgetary assistance. The government
extended the 2007–10 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to 2011–12, which
provides the policy framework for growth and poverty reduction.
Reflecting the improved political situation and an increase in agricultural production,
growth picked up in 2011 to 3.6 percent, after a near-stagnation during 2009–10.
The basic fiscal deficit is estimated to have been reduced from 12.6 percent of gross
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

domestic product (GDP) in 2010 to 2.5 percent in 2011. Central bank financing of the
government was stopped, and monetary policy tightened. As a result, inflation stabilized,
with a slight decline by year-end. Following a sizeable depreciation early in the year, the
exchange rate stabilized and the gap between the official and market exchange rate
narrowed substantially. Following a large inflow of exceptional mining revenue, the
external position consolidated, and gross available international reserves increased to
the equivalent of 4.5 months of imports at end-2011, from less than one month of
imports a year earlier.
The authorities’ medium-term priorities are to reduce inflation and develop Guinea’s
abundant natural resources as the main source of growth, employment, and poverty
reduction. In addition to ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability, the main areas of focus
are improving the business and investment climate, strengthening public financial
management, including the cost-effective and sustainable management of exceptional
mining revenue. These objectives are in line with the PRSP, which the government
intends to update during 2012, and form the basis of the program supported by a
new three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement approved by the IMF
Executive Board at its February 24, 2012 meeting (see Press Release 12/57
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2012/pr1257.htm. The ECF-supported program
will also help the authorities advance toward the completion point under the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. A key challenge for the authorities
is to prepare for the expected rapid growth in investment and production in the mining
sector over the coming years.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Guinean authorities for the good performance
under their staff-monitored program, in particular their decisive actions to bring the fiscal
situation under control. Growth has accelerated, inflation has been contained, and
international reserves have increased. The outlook remains favorable, underpinned by
prospective large investments in the mining sector and the improving political and
governance environment. Important challenges nevertheless remain. Policies going
forward should focus on consolidating the progress thus far, preparing the economy for
the expected increase in mining activity and revenues, and ensuring that the natural
resource wealth translates into sustained and inclusive growth and poverty reduction.
Directors saw continued efforts to reduce still high inflation as a near-term priority.
Close coordination of monetary and fiscal policies should help to improve liquidity
management, and monetary policy should remain sufficiently tight by containing bank
financing of the budget. Directors underscored the importance of a market-determined
exchange rate and eliminating the multiple currency practice. They encouraged the
central bank to further enhance its supervisory capacity and to strengthen its
governance and safeguards framework. Over the medium term, development of a
strong financial sector will contribute significantly to diversified economic growth.

3

Directors underscored that fiscal policy should continue to aim at containing the budget
deficit, to support the reduction in inflation and ensure debt sustainability, while
generating fiscal space for priority investments and social spending. Key measures
should include improved tax policy and tax administration, stronger public financial
management, and streamlined expenditures, particularly eliminating subsidies.
Directors stressed the need to ensure that windfall mining revenues are used in a
cost-effective and sustainable manner. They welcomed the establishment of a special
investment fund to strengthen oversight over large investment projects, while noting the
need for an effective institutional structure to support strong project appraisal and
implementation.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress with structural reforms. Removing
existing bottlenecks to the development of non-mining activities, through investment in
basic infrastructure, efficient and financially sustainable public utilities, and an improved
business environment, will play an important role in fostering broad-based growth and
poverty reduction.
Directors supported the steps taken by the authorities to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative as soon as possible. They noted that Guinea would remain
vulnerable even after debt relief, and urged the authorities to avoid non-concessional
borrowing and give high priority to strengthening debt management capacity. They
cautioned that direct state participation in large new mining and related infrastructure
projects would create large financing needs, and called for close consultation with the
Fund and the World Bank in this area.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year, US$198.9 Million Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement and Additional Interim HIPC Assistance for Guinea
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a new
arrangement for Guinea under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an amount equivalent to
SDR 128.52 million (about US$198.9 million). The Board’s decision will enable an
immediate disbursement equivalent to SDR 18.36 million (about US$28.41 million).
The authorities’ program is aimed at supporting higher growth, reducing poverty and
reaching quickly the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative. The Board also approved an amount equivalent to SDR 1.2852 million
(about US$ 1.99 million) in interim assistance for Guinea under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. The Executive Board also completed the 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea. A Public Information Notice will be published in due course.
Following the Board’s discussion of Guinea, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Performance under the authorities’ 2011 program, monitored by the IMF’s staff, has been
strong. GDP growth picked up to an estimated 3.6 percent; the surge in inflation during 2010
was contained; and the exchange rate has been broadly stable. The fiscal deficit was cut
sharply; government recourse to bank financing was halted, and monetary policy was
tightened. Progress was made with administrative and policy reforms, while improved
relations with the international community led to the resumption of budget support and
project assistance.
“The government’s medium-term program, which is supported by an arrangement under
the Extended Credit Facility, aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability and lay the
foundations for sustained and broad-based growth and poverty reduction. Immediate
policy priorities include reducing the high inflation rate; strengthening public financial
management, including of windfall mining revenues, and increasing public investment
and social sector spending.

2
“A key medium-term challenge is to create a policy and infrastructure environment that will
ensure that sharp growth in mining activity translates into inclusive growth and poverty
reduction. The government’s structural reform agenda aims at developing hydroelectricity
and agriculture, while improving government services, including utilities, infrastructure, and
the business climate.
“Fiscal policy aims at containing the budget deficit to support the monetary tightening
needed to reduce inflation while preserving debt sustainability. Key measures include reform
of the tax system to boost non-mining revenues and reorientation of spending to priority
areas—specifically, public investment and social sector spending. The authorities are
working to enhance efficiency and transparency of the foreign exchange market.
“Reaching the completion point as soon as possible would pave the way for permanent debt
relief under the HIPC initiative and MDRI. Guinea’s external debt position would then
become sustainable, subject to prudent public external borrowing policies,” added
Mr. Shinohara.
Recent economic developments
Guinea is emerging from a prolonged period of social unrest and from military rule.
Following presidential elections completed in December 2010, the new government adopted
an economic stabilization program for 2011, monitored by Fund staff. Performance under the
Staff Monitored Program (SMP) has been good. Real GDP growth rebounded on the back of
the improved political situation and a sharp increase in agricultural production. Strong
adjustment and prudent use of the windfall revenue resulted in a sharp decline in the 2011
fiscal basic balance. The authorities made good progress with structural reforms, notably the
adoption of a new mining code compatible with international standards in September 2011.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is driven by large investments in the mining
sector. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the mining sector, which could be as high as
40 percent of GDP or more per year during 2012–14, will raise output, imports, and the
external current account deficit, and should boost employment with the construction of
infrastructure such as railroads and ports. However, this outlook is subject to downside risks,
mainly renewed political instability. Social unrest would affect both short- and long-term
growth and complicate the implementation of the reform agenda.
Program objectives
The government’s medium-term program (January 2012–December 2014), supported by
the ECF arrangement, seeks to address Guinea’s development challenges. Building on
the progress made under the SMP in 2011, it aims at real GDP growth in the range of
4–5 percent per year during 2012–14; a drop in inflation to the single digits; and maintenance
of gross official reserves at a level at least equivalent to 2.5 months of imports (excluding

3
imports for large mining projects). International reserves, which were boosted by the 2011
windfall revenue, will be negatively affected by the subsequent use of these resources over
the program period, which will be partly offset by the support under the ECF arrangement.
Fiscal policy will be guided by the need to maintain expenditure within the constraints of the
objective for net domestic financing and limited availability of external financing while
ensuring (post-HIPC) debt sustainability. Strengthening public financial management
remains a high priority. In this regard, the authorities intend to implement a comprehensive
reform and capacity building strategy in close coordination with external partners, including
the Fund and AFRITAC West. The main objective of the central bank’s (BCRG) monetary
policy is to reduce inflation through an orderly unwinding of the economy’s remaining
excess liquidity.
On the structural front, the reform agenda, which is in line with the extended PRSP, the
authorities focus on the implementation of the new mining code. The authorities will review
and may renegotiate the existing mining concessions, while pursuing Guinea’s reintegration
into the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative process. In the electricity sector, the
authorities’ first priority is to reduce the severe shortages by adding generating capacity and
strengthening the electricity company (EDG). The government expects to adopt a
comprehensive plan for the sector, which will also focus on developing Guinea’s abundant
hydroelectric potential, including by reforming the institutional and legal framework by
upgrading the law on public-private partnerships to international best practices. Reform in
the agricultural sector will be based on a National Plan for Agricultural Investment and Food
Security (PNIASA). This plan is expected to be approved by government early in 2012 and
aims at ensuring food security by 2014 and becoming a food exporter thereafter.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Guinea
Friday, February 24, 2012

Introduction
1. On behalf of my Guinean authorities, I would like to express their deep appreciation to
management and staff for their support and constructive policy dialogue in the
implementation of the staff-monitored program, and the development of a medium-term
program of economic and financial adjustment.
2. In December 2010, following open and free Presidential elections, a new Government
was formed. In order to address the difficult situation experienced in 2009-10 while meeting
the urgent needs of the population, the authorities embarked in early 2011 on a program of
fiscal and monetary adjustment monitored by staff. In implementing their SMP, my
authorities also aimed at paving the way for a three-year program supported by an
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility and for reaching as soon as possible the
completion point under the HIPC initiative.
3. In addition to their macroeconomic stabilization efforts, my Guinean authorities have also
undertaken efforts to improve the political environment and reform the security sector. In this
regard, they have initiated a political dialogue involving all main stakeholders with a view to
hold free and fair legislative elections scheduled to take place in May 2012.
Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the SMP
4. In 2011, my Guinean authorities implemented with success an ambitious SMP, which
included unprecedented economic, financial and structural measures. All the quantitative and
structural benchmarks for end-June and end-September under this program were met. In
addition, provisional data for end-December indicate that program targets remain on track.
5. In the real sector, improved performance in the agricultural and mining areas led the real
GDP to grow at 4.0 percent against 1.9 percent a year earlier. In addition, significant public
investments were initiated with the support of development partners that led to increased
electricity and water supply and improved infrastructure.
6. On the fiscal front, the authorities implemented a rigorous fiscal policy that enabled the
basic fiscal balance to be reduced from 12.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to less than 1 percent of
GDP in 2011. This remarkable achievement was possible through the elimination of ad hoc
exemptions from customs tariff, intensification of efforts to collect back taxes and the

2
strengthening of control of contributions from autonomous revenue-collecting agencies. The
authorities also established the Treasury Single Account to all public entities. On the
spending side, a stringent cash-based expenditure management system was put in place,
Government contracts totaling 40 percent of GDP and signed in violation of the procurement
code were frozen following external audits. Moreover, the procedure of competitive selection
as the normal process for awarding government contracts and strict controls of expenditure
were enforced. Following the elimination of the central bank financing, the Treasury net
borrowing from the banking system was also reduced in line with the staff-monitored
program.
7. In their efforts to improve transparency in the mining sector and increase the government
revenue, the authorities signed in April 2011 an agreement with a multinational mining
company concerning the iron ore of Simandou south concession. Under this agreement, the
company paid US $ 700 million to the Treasury, which was deposited in an account with the
central bank. In addition, the authorities increased, in October, fuel prices by 27 percent,
which helped to reduce the losses in tax revenue, and paved the way for smooth
implementation of the pass through adjustment mechanism. Efforts to normalize the financial
relations with foreign creditors were also intensified with the clearance of arrears due notably
to development partners.
8. Progress was made in implementing prudent monetary and exchange policies. In this
respect, the central bank’s policy rate was raised from 16.75 to 22 percent in March 2011 and
the reserve requirement rate was increased in March and October to stand at 22 percent.
These measures helped reduce inflation and stabilize the exchange rate. Moreover,
regulations to improve the functioning of exchange bureaus were streamlined and the
authorities set up an interbank foreign exchange market. With Fund’s technical assistance,
the central bank strengthened its capacities in the banking supervision.
9. In the area of structural reforms, my Guinean authorities established a framework for
public-private sector dialogue, set up a private investment agency and implemented a onestop window for creating enterprises. The authorities launched the reform program to
restructure the justice and security services. With the support of the World Bank and the
Agence Française du Développement (AFD), the institutional audit of the energy sector was
completed and submitted to stakeholders in September 2011. This step led to the round-table
held in January 2012 with a view to restructure the electricity company and enhance its
capacities.
10. My authorities have also taken steps to improve the exploitation of Guinea’s mineral
resources that should contribute to increase government revenue and improve the
management of the sector. To this end, they promulgated in September 2011 a new mining
code that is in line with international standards. They also resumed Guinea’s participation in

3
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Based on Guinea’s sizeable potential
in the agricultural sector and the need to attain over the medium-term sustained food selfsufficiency while increasing agricultural exports, the authorities initiated a broad agricultural
recovery program. In this context, needed structures for agricultural training and extension
services were launched throughout the country.
Macroeconomic Policies and Structural Reforms under the ECF-Program
11. My Guinean authorities are strongly committed to continue and strengthen the ambitious
reform efforts already started. In this regard, they have put in place a comprehensive and farreaching program of economic, financial and structural reforms, which they intend to
implement under an ECF-supported program. They view this program as an appropriate
vehicle to sustain macroeconomic stability, resume with a higher growth, fight poverty and
improve the business climate. To ensure a good implementation of the program, they have
established an institutional mechanism of coordination and monitoring consisting of a
Reform Coordination Committee at the ministerial level, assisted by a Technical Support
Committee as well as a Program Monitoring Technical Unit created as a unit of the Ministry
of Economy and Finance.
12. Under the program, the authorities aim at substantially reducing inflation and building
solid foundations for a sustained and diversified economic growth. In particular, they aim at
achieving a real growth of 4.7 percent in 2012 and an average rate of 4-5 percent in 2013-14;
reducing inflation gradually to single digits by 2014; and maintaining the exchange reserves
at above 2.5 months of imports.
Fiscal Policy
13. Building on progress made in implementing the SMP, my authorities will pursue their
efforts focused on mobilizing government revenue and strengthening public expenditure
management. In this context, their fiscal policy will continue to play a key role in the strategy
to reduce inflation and ensure debt sustainability before and after reaching the completion
point.
14. On the revenue side, they intend to raise the tax ratio to 20 percent of GDP in 2014
from 17.5 percent in 2011 thus meeting the ECOWAS convergence criterion. In this regard,
measures and reforms to improve tax policy and tax administration will be pursued. In
particular, the mechanism to regularly adjust fuel prices to changes in world prices and
exchange rate will be reinstituted as of July 1, 2012. Regulatory and contractual exemptions
will be reviewed by end-June 2012 to eliminate exemptions that no longer respond to their

4
purposes. It is also envisaged to conduct an institutional and regulatory audit of all revenuegenerating services and complete the tax audits initiated in 2011.
15. As regards expenditure, the authorities’ efforts will continue to further control public
outlays, improve the quality of expenditure and channel spending towards priority social and
economic sectors. The wage bill will be stabilized around 5.3 percent of GDP. Further
measures to rationalize subsidies with reforms in electricity and agricultural sectors will be
implemented as will the reform of the security sector. The authorities, with assistance from
development partners, will develop well-designed safety nets targeting poverty reduction and
human capital development.
16. In a context of declining budgetary assistance, the financing of these actions will be met
with increased domestic resources mobilization and external debt relief. As for infrastructure
financing, the authorities have created a Special Investment Fund (SIF) with the windfall
revenue received in May 2011 from the mining sector. Based on this policy, the overall
deficit will decline to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2013 and remain at that level over the mediumterm.
Monetary and Exchange Policies
17. The priority of my authorities’ monetary policy will be to substantially reduce inflation
by regularly mopping up excess liquidity in the economy. To this end, the growth of base
money will be limited to the inflation reduction target by revitalizing the use of market
instruments and interventions on the foreign exchange market. Efforts to improve the
determination of rates by market forces will be pursued with IMF technical assistance in
order to unify the official and parallel markets.
18. The authorities will intensify their efforts to further strengthen the banking supervision
by the central bank including the modernization of, and increased transparency in, the
conduct of its operations. My authorities welcome the recommendations made by the IMF
mission to update the 2007 safeguards assessment that will be implemented in 2012.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
19. My Guinean authorities will continue implementing far reaching structural reforms to
create an environment conducive to diversified and sustained economic growth. They intend
in particular to ensure that the population will benefit from the exploitation of the country’s
natural resources and promote synergies with the rest of the economy. Further efforts will be
focused on improving the business climate, encouraging investments in the mining and
energy sectors as well as promoting the development of agriculture.

5

20. To improve the business climate, ongoing efforts to promote competition and publicprivate partnerships, enhance the credibility and authority of the judiciary system and,
strengthen the National Governance and Anti-Corruption Agency will be continued. A
strategy to withdraw the government from business will be adopted by end-December 2012
and a list of enterprises to be privatized will be established by end-June 2012.
21. The authorities’ efforts to reform the energy sector will rehabilitate the state-owned
electricity company (EDG) and develop Guinea’s hydroelectric potential. Given the urgent
need for a regular supply of electricity to increase economic growth and improve on living
conditions in Guinea, the authorities attach a high priority to reforms and new investments in
the energy sector. Following the round-table on the electricity in January 2012, the
authorities will adopt a comprehensive reform plan for the sector by end-March 2012. This
plan will include a tariff adjustment to limit the budgetary support to EDG within the budget
law. In the same vein, an institutional audit of the water sector will be conducted in 2012 and
a round-table of partners will be held thereafter.
22. As regards the mining sector, the authorities’ policy embedded in the new mining code
adopted in September 2011 is based on the concept of mines and sustainable integrated
development. They will pursue their efforts focused on finalizing the adoption of its
implementing texts, auditing and revising the existing contracts to comply with the new
mining code, and rehabilitating the mining cadastre. The authorities will also strive to fully
implement the principles of EITI and the Kimberly Process to increase transparency and
build credibility in the management of mining revenue.
Debt Sustainability and HIPC Completion Point
23. My Guinean authorities are determined to reach the completion point under the HIPC
initiative without delay in order to ensure the sustainability of public finances, normalize
Guinea’s relations with its creditors and refocus budget priorities on poverty reduction and
infrastructure spending. In this regard, they have made good progress in achieving the
remaining completion point triggers notably the implementation of the PRSP extended for
2011-12, the audit of large public procurement, and update of poverty database. In the same
vein, they are also strongly committed to a satisfactory implementation of the ECF-supported
program.
24. My authorities are cognizant of the need to achieve and maintain debt sustainability.
They intend to seek a debt rescheduling from Paris Club creditors and have initiated
discussions with other external official bilateral and commercial creditors. They are also
committed to prudent debt management by mobilizing only grants and concessional loans.

6

25. In view of the tremendous development challenges facing the country notably the fight
against poverty, the need to develop natural resources and boost economic growth, my
authorities are of the view that reaching the completion point by end-June 2012 will help
them to alleviate the unsustainable debt burden and direct available resources towards
investments in education, health and infrastructure sectors.
Conclusion
26. My Guinean authorities are confident that their strong commitment to sound policies and
structural reforms will be sustained under the implementation of the ECF-supported program.
They are determined to achieve, with the assistance of the international community and the
Fund, the program’s objectives in particular sustaining fiscal and debt stability, enhancing
resource mobilization, increasing the economy’s competitiveness and growth to fight poverty
and unemployment. Based on their good track record under the SMP and their commitment
to pursue needed reforms, I would appreciate Directors’ support to my Guinean authorities’
request for a three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility and for quick additional
interim assistance under the HIPC initiative.
