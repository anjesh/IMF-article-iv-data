IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with India
On February 12, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with India.
The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of trade gain (about
2.5 percent of GDP), positive policy actions, and reduced external vulnerabilities. Since late
2014, a collapse of global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and underpinned a
further improvement in the current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline
in inflation. A range of supply-side measures (including release of surplus grain buffer stocks)
and an appropriate monetary stance have also contributed to the decline in inflation, from an
average of about 9.5 percent during 2011–13 to 5.6 percent in December 2015. Due to its
further-reduced vulnerabilities and improved growth prospects, India has experienced large
foreign direct investment inflows in 2015. As a result, and in conjunction with the continued
much-smaller current account deficit (largely due to continued low global commodity prices),
international reserves have increased by $46.7 billion since end-March 2014, standing at
US$350.4 billion at end-December 2015 (around 8 months of import cover). Nonetheless,
persistently high household inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key
macroeconomic challenges, resulting in limited policy space to support growth through demand
management measures. Furthermore, anemic exports as well as headwinds from weaknesses in
India’s corporate financial positions and public bank balance sheets weigh on the economy.
Growth is projected at 7.3 percent for fiscal year FY2015/16, picking up to 7.5 percent in
FY2016/17 (at market prices), supported by stronger domestic demand. With the revival of
sentiment and picking up of industrial activity, an incipient upturn in private investment is
expected to help broaden the recovery. Higher public infrastructure investment and government
initiatives to tackle supply-side bottlenecks and repair corporate and public bank balance sheets

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

should also help crowd-in private investment. The Reserve Bank has achieved its inflation target
to bring inflation below 6 percent by January 2016. Going forward, near-term headline consumer
price inflation dynamics will continue to be underpinned by supply-side factors which, despite
the subpar crop outlook, should help achieve the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation goal of
around 5 percent for March 2017. Notwithstanding the 125 basis points nominal policy rate cut
in 2015, monetary conditions remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 5 percent
by March 2017. Despite the recent export slowdown, continued low global oil prices should
help contain the current account deficit at around 1.5 percent of GDP in FY2016/17. The
FY2015/16 Union budget deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP (equivalent to about 4.25 percent
of GDP in IMF terms) will likely be achieved.
While the balance of risks has improved, economic risks remain tilted to the downside. On the
external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers, the impact from
intensified global financial market volatility could be disruptive, including from unexpected
developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization or China’s growth slowdown.
Absent disruptive global financial market volatility, slower growth in China would have only
modest adverse spillovers to India, given weak trade linkages. Domestic risks include continued
weaknesses in corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality, as well as setbacks in
the reform process, which could weigh on growth, accelerate inflation and undermine sentiment.
On the upside, further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained
period of low global energy prices.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their appropriate policy actions that—along
with favorable terms of trade—have underpinned India’s improved economic performance and
reduced external vulnerabilities. They welcomed in particular recent measures aimed at
increasing public infrastructure spending, rationalizing subsidies, creating more flexible labor
and product markets, and enhancing financial inclusion. Looking forward, Directors noted that
global financial market volatility, a potential further deterioration in exports, and strains in bank
and corporate balance sheets could weigh on India’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, high fiscal
deficits and upside risks to inflation constrain the scope for countercyclical policies.
Against this backdrop, Directors underscored the need for continued vigilance, growth-friendly
fiscal consolidation, and sustained reforms to enhance the resilience of the economy and bolster
potential growth. Addressing supply constraints and further improving the business environment
remain important priorities. Progress in these areas would have a positive impact on poverty
reduction.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed the importance of preserving external stability. They noted that
India’s international reserves are assessed to be adequate. Directors agreed that, in the event of a
surge in global financial market volatility, exchange rate flexibility remains a key shock absorber,
complemented by judicious foreign exchange intervention. They encouraged the authorities to
sustain the reform momentum to further enhance investor confidence and attract foreign direct
investment, while cautiously liberalizing external commercial borrowings by the private sector.
Directors welcomed the adoption of flexible inflation targeting and progress in enhancing
monetary policy transmission. Given upside risks to inflation and still high household inflation
expectations, Directors agreed that the monetary policy stance should remain appropriately
targeted at ensuring durable reduction in inflation toward the medium-term target, supported by
clear policy communication, continued fiscal consolidation, and measures to boost food supply.
They encouraged the monetary authorities to stand ready to tighten the stance if warranted.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in the quality and efficiency of public expenditure,
as well as revenue-enhancing measures. They called on the authorities to articulate and
implement credible measures that would underpin the achievement of the medium-term fiscal
deficit targets and increase fiscal space for priority capital spending and social expenditures.
Crucial in this regard are further reforms of fertilizer and food subsidies, a well-designed goods
and services tax, and improved tax administration.
Directors saw as priorities for the authorities to accelerate reforms to remove supply-side
bottlenecks, especially in the agricultural and power sectors; and to facilitate land acquisition.
Further reforms are also essential to boost employment in the formal sector, encourage female
labor force participation, and enhance labor market flexibility more broadly.
While acknowledging that India’s financial system is generally sound, Directors noted potential
risks from weak corporate and bank balance sheets. They supported ongoing efforts to further
enhance bank supervision, and encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen prudential
regulation for bank asset quality recognition, augment capital buffers and improve corporate
governance at public sector banks, as well as enhance the bankruptcy and insolvency framework.
A further deepening of capital markets would also facilitate financial intermediation.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks: The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of
trade gain, positive policy actions, improved confidence, and reduced external vulnerabilities.
A faster-than-expected decline in inflation created space for nominal policy rate cuts.
Persistently high inflation expectations and large fiscal deficits remain key macroeconomic
challenges, resulting in limited policy space to support growth through demand
management measures. In addition, supply bottlenecks and structural challenges constrain
medium-term growth and hinder job creation. Risks are weighted to the downside, with
external risks mainly from intensified global financial market volatility and slower global
growth. On the domestic side, a further weakening of bank and corporate balance sheets
could pose risks to economic recovery and weigh on financial stability, while setbacks in the
pace of structural reforms could dampen growth and undermine sentiment. In contrast,
lower-for-longer global energy prices constitute an upside risk for India.
Key Policy Recommendations:


To achieve the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) “glide path” towards its medium-term
inflation target of 4 percent, the monetary stance should remain tight to ensure a
durable reduction in inflation and still-high household inflation expectations,
supported by measures to boost food supply and continued fiscal consolidation.



The Union budget deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP for FY2015/16 will likely be
achieved. Looking ahead, while accommodating an appropriate increase in public
capital spending, medium-term fiscal consolidation should continue, underpinned by
revenue-raising reforms (including by introducing the GST and improvements in
revenue administration) and further reductions in subsidies.



To safeguard financial stability in the presence of elevated corporate and banking
sector strains, NPAs on public banks’ balance sheets should be fully recognized;
banking sector structural reforms continued; banks’ loss-absorbing buffers increased;
monitoring of corporate vulnerabilities strengthened; and banks’ debt recovery
mechanisms further enhanced.



Several important economic and structural reforms have been initiated. Additional
steps in relaxing long-standing supply bottlenecks, especially in the mining and
power sectors, as well as further labor market reforms, are crucial to achieving faster
and more inclusive growth.

CONTEXT
1.
The Indian economy is on a recovery path, supported by a large terms of trade gain
(about 2½ percent of GDP) and reduced external vulnerabilities, though downside risks remain.
After bottoming at 5.1 percent in FY2012/13, the economy has been on a gradual cyclical recovery,
reaching 7.3 percent growth in FY2014/15 with a revival of sentiment. 1 2 Since late 2014, a halving of
global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and underpinned a further improvement in its
current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline in inflation (Boxes 1 and 2).3 As a
result of further-reduced external vulnerabilities, improved growth prospects, and continued monetary
accommodation in advanced economies, India has experienced large FDI and portfolio capital inflows, a
real appreciation of the rupee, and a robust rebound in foreign exchange reserves in FY2014/15.
Nonetheless, despite better growth prospects, India faces the risk of capital flow reversals and should
guard against the buildup of domestic vulnerabilities.

Important economic and structural reforms have been initiated, but further reforms are
needed to boost India’s growth potential. Following its election victory in May 2014, the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP)-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gradually introduced
numerous economic reforms (see Annex I and Box 3), including subsidy reforms, steps to create more
flexible labor and product markets, agricultural reforms (including the new crop insurance scheme),
enhancing financial inclusion, relaxing FDI limits in several key sectors and improving the ease of doing
business, raising Foreign Portfolio Investment limits in public debt securities, and increasing public
infrastructure spending. Flexible inflation targeting was also adopted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
in February 2015. Nonetheless, in the last two sessions of Parliament the passage of key legislation,
including the long-planned goods and services tax, was not secured given the lack of BJP control of the
upper house of Parliament.

1 In

January 2015, India’s Ministry of Statistics released the new series of national accounts. Upward revisions of the
GDP growth rate for 2012/13 and 2013/14 in part reflected methodological changes. Lack of back-casted historical
GDP data based on the new methodology constrains a comparison of current growth with past growth.
2 The output gap is currently estimated at about -0.5 percent.
3As

the global commodity price boom unwinds, India’s terms of trade has improved significantly (jumping by
4 percent in 2014/15 and a further 7 percent in 2015/16), supporting output growth and raising real incomes.

3.
Notwithstanding the cyclical pickup, medium-term growth continues to be
constrained by supply-side bottlenecks and weaknesses in the corporate and banking
sectors. Past weak economic growth and delays in implementing infrastructure projects have
placed pressure on banks’ asset quality (particularly at state-owned banks that lent heavily to
infrastructure companies). Corporate vulnerability indicators remain elevated. Long-standing
supply-side bottlenecks, especially in the energy, mining and power sectors, continue to weigh on
India’s growth potential.
4.
Past Fund advice and the authorities’ macroeconomic policies have been broadly
aligned, but progress on structural reforms has been partial. There has been substantial fiscal
consolidation in recent years (although it has paused in FY2015/16), and staff supports the
improvement in quality of fiscal adjustment this year with its welcome emphasis on public investment.
Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised, important kerosene and LPG subsidy
allocation and distribution reforms have been pursued, and some progress has been made on
reducing and rationalizing fertilizer subsidies, broadly in line with previous IMF advice. The stance
of monetary policy was appropriately tight in 2014/15 to reduce inflation along the RBI’s “glide path”,
consistent with Fund advice. The RBI has adopted a flexible inflation targeting regime, with headline CPI
inflation the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy. Progress on land and labor market reforms
has been limited, though some market reforms have been initiated by the center and a few states.

by recovery in domestic demand. Nonetheless, anemic exports as well as headwinds from
weaknesses in India’s corporate financial positions and public bank balance sheets will weigh on
the economy. In the presence of continued supply-side bottlenecks, and assuming no substantial
legislative initiatives, medium-term growth is projected to remain at around 7¾ percent.
6.
Despite a sharp reduction in inflation over the past year, medium-term inflationary
pressures and upside risks to inflation remain. Headline CPI inflation declined to 5.6 percent in
December 2015, down from an average of 10 percent during 2009-13, reflecting economic slack,
the RBI’s tight monetary policy stance, lower global commodity prices and government efforts to
contain food inflation (through release of surplus grain buffer stocks and low minimum support
price increases in agriculture) (see Box 5). Although the 6 percent inflation target for January 2016
is expected to be met, upside risks to inflation for FY2016/17 stem from an unfavorable monsoon
and implementation of the pay review of government employees.6 7 Given food supply constraints
and the ingrained nature of household inflation expectations (which remain near double-digits),
inflation is expected to remain close to the upper limit of the RBI’s medium-term inflation target
band (4 percent CPI inflation ± 2 percent).
7.
The current account deficit (CAD) has narrowed further, helped by sharply lower
commodity import prices. From a high of 4.8 percent of GDP in FY2012/13, the CAD has
compressed sharply to an average of 1.5 percent of GDP in the past two years. This narrowing was
helped by a policy-induced fall in the volume of gold imports and, more recently, by lower
commodity prices (see Box 6).8 Notwithstanding the recent export slowdown, continued low
global oil prices should help contain the CAD.9 The CAD is expected to widen to 2½ percent of

profitable, and have low NPAs and limited exposure to troubled sectors, low profitability and
further asset quality deterioration in public sector banks (PSBs) constrain the banking system’s
capacity to expand credit. In addition, a thin investment pipeline, reflecting still low capacity
utilization in core sectors and areas of high corporate leverage (and recourse of higher-quality
borrowers to capital markets), have reduced the demand for bank credit. Further deterioration in
asset quality could lower capital levels and thereby weigh on credit supply and the investment
recovery. In addition, although capital markets have partly substituted for bank credit, their ability
to provide adequate, stable financing for the growth recovery will hinge on investor sentiment,
and on further policy measures to deepen capital market liquidity.10
9.
While the balance of risks has clearly improved, economic risks remain tilted to the
downside. On the external side, despite the reduction in imbalances and strengthening of buffers,
the impact from intensified global financial market volatility could be disruptive, including from
unexpected developments in the course of U.S. monetary policy normalization or China’s growth
slowdown, particularly against the backdrop of recent large capital inflows.11 Absent disruptive
global financial market volatility, slower growth in China would have only modest adverse
spillovers to India, given weak trade linkages (see Box 8). Domestic risks include continued
weaknesses in corporate financial positions and public bank asset quality, as well as setbacks in
the reform process, which could weigh on growth, accelerate inflation and undermine sentiment.
On the upside, further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained
period of low global energy prices (see Annex II: Risk Assessment Matrix).
Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s view on the outlook. They agreed that
the Indian economy is in the early stage of recovery with some areas of weakness, and—in view of
the recovering investment pipeline—project real growth for the current fiscal year at about
7½ percent, rising slightly in FY2016/17. They acknowledged that some indicators, such as the
growth of indirect tax receipts, are consistent with economic growth in the 7½ percent range, but
they also noted that other high-frequency data, including corporate profitability and capacity
utilization, do not corroborate this rate. The RBI estimates the output gap at about -½ of one
percent.
11.
Nevertheless, the authorities feel they are well prepared to weather any surge in
global financial market volatility. The RBI has adequate reserves, including after adjustment for
forward contracts, and there remains scope for monetary policy action. There was agreement with
staff that exchange rate flexibility has served India well, and the authorities noted that corporate
hedging ratios have risen over the past year. Finally, a part of the oil price decline windfall was

11 During early January 2016 episode of China-induced global financial market volatility, India largely resisted the
spillover pressures. Stock markets only declined by about 3 percent, the rupee depreciated by about 1 percent
against the U.S. dollar, and FII outflows were limited (about $100 million). See also Selected Issues Chapter IV for

saved by the government in the form of higher petroleum product excise taxes, and this
represents a potential buffer against a spike in global commodity prices.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
A. Bolstering Robustness of the Financial Sector

FY2014/15

12.
Elevated corporate sector risks and weakened bank balance sheets, especially for
PSBs, pose headwinds for economic growth. With the corporate sector (non-household
lending) accounting for over 80 percent of banks’ credit portfolios, banking sector soundness and
its ability to finance investment and growth rest on the financial health of the domestic corporate
sector.12 Corporate vulnerabilities remain elevated, reflecting implementation delays and cost
overruns in infrastructure projects, and challenges to effective debt restructuring. The share of
debt held by firms with weak debt repayment capacity (interest coverage ratio below one)
remains close to a decade-long high, at about 11 percent as of end-March 2015 (see Selected
Issues Chapter I). Corporate leverage—particularly among large firms and in a few key sectors—is
one of the highest across EMs, reflecting increased reliance on bank funding to meet high capital
investment requirements in the late 2000s. Industries subject to greater stress, particularly those

13.
Public sector banks continue to face asset quality difficulties, contributing to a
slowdown in credit expansion. The share of PSBs’ stressed assets—including gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) and restructured assets—in total advances continued to increase to
14.1 percent at end-September 2015 (of which NPAs stand at 6.2 percent), from 12.9 percent a
year earlier.14 Weaker credit quality, due in part to poor governance and lack of commercial
incentives, has kept PSBs’ profitability depressed, with ROA of around 0.4 percent in the past two
fiscal years, below the 0.8 percent average in the preceding three years, and well below the 1.7
India’s stocks of household debt (10 percent of GDP) and corporate debt (50 percent of GDP) are relatively small
compared to other major emerging market economies.

12

Indian corporates’ FX funding has continued to account for up to a fifth of total funding, as of end-March 2015.
RBI data show that the hedge ratio for external commercial borrowings (ECB) and foreign currency convertible
bonds (excluding natural hedges) increased to about 39 percent in FY2014/15 and about 41 percent in the first
quarter of FY2015/16, from about 15 percent of borrowings in FY2013/14. However, a sharp increase in hedging
costs could adversely affect corporates’ hedging ability.

percent ROA of private sector banks. While provisioning for stressed assets has increased
gradually over time, there are still concerns about possible underprovisioning, with average NPA
provisioning of about 40 percent. In addition, the need for capital preservation, given eroding
asset quality, has accounted for a marked slowdown in credit growth at PSBs to 6.1 percent yearon-year as of end-June 2015 (alternatively 7.4 percent as of end-FY2014/15), down from 14.0
percent at end-FY2013/14. While PSBs’ credit growth is expected to remain muted, its impact on
growth is lessened by the relatively low credit intensity of the Indian economy and the pick-up in
nonbank financing.15

PSBs’ capital augmentation needs are expected to be manageable, but may require
further fiscal outlays. Under a stress scenario assuming a transition of 15 percent of restructured
loans to NPAs and an extra capital cushion of 2 percentage points, PSBs’ capital needs are
estimated to account for 2.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulatively over the next four years),
with a government share of 1.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (see Box 9, Annex III, and Selected
Issues Chapter I).16
15.
Full recognition of risks on PSBs’ balance sheets, adequate capitalization, and
further governance reforms are critical for strengthening the banking sector going forward.
In this regard, staff recommends the following policy measures:


Phasing out remaining forbearance. New regulations (as of April 1, 2015) curb considerably
banks’ ability to resort to forbearance by requiring banks to classify new restructured loans as
NPAs, and hence provision appropriately. However, there are still certain exemptions,

15

Non-bank funding has seen a considerable uptick, with the stock of outstanding commercial paper (CP) up by
about 80 percent in FY2014/15 (reflecting lower funding costs), and lending by non-bank financial corporations
(NBFCs) up by 20 percent over the same period.
16
This estimate includes a cumulative capital injection of 0.8 percent of FY2018/19 GDP over four years, related to
the ongoing implementation of Basel III in India, expected to be finalized by March 2019. The estimate for the
government’s share assumes no dilution of government ownership in PSBs, currently at about 61 percent.
Implementation of the Basel III capital framework is progressing and is expected to be completed by end-March
2019. All banks currently meet the minimum 8 percent Tier-1 capital requirement under Basel III and its Indian
equivalent of 9 percent. However, further Basel III capital requirements and potential risk weight changes would
necessitate additional capital infusions (see Selected Issues Chapter I).

including on postponing reclassifications of restructured loans on projects with delayed
implementation schedules (projects deemed to be viable but with temporary problems), and
on extending amortization schedules of classes of loans (provided there is no change in
present value terms).


Bank recapitalization. To support PSBs' current lending capacity, the authorities should
consider larger government capital injections in PSBs and some divestments of banks’ noncore assets. The government’s capital injections in PSBs per the Indradhanush plan (August 2015)
are quite modest in scale (0.3 percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulatively over the next four years),
and largely leave recapitalizations up to the ability of affected PSBs to raise capital in the markets.



Corporate debt restructuring. To boost corporate loan recovery, banks are now allowed (under
the Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) scheme) to convert corporate loans into equity if
debtors cannot meet debt restructuring plans. Debt-to-equity conversions are only a partial
solution, given high corporate leverage ratios and hence limits on debt recovery. The
authorities should continue to place priority on improving corporate debt restructuring
mechanisms, including the formal insolvency framework (passage of the new Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Bill and the Company Law Tribunals) and out-of-court debt restructuring
(introduction of robust mechanisms for both operational and financial restructuring). These
initiatives would build upon the LEG-provided capacity building assistance in these areas.



PSB governance reforms. The authorities should follow through on the Indradhanush plan’s
commitment to structural reforms, including on enhancing PSBs’ corporate governance, risk
management practices and accountability.

16.
The Indian government remains fully committed to enhancing financial inclusion. Its
financial inclusion agenda has broadened over the past year (see Box 10). The government’s proposed
introduction of gold monetization schemes is also, in part, meant to boost financial intermediation by
channeling domestic gold holdings to gold savings accounts (see Selected Issues Chapter III).
Continued emphasis on increasing transactional volumes on Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana
(PMJDY) accounts by expanding the range of provided financial services (including Aadhaarsupported17 direct benefit transfers), and linking these to new technologies (e.g., via use of mobile
solutions), and potentially provided by the newly-formed payments banks, would support financial
inclusion.
17.
Additional measures would help maintain financial stability and enhance the
contribution of the financial sector to growth. Staff supports the following measures:


Facilitating further deepening of the domestic corporate bond market, including, among
others, by developing robust bondholder protection mechanisms, improving liquidity in the
secondary market, and rationalizing stamp duties on bond issuances. Easing investment
restrictions on domestic institutional investor classes would be important to support the
development of a broader investor base.



Enacting a further gradual reduction of banks’ statutory liquidity requirement (SLR), as the
government’s fiscal deficit declines, to facilitate more private sector lending. The Indian
government has been gradually reducing the SLR rate (currently at 21.5 percent, down from
25 percent of deposit liabilities in mid-2008), and plans to reduce the ratio to 20.5 percent by
January 2017. 18

Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities recognized the challenges of addressing corporate balance sheet
stress. They emphasized their efforts to strike a balance between creating room on bank balance
sheets and instilling payment discipline. Several schemes have been introduced to promote debt
restructuring, including the recent Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) power sector scheme19
for electricity distribution companies (November 2015), while forbearance has been phased out,
with any debt restructured under the Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) window now requiring
provisioning at the same level as NPAs. The emphasis on labeling loan nonpayers as “willful
defaulters” has had some effect, and mergers and acquisitions activity is beginning to pick up.
Finally, they were very optimistic that the new Bankruptcy Bill (introduced in parliament in
December 2015) will close a loophole in the corporate finance architecture, and took note of staff
views that the formal bankruptcy set-up needs to be complemented by an appropriate out-ofcourt settlement framework.
19.
There was, however, a general view that the cause of anemic credit growth is mainly
inadequate demand. To some extent the commercial paper market and non-bank financial
intermediaries have taken up some of the slack, but anemic investment and the slow recovery of
private sector borrowing suggest that the investment cycle has yet to definitively turn. The
authorities also agreed with staff’s view that the fiscal cost of recapitalizing PSBs will be modest.
They noted that strong steps are being taken to improve corporate governance in PSBs, which
should help to reduce the flow of new bad assets going forward. Finally, the authorities are
looking forward to the upcoming 2016/17 FSAP for inputs on how to continue building a financial
system that is efficient and inclusive. They also urged staff to carefully review the upcoming
Financial Stability Board (FSB) Peer Review of India (due by September 2016), to avoid duplication
of effort in the FSAP.

20.
The authorities also noted that, in the presence of elevated corporate and banking
sector strains, they have taken extensive measures to safeguard financial stability. These
include: the withdrawal of forbearance by requiring banks to classify and provision restructured
Under India’s system of parallel bank liquidity requirements—including India’s own SLR and the Basel III liquidity
coverage ratio (LCR)—banks face conservative liquidity requirements. Further reductions of the SLR are, thus,
important in order to lessen the burden on domestic banks.
18

Under UDAY, state electricity distribution companies will enter a tripartite agreement with the Ministry of Power
and relevant State Governments, and 75 percent of their outstanding debt (as of September 2015) will be taken up
by states in a staggered manner over the next two years. The scheme aims to enforce financial discipline, improve
operational efficiency, and reduce power and interest costs.

loans as NPAs; monitoring closely likely NPAs via the Central Repository of Information on Large
Credits (CRILC); and encouraging corporate debt restructuring and strategic debt restructuring.
They underscored that extensions of loan amortization schedules under current regulations should
not be construed as forbearance, given that these pertain to the refinancing of projects (in
infrastructure and core industries) that do face any credit weakness. Overall, the authorities
emphasized that the recent policy measures seek to induce a structural change in project financing,
including a shift to long-term structured financing and a change in banks’ mindset to ensure that
project financing is carried out per international best practices.

inflation target of 5 percent by March 2017.20 However, in light of upside risks to inflation, the
authorities should stand ready to raise the policy rate if inflationary pressures gather pace.

India’s neutral real interest rate is estimated to be in the range of 1.25–1.75 percent, which is in line with RBI

transmission21 and structural liquidity management. Nonetheless, bringing down inflation
expectations of the general public and anchoring them at a lower level has proven challenging, as
food inflation propagates rapidly into non-food inflation, and household inflation expectations
remain near double digits.22 Breaking away from the adaptive nature of Indian inflation
expectations will likely require a prolonged period of low inflation, underpinned by a continued
anti-inflationary monetary policy stance.23
23.
Introducing durable supply side measures, continued fiscal consolidation, relieving
impediments to monetary transmission, and finalizing a robust Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC) are prerequisites for low inflation in the medium term. Staff views the medium-term 4
percent inflation target adopted by the RBI as broadly appropriate. However, in view of India’s
large weight on food in its CPI basket and structurally-high food inflation, achieving this target on
a sustained basis will require ramping up food supply commensurate with strong consumption
demand. Further structural reforms to increase food production are needed, particularly to
accommodate dietary shifts towards more nutritious and protein-based foods associated with
growing incomes.24 Staff sees scope for improving food grain buffer stock management, and for
increasing investment in storage and distribution infrastructure for perishable produce. A strong
institutional design of the RBI’s MPC, supporting credible monetary policy making, remains
paramount for the success of the new monetary framework, as does further reducing
impediments to monetary transmission (including administered interest rates on small savings
schemes) and continued fiscal consolidation.25
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities acknowledged that achieving their medium-term inflation target of
4 percent would be a challenge in the absence of structural reforms, particularly in
agriculture. They agreed with staff that the January 2016 target will be met, and were optimistic
that inflation will fall to 5 percent by early 2017. In addition the authorities viewed household
inflation expectations as on a declining trend. In their view, by reducing the policy rate by 125
basis points in 2015 they had implemented an accommodative monetary stance, but emphasized
that these rate cuts had been front loaded and further cuts would be contingent on inflation
developments and ongoing fiscal consolidation. The authorities also recognized that the recent
In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, new RBI guidelines will require banks to
move to marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination of their lending rates from April 1, 2016. Prior to this, banks
were following different methodologies in computing their lending rates, including those based on average costs
of funds.
22 See R. Anand, D. Ding and V. Tulin (2014), “Food Inflation in India: Role for Monetary Policy,” IMF WP 14/148.
23 Low and stable inflation is the best way for monetary policy to support Indian growth over the medium term.
Staff analysis concludes that CPI inflation exceeding 5½ percent is particularly detrimental to long-term economic
growth—see K. Mohaddes and M. Raissi (2014), “Does Inflation Slow Long-run Growth in India?”, IMF WP 14/222.
24 See R. Anand, N. Kumar and V. Tulin (2016), “Understanding India’s Food Inflation: The Role of Demand and
Supply Factors,” IMF WP 16/2.
21

25 On asymmetric monetary transmission, see S. Das (2015), “Monetary Policy in India: Transmission to Bank
Interest Rates,” IMF WP 15/129. Transmission would benefit from reducing the SLR over time to a level in line with
the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), continued focus on increasing competition in the banking sector, and progress
on financial inclusion which will decrease the presence of informal finance.

windfall of lower world oil prices will not be repeated. They pointed out that some portion of food
inflation during the past year stemmed from the subpar monsoon, and that it would be unlikely
for three monsoons in a row to be so poor. They pointed out that a range of supply side reforms
are being undertaken in the agricultural sector that should raise productivity and facilitate price
stability.

C. Consolidating the Fiscal Position
25.
Although near-term fiscal consolidation has paused, the spending mix has
improved. While FY2014/15 Union Budget execution outperformed the target, this was largely
achieved as a result of cuts in capital spending to make up for overly optimistic revenue
assumptions in the budget. The FY2015/16 Budget targets a fiscal deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP
(equivalent to about 4¼ percent of GDP in IMF terms), and will likely be achieved. This deficit is
0.3 percentage points of GDP higher than envisaged in the previous roadmap for fiscal
consolidation. While staff would have preferred a deficit path in line with the roadmap, the
FY2015/16 Budget contains a welcome emphasis on public investment (0.25 percent of GDP
increase over FY2014/15) and a further reduction in fuel subsidies (see Annex V: Subsidy Reform
Progress). Nonetheless, given a possible shortfall in disinvestment proceeds, expenditure may
again come under pressure. As the expenditure side gains from declining global oil prices have
been largely exhausted, the authorities should take the opportunity to continue to raise
petroleum-related revenues. Staff recommends that any increased expenditure arising from the
Seventh Pay Commission be phased over time.
26.
Medium-term fiscal targets have been delayed and appear to be challenging. The
achievement of the medium-term Union deficit target of 3 percent of GDP has been deferred to
FY2017/18, one year later than previously planned. 26 India’s overall fiscal position remains
vulnerable, given that at the general government level the deficit is expected to remain around 67 percent of GDP, which is high by global standards, and could pose challenges to durably
reducing inflation. Moreover, with the increase in net transfers to states and no offsetting
consolidation expected from the states, measures at the center need to be further articulated.
Given the absence of clear medium-term fiscal plans, staff’s projections (which are on the basis of
current policies and assume no major legislative changes) suggest that the central government
will underperform against its fiscal adjustment targets. Also, the lack of a binding medium-term
fiscal framework raises questions about the credibility of medium-term consolidation plans.
Nonetheless, India’s public debt (with a favorable maturity structure and currency composition, as
well as a captive domestic investor base) remains on a downward path and is sustainable (see
Annex III: Debt Sustainability Analysis). As in the 2015 Article IV consultation, staff recommends
that when fiscal space is rebuilt, future fiscal responsibility legislation should be underpinned by a
To institutionalize financial discipline in public finances, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act
(2003) introduced a medium-term ceiling for the central government’s fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP. India’s
public-debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced from 83 percent in 2005 to 65 percent as at end-March 2015, due in
large part to ongoing fiscal consolidation.

rule that provides room for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. In the meantime, pro-growth fiscal policy
could be practiced by further improving the quality and efficiency of public expenditure.
27.
Implementing a robust goods and services tax (GST), improving revenue
administration, and undertaking further subsidy reforms are policy priorities. Specifically,
staff recommends the following measures:
Tax reform. India’s revenue-to-GDP ratio remains considerably below its emerging market
peers. The long-awaited GST should be implemented, as it would create a single national market,
enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services and boost GDP growth. As
envisaged by the authorities in the recent Subramanian Committee recommendations, the GST
should have minimal exemptions and a moderate single rate. Progress towards a new direct tax
code, with smaller and streamlined deductions, would also help. Efforts to improve tax
administration (as envisaged in the Tax Administration Reform Commission reports) should be
stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. Staff supports the Finance Minister’s plans to
lower the corporate income tax rate while eliminating exemptions.


Subsidy reform. Overhauling India’s subsidy regime should continue via better targeting,
improving efficiency, and reducing distortions. Untargeted food subsidies should be pared back,
including by rationalizing the list of eligible beneficiaries and reforming the inefficient Food
Corporation of India (FCI)—see Box 5 and Selected Issues Chapter VI. The current approach to
non-food subsidy payments, namely direct benefit transfers, increased financial inclusion, and use
of the Aadhaar system to better identify beneficiaries, should continue to yield large fiscal savings.


Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities were confident that the central government fiscal deficit target for
this year will be met. They noted that revenue performance has been healthy, and reforms to the
timing of public infrastructure spending make bunching of expenditures at the end of the fiscal
year somewhat less likely. Lower world oil prices have given India the opportunity to recast its fuel
subsidy architecture, eliminating waste while focusing scarce resources more effectively on the
truly needy. The authorities pointed to high-quality reforms to gasoline, diesel, LPG, kerosene and
fertilizer subsidy programs that, even as recently as three or four years ago, were unimaginable.
29.
While acknowledging that meeting the deficit targets for FY2016/17 and beyond
will be challenging, the authorities did not agree that fiscal adjustment has paused this
year. They noted that the Seventh Pay Commission mandate, combined with the need to kickstart the investment cycle with public infrastructure spending, could make it difficult to achieve
the deficit target of 3½ percent of GDP for FY2016/17. The GST is not likely to be implemented
quickly, certainly not from the previously-planned April 2016, although it will support revenue
performance over time. Even though the rate structure of the GST is likely to be revenue neutral,
the authorities anticipated that a good GST design will support revenue administration
improvements by encouraging firms to join the formal economy to take advantage of input tax
credits. The authorities took note of staff’s view that continued fiscal adjustment remains
appropriate, given India’s still-high general government deficit, even after recent consolidation

efforts, though they argued that India’s revenue/GDP ratio is comparable with countries having a
similar level of per capita GDP.

D. Maintaining External Stability
30.
India’s external position is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings, and reserves are assessed to be adequate (Box 11 and Annex IV:
Assessing Reserve Adequacy). International reserves have increased by $48 billion since April 2014,
standing at US$352 billion at end-December 2015 (slightly above 150 percent of the Fund’s reserve
adequacy metric and around 8 months of import cover).27 The build-up of reserves was driven by
robust capital inflows (both FDI and FPI flows), although these have tapered off since April 2015.
Foreign exchange (FX) intervention continues to be guided by the need to limit excessive volatility.
Notwithstanding the reduction in external vulnerabilities, there is a need for vigilance given sharp
movements in global commodity prices, potential volatility of global financial market conditions, and
the deterioration in India’s export performance.
31.
In the event of a surge in global financial market volatility, India should continue to
rely on exchange rate flexibility as a key shock absorber. To minimize disruptive movements
in the currency divorced from fundamentals, continued exchange rate flexibility could be
accompanied by judicious FX intervention (which can be in spot and forward markets, and via
liquidity provision through swaps).
32.
India faces a challenge in increasing exports. The contraction in merchandise exports has
been partly due to the collapse in commodity prices, as refined petroleum products made up about
20 percent of the value of goods exports in 2014/15. The slowdown in global demand has also
affected India’s exports, as potentially has the appreciation of the rupee real effective exchange rate.28
Achieving a significant export acceleration (as envisaged in the Foreign Trade Policy blueprint) would
need to be underpinned by measures to reduce barriers to trade and lower the cost of doing business.
Continued progress on alleviating supply-side bottlenecks would help enhance the effectiveness of
exchange rate flexibility in lessening the impact of adverse external shocks, as well as in boosting
exports in the long-term.
33.
While India’s external financing requirements have declined, further enhancing the
environment for attracting stable, non-debt creating capital flows, particularly FDI, remains
important. In the past year, several steps toward this goal have been taken, including by
liberalizing caps on FDI inflows in several sectors (among them railways infrastructure,
construction, defense, and insurance). This has resulted in US$35 billion of FDI flows in calendar
27

See also Selected Issues Chapter V for measures of capital account openness.

The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projects that the volume growth of non-oil import demand in India’s major
trading partners will average about 5½ percent during the next five years, significantly below the near 10 percent
growth rate recorded during 2001–08. Using the average estimated income elasticity of 1.5, in the absence of
further measures to enhance competiveness, India’s merchandize export growth will likely remain below 10
percent per annum (see Box 7 and M. Raissi and V. Tulin (2015), “Price and Income Elasticity of Indian Exports: Role
of Supply-Side Bottlenecks,” IMF WP 15/161).

2015 to October, up from US$29 billion during the same period in 2014, more than
counterbalancing the CAD. In addition, limits for foreign portfolio investors’ (FPI) purchases of
government bonds have been increased from January 1, 2016, which have the potential to bring
in an additional US$2.5 billion of inflows in the bond market in Q1 of 2016, if fully taken up.
Nonetheless, a more conducive business environment is necessary to attract greater FDI and help
the success of the “Make in India” initiative. Debt inflows, particularly in the form of external
commercial borrowings (ECBs) by Indian corporates, have increased in recent years (though not in
2014/15), nonetheless India’s external debt remains low at 24 percent of GDP at end-September
2015. Further liberalization of ECBs should proceed cautiously and be carefully monitored by the
RBI, given the vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets.29 30
Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities agreed that external vulnerabilities are now much lower. Like staff,
they foresee a current account deficit of about 1½ percent of GDP for 2015/16, easily financed by
FDI. They also agreed that reserves are at a healthy level, and the exchange rate is both flexible
and broadly fairly valued. The recent slowdown in exports notwithstanding, the authorities were
not overly concerned about near-term competitiveness. Nonetheless, they emphasized the
importance of structural reforms, ease of doing business, and infrastructure investments to ensure
that India’s external outlook remains healthy over the medium term.

E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth and Employment
35.
Priority areas for reforms are well known: addressing long-standing supply
bottlenecks, labor and product market reforms, and improving the business climate.
Building on recent progress, key measures include:


Power reforms. Strengthening the UDAY scheme for state power distribution companies to
mitigate the risk of moral hazard, including through strong conditionality aimed at reducing
transmission losses and raising power tariffs when needed. Additional reforms should also be
informed by India’s commitments under the Paris climate change agreement (see Box 12).



Land reforms. Streamlining and expediting land acquisition and simplification of procedures, at
both the center and state levels.



Labor market reforms. Greater labor market flexibility and product market competition remain
essential to create jobs and raise growth. Recent steps by several states to increase labor market
flexibility are welcome. Such reforms are key for increasing employment in the formal sector and
employment of women, broadening the manufacturing base, and taking advantage of India’s
favorable demographics (see Selected Issues Chapter VII).

The RBI announced relaxed rules in late-September 2015, which allow Indian companies to issue local-currencydenominated bonds overseas. These so-called Masala bonds transfer currency risk to foreign investors, will
potentially open up new sources of funding for Indian firms, and broaden the set of Indian firms with access to
offshore borrowing.
30
The RBI also announced in September 2015 that a gradual increase in the foreign investor quota for domestic
government bonds will be implemented from October 2015. The increase in limits for government securities will
be announced every half year, and will be released every quarter.
29



Strengthening the business climate. Efforts to improve India’s business climate should
continue. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to improve India’s ranking on the World
Bank’s Doing Business indicators, particularly in the underperforming areas of resolving
insolvency and enforcing contracts. Staff supports the recent introduction of state-based
doing business indicators, which will encourage cross-state competition in attracting
investment.

Other reforms. As elaborated in the 2015 India Article IV Staff Report, other key reform areas include: (i)
rationalizing natural resource allocation; (ii) reorienting public expenditure towards growth-enhancing
and social spending; and (iii) agricultural sector reforms, including reform of the Food Corporation of
India (see the recommendations of the FCI Committee and Box 5). The above reforms are needed to
raise potential growth, which is critical for poverty reduction in India.31
Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities concurred with staff that structural reforms are critical to boosting
India’s growth prospects. They felt that the UDAY power sector debt restructuring scheme
would not give rise to moral hazard, and they noted that coal sector reforms had been successful,
including the transparent re-auctioning of coal blocks. They welcomed the progress that has been
made in improving India’s ranking in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business survey. Major
international partners, notably Japan, have accelerated efforts to boost the Prime Minister’s “Make
in India” campaign. Finally, the authorities noted that “cooperative federalism” is allowing some
states to introduce major reforms—such as to land, labor, and agricultural markets—which are not
yet politically feasible at the all-India level. Over time, they expected these reforms to fructify into
healthy and inclusive job creation and growth.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
The Indian economy is on a recovery path, helped by a large terms of trade gain,
positive policy actions, improved confidence, and strengthened external buffers. After
bottoming out in 2012, growth has risen steadily with a revival of sentiment. Since late 2014, a
halving of global oil prices has boosted economic activity, underpinned a further improvement in
the current account and fiscal positions, and engendered a sharp decline in inflation. The
important structural reforms that have been initiated will support growth prospects and enhance
the resilience of the Indian economy. At present, however, there remains limited space for
countercyclical macroeconomic policies to counteract the remaining economic slack and respond
to domestic and external shocks.
38.
India’s growth outlook remains favorable, but faces difficult challenges. The
economic recovery is expected to continue to be underpinned by private consumption. Higher
public infrastructure investment and government initiatives to tackle supply-side bottlenecks and
to repair corporate and financial sector strains should help crowd-in private investment.
See R. Anand and V. Tulin (2014), “Defining and Explaining Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction,” IMF WP
14/63.

Nonetheless, risks are tilted to the downside. The main risks relate to weak corporate and bank
balance sheets, and renewed global financial market volatility. Continued anemic growth of India’s
trading partners could also weaken the sustainability of the growth recovery. On the upside,
further structural reforms could lead to stronger growth, as would a sustained period of low
global energy prices.
39.
India’s financial system is generally sound, but public sector banks continue to face
asset quality difficulties. The RBI should continue to strengthen asset quality recognition and
increase banks’ provisioning as needed, and continue to monitor corporates’ FX exposures.
Augmenting capital buffers in public banks and implementing corporate governance reforms are
of key importance to ensure the durability of the Indian growth recovery. The introduction of a
Bankruptcy Bill is welcome which, together with strengthening out-of-court debt restructuring,
should pave the way to a robust insolvency resolution regime and also help deepen domestic
capital markets. Efforts should continue to build on India’s commendable progress in financial
inclusion, underpinned by new technologies and expanding the range of financial services.
40.
The monetary stance remains appropriately tight for achieving near-term inflation
objectives. Following the formal adoption of the flexible inflation targeting regime in early 2015,
progress to enhance communication and improve policy transmission continues. Favorable
inflation dynamics gave the RBI room to cut the policy rate, while maintaining positive real
interest rates broadly consistent with the “glide path” towards the medium-term inflation target.
Given upside risks to inflation, a re-emergence of inflationary pressures may require monetary
tightening. Reducing still-high household inflation expectations will require a long period of low
inflation which, unless underpinned by durable measures to boost food supply, may require a
tight monetary stance for longer.
41.
Fiscal consolidation needs to be underpinned by revenue-raising reforms. Although
fiscal consolidation has paused, enhanced capital outlays and important fuel subsidy reforms are
welcome. The medium-term fiscal targets are broadly appropriate, but to achieve them more
efficient taxation (including through introduction of the GST) and further rationalization of
subsidies (fertilizer and food) are essential. While public debt is sustainable, the general
government deficit remains high and constrains the space for much-needed public investments.
42.
International reserves are assessed to be adequate and the external position is
broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Notwithstanding the reduction in India’s
external vulnerabilities, there is a need for vigilance given potential volatility in global financial markets,
and the deterioration in India’s export performance. If global financial market volatility resurfaces,
continued exchange rate flexibility could be accompanied by judicious foreign exchange
intervention given India’s increased and adequate reserve buffers. Achieving a significant export
acceleration would need to be underpinned by measures to reduce barriers to trade and lower the
cost of doing business. Further liberalization of external commercial borrowing should proceed
cautiously, given the potential vulnerabilities of corporate balance sheets.

43.
Addressing long-standing supply bottlenecks, labor and product market reforms,
and improving the business climate are crucial to achieving faster and more inclusive
growth. Enduring improvements in power distribution and natural resource allocation and pricing
will be important in raising potential growth. Further reforms to increase labor market flexibility
and facilitate land acquisition, including at the state level, are key to increasing employment in the
formal sector and broadening India’s manufacturing base.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Oil Price Collapse: Impact on Indian Inflation1
The collapse of oil prices accounts for close to half of the 3½ percentage point decline in Indian CPI
inflation since the first half of 2014. Monetary policy should be watchful of the likely transitory nature
of this decline in inflation.
Since mid-2014, a halving of global oil prices has boosted economic activity in India and
underpinned further improvement in the current account and fiscal positions and a sharp
decline in inflation. India’s terms of trade have improved by about 9½ percent, largely reflecting
the reduction in imported oil prices (net petroleum imports were 5 percent of GDP in 2013/14). With
deregulation of diesel prices in late 2014, the fuel subsidy bill has been reduced from about ¾ of
one percent of GDP to just 0.1 percent of GDP, while the excise duties on petrol and diesel have
been increased on multiple occasions since late 2014, with fiscal revenue impact of about 0.2 percent
of GDP. Finally, with gasoline and diesel prices now free to move in line with international prices,
their retail prices have declined by around 15–20 percent from mid-2014 levels.
Staff analysis suggests that the collapse of oil prices could have contributed up to 1¾
percentage points to the decline in headline CPI inflation since mid-2014. Assuming the full
pass-through of lower petroleum-related production costs onto the domestic prices of goods and
services, the direct impact of the 20-percent decline in domestic petroleum product prices on
headline CPI inflation is estimated at about 1

point. In addition, the total impact of a reduction in
petroleum products cost on the WPI inflation is estimated to be significantly larger, at about 3½
percentage points, reflecting the WPI product basket.
The assessed disinflationary impact should be seen as an upper bound. The implicit assumption
of zero demand price elasticity implies that the decline in petroleum costs is fully passed on to
producer prices rather than into profit margins. Notwithstanding some pickup in FY2015/16 advance
tax payments by India’s largest firms, the underlying improvement in profits may reflect not only
better margins from lower input costs, but also incipient demand recovery, resulting in part from an
oil drop boost to real disposable incomes, in addition to reduced interest costs on account of recent
policy rate cuts. Overall, the oil price drop has clearly led to a significant drop in Indian inflation.
Monetary policy should take this into account, given the likely transitory nature of this decline.

Box 2. Oil Glut and the Indian Economy1
Following a positive supply-driven oil price shock (with prices falling by about half), growth is
estimated to increase by about 0.3 percentage points and inflation to fall by 80 basis points after
one year.
This Box investigates the macroeconomic consequences of the recent oil glut for the Indian
economy in terms of its effects on oil prices, real output, inflation and financial markets. To
do this, Mohaddes and Raissi (2015) integrate an oil price equation, which takes account of
developments in the world economy as well as the prevailing oil supply conditions, within a
reduced-form quarterly model of the global economy (the GVAR model for short).2 To distinguish
the oil glut shock (mainly driven by the U.S. oil revolution) from oil demand disturbances, they
employ a set of dynamic sign restrictions on the impulse responses of their GVAR-Oil model
(estimated over 1979Q2-2011Q2). More specifically, they require the oil glut to be associated with:
(i) a decline in oil prices; (ii) an increase in oil production; and (iii) an increase in the sum of real
GDPs across all major oil importers in their sample.
The results indicate that the collapse of oil prices (which is equivalent to a 2.5 percent of
GDP terms of trade gain for India) leads to higher growth and equity prices, and lower
inflation. Figure 1 shows the estimated median (blue solid) and median-target (black longdashed) impulse responses for up to 40 quarters of key macroeconomic variables of India to a
supply-driven negative oil-price shock, together with the 5th and 95th percentile bands.3 The
results suggest that following the U.S. oil revolution, with oil prices falling by 51 percent in the first
year, Indian growth increases by about 0.3 percentage point after one year—either directly
through higher urban consumption spending and lower input cost for corporate sector or
indirectly from trade with the rest of the world (as global growth increases by 0.2–0.4 percentage
point). The oil glut also creates a moderate temporary disinflation pressure in India (80 basis
points on an annualized basis over 4 quarters) and boosts equity prices over the medium-term.

Box 3. India’s Progress on Structural Reforms1
Progress on structural reforms has been made in recent years, and India has done more than several other
emerging market countries and many advanced economies. Still, expedited progress on structural reforms will
be important to achieving stronger growth.
India faces several structural impediments to growth. These include: rigidities in product and labor
markets; inefficient pricing and allocation of natural resources; an uncertain and burdensome business
environment, including difficulties in acquiring land and regulatory clearances; and inefficient agricultural
markets, including in the public system for food procurement, distribution, and storage.

legislated actions, and not announcements. Compared to
OECD countries, BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) countries were active in
financial market reform.
The indicator shows that India has achieved more of the recommended reforms from 2011 to 2014
than other BRIICS. India has taken steps to ease barriers to domestic and foreign competition in the
banking sector. Recent actions to increase banking competition in India include issuing new bank licenses,
liberalizing branch licensing, and guidelines on differentiated licenses for payment banks and small banks.
In addition, a process of reviewing the current regulatory architecture and replacing most of the existing
financial laws began in 2011, and a revised draft of a new Indian Financial Code was recently completed. In
response to the slowdown in infrastructure investment in 2011/12, a process of reforms began which
include: setting up a Cabinet Committee on Investments to streamline approvals, streamlining coal block
auctioning, financial restructuring of state electricity distribution companies, allowing FDI of up to 100
percent in railway infrastructure, and tax-free infrastructure bonds for projects in the rail, road and irrigation
sectors. The overall trend has been to increase the caps on allowed foreign investment, simplify regulations,
and to move towards market-based pricing of natural resources. For example, gasoline and diesel prices
were deregulated in 2010 and 2014 and the formula that fixes the price of natural gas is now revised every
six months. First steps on labor market flexibility have been taken by the center—making it easier to comply
with labor regulations and removing certain restrictions on overtime and women working night shifts—and
in several Indian states.

Box 4. Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment In India1
Since the mid-1990s, public investment, especially in infrastructure, has a significant positive impact on private
investment in India.
Reviving public investment, as a key engine of growth, is an important objective of Indian policy-making.
The FY2015/16 Budget, in particular, focuses on investment in infrastructure, both through higher on-budget
outlays as well as initiatives to facilitate off-balance sheet financing—including implementation of the National
Investment and Infrastructure Fund and permitting tax-free infrastructure bonds. Moreover, recognizing the
subdued private investment outlook, the rationale for the public investment thrust is not only to enhance long-term
productive capacity of the economy but also to complement the private investment revival in the short-term.
Staff research suggests that public investment has a long-lasting impact on output and has become
complementary to private investment in India. First, using a theory-based structural vector error-correction
model differentiating long-run and short-run dynamics, it is shown that a policy-induced change in public
investments has a statistically significant positive impact on output. Second, reflecting major structural changes that
the Indian economy has undergone during the 1980s and early 1990s, the interaction between private and public
investment during the past three decades has changed from “crowding out” to “crowding in”, see Figure 1. Third,
public investment initiatives that target the infrastructure sector and those that result in completion tend to have
more pronounced positive impact on both economic output and private investment.2

Box 5. India: Reorienting the Role of the Food Corporation of India (FCI)1
FCI reform is needed to reduce the rate and volatility of food inflation, incentivize growth of agricultural productivity, raise
efficiency of grain markets, and better serve economically vulnerable households.
In the past few years, the FCI’s dominant role2 in the market of cereals has come under increasing public criticism
which pinpointed market distortions, large leakages in the Public Distribution System (PDS),3 and operating
inefficiencies. The FCI was established in 1965 as India faced major shortages of grains to stabilize markets through
procurement, distribution, and maintenance of buffer stocks for food security and price stability purposes. Over time, as
production increased substantially, India has emerged as a net cereal exporter and the largest exporter of rice in the
world, while it has also built a cushion of massive buffer stocks of cereals. In addition, a particular area of policy criticism
has been FCI’s buffer stock practices which, as a result of essentially open-ended procurement and strong price
incentives, have resulted in excessive buffer stocks that have been accompanied by high food inflation. The
recommendations of the Shanta Kumar Committee Report on Reorienting the Role and Restructuring of FCI aim at
refitting the PDS and revisiting the National Food Security Act (NFSA) to better serve the economically vulnerable
households, improving operational efficiency, and implementing a pro-active buffer stock liquidation policy.
Excessive cereal stock hoarding and a lack of pro-active buffer stock liquidation resulted in sustained inflationary
pressures. Although government’s proactive response to a surge in global food prices during 2007-08 helped limit the
impact on domestic food prices, cereals buffer stocks fell significantly below the norms. In subsequent years, however,
excessive stock hoarding took place, supported in part by effectively open-ended procurement and strong growth of
minimum support prices. Rice and wheat intake into the Central Pool between 2007/08 and 2012/13 averaged around 4
and 7 percent of annual output, respectively, while growth of minimum support prices averaged about 13 percent per
year. As a result, during the last five years actual buffer stocks held with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) averaged
more than double the norms. Substantial increases in the minimum support price were generally followed by rising
inflation in key agricultural crops, fueling inflationary pressures. In addition, the inefficiencies of the buffer stock policy
have been aggravated by the significant costs of carrying excess stocks, as the FCI’s costs of acquiring, storing, and
distributing food grains have been 40 to 50 percent more than the procurement prices.
Staff research suggests that pro-active intake and liquidation of
stocks can smooth consumption and stabilize prices. A counterfactual buffer stock policy scenario entailing (i) lower cumulative buffer
stock intake during 2007–2012 in accordance with the revised buffer
stock norms, and (ii) pro-active buffer stock intake and liquidation
policy (smoothing the growth rate of cereal consumption at around 1½
percent per year), could have directly reduced the standard deviation of
relative food inflation during this period by half—from about 3¼
percentage points to about 1⅔ percentage points. Anti-inflationary
benefits would likely have been larger given the strong second-round
effects from elevated food inflation on core inflation. These results also
imply that a potential buffer stock of pulses, if feasible, may be effective
in stabilizing markets and containing inflation volatility.

Box 6. Gold: Macro-Financial Linkages1
While import demand for gold is mainly affected by inflation, international gold prices, and financial
inclusion, the Government of India’s recently announced gold schemes could lower gold imports by about
10 percent annually if implemented successfully.
Persistently-high inflation (depressing real returns) prompted a surge in gold imports in
FY2011/12, which subsequently led to a marked deterioration in India’s current account balance.
India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold (about a quarter of world demand), and depends
heavily on imported gold which meets about 90 percent of its domestic demand.2 Gold imports
reached a record high in FY2011/12 (US$56 billion, or 3 percent of GDP) and remained elevated in
FY2012/13, contributing to the widening of current account deficit to 4.8 percent of GDP in FY2012/13.
They were sharply curtailed in FY2013/14 before partially rebounding in FY2014/15 with the
liberalization of administrative restrictions on their import.3 As domestic inflation and international gold
prices have fallen, and financial inclusion has been improved, import demand for gold has remained
below the FY2011/12 highs.

The government has recently announced two schemes to reduce gold imports: a Gold
Monetization Scheme (GMS) and a Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) scheme. While the GMS intends
to bring the private holdings of gold into circulation, and reduce the reliance on gold imports (as
domestic recycling improves), the SGBs scheme aims at converting the investment demand for gold
(estimated at about 300 tons annually) into paper demand. If successful (see Selected Issues Chapter III
for pre-requisites), these schemes could lower gold imports by about 10 percent annually.

reflects a deep cultural affinity for gold and residents’ perception of gold as a “safe” asset. The perception of
safety, coupled with limited availability of alternative investment opportunities, has contributed to a concentration
of household savings in gold-related investments.

3 On

May 13, 2013, the Reserve Bank of India restricted the import of gold by banks on a consignment basis,
followed by the 20:80 scheme on July 22, 2013 under which all nominated banks/agencies were to ensure that at
least 20 percent of every lot of imported gold was exclusively made available for the purpose of exports.

Box 7. India: Export Elasticities and the Role of Supply Rigidities1
India’s exports are constrained by sluggish external demand. Alleviating supply-side bottlenecks, in the
energy sector in particular, is vital for better export performance in the long-run and also for enhancing the
effectiveness of exchange rate flexibility as a shock-absorber in the short-run.
While Indian exports are sensitive to international relative-price competitiveness and external
demand, binding supply-side constraints (notably energy shortages) dampen price responsiveness
in the short term. Export performance is affected by short-term fluctuations in international relative
prices, with an estimated average elasticity of about -0.5 (see Table 1). Furthermore, non-manufacturing
exports appear to be slightly more demand elastic in the long run, but significantly less price-elastic in
comparison to manufacturing exports. The negative sign of the average short-run income elasticity on
crude materials and chemical products likely reflects India’s net commodity importer status. Finally,
energy shortages may reduce the responsiveness of Indian exports to real depreciation while they appear
not to matter when relative price changes are unfavorable.

merchandize export growth rates will likely remain in
single digits. Consolidating the recent gains in inflation reduction, alleviating supply-side bottlenecks, and
improving the business climate will be key to ensuring competitiveness in the long term.
Continued exchange rate flexiblity, as well
as further structural reforms to ease
supply-side bottlenecks, are important for
facilitating exports. In the face of external
shocks, international relative price flexibility,
with the exchange rate as a shock absorber,
can help increase India’s exports in the short
run. In addition, continued progress on
alleviating supply-side bottlenecks, in the
energy sector in particular, would help
enhance the effectiveness of exchange rate
flexibility in lessening the impact of adverse
external shocks as well as in boosting exports
in the long-term.

Box 8. Spillovers to India from China’s Rebalancing1
A one percent permanent negative GDP shock in China could have major global macroeconomic
repercussions (with world growth falling by ¼ of one percentage point), but its impact on India is limited.
This Box investigates empirically how shocks to GDP in China are transmitted to India, conditional
on alternative configurations of cross-country linkages in the global economy. A dynamic multicountry model (Global VAR) is used to determine the size and speed of the transmission of China GDP
shocks to India. This framework consists of 26 region-specific models (including a single Euro Area
region comprising 8 of the 11 countries that adopted the euro in 1999). These individual models are
solved in a global setting where core macroeconomic variables of each economy are related to
corresponding foreign variables (constructed exclusively to capture each country's bilateral exposures to
the other countries due to trade and financial linkages). Spillovers are transmitted across economies via
trade, financial, and commodity price channels. The model has both real and financial variables: real
GDP, inflation, the real equity price, the real exchange rate, short and long-term interest rates, and the
price of oil. All data are quarterly in frequency, for the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1.
The results show that output shocks emanating in China have important global effects, but their
impact on India is limited (likely due to India’s narrow trade/financial exposures to China). A
permanent one percent decline in China’s real GDP would translate into lower overall growth globally.
Countries most heavily exposed to China’s
growth slowdown are those within the Asian
regional supply chain and commodity
exporters (following the China shock, the
price of oil falls by about 6½ percent). After
one year, the China shock would reduce
output in Malaysia and Singapore by about
0.35 percent and in Indonesia and Thailand by
about 0.3 percent. The effects on the GDP of
the Euro Area, Japan, UK, and the United
States are generally smaller. Output in India
would be affected by less than 0.1 percent
after one year, as the positive impact of the
fall in the price of oil partly offsets the decline
in demand from China (with which India has weak trade links) and that of India’s other trading partners
(which are themselves adversely affected by the GDP shock in China). Note that the approach taken here
not only accounts for direct exposures of countries to shocks but also indirect effects through secondary
or tertiary channels. Nonetheless, if the shock to China’s GDP is combined with a spike in global financial
market volatility (leading to exchange rate pressures, higher bond yields and lower equity prices), the
impact on most countries, including India, would be significantly larger.2

Box 9. Corporate and Banking Sector Vulnerabilities1
Past deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and supply-side bottlenecks, particularly in infrastructure, have
led to the build-up of high corporate vulnerabilities, with a strong negative impact on banks’ asset quality. Banks
face potential recapitalization needs. Staff estimates that these should be manageable, but may require further
fiscal outlays.
The vulnerabilities of the Indian corporate sector remain high, reflected in profitability pressures and
high leverage, particularly among large corporates. Supply side bottlenecks—particularly in infrastructure,
and the iron and steel sectors—continue to affect negatively corporate profitability. The median return on
assets (ROA) of Indian corporates has continued to decline and at 4.6 percent in FY2014/15 was the lowest over
the past decade. Corporate leverage is now one of the highest across emerging market economies, with
leverage of the largest corporates (top 1 percent) persistently higher than for other firms. The median debt-toequity ratio of the top corporates (on a gross debt basis) has been at more than 175 percent each year since
FY2008/09, relative to less than 130 percent for other firms (245 percent and 113 percent at end-FY2015,
respectively; see Selected Issues Chapter I).
Stress tests of corporate balance sheets confirm that exposure to potential shocks is high. Corporates’
debt repayment capacity, after improving in FY2013/14, showed signs of marginal deterioration in FY2014/15.
Corporate debt-at-risk—the share of debt owed by firms with an interest coverage ratio (ICR) below one—
edged up to 10.8 percent, following an improvement to 10.2 percent in FY2013/14 (Figure).2 An upward shift in
domestic interest rates continues to be a key risk for Indian corporates, with the share of debt-at-risk estimated

interest rate; a 400 bps rise in foreign interest rates; and a 25 percent decline in the portion of operating income not
affected by these shocks. The results present an upper bound on impact of shocks, as it is assumed that corporates do not
hedge against any foreign currency risks.

Box 9. Corporate and Banking Sector Vulnerabilities (Concluded)
banks (PSBs)—including gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and restructured assets—in total advances
increased to 13.5 percent at end-March 2015 from 11.9 percent a year earlier. A significant share of stressed
loans—more than 41 percent—are concentrated in the infrastructure and iron and steel sectors, which have
been impacted adversely by the domestic supply-side issues and by export headwinds. With reform measures
to address structural bottlenecks, new NPA formation may decelerate. However, the accumulation of
restructured loans, which accounted for 8.1 percent of PSBs’ total loans at end-FY2014/15, poses a challenge.
These loans, while not classified as non-performing, have modified terms to ameliorate possible borrower
debt repayment difficulties, and hence imply substandard quality. Further transition of restructured loans to
NPA status, and the need to provision new restructured loans at the NPA provisioning rate, coupled with the
phase-in of Basel III capital requirements by March 2019, are expected to necessitate additional capital
injections in the PSBs in the coming years.
Banking sector stress-test simulations suggest that potential recapitalization needs should be
manageable, but may require further fiscal outlays. The simulations evaluated the impact of further
deterioration in loan quality on banks’ capital base, assuming a 15 percent transition of restructured advances
to NPAs in each year to end-FY2018/19, and minimum 60 percent provisioning against NPAs. The analysis was
carried out on a bank-by-bank basis, with slippage, recovery and write-off rates calibrated on banks’ recent
performance, and using the Tier 1 capital ratio as a hurdle rate (including the 2.5 percent capital conservation
buffer (CCB) and additional buffers of up to 2 percent). Even in a severe scenario of continuous deterioration
of PSBs’ asset quality on a scale commensurate with their recent experience, recapitalization costs should be
manageable, at 2.9 percent of FY2018/19 GDP (cumulative over four years, including a 2 percent extra buffer;
left Table).4 Costs are more modest, at 1.8 percent of FY2019 GDP, in the case of further reforms (right Table).
Such milder stress is associated with an about 4 percentage-point decline in PSBs’ median Tier 1 ratio and a
1.7 percentage-point rise in the median NPL ratio. However, these estimates may be subject to downward
bias, given remaining forbearance on the classification of certain loans as restructured.

Box 10. Expanding Financial Inclusion in India1
The ambitious agenda of the Indian government to extend financial access to the unbanked segments of the

In an effort to enhance financial services availability, curb inequality and boost domestic growth,

transactions on the part of banks. India’s Postal network,
with 154,000 points of presence across villages, is expected to act as a key agent for banks. To incentivize
use of the accounts, there has been a gradual channeling of add-on services, including debit cards and
direct benefit transfers (DBT; e.g., subsidies, and direct cash payments for social programs), as well as
bundling of life and accident insurance, and pension products.2 Women are explicitly targeted under the
scheme, with overdraft facilities and other benefits provided on a priority basis to the wife in each family.
In April 2015, the Government of India also set up Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) to provide
refinancing for micro-finance institutions that lend to small and medium-sized unbankable businesses,
primarily of scheduled castes (CS) and scheduled tribes (ST), with schemes targeting various growth stages
and funding needs.
Propelling further financial inclusion hinges on enabling sufficient transactional volumes on PMJDY
accounts, digitalization, and more extensive financial literacy. The number of zero-balance accounts is
still high, at 32 percent of all accounts as of end-December 2015 (Figure). Average balances also remain
small (at about Rs. 1,500) and transactional volumes are limited, reflecting in part the continued prevalence
of cash payments in rural India. Further channeling of subsidies and social payments (e.g., food and
fertilizer subsidies, and health insurance), as well as more points-of-access would facilitate higher use and
transactional volumes.3 Digitalization via the linking of PMJDY accounts to mobile payments—as
envisaged in the government’s Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-mobile phone (JAM) scheme—can offer considerable
efficiency gains through better integration of financial services, ease of use and reduction in costs. Further
mobile internet penetration via the government’s “Digital India” initiative would provide a much needed
impetus, with Post offices already rolling out affordable devices.4 Importantly, concerted efforts to increase
the financial literacy of the poor population which lacks experience with financial products is crucial for
PMJDY’s success.

The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed further in FY2014/15, helped by lower commodity-import
prices, and is projected to remain contained at about 1.3 percent of GDP in FY2015/16. As of December
2015, the real effective exchange rate (REER) was about 7 percent higher than the average REER in
FY2014/15, with appreciation pressures coming in part from the terms of trade gain.
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) CA regression estimates a norm of about -3.9 percent of GDP for
India in FY2015/16. However, in staff’s judgment, global financial markets could not be counted on to
reliably finance a deficit of that size, in light of India’s current (albeit reduced) vulnerabilities. Given the
risks with global financial market volatility, staff assesses that a smaller CA of about -2½ percent of GDP
is a more appropriate norm.2 The underlying CA in FY2015/16, which is the CA adjusted for temporary
factors,3 is estimated to be -2 percent of GDP. Thus, staff assesses the CA gap to be about ½ percent of
GDP, or in a range of –½ to +1½ percent of GDP.
The EBA Index REER and Level REER regression approaches estimate an overvaluation of about 8 and 12
percent for the 2015 average REER, respectively. Staff assesses the REER gap to be in a range of -5 to
+10 percent.4
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position
India’s financial account is dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows. Nonetheless, debt flows,
particularly in the form of external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates, have increased in recent
years. Net portfolio debt flows were particularly large in FY2014/15. Given that portfolio debt flows have
been volatile and the exchange rate has been sensitive to such flows and to changes in global risk
aversion, attracting more stable sources of financing would reduce vulnerabilities.
India’s net international investment position (NIIP) deteriorated slightly to -18 percent of GDP in
FY2014/15, from -12 percent in FY2010/11. Reserves, at US$352 billion at end-December 2015, are
adequate (see Annex IV). India’s external debt, at 24 percent of GDP as at end-September 2015, remains
moderate when compared to other emerging market economies. Moreover, the maturity profile of
external debt is favorable as the share of long-term external debt in total debt is about 80 percent and
the ratio of short-term external debt to foreign exchange (FX) reserves is low. With a CAD of under 2½
percent of GDP projected for the medium term and higher GDP growth, the NIIP-to-GDP ratio is
expected to remain broadly stable.

3 This estimated underlying CA incorporates the EBA-estimated cyclical adjustment, and also takes account of the
temporary impact of higher tariffs on gold imports as well as the temporary part of the terms of trade gain (about ½
of one percent of GDP).
4 This range incorporates both the implication of the CA gap and the REER regression approaches. The staff assessed
CA gap implies an undervaluation in the range of -7.5 to 2.5 percent for the FY2015/16 average REER.

Box 12. Climate Change in India1
Given India’s high vulnerability to climate change and dominance of coal-based energy sources, the Government
has pledged to curb emission intensity and to expand renewable energy capacity.
Global climate change is expected to have a
significant impact on the Indian economy.2 A
large proportion of the population relies on climate
sensitive sectors, such as agriculture. Research
suggests that India is among the most vulnerable
countries to extreme climate events, where Bosello
et. al. (2012)3 estimate that growth could be almost
4 percentage points lower than potential for a
1.9ºC increase by 2050.
At the same time, India is the fourth-largest
emitter of CO2 in the world, after China, U.S.
and the EU. India accounted for around 7 percent
of global emissions in 2014, but in terms of per
capita emissions, India is among the lowest and its contribution to cumulative global CO is only 3 percent,
compared to 21 and 18 percent by the U.S. and the EU, respectively. A key concern is the dominance of
inefficient coal-based energy sources (more than 60 percent of electricity is generated by burning coal). With
growing population and economic development, electricity demand is expected to increase rapidly.
India launched a National Action Plan on Climate Change in 2008 and has made tangible progress. The
action plan includes adaptation and mitigation strategies at national and state levels, with a voluntary goal of
reducing the emission intensity of GDP 20-25 percent below its 2005 level by 2020. Key measures include: (i)
expanding renewable energy capacity fivefold from 2014 to 2022; (ii) introducing and increasing the clean
energy process on coal; (iii) promoting climate-resilient agriculture systems and smart cities; and (iv)
developing domestic carbon markets. India currently spends 3 percent of GDP on adaptation measures and is
assessed to be on track to achieve its voluntary pledges by the 2014 United Nations Environment Program
Emission Gap Report.

Post 2020, India has pledged to curb emissions intensity
by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from its 2005 level. India has
targeted to increase the share of non-fossil-based electric
power capacity from 30 to 40 percent of total power
generation,4 and to create an additional (cumulative) carbon
sink of 2.5-3 GtCO e through forest cover by 2030.
Preliminary government estimates suggest that achieving
these targets will require at least $3.5 trillion (at 2014-15
prices) in domestic and foreign investment, and
implementation of an array of technologies with support
from developed nations.

Figure 7. India: Corporate and Banking Sectors
The corporate-banking nexus continues to play a critical role in domestic financial stability.
Financial stress in the corporate sector remains high, leading to a deterioration in bank asset quality.
...leading to a further increase in banks’ stressed loans
(NPAs and restructured loans), in particular for public
sector banks (PSBs).

SLR: Statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of banks reduced by 50 basis points (bps) to
21.5 percent from 22.0 percent.
Monetary policy framework agreement: The Ministry of Finance and RBI
signed an agreement on a new monetary policy framework that formalized
flexible inflation targeting as the prime objective of the central bank with
headline CPI inflation as the nominal anchor. The RBI is now mandated to bring
inflation down to 6 percent by January 2016 and target an inflation of 4 (+/-2)
percent in all subsequent financial years.
Repo rate: RBI reduced the policy repo rate by 125 bps from 8.00 percent to
6.75 percent in four phases: (i) 25 bps each on January 15, March 4, June 2, 2015;
and 50 bps on September 29—the two cuts in January and March being out-ofpolicy cycle.
Bank lending rates: The RBI issued fresh guidelines on computing interest rates
on advances based on the marginal cost of funds to be operational effective
April 1, 2016. The guidelines would help improve monetary transmission and
ensure transparency in the methodology followed by banks for determining
interest rates on advances.
Financial Sector
Strategic debt restructuring scheme: RBI allowed banks to undertake ‘strategic
debt restructuring (SDR)’ by converting loan dues to equity shares to provide
banks with enhanced capabilities to initiate change of ownership in accounts
which fail to achieve the projected viability milestones.
Interest Rate Futures: RBI introduced cash settled Interest Rate Futures (IRF) on
5-7 year and 13-15 year Government Securities.
Infrastructure funding: Government approved the framework for setting up of
the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) with an initial corpus of Rs
200 billion with 49 percent government equity contribution to solicit equity
participation from strategic domestic and foreign partners. Funds would extend
equity support to infrastructure nonbank financial corporations/financial
institutions that could leverage the additional equity to scale up debt financing
of projects.
Governance of public sector banks: Government launched a seven pronged
plan—Indradhanush—to revitalize the operations of public sector banks. The
seven elements include more flexibility and professionalism in appointments;
formation of boards of bureau; enhancing bank capitalization; de-stressing
stressed assets, strengthening risk control measures and NPA disclosures;
providing more autonomy in decision making; activating a robust framework of
accountability; and initiating governance reforms.
RBI grants approval to 11 applicants for Payments Bank.

Masala Bond: RBI issued a new framework allowing corporates to issue rupee
denominated pain vanilla (masala) bonds in overseas market with a minimum
maturity of 5-years with end-use restrictions. Accordingly, corporates would be
allowed to borrow up to $750 million under automatic route and anything above
under the approval route, while overseas investors would be eligible to hedge
their exposure in rupee through permitted derivative products of Indian banks.
FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investment) limit: RBI raised the limits for FPI investment
in Government securities, in rupee terms, to 5 percent of the outstanding stock by
March 2018, which is expected to open up room for an additional ₹1,200 billion.
FPIs have also been permitted to invest in the State Development Loans (SDLs),
up to a limit of 2 percent of the outstanding stock by March 2018, estimated to
an additional ₹500 billion by March 2018.
External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) Policy: RBI issued a revised framework
for ECB policy with a view to making it more liberal, with fewer restrictions on end
uses and higher all-in-cost ceiling for long term borrowings and borrowings
denominated in rupee.
Bankruptcy law: Government introduced the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,
2015 in the Lok Sabha (lower house) that proposes to consolidate the insolvency
resolution process into a single law by repealing/amending multiple laws
currently in operation. The code proposes two separate tribunals to adjudicate
complaints of bankruptcy: (i) the National Company Law Tribunal for companies
and limited liability partnerships firms; and (ii) the Debt Recovery Tribunal for
individuals and partnerships. The process would be managed by licensed
insolvency professional hired by Insolvency Professional Agencies that must close
each case within a time bound period of 180 days, extendable by another 90 days.
The code has provision for an insolvency regulator, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy
Board of India, to maintain oversight over the insolvency resolution process.

Fiscal consolidation: Fiscal consolidation road map was delayed by one year; the
new road map proposes to achieve central government fiscal deficit of 3 percent
of GDP by 2017/18 instead of 2016/17. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit target for
2015/16 has been set at 3.9 percent in place of the earlier 3.6 percent.
Corporate tax: Budget 2015/16 proposed cutting basic rate of corporate tax to
25 percent from current 30 percent over the next four years, accompanied by
removal of exemptions. The government has published a draft roadmap for public
comment.
Service tax: Service tax rate increased to 14 percent from 12.36 percent.
Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendation: Government accepted the
recommendation to raise share of states from central pool of taxes to 42 percent
from 32 percent. The government also appointed a sub-group of state chief
ministers to rationalize centrally sponsored schemes (CSS) to make
commensurate savings at the centre.
GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule): GAAR on tax avoidance has been
deferred by 2 years; will be effective from April 1, 2017.

GST Bill: Constitution Amendment Bill related to GST (goods and services tax) is
passed in the Lok Sabha (lower house) and pending approval of Rajya Sabha
(upper house). The Bill seeks to replace central and state indirect taxes currently
levied on goods and services, with the GST. The government committee chaired
by Chief Economic Advisor, Ministry of Finance, has submitted its
recommendations on revenue neutral tax rates.
Social Security: The government announced three insurance schemes: (i)
Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Beema Yojana that offers cover of Rs 0.2 million for
accidental death/disability with an annual premium of Rs 12; (ii) Pradhan Mantri
Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana that offers cover of Rs 0.2 million for death with an
annual premium of Rs 330; and Atal Pension Yojana that would provide a fixed
minimum pension between Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 per month on contribution
basis.
Fertilizer subsidy: Government approved a new urea policy that aims at
maximizing domestic production and increasing the energy efficiency of urea
units, though prices would continue to remain at the current level.
MAT: The government accepted the recommendations of the High Level
Committee to exempt minimum alternate tax (MAT) levied on FIIs.
Pay Commission: The Seventh Central Pay Commission report submitted to the
government recommended an overall pay increase of 23.55 percent. The
proposed date for implementation of these recommendations is January 1, 2016.
Discoms debt restructuring: The government announced Ujwal Discom
Assurance Yojna (UDAY) scheme to restructure debt owned by state-owned
power distribution companies (discoms) and to set in place a framework to
improve their operational and financial efficiency through monitoring of target
activities related to transmission and distribution losses and periodic tariff
revisions. Under the scheme, states, on a voluntary basis, would be required to
take over 75 percent of the discoms’ debt (as of September 30, 2015) over two
years (50 percent in the first year and 25 percent in the second year) and issue
bonds in the market, which would not be counted within the states’ fiscal deficit
limits for the first two years, FY2015/16 and FY2016/17.

NITI Aayog: Government notified the creation of NITI (National Institution for
Transforming India) Aayog, the body to replace the Planning Commission. The
new institution will provide strategic and technical advice to central government
and states regarding different aspects of policy.
Special Economic Zone (SEZ): Government notified SEZs (Amendment) Rules,
2014, which would allow dual use of non-processing areas in SEZs.
FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in insurance: The Insurance Laws
(Amendment) Bill, 2015 was passed by Parliament, and raises composite foreign
equity investment cap to 49 percent (both FDI and FPI) in insurance companies.
Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2015
passed by Parliament. The amended law permits all new mining leases through
auction by competitive bidding, including e-auction.
Coal Mines Bill, 2015: Parliament passed the bill that enables government to
allocate coal mines through auctions as well as allowing private companies to
mine coal for sale in the open market.

Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF): Government approved PSF as a Central Sector
Scheme, with a corpus of Rs.500 crores, to support market interventions for price
control of perishable agri-horticultural commodities. PSF would be used to
advance interest free loan to State Governments and Central agencies to support
their working capital and other expenses on procurement and distribution
interventions for such commodities.
Financial Redress Agency: Government constituted a task force to set up
Financial Redress Agency (FRA) for financial consumers. It will deal with
complaints of low values and large numbers, functioning on a pan-India basis.
Urban development initiative: Government launched three schemes for urban
areas. The schemes are: (i) Smart Cities; (ii) Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and
Urban Transformation (AMRUT); and (iii) Housing for All in urban areas.
Agriculture markets: Government approved a scheme to integrate 585 regulated
wholesale markets in various states in three phases during 2015/16, 2016/17 and
2017/18 on an electronic platform. It would help develop a national e-market by
asking states to carry out reforms on a voluntary basis to benefit from the
scheme.
Black money: Government notified the new black money act passed by the
Parliament that provides for a one-time ‘compliance window’ of three months
until September 30 for disclosure of foreign income and assets to escape
prosecution with a 60 percent penalty. Those failing to pay, however, would face a
more stringent penalty of 120 percent and could also face criminal prosecution
with a jail term of up to ten years, beginning April 1, 2016.
Composite cap on foreign investment: Government simplified foreign
investment by clubbing all forms of foreign investment (FDI and FPI) in Indian
companies under a single, composite ceiling. However, banking and defence
sectors would continue to operate under separate caps—one for foreign portfolio
investment and the other for overall foreign investment.
Comprehensive revision of FDI policy: Limits for FIPB approval raised to Rs. 50
billion; FDI up to 100 percent allowed in coffee, rubber, cardamom, palm oil, olive
oil tree plantations, broadcasting, and non-scheduled air transport services; 49
percent FDI in defence through automatic route; and limits raised for satellite
establishment, construction development projects, duty free shops.
Labor reform: President approved amendments to 15 central labor laws passed
by the legislative assembly of Madhya Pradesh. Some of the key amendments
include easing retrenchment norms, three months’ compensation to retrenched
workers, raising overtime hours and night shift for women.
Agricultural reform: Government approved a modified crop insurance scheme,
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (Prime Minister’s Crop Insurance Scheme), to
provide a social security net to most farmers across the country. The scheme
would require farmers to contribute a much smaller share of the total premium: 2
percent of the sum insured for kharif crop; 1.5 percent for rabi crop; and 5 percent
for commercial and horticulture crops. The balance of the premium would be
contributed by the central and state governments, to be shared equally.

Annex III. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery
in the economy’s real GDP growth rate (with growth higher than projected in the 2015 Article IV
Staff Report). 2 Under the baseline, assuming gradual fiscal consolidation, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is forecast to decline gradually to around 61¾ percent of GDP in the medium term from the
current level of about 66 percent, with gross financing needs also declining slightly to about
10¾ percent of GDP in 2020/21. Negative growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the
debt outlook. In addition, realization of contingent liabilities coming from future bank
recapitalization needs and liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also push the
debt trajectory up above the 70 percent benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines
gradually in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to
mitigate the impact of any real interest rate shocks. India’s external debt, currently at 24 percent of
GDP, remains sustainable.
1.

India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:



Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 7.3 percent (at market prices) in
2015/16, gradually rising to 7¾ percent in the medium term. CPI inflation is projected to
decline from about 6 percent in 2014/15 to around 5 percent in 2020/21. This baseline
scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms that do not require
legislative approval, and a gradual global economic recovery scenario as outlined in the
WEO.



Fiscal Assumptions. The 2014/15 central government fiscal deficit came in at 4.0 percent
of GDP (below the authorities’ deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP), which corresponds to
4.2 percent under the Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, the central government’s
fiscal deficit (as per IMF definition) is expected to decline slowly toward 3.6 percent of
GDP, while state government deficits should decline to about 2.3 percent of GDP. Staff
projections (which are based on current policies and assume no major legislative
changes) imply that the central government will underperform against its fiscal
adjustment targets.
o

1

Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as
ongoing administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening
is expected to continue. Introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is not
assumed in this baseline, as it requires further legislative changes.

Prepared by Mehdi Raissi, and Volodymyr Tulin.

The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See
Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.

o

At the same time, while savings from reduced fuel subsidies have already been
realized as diesel prices have been deregulated, the planned gradual introduction of
cash transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the
Food Security Act and fertilizer subsidies will keep the subsidy bill high.

o

Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets (baseline
assumes 0.3 percent of FY2018/19 GDP cumulative over the next four years). Recent
announcements indicate state governments will assume a large portion of the debt
of electricity distribution companies (up to 3 percent of GDP), but since the actual
agreements have not yet been reached, this is incorporated only into the contingent
liabilities shock scenario.

2.
Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will
enter a gradual declining path from 2016/17. India’s primary deficit is projected to trend
downward and remain below its debt-stabilizing threshold (estimated at 2.9 percent of GDP
based on the 2020/21 projections) in the projection years. Therefore, gross financing needs are
expected to remain at slightly above 12 percent of GDP in 2015/16 before gradually declining to
about 10¾ percent in 2020/21. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth
differential will on average reduce the debt ratio by close to 2¼ percentage points per year from
2015/16 to 2020/21. As a result, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from about 66
percent in 2014/15 to 61¾ percent in 2020/21. The medium-term public debt-to-GDP ratio is
about 3 percentage point higher than envisaged in the last Staff Report, reflecting an upward
data revision of the historical public debt path and projected slower nominal GDP growth, in part
as a result of reduced inflation and the adoption of flexible inflation targeting.
3.
India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but could
be vulnerable to slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map
suggests that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded
under a contingent liability shock. A contingent liability shock (which could arise from losses at
public banks and debt restructuring of electricity distribution companies)4 pushes the debt-toGDP ratio to around 73 percent in 2016/17 and 2017/18. While not flagged as a main risk by the
heat map, a one-standard deviation shock to real GDP growth increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to
just below 70 percent in 2017/18, only marginally lower than the threshold of 70 percent above
which the heat map flags the risk. Both shocks, however, do not change the downward debt
trajectory in the medium term. Lack of fiscal adjustment is another principal risk to debt
sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged primary balance would slow the debt reduction in
the near term. Finally, the combined macro-fiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not
change the direction of the debt trajectory. As a result, the asymmetric fan chart suggests that
upside risks to debt ratio dominate in the medium term. Overall, risks are mitigated by the fact
that most of the public debt is financed through a captive domestic investor base, the very small
The contingent liabilities shock is customized to reflect: (i) the central government bearing the full cost of PSBs’
recapitalization in a severe stress scenario (about 3 percent of GDP), and (ii) state governments assuming 75
percent of the debt of the electricity distribution companies (about 2.5 percent of GDP).

external debt is mostly from official creditors, and adequate international reserves are available in
the rare case that external financing needs arise. Risks that could improve India’s public debt
sustainability include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a new Direct Tax Code (including
improvements in tax administration) that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains.
A stronger revival of the economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before
the global financial crisis.
4.
There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions
and the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s
forecast track record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median
forecast errors for real GDP growth, primary balance and inflation during 2006–14 are all close to
the median among all surveillance countries. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement
of around three-quarters of one percentage point in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP
over the medium term) is modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is
also in line with other countries’ experiences, with a three-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted
primary balance at the 64 percentile among all surveillance countries with market access. The
boom-bust analysis is not triggered because India had a negative output gap in 2014/15.

Annex IV. Assessing Reserve Adequacy in India1
This note analyzes the adequacy of international reserves in India using the reserve optimizing
model of Jeanne and Rancière (2011) and the IMF’s risk-weighted reserve adequacy metric. The
results show that India’s international reserves are adequate to cover a broad set of risks.
India’s international reserves have increased by about $50 billion since end-March 2014,
and stand at $352 billion at end-December 2015. The current account deficit (CAD) of
1.3 percent of GDP in 2014/15 was comfortably financed by capital flows, resulting in an increase
in international reserves. The main capital flows were: (i) inflows from foreign institutional
investors (FII), who made net purchases of Indian equities and debt of about $45 billion in
2014/15; (ii) net FDI flows, at about $33 billion in 2014/15; and (iii) non-resident Indian deposits
and overseas borrowings by banks amounting to $14 billion. The CAD is projected to remain at
about 1.3 percent of GDP in 2015/16.
Given that any sudden stops or reversal of capital inflows could expose India to significant
risks, holding an adequate level of international reserves is essential for the country to
reduce its vulnerability. India is susceptible to surges in global financial market volatility as well
as commodity-price shocks, and should hold reserves for precautionary purposes. However,
there is little consensus in the literature on what constitutes an adequate level of reserves from a
precautionary perspective. This Annex analyses international reserves in India using the reserve
optimizing model of Jeanne and Rancière (2011), and compares the findings with those of the
IMF’s risk-weighted metric. The results show that India’s international reserve levels are adequate
to cover a broad set of risks.
The Reserve Optimizing Model of Jeanne and Rancière2: This model describes reserves
accumulation as an optimization problem in which risk-averse policy makers choose the level of
reserves to provide optimal insurance against a sudden stop in consumption, given the cost of
holding reserves. When a sudden stop occurs, external debt cannot be rolled over and output
falls below its long-run growth path. Higher reserves mitigate the fall in output and help smooth
national consumption. However, there is a cost to holding reserves as they yield a lower return
than other assets in the economy. In this model the optimal level of reserves is determined by
the size and probability of the sudden stop, the potential loss in output and consumption, the
opportunity cost of holding reserves, and the degree of risk aversion. Based on a calibrated
version of this model to Indian data, the optimal level of reserves in India is estimated to be just
above the projected actual holdings in 2015 (see Figure 1).

The IMF’s Risk-Weighted Approach3 employs a metric that reflects the relative risk levels of
different potential sources of balance of payments pressure—the relative risk weights are based
on tail event outflows associated with periods of exchange market pressure in different
countries—and assesses how large a stock of reserves might be needed relative to this riskweighted measure, to cover for outflows from different sources. For India the metric is
constructed as 30% of short-term debt + 15% of other portfolio liabilities + 5% of M2 + 5% of
exports. Coverage in the region of 100-150 percent of the metric can be regarded as adequate.
Figure 2 shows India’s reserve coverage against the proposed adequacy range of 100-150
percent (dashed lines). In 2015, the projected level of reserves in India is at 151 percent of the
IMF’s reserve adequacy metric.

The IMF’s ‘unadjusted’ assessing reserve adequacy (ARA) metric is used for India. IMF
(2015) proposes a new ARA metric, the ‘adjusted’ ARA metric, to account for controls on capital
outflows, which should reduce the risk of resident capital flight. The adjusted ARA metric halves
the weight on broad money—the proxy for resident flight—resulting in a lower needed stock of
reserves. This approach is not appropriate for India for two reasons. First, de facto measures
show that India’s integration with international capital markets has increased significantly over
the past three decades.4 Second, the adjusted ARA metric uses a composite index to measure
capital account openness that is based on de jure indices which: (i) tally both inflow and outflow
restrictions; (ii) do not distinguish between controls on residents and non-residents; (iii) count
even minimal registration requirements as restrictions; (iv) do not capture whether controls
would potentially bind in an outflow event; and (v) end in 2012—thus not measuring easing of
restrictions in subsequent years. These indices are not granular enough to measure the extent of

capital account liberalization in India. To deem a lower level of reserves to be adequate as a
result of using a dated and coarse measure of capital controls that has not changed for India
since the early 1990s—even though the capital account has become increasingly open—would
be to go against the spirit of the assessing reserve adequacy exercise.
Overall, India’s level of foreign reserves is adequate to cover a broad set of risks. However,
international reserves are only one part of a country’s defense against shocks. No one measure is
complete and can fully capture the range of factors that bear on a country’s resilience against
shocks. While it could be argued that a sound macroeconomic and prudential policy framework
is likely more important than reserves in limiting country vulnerabilities, the present uncertainties
in global financial markets related to the prolonged use of accommodative monetary policies by
advanced economies may warrant holding a higher level of reserves than suggested by the IMF’s
reserve adequacy framework.
Assessment of reserve adequacy should also take into account a central bank’s other
external buffers, such as forward FX liquidity positions and bilateral/multilateral swap
lines. The RBI has purchased about $36 billion in both spot and forward markets from January to
November 2015. As at end-November 2015, the net outstanding forward FX purchases of the RBI
stood at $1.5 billion. The net forward position was negative $3 billion. RBI’s reserve holdings, net
of forwards, compares favorably with other EMs (see text chart on the right). Regarding other
lines of defense, the RBI and Bank of Japan have a Currency Swap Arrangement of $50 billion,
and the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) have a Contingent Reserve
Arrangement (CRA) of $18 billion.

Annex V. Subsidy Reform Progress1
Subsidy reforms have played an important role in fiscal consolidation efforts of the past few years. Better
targeting, improving efficiency, and reducing distortions are imperative for further rationalization of subsidies.
The major subsidies of the Government of India, for the first time in a decade, are expected to dip
below 2 percent of GDP in 2015-16. The Government provides major subsidies for food, fertilizer and
petroleum products. The strong reform efforts over the

cereals to 67 percent of the population—on the
government’s fiscal position is thus likely to remain limited. Digitization and biometric seeding of Public
Distribution System (PDS) beneficiaries are being pursued all over the country. In addition, some pilot
experiments for cash transfers are being carried out in selected urban areas. In this regard, in addition to
enhancing the PDS until the full NFSA rollout, the High Level Committee on restructuring of the Food
Corporation of India (FCI) has recommended bringing down the coverage rate to about 40 percent which is
more than adequate to cover the below-poverty-line households.

Reforms have been recently implemented to help reduce energy subsidies and prevent their recurrence.
These measures include:

Gasoline and diesel prices were deregulated in 2010 and 2014, respectively, and now move in line with
international prices. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been raised on multiple occasions over the
past year.


The formula for fixing the price of natural gas also has been revised and gas prices have been raised,
with a provision to revise prices every six months. LPG subsidies have been reduced and fixed on a per
cylinder basis, and since early 2015 delivered via the direct benefits transfer scheme with nationwide
coverage. The nationwide introduction of the modified direct cash transfers scheme for LPG (PAHAL
scheme) yielded an estimated 10 to 20 percent subsidy bill savings, in part as a result of de-duplication
initiatives and reduced leakages. While around 3 million households have given up cash subsidy under
the “Give it Up” campaign, LPG subsidies have remained untargeted and in practice highly regressive.



Both allocation and distribution reforms are being pursued in the kerosene sector; and the Indian
states are being incentivized to undertake distribution reforms to improve targeting to the needy.

As allocation and distribution reforms are rolled out, the under-recovery burden of the oil companies is
expected to be completely eliminated, which will help free up resources towards exploration and investment
activities. With the ensuing substantial reduction in the fuel subsidy bill, the drop in international oil prices
presents an opportunity to increase fuel taxation levels to generate additional indirect tax revenues and raise

the overall tax ratio. In addition, staff research suggests that from an economic efficiency perspective, fuel
taxation in India remains significantly below the levels that would internalize negative externalities relating to
pollution, traffic accidents, and global warming.2

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the
exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the
interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to
modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India
maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):
restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;
restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with
two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans
by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in December 2014. The Staff Report (IMF
Country Report No. 15/61) and associated Selected Issues (IMF Country Report No. 15/62) were
discussed by the Executive Board on February 13, 2015.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
The pilot FSSA/FSAP report was issued in January 2001; a fiscal transparency ROSC was issued in
February 2001 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/ind/fiscal.htm); the data model of the ROSC
(Country Report No. 04/96) was issued in April 2004. The missions for the FSAP Update took place in
2011, and concluding meetings were held in Delhi and Mumbai in January 2012—the FSSA Update
report was published in January 2013 (Country Report No. 13/8). Detailed assessment reports on
FSAP-related papers were issued in August 2013 and published as Country Reports No. 13/265–268.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In Bank FY15 (July 1, 2014–June 30, 2015), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$3.8 billion (of which
US$2.1 billion IBRD and US$1.7 billion IDA). IFC committed US$1.3 billion in FY15. The World Bank
Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India for 2013-20171 focuses on helping India
accelerate poverty reduction and boost shared prosperity, and is closely aligned the Government’s
12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster, sustainable, and more inclusive growth.” To make a
meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges, the volume of WBG support—
from IBRD, IDA, and IFC—should reach $4 billion annually over the five-year period of the CPS.
Under the Strategy, the WBG aims to contribute to India’s development by deepening and
strengthening engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and
inclusion. “Integration” seeks to increase market integration by focusing on addressing infrastructure
gaps and investment climate as key measures needed to help low-income states converge more
quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities
by 2031, “rural-urban transformation” will require intensified engagement to improve the
management and livability of medium-sized cities. “Inclusion” will entail a stronger focus on human
development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on the quality of education at
all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for the underprivileged. A
common theme across these three areas of engagement will be an emphasis on improved
governance, sustainability, and gender equality.
Two key strategic shifts are central to the WBG program in India: increased support to 14 lowincome and special category states2 and to urbanization. The Bank is working with the Government
to rebalance its lending portfolio, so that 30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will be directed to these
states, which together account for 61.5 percent of India’s 270 million people living in poverty. Many
of these states also have human development indicators—high infant mortality, high child
malnutrition, low female literacy—on par with the poorest countries in the world. IFC’s LIS
investment portfolio covers a broad range of sectors, complemented its advisory services.
Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities that are
transformative and innovative. Urbanization presents tremendous opportunities, both for agriculture
and poverty reduction, and competitiveness. WBG support focuses on government efforts at the
national, state and city levels to help improve the livability of medium-sized cities.
A robust knowledge portfolio complements and underpins financing and includes: (i) focus on indepth analytical work on key cross-sectoral questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of
future interventions by drawing on impact evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with
demand-driven technical assistance and just-in-time knowledge support to help reform and
implementation; (iv) broker South-South and across-state knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible
programmatic approaches to develop analytic and advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training

Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

capacity. The Advisory Services and Analytical (ASA) program has been strategically realigned to
enhance the implementation of the CPS and its contribution to the twin goals of poverty reduction
and shared prosperity. A clustered approach enables WBG teams to work on multi-sectoral
development challenges in areas such as poverty and shared prosperity, water, urban, service
delivery, human development outcomes, public-private partnerships, social inclusion and gender
and economic integration.
The India Performance and Learning Review (PLR)3—the mid-term assessment of the Strategy—
noted that the India program has been scaled up over the last three years and is being delivered in
the context of a strengthened partnership between the Government of India and WBG. The 2014
National Elections brought to power the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Prime Minister
Narendra Modi. Stressing the importance of WBG as the “Knowledge Bank”, Prime Minister Modi
and President Jim Kim agreed to scale up support in six strategic priority areas of engagement.
Cutting-edge, global knowledge and financing is being mobilized from across the “One World Bank
Group” to help: rejuvenate the Ganga; develop smart cities and improve urban service delivery;
improve rural sanitation and end open defecation; provide 24/7 electricity to all, including an
ambitious push on solar energy; and provide youth with training and skills development. The Bank
Group will also scale up engagement to help modernize India’s massive railway system and improve
India’s business climate. In the remainder of the CPS period more emphasis will also be placed on
addressing India’s high malnutrition rates and helping to create opportunities for greater economic
and social inclusion of people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and women.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2013–2017) (CPS) is based on three strategic pillars: (i)
inclusive growth; (ii) environmental sustainability; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration. The
CPS is anchored to AsDB’s Strategy 2020 and has been designed to support the Government of
India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) vision of faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. The
CPS emphasizes robust infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional
connectivity, and environmental sustainability. The backbone of the India program will be energy,
transport, and urban services. On a selective basis, ADB will also invest in special purpose vehicles
for infrastructure financing, water resources management, skills development, and state-level fiscal
reforms.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for
timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and timeliness of labor
market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against
the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: In January 2015 the Central Statistical Office
(CSO) released a new series of national accounts, with base year 2011/12. In addition to the shift in
the base year for measuring growth, the revisions reflected a review of source data and compilation
methods, and implementation of 2008 SNA. Due to weaknesses in estimating taxes less subsidies on
products in constant prices and as supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side
data, Gross Value Added is preferred as a proxy for measuring economic growth. For current price
estimates, the data sources provide adequate coverage of economic activities, and the methodology
is broadly consistent with international standards and best practices. Nonetheless, a sales-tax-based
extrapolation of trade turnover value from the base year does not provide an accurate gauge of
growth of economy-wide value added from trade. Constant price estimates of GDP deviate from the
conceptual requirements of the national accounts, in part because the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) is
used to derive volume estimates for many economic activities. The WPI is not the price counterpart
for GDP by type of activity because the WPI includes some product taxes whereas GDP by activity
does not include product taxes. Therefore, the WPI can be influenced by changes in tax rates. Further,
the WPI weights include imports but the prices for the index are collected only on domestic goods.
Large revisions to historical series, the relatively short time span of the revised series, and major
discrepancies between GDP by activity and GDP by expenditure complicate analysis. There are longstanding deficiencies in employment data: they only cover the formal sector, which accounts for a
small segment of the labor market, and are available only with a substantial lag.
4.
Price statistics: A revised all-India Consumer Price Index (CPI) with new weights was released
in early 2011, which covers combined rural and urban India, with 2009/10 as a base year. As well,
separate corresponding urban and rural CPI series are published. The CPIs are published with a lag of
about one month. In early 2015, the CPI weights were updated using 2011/12 expenditure data and
the CPI series has been revised from January 2015. Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has
published a CPI for industrial workers with a 2001 base year. Presently, there also remain four CPIs,
each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers,
10

urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). With the exception of the
industrial workers CPI, these other indices are based on weights that are over ten years old. The WPI
has a 2004/05 base year, for which data are also subject to frequent and large revision, usually
upward. A new series of the WPI, also using 2011/12 base year, are likely to be released in March
2016. The authorities have been encouraged to develop a Producer Price Index to replace the WPI.
New RBI price series on residential property price indexes have helped surveillance in this area,
though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not
available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance,
but economy-wide wage data are scant.
5.
External sector statistics: The concepts and definitions used to compile balance of payments
statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6).
However, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on trade prices,
volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. External debt statistics are
available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are
presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a
residual maturity basis is only available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and
long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the
sectors prescribed in the BPM6 and these data are disseminated within six months of the reference
period in respect of annual data.4 Coverage of direct investment positions data is hampered by the
absence of appropriate legal or institutional authority. India began disseminating the Data Template
on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in
December 2001. More up-to-date information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves,
foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part
of a weekly statistical supplement on the RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array
of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a weighted
average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency and quality
of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,
under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data
by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other
financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
4
The IIP as published by the RBI values equity liabilities at acquisition cost, while the Fund uses market prices,
resulting in substantial differences.

Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis
only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous
paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test
data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been
developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities
in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling
and disseminating the GFS. India reports the budgetary central government cash flow statement
within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the
reference quarter. With the agreement of the authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly
cash flow statement for publication in the International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001
presentation, with some missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance
at the state level are available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the
functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is
also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,
classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and
plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central
government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), the latest reported data corresponding to 2010. Two years after the reference year, the
Ministry of Finance reports general government data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff
reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to
2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude
data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds.
Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the
reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option but meets the SDDS specifications for central
government debt and operations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 12, 2016
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Historical GDP figures for FY2011/12–FY2014/15 have been revised. India’s
Ministry of Statistics released (on January 29), revised estimates for the national accounts for
these years, which suggest a more gradual growth recovery during the period 2012–14. The
revision to FY2014/15 growth has been minor (down to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent).
However, the revised series for GDP (at market prices) indicates that growth accelerated
from 5.6 percent in FY2012/13 to 6.6 percent in FY2013/14, compared to an acceleration
from 5.1 percent to 6.9 percent, respectively, in the previous data vintage.
2.
The Q3 FY2015/16 estimate for real GDP growth at market prices was also
released, indicating quarterly growth of 7.3 percent, in line with staff forecasts. This
suggests some moderation in momentum, as growth in the first half of FY2015/16 has been
revised upward from 7.2 percent to 7.6 percent. This GDP data (at market prices) indicates
that domestic demand, primarily private consumption, remains a key growth driver, while an
increase in exports (on a seasonally adjusted basis) indicates a likely bottoming out of export
receipts. However, the ongoing investment recovery remains unsteady, as growth of capital
formation decelerated from 7.3 percent in the first half of the fiscal year to 3.1 percent in the
third quarter of FY2015/16. Finally, the services PMI rose to a ten-month high in December
2015, on account of improved new business orders and upbeat expectations.
3.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy repo rate unchanged at
6.75 percent on February 2, in line with market expectations. The RBI stated in its latest
bi-monthly monetary policy statement that the rationale for its decision was the absence of
major new inflationary developments and a reasonable pace of economic recovery. The RBI
did caution that the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
would have an inflationary impact for a period of up to two years. With regard to the
forthcoming Union Budget, the RBI noted that pro-growth structural reforms that also keep
spending in check would create greater space for monetary policy. Recent data indicates that
since mid-December 2015, bank credit growth has picked up from 9.9 percent to 11.6
percent.
4.
International reserves have declined by US$ 1.2 billion in 2016, standing at US$
349 billion at the end of January 2016. Net portfolio investment outflows (both equity and
debt) amounted to US$ 1.3 billion in January 2016, and so far in February there have been net
inflows of about US$ 190 million. Foreign direct investment inflows have been robust,
amounting to US$ 35 billion during the first eight months of FY2015/16, an increase of
25 percent over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. International reserves now
represent about 8 months of next year’s imports of goods and services. Official intervention

2
data indicates that the RBI’s net spot sale of foreign currency amounted to only US$ 179
million in December 2015, with outstanding net forward purchases of foreign currency standing
at US$ 2 billion at end-December. The Indian rupee depreciated by about 2.5 percent in January
2016, and has changed little since.
5.
The Indian authorities have taken further steps to enhance the recently
introduced gold monetization schemes. In mid-January, the government launched a second
tranche of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and in late January, the RBI modified certain
aspects of the Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS). For example, with the GMS, the RBI
allowed early withdrawals of medium- and long-term government deposits, following
minimum lock-in periods of three and five years, respectively.

Statement by Subir Gokarn, Exectuvie Director for India
Himanshu Joshi, Senior Advisor, and Mohua Roy, Advisor
February 12, 2016
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank staff for presenting a
comprehensive and balanced assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial sector
developments in India and the evolving outlook. The mission team had broad-based and open
discussions with our authorities, who broadly share the staff’s assessment.
2.
The Indian economy has embarked on a steady growth path during the past two years.
During FY2014-15, India's GVA (gross value added at basic prices) growth recovered to 7.1
per cent from 6.3 per cent recorded in the previous fiscal year. The same year, India's
services sector grew by 10.3 per cent, manufacturing by 5.4 per cent, and agriculture by 1.3
per cent. More recently, India's GVA (at basic prices) growth during October-December
2015 (FY 2015-16) stood at 7.1 per cent, making it the fastest growing major economy. Our
authorities took advantage of the sharp decline in the global oil and commodity prices to
significantly reduce fuel subsidies and increase excise taxes on petroleum products.
Resources obtained from lower subsidies and higher excise taxes have helped in lowering
deficits and increasing capital expenditure. Inflation is expected to remain within the target
band set under the new monetary policy framework put in place in February 2015. This
would also be supported by a sustainable medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy being
pursued by our authorities.
3.
While the recovery in various sectors of the economy has not been uniform, our
authorities have taken swift and effective policy measures to address the challenges facing
the economy. Progress is visible in several areas, particularly in the ease of doing business.
Some key reforms on the anvil, most notably the Goods and Services Tax (GST), would
further spur economic activity and exert a downward pressure on inflation. Export growth
and foreign capital inflows, however, face some risks from the slowdown in global demand
and heightened volatility in global financial markets. The authorities recognize that bank
balance sheets need to be strengthened and have taken action in this direction.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
GDP growth and Short-term Outlook
4.
The Indian economy recorded a growth of 7.3 per cent in the first three quarters
(April-December) of FY2015-16 as compared with 7.4 per cent during the same period last
year. The Advance Estimates have placed India’s FY2015-16 GDP growth at 7.6 per cent as
compared with 7.2 per cent last year. Despite rainfall deficiency, rural incomes have been
supported by allied activities such as dairy and horticulture leading to a marginal increase in
agricultural growth. While manufacturing has recorded acceleration in output growth during
the first three quarters, other industrial sectors have decelerated, due to weak investment
demand with some slowdown in capital goods production. This is being sought to be
corrected by several major policy initiatives by the authorities which are supported by a
pick-up in corporate profitability on account of declining input costs. Overall, the Reserve

2
Bank of India’s (RBI’s) industrial outlook survey indicates expansion of activity at an
accelerated pace in Q4. In January 2016, activity in India's services sector, as reflected in
Nikkei purchasing managers’ index, increased at its fastest pace in over a year and a half.
While the current growth impetus is steady, it remains below the medium-term potential. Our
authorities recognize the need for reviving private investment to put the economy durably on
a higher growth trajectory.
5.
The outlook for the Indian economy beyond the current year has also improved
significantly. Several positive factors such as steady disinflation, a modest current account
deficit, fiscal rectitude, improvement in regulatory environment for business, and scaling up
of infrastructure, have contributed to this improvement. However, the slowdown in global
growth and trade accompanied by higher volatility in global financial markets could impose
some constraints on growth.
Fiscal Policy
6.
India continues on a path of steady fiscal consolidation. The GFD of the Central
Government, which was contained at 4.0 per cent of GDP in FY2014-15 against the budgeted
target of 4.1 per cent of GDP, is targeted to decline further to 3.9 per cent of GDP in
FY2015-16. During April-December 2015, the fiscal position of the Central Government was
considerably better than in the corresponding period of the previous year as reflected in key
deficit indicators. Although the authorities have slightly extended the timeframe for reaching
the GFD-GDP goal-post of 3 per cent upto 2017-18, they have, at the same time, expressed a
binding commitment for a path of medium-term fiscal consolidation. Tax collections, and
especially indirect taxes, have been buoyant. The authorities have taken several
administrative and technological initiatives to further boost revenues. They have made
concerted efforts to usher in the GST regime. Based on recommendations of the Tax
Administration Reforms Commission, the government has set up a Tax Council to obtain
multidisciplinary inputs and bring about greater coherence in formulation of tax policy. On
the expenditure side, the growth in capital expenditure at 33.54 per cent reflects the
Government’s commitment to support investment. Other measures for expenditure
management, subsidy reforms, and direct benefits transfer (DBT) have also yielded
substantial benefits. As a result, so far during FY2015-16 (up to January 29, 2016), net
market borrowings have been lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
7.
There are three broad emergent trends that are likely to have a strong positive impact
on the fiscal situation over the medium term.


The GST implementation would contribute to an efficiency-enhancing centralization
of the indirect tax system. Apart from the revenue potential of a self-enforcing tax, as
powerfully demonstrated by the experience of states which had implemented the
Value Added Tax (VAT) regime in 2005, there are significant efficiency gains to be
obtained from lower transportation and logistics costs. It is also likely to increase the
indirect tax base.

3


The recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission1 (FFC) will contribute
to a significant decentralization of expenditure from the centre to the states. Based on
the premise that state governments will be better able to target expenditures to meet
their social and economic objectives, this should lead to greater efficiency of public
expenditure.



The country's infrastructure deficit requires significantly large resources to be
bridged. While the state has to play a much larger role in accelerating investment into
infrastructure especially in provision of resources, private sector skills in execution
and operation can contribute in delivering effective infrastructure services. This reframing of the notion of Public-Private Partnerships is manifest in the recently
constituted National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).

The changes in the fiscal dynamics mentioned above are expected to incentivize buoyancy
and efficiency in the taxation system, increase public spending in infrastructure and other key
sectors and improve public accountability.
Inflation and Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Inflation, which had moderated significantly since 2014, has stayed along the
projected trajectory during FY2015-16 so far. CPI inflation rose to 5.6 per cent in December
2015 from 5.4 per cent in November 2015, with inflation in all major groups registering an
increase. To manage food inflation, the authorities have implemented supply side measures,
allowed imports and released stocks through PDS. A Price Stabilization Fund has been
established to support market interventions in perishable agri-horticultural commodities, with
the aim of managing non-cereal food inflation. Inflation is likely to remain range-bound in
the remaining months of FY2015-16. Both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations
of households have moderated but are still in the low double digits. In the latest round of
Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, the proportion of respondents expecting price
rise by ‘more than current rate’ for prices in general has decreased marginally as compared
with the previous rounds of both 3 month and 1 year ahead periods. Regarding the mediumterm inflation target of 4 per cent, the Reserve Bank’s endeavor is to keep the economy
anchored to the projected disinflation path that should take inflation down to 5 per cent by
March 2017.
9.
Owing to the easing of inflationary pressures, RBI has been able to reduce the policy
rate by 125 basis points since January 2015. Overall, the monetary policy stance continues to
1

The Constitution of India requires the setting up of a Finance Commission every five years, or earlier. The
Finance Commission recommends the distribution of the net proceeds of taxes of the Union between the Union
and the states. The report of the Fourteenth Finance Commission was submitted to the Parliament in February
2015. The states’ share in the net proceeds of the Union tax revenues would now be 42 per cent, up from the
current level of 32 per cent (which was recommended by the previous Finance Commission). This is the largest
ever change in the percentage of devolution to the states. In the past, when Finance Commissions have
recommended an increase, it has been in the range of 1-2 per cent increase. As compared to the total
devolutions in 2014-15, the total devolution of the States in 2015-16 is expected to increase by over 45 per cent.

4
be accommodative while awaiting further data on inflation. Further monetary policy
measures will depend on developments in both the disinflationary process and forthcoming
Union Budget.
10.
India’s current account deficit (CAD) declined sharply from 4.8 per cent of GDP in
FY2012-13 to 1.7 per cent in FY2013-14. It has declined further to 1.6 per cent during JulySeptember 2015 aided mainly by a sharp decline in oil prices. While year-on-year exports
have contracted for the thirteenth successive month in December 2015, there has been
positive growth on a month-on-month basis. The decline in imports has slowed down in
December 2015. India’s trade deficit has widened to USD 11.7 billion in December 2015
from USD 9.8 billion in November 2015. Financing of the CAD has been facilitated by the
large inflow in FDI – USD 28.65 billion during FY2015-16 so far (April-November 2015),
despite net outflows from the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), reflecting global financial
volatility. India’s foreign exchange reserves, which are now at USD 349 billion (as of
January 29, 2016), are up by USD 7.5 billion from the level at end-March 2015.
11.
India has successfully weathered large capital outflows and currency volatility in
emerging markets caused by uncertainty about the normalization of US monetary policy in
2015. The nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee remained stable among only a few such
currencies of other emerging markets in 2015 even as forward-looking market liberalization
policies have attracted a good deal of foreign capital in recent years.
Financial Sector
12.
Credit growth has generally remained above 10 per cent with some pick-up in the
recent month’s incremental credit growth. Strong growth has been observed in personal loans
and non-bank flows from both domestic and foreign sources, which is expected to support
recovery going forward. The recent period has also seen stabilization of corporate leverage
that would improve credit growth going forward.
13.
Indian banks continue to be well-capitalized at the system level and above the
regulatory minimum. The capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of SCBs at the system
level declined moderately to 12.7 per cent from 13.0 per cent between March and September
2015, whereas the Tier-I leverage ratio increased to 6.5 per cent from 6.4 per cent during the
same period.
14.
Our authorities also plan to increase the capital of public sector banks (PSBs) by
Rs.700 billion funded by the budget in the four year period leading up to FY2018-19, in
addition to introducing differentiated capital support based on parameters of efficiency and
business growth. Further, managerial autonomy in decision making would be assured.
Although, weaker credit quality has somewhat depressed the profitability of PSBs and has
resulted in lower credit growth, the impact on GDP growth remains muted due to the
relatively low credit intensity of the Indian economy. Meanwhile, our authorities have
created institutions for reconstruction/resolution of bad assets.

5
15.
Though the elevated level of NPAs continues to be a key concern, the stress test for
credit risk conducted by the RBI suggests that, under the baseline macroeconomic scenario,
the GNPA ratio may rise to 5.4 per cent by September 2016 from 5.1 per cent seen in
September 2015, but it is expected to subsequently improve to 5.2 per cent by March 2017.
However, current indications about improvements in the corporate operating profits margins
are expected to provide an impetus for deleveraging and reduction in NPAs going forward.
RBI is taking steps to contain the strains on banking sector. These steps include:
i.
ii.

v.

deciding that all restructured loans (with minor exceptions) will be classified as nonperforming assets (NPAs), thus attracting provisioning;
introducing strategic debt restructuring that, inter alia, allows banks to convert their
loans into equity, thus enabling faster recovery of bad loans by quicker sale of assets;
increasing the ceiling on FDI in Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs);
Establishing a Central Registry of Information on Large Credits (CRILC); and
bringing out guidelines for early intervention through Joint Lenders Forum (JLF) and
Corrective Action Plan (CAP).

16.
The predominance of bank finance in India even as banks face challenges on asset
quality, profitability and capital, implies a need for diligent governance, review of business
models, and strong capital planning and dividend policies. The Reserve Bank has taken steps
the arrest the deterioration of asset quality by tightening the norms for recognition of
impaired assets and permitting viability based restructuring, while asking banks to be
proactive in better credit management and early recognition of stress. The ‘Indradhanush’
initiative to revamp the functioning of PSBs aims at a multi-pronged approach that includes
setting up of Banks Board Bureau for making senior appointments, capitalization, destressing, empowerment and framework for accountability and governance reforms.
17.
A number of initiatives have been taken by our authorities to expand financial
inclusion, including the scheme for disbursal of direct benefits into bank accounts, payments
banks and small finance banks (SFBs) for small payments/finance needs in the economy,
revising the priority sector guidelines with a specific focus on small and marginal farmers
and micro-enterprises and refinancing of loans to micro/small business entities engaged in
manufacturing, trading and service activities.
Structural Reforms
18.
Our authorities have initiated a number of reform measures to raise the potential
growth of the economy. These include progressive liberalization of FDI limits in several
sectors to improve access to capital. The setting up of the NIIF for financing infrastructure
and measures to ease supply constraints in the mining sector are expected to boost
infrastructure development. Efforts are also being made to improve operational efficiency in
power generation. In the agriculture sector, which is critical to inflation management, our
authorities have operationalized an irrigation scheme to ensure irrigation to all cultivated
lands and have recently launched a new Crop Insurance Scheme for farmers. Labor skilling
and reforms of inflexible labor regulations are underway in some states. The Digital India
program is aimed at enabling improved access to information and services/facilities to

6
enhance transparency and efficiency. The recently launched ‘Start-up India, Stand-up India’
aims at encouraging startup-entrepreneurial ventures to give impetus to employment
generation and wealth creation. Our authorities have also announced a funding corpus for
start-ups and fiscal incentives to enable these ventures to take quick roots.
Conclusion
19.
The Indian economy is on the path of steady progress despite adverse headwinds
from the global growth slowdown, weak investment demand and structural issues from the
past. Headline inflation has been on a downward trend and fiscal and external balances have
improved over time. Our authorities are committed to the fiscal consolidation path stated in
the Union Budget 2015-16. Adequate foreign exchange reserves provide a buffer in the event
of unwarranted turmoil in the global financial system. The IMF has retained the growth
forecast for India at the same level that was projected earlier. With these enabling
macroeconomic conditions, combined with broad-based structural reforms, the Indian
economy is poised to achieve a higher sustainable growth path going forward.
