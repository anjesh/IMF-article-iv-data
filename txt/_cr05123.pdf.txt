REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2004 Consultation with the Republic of Lithuania
Approved by Poul Thomsen and Carlos Muniz
March 9, 2005
The Article IV discussions were held in Vilnius during December 1–10, 2004. The mission
comprised Messrs. Mody (Head), Bonato, Kontolemis, and Leigh (all EUR) and was assisted by
Ms. Brixiova, the Fund’s Representative in Lithuania. Mr. Solheim (Executive Director) and
Mr. Sidlauskas (Advisor to the Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with
President Adamkus, Prime Minister Brazauskas, Finance Minister Butkevicius, Central Bank
Governor Sarkinas, members of the Budget Committee of the Parliament, leaders of political parties,
trade unions, financial institutions, and foreign investors. The mission overlapped with FAD technical
assistance missions on decentralization and treasury management issues.
Lithuania embarked on a Fund-supported program in March 2000 and by 2003 had achieved
macroeconomic stability, while also making considerable progress in structural reforms. At the
conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the authorities for
Lithuania’s success and graduation to a nonprogram relationship with the Fund. Nevertheless,
Directors noted that unemployment and the external current account deficit remained relatively high.
Directors urged the authorities to (a) limit the budget deficit to significantly below 3 percent of GDP;
(b) develop a credible medium-term fiscal plan that took into account all outstanding fiscal liabilities,
including costs associated with a rapidly aging population; (c) step up structural reforms to sustain
long-term growth; (d) enhance the efficiency of the health sector; and (e) solve the underlying
problems of municipalities. Some progress has been achieved, but these objectives should be actively
pursued.
Lithuania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of
restrictions (Appendix I). In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, Lithuania maintains
restrictions and imposes sanctions against individuals, groups, and organizations associated with
terrorism.
Lithuania subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data provision is timely and
facilitates effective surveillance (Appendix II). The authorities have agreed to the publication of the
staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Lithuania’s impressive growth continued unabated in 2004, and GDP
expanded by an estimated 6¾ percent, driven by vigorous private consumption and
investment growth. Inflation remained low at 1¼ percent in 2004 but was on an accelerating
trend toward year’s end. The current account deficit widened in 2004 to about 8½ percent of
GDP, and the budget deficit expanded from 1¾ percent in 2003 to 2¼ percent of GDP.
Outlook: GDP growth is forecast to reach 7 percent in 2005, underpinned by strong
investment and consumption. Utilization of EU funds is expected to add to demand pressures
in 2005–06. Increased demand for imports would lead to a further deterioration of the current
account deficit, which staff estimates could widen to 9½ percent in 2005 before declining
gradually to below 9 percent in the medium term. Inflation will reach some 3 percent in
2005, with some risk that strong domestic demand pressures, administrative price hikes, and
higher oil prices could push it even higher. With a buoyant outlook in 2005, a general
government deficit below 2 percent of GDP should be easily reachable.
Policy Discussions
Euro adoption: Lithuania is on course to adopt the euro in early 2007. The main risk arises
from inflation shocks, which could set the inflation rate temporarily above the Maastricht
limit. Bottlenecks in various segments of the economy are adding to demand pressures and
to wage demands. The authorities thought it unlikely that accelerating inflation could breach
the Maastricht criterion, though they recognized the risk. They took the view that domestic
demand pressures would mainly spill over into a larger current account deficit and were
concerned primarily about supply-side shocks. Staff argued that the impact of domestic
demand pressures on nontradable goods should not be minimized.
Fiscal policy: Staff expressed concern that the authorities had left insufficient space for the
operation of automatic stabilizers in the event of economic slowdown. Moreover, the trend
decline in revenue/GDP ratio is worrisome, and EU-related cofinancing expenditures are
likely to add to the expenditure pressures in 2005-06. In view of the upside risk to inflation,
staff recommended a somewhat tighter fiscal stance than envisaged under the 2005 budget
and saving of additional revenues in the event of stronger-than-anticipated growth.
Structural policies: Staff urged that the fiscal system be modernized to enhance incentives
for increased employment and productivity growth, and supported the authorities’ plan to
lower the marginal income tax rate from the current 33 percent, though with the caution that
the phased reduction should be part of a package that ensures revenue neutrality. The
authorities and staff agreed that further measures were needed to improve the financial
viability and effectiveness of the social safety and health systems. Efforts were also needed
to increase the economy’s competitiveness by improving the business climate, especially
with respect to greater flexibility of labor contracts, effective deployment of EU transfers for
small business development, and deregulation of the education and health sectors.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following severe economic difficulties in 1999, Lithuania accelerated its efforts
to make a transition towards a competitive market economy. With its currency board
already in place to provide monetary policy credibility, a major fiscal consolidation was
undertaken. Together, these helped lower inflationary expectations, allowing interest rates to
come down. A sustained privatization effort and measures to improve the business climate
provided impetus for private entrepreneurship and high productivity growth. Lithuania
achieved an enviable combination of high growth and low inflation (Figure 1). Important
legacies of the central planning era, however, are structural unemployment and an inadequate
social support system.
2.
With its accession to the European Union (EU), Lithuania has set itself the goal
of achieving advanced European living standards. Lithuania acceded to the EU on May 1,
2004 and entered the ERM II mechanism on June 28, 2004, as a prelude to possible euro
adoption by early 2007. The discipline of the Maastricht criteria has added a further policy
anchor to its currency board arrangement. This new anchor is effective because of the wide
political support for euro adoption.
3.
However, the Maastricht quantitative benchmarks are an incomplete guide for
the conduct of Lithuanian policies, and complementary domestic measures are
required. Short-term stability requires greater fiscal conservatism than necessary to meet the
Maastricht budget deficit target, so as to allow for a safety margin if demand slows
unexpectedly and to dampen the stimulating effect of EU funds. Long-term productivity
growth requires important structural reforms, many closely tied to fiscal reform and
modernization. Because fiscal policy is central to achieving stability and growth,
mechanisms to contain competing claims for fiscal resources acquire particular importance.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
A variety of indicators suggest limited slack in the economy. Lithuania’s
impressive growth continued unabated in 2004. GDP expanded by an estimated 6¾ percent
in 2004, driven by vigorous private consumption and investment growth (Figure 2). The
Lithuanian business cycle has tended to move counter to the European cycle (Text Figure 1),
and the recent low interest rates in the euro area have added impetus to the Lithuanian
economy. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing rose in 2004 to some 70 percent, the
highest level since 2000. Labor market, inflation, credit, and current account developments
also reflect demand pressures.

Labor markets have tightened. The unemployment rate is down to 10½ percent
Text Figure 2. Lithuania: Unemployment and Wages
(Text Figure 2). Thus, while skill mismatches
have kept the unemployment rate high in absolute
terms, bottlenecks (in sectors such as construction,
financial intermediation, and transportation) have
contributed to wage inflation. Emigration is
believed to have increased since 2001, and the
expected continuation of this trend will have
important implications for labor supply and
wages.1

Some 200,000 persons—a little over 10 percent of the active workforce–are thought to have
emigrated since the early 1990s. Lithuanian doctors, computer programmers, and
construction workers have been in high demand. As entry restrictions in Europe and the
United States are relaxed, the pace of emigration could further accelerate.

The current account deficit deteriorated in 2004 to about 8½ percent of GDP
(Text Table 2, Table 2, and Figure 4). Because of the greater confidence in the future,
savings rates continued to fall and investment rates continued to rise. While Lithuania had a

The budget deficit increased from 1¾ percent in 2003 to 2¼ percent of GDP in
2004, imparting an expansionary fiscal stance (Table 4). The 2004 widening reflected
higher pension reform costs, discretionary expenditures in the midyear budget and prior to
the elections in November, and end-of-year expenditures on real estate and savings
restitution; EU-related cofinancing expenditures played a smaller-than-anticipated role.
Higher-than-expected personal and corporate income tax revenues helped contain the deficit;
however, receipts from the single largest revenue source, the value-added tax (VAT), fell
short of projections by about 15 percent.

III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES

The authorities reiterated their commitment to early euro adoption, a goal that
staff strongly supported while also urging that attention be paid to challenges that lie
beyond. The authorities expressed

structural issues related to long-term competitiveness.

There was agreement that Lithuania was emerging from a special period of
rapid noninflationary growth and output was now above its potential (Figure 2).
Following its remarkable structural transformation, the path of the Lithuanian economy
remains difficult to predict. The authorities and staff agreed that, given its catch-up potential,
Lithuania could grow in the medium term at annual rates of around 5½–6 percent. Factors
favorable to continued strong growth include Lithuania’s human capital, institutional
preparation, and geographic advantages. While the growth potential may be higher than
5½–6 percent a year, the authorities and staff agreed that short-term policy decisions should
be based on a conservative view of the economy.
12.
Despite the medium-term uncertainties, the economy is expected to continue to
grow strongly in 2005-06, with implications for wage pressures and the current account.
Staff stressed that utilization of EU funds would add significantly to demand pressures in
2005 and GDP growth could reach 7 percent. The authorities had a somewhat lower growth
estimate (6½ percent) but agreed that capacity constraints would be more binding than in the
past and that wage pressures would intensify in certain sectors. Staff estimates that the
current account deficit would widen to 9½ percent in 2005 before declining gradually in the
medium term (Tables 2 and 7).

13.
The authorities thought it unlikely that accelerating inflation could breach the
Maastricht criterion, though they recognized the risk. They took the view that domestic
demand pressures would largely spill over into a larger current account deficit and were
concerned primarily about

however, second-round effects could raise inflation by more than twice as much. Moreover,
staff argued that the role of domestic demand pressures on nontradable goods should not be
minimized. Domestic bottlenecks could raise short-term inflationary expectations and, hence,
the inflation rate above the Maastricht limit.2

pace. With strong growth prospects and financial deepening, private savings have declined
for some years while rising investment rates have stimulated demand for imports of capital
and intermediate goods (Text Table 4, Table 7, and Figure 4). Staff estimates that a current

while a currency board delivers lower inflation due to its high credibility, rapidly adjusting
expectations may increase the risk of accelerating inflation in the short term.

- 14 -

account deficit of 8–9 percent of GDP is consistent with Lithuania’s present income per
capita relative to the EU and its growth prospects (Box 1).
15.
Two sources of external vulnerability were stressed. Staff noted that, with foreign
direct investment at about 3 percent of GDP in the medium term and EU financing around
2–3 percent of GDP, debt-creating flows to close the financing gap would make up
2–3 percent of GDP. Gross external debt is expected to reach about 43 percent and net
external debt some 38 percent of GDP by 2009. While a debt sustainability analysis did not
show a high degree of risk, staff cautioned that external reserves as a ratio of amortizations
had fallen from 87 percent in 2001 to a relatively low 53 percent by end-2004 (Table 8). The
authorities responded that the currency board arrangement had very large buffers (with the
central bank’s net foreign assets at over 140 percent of base money). The amortizations, they
explained, reflected private transactions between Lithuanian and their parent banks overseas,
as well as between exporters and trade credit suppliers.3 A failure to roll over these loans
would set back real activity, but confidence in the litas would be maintained because of the
strong position of the currency board. Moreover, in light of current economic growth
prospects, the authorities considered it unlikely that private loan transactions would not be
rolled over. Vulnerability on account of a possible erosion in competitiveness was also
discussed, as reported below.
B. Fiscal Policy
16.
The authorities viewed their fiscal consolidation effort as representing the
appropriate balance between the need for prudence and the demands for social and
infrastructure spending. In line with their Convergence Program (CP), the authorities noted
that they were targeting a 2½ percent deficit in 2005 and a gradual consolidation thereafter to
1½ percent of GDP in 2007. Between 2004 and 2007, revenues are expected to increase by
1½ percent of GDP. While current expenditures are expected to decline by ¾ percent of
GDP, capital expenditures are to rise by just over 1½ percent of GDP, mainly due to
EU-related investment spending. However, the authorities had not yet finalized specific
measures to achieve the proposed reduction in current expenditures.

3

The banking system comprises ten banks, two foreign bank branches, and three
representative offices of foreign banks. Concentration is high, with three of the largest
banks—all foreign owned—accounting for some 70 percent of assets. The share of banking
capital held by foreign investors is close to 90 percent.

- 15 -

Box 1. Is the Current Account Deficit a Concern? An Intertemporal Perspective
Lithuania’s current account deficit, at 8½ percent of GDP in 2004, is consistent with
predictions of models based on intertemporal considerations. This proposition was tested,
first, using a model of regional income convergence in which relatively poor countries
converge (“catch up”) with the income levels of their richer neighbors. Lower-income
countries can finance their catch-up growth partly via external borrowing. Other things
equal, a relatively low income level should be associated with a larger current account deficit
and higher growth.
Using data on the EU-25 for the 1975–2004 period, a catch-up model predicted Lithuania’s
current account deficit in 2004 to be 9 percent of GDP, compared to the actual deficit of
8½ percent (see selected issues paper).

An alternative approach to assessing the current account deficit is based on a model of
optimal consumption smoothing. Agents respond to an increase in permanent income by
consuming more than their current income, thus raising the current account deficit. The
results once again suggest that Lithuania’s high future income prospects explain its current
account deficit. By this measure, Lithuania’s 2004 current account deficit was projected at
8.1 percent of GDP.
17.
Discussions centered around the ambition of, and risks to, the consolidation
path. First, did projected deficits leave sufficient space for the operation of automatic
stabilizers in the event of a slowdown? Second, the trend decline in revenue/GDP ratios
created the risk that projected revenue increases may not be achieved. Third, the government
had outstanding obligations that would eventually have to be paid. Finally, EU-related
cofinancing expenditures added to the expenditure pressures.
18.
The authorities agreed with staff estimates that the structural, or cyclically
adjusted, deficit had widened to about 3 percent of GDP in 2004. The structural deficit—
which takes into account the favorable cyclical position—is expected to remain at about the

- 16 -

same level in 2005, after the deterioration in 2003–04 (Text Figure 5). Recognizing the
imprecision in the measure of the cyclical position, staff conceded that the structural deficit
could be somewhat lower. However, the main conclusion—that the fiscal stance in 2005 will,
at best, remain neutral—would not change significantly. Moreover, since demand pressures
may well be underestimated, staff argued

below 2 percent could be attained simply
by saving additional revenues; an even lower deficit could be achieved by also cutting
expenditures. In either case, a discretionary opening of the budget at midyear would be
undesirable. The authorities agreed with the thrust of the analysis but judged that, in view of
expenditure compression in several areas and increased cofinancing needs in 2005, more
consolidation may be difficult to achieve.
19.
The authorities recognized risks
to the budget from the declining
revenue ratio and outstanding
obligations. They noted that the tax
reform of 2002–03 had helped, but tax
loopholes, exemptions, and weaknesses
in tax administration were the principal
factors behind the declining revenue ratio
(Text Figure 6).5 Staff observed that

Revenue data for 2004 show a strong performance for income and profit taxes (with a
107 percent execution rate). However, receipts from indirect taxes other than the VAT (the
pollution tax, other excise duties, and taxes on international trade transactions) were
relatively weak.

- 17 -

could only partially be explained by one-off changes related to EU accession since the
VAT/GDP ratio had experienced a secular decline since 1998. The authorities acknowledged
that differentiated VAT tax rates had made tax administration more difficult, while also
distorting the incentives for resource allocation. With respect to claims on the budget, they
recognized that the cost of pension reform had risen, owing to better-than-anticipated
participation in the second pillar. Repayments on account of the real estate and savings
restitution obligations, the authorities noted, would be undertaken in a way that was
consistent with current fiscal plans and prevailing macroeconomic conditions.6

Restitution payments amounted to some 1 percent of GDP in 2004; the authorities plan to
spend an additional ½ percent of GDP in 2005. See IMF Country Report No. 03/55 for a
detailed description of the savings and land restitution programs. Obligations under these
programs and those due to VAT refunds add up to about 6½ percent of GDP.

Among the new member states of the EU, Lithuania is likely to receive the highest
assistance per capita (for 2004–06, €895 million from Structural Funds and €543 from the
Cohesion Fund, and smaller amounts for specific functions, including the decommissioning
of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant).

- 18 -

C. Fiscal Reforms and Modernization
21.
The authorities were mindful of the high tax on labor and discussed their plan to
gradually lower the personal income (PIT) rate. The PIT and the employee and employer
pension contributions add up to one of the highest statutory rates and tax wedges among
European economies.8 This is not compatible with the need to include a larger fraction of the
population in the labor force and to remain competitive in international markets (Box 2).
Staff supported the authorities’ plan to lower the marginal rate from its current high of
33 percent. The authorities and staff agreed on the importance of introducing a tax reform
package that maintained revenue neutrality and kept Lithuania’s fiscal consolidation effort on
track.
22.
Several possibilities were discussed for making up revenues lost on account of
lower PIT rates. An immediate loss of some 1.1 percent of GDP of revenue from a lowering
of the PIT rate to 25 percent could be partly offset through revenues from a new property tax
(0.2 percent of GDP) and abolition of most income tax and VAT exemptions (which could
amount to an additional

23.
Staff pointed to areas where improved public expenditure design and
management would achieve greater transparency and control. Government expenditures
and cash flows are not documented in sufficient detail to allow for efficient fiscal
management. In particular, contingencies and buffers for dealing with an unexpected
requirement to reduce government expenditures are not explicitly identified. Therefore, if
such a reduction were needed, economically valuable capital expenditures would be most
likely to suffer. In conjunction with a technical assistance mission from the Fiscal Affairs

Box 2. The Labor Market in Lithuania
In many respects, the Lithuanian labor market functions well. Continuing enterprise
restructuring ensures high rates of job creation and turnover. Labor market institutions are, in
general, flexible, with the significant exception of the tight regulation of working hours,
which limits the use of part-time and overtime work.
The high tax wedge on labor income reduces work incentives and raises labor costs. The
combination of personal income tax and employee social security contributions for a typical
worker may be as high as 36 percent of gross salary, and employer social contributions and
payroll taxes can add another 31 percent to labor costs.
The minimum wage, now close to 50 percent of the average gross salary, covers about
18 percent of workers, although these figures may be exaggerated by the underreporting of
wages to avoid payment of tax and social security contributions. The 16 percent increase of
the minimum wage in May 2004 was partly motivated by the goal of making work more
attractive. However, this appears to have misread the unemployment problem as arising
largely from low incentives to supply labor.
The high minimum wage is viewed as compensating for the absence of targeted income
support. However, a countrywide uniform minimum wage aggravates the difficulties of
poorer regions, which already suffer on account of low territorial mobility, contributing to
the persistence of significant regional disparities and further straining the capacity of poorer
municipalities to provide social assistance.
Department, staff urged consolidation of various government accounts into a single account
and adoption of improved methods for cash control and budget planning. The authorities
welcomed these suggestions.
24.
Staff proposed measures to achieve more effective decentralization. Another
accompanying technical assistance mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department commented
that municipal finances were too dependent on transfers from the state budget. The
authorities pointed to the likely introduction of a property tax which would broaden the
revenue base of municipalities and increase incentives for efficient operation. They noted
that the borrowing framework for municipalities had strengthened in recent years, but staff
proposed more consistency between borrowing limits and repayment capacity. To limit the
liability of the central government, a formal bankruptcy procedure for municipalities could
be introduced. Staff also recommended reducing substantially the number of targeted grants
and strengthening capacity for financial management at the municipality level.
25.
The authorities and staff agreed that further reforms were needed to improve
the financial viability of the social safety and health systems. The authorities recognized
that the recent reform of the pension system did not guarantee its long-term viability (Box 3).
They agreed also on the need to sharpen the focus, reduce the gaps, and raise the quality of
the numerous social assistance programs. They pointed to the move toward more targeted

- 20 -

Box 3. The Viability and Efficiency of the Social Security System
Despite recent reform, the viability of the pension system is not ensured. Between 2015
and 2060, the dependency ratio will almost double as the active population shrinks by about
30 percent. Moreover, the authorities have set the ambitious goal of raising the income
replacement ratio to 60 percent by 2010. Following the introduction of a voluntary second
pillar in 2004 (funded by 2.5 percent of social security contributions, to increase gradually to
5.5 percent in 2007), the transition costs worsen the financial balance until 2040, but
improve it thereafter. Under current policies, the first pillar deficit will stabilize somewhat
below 3 percent of GDP between 2050 and 2060. A gradual increase in the retirement age by
2020 to 65 years for both men and women will reduce the first pillar deficit to about
1 percent of GDP.

Social assistance is not well targeted. Income testing is limited. “Categorical” benefits,
given regardless of the income status of the beneficiary, amount to some 1 percent of GDP,
half of which are provided to families with children. At the same time, the long-term
unemployed are not adequately protected, and social assistance that will not compromise
work incentives may be needed. The 2004 laws on child benefits and support of low-income
families are steps in the right direction.
support, with new laws on child benefits and family income support, but acknowledged that
more progress was needed (Box 3). They were especially aware of the need to restructure
hospitals to reduce overcapacity and to impose stricter expenditure controls on
pharmaceuticals and other consumables. Staff noted that the 2005 budget of the Health
Insurance Fund did not adequately restrain expenditures.

- 21 -

26.
To consolidate the full range of tax and expenditure reforms, and to limit the
political competition for resources, staff recommended the adoption of a Fiscal
Responsibility Act. Such an act could encompass detailed rules on budget execution and
fiscal targets, rules outlining revenue forecasting and revisions, regulations permitting only
revenue-neutral tax reforms, and limits on public debt and credit operations.9 The rules
would enhance transparency and clarity in fiscal policymaking, while underpinning the
implementation of commitments vis-à-vis the EU. Parliamentarians and the government
showed considerable interest in the proposal.
D. Competitiveness and Other Structural Issues
27.
In light of the fixed parity of the litas vis-à-vis the euro, discussions focused on
the real effective exchange rate and the recent decline in export growth. The real
effective exchange rate based on the

exports since 2003 reflected, in part, a
fall in exports of transport equipment
to Russia following changes in the tariff structure in October 2002. However, staff expressed
concern since even excluding transport equipment, exports have trended down since 2000,
though the short time period does not allow a definitive assessment (Text Figure 7). The
authorities acknowledged the effect of competition from lower-wage economies, but noted
that Lithuanian companies continued to move up the “quality ladder.”10 The share of
Lithuanian exports in total world imports has continued to edge upward (Figure 5). Overall,
the authorities viewed Lithuania’s exchange rate as consistent with fundamentals. Staff

Encouragingly, Lithuania has diversified toward higher-value-added goods. While exports
of unprocessed wood products declined, those of furniture increased. The share of transport
equipment and machinery and electrical equipment in Lithuanian exports has risen sharply.
Moreover, exporters have enjoyed increasing profit margins over the past five years.

calculations (based on a framework incorporating the Balassa-Samuelson effect within a
balance of payments approach) suggest that the real exchange rate is close to its equilibrium
value. While export trends indicate increased competitive pressures, recent history suggests
that Lithuanian exporters have responded to such challenges.
28.
Private sector representatives praised improvements in the business
environment but pointed to areas where further progress was needed. Lithuania has
made significant strides in improving its business climate but remains behind leaders such as
Ireland (Box 4). In addition to the widespread concern with regard to labor taxes, the
restrictions on the use of flexible employment contracts were highlighted as a constraint, as
was the regulation and compensation premium for overtime work (Box 2). The business
environment remains challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which
have to deal with complex and time-consuming regulations, especially those related to land
use and construction. The authorities noted plans to use EU funds to support SMEs. Private
sector representatives and the authorities highlighted the importance of deregulating the
health and education sectors to stem the emigration of highly skilled, but underpaid, public
sector workers and to improve the quality of these services. Finally, authorities observed that
privatization was almost complete, with only the National Railway, the Eastern Distribution
Company, and Lithuanian Air remaining under government ownership.11
29.
The authorities recognized that rapid growth was driving demand for credit but
were confident that the expansion would not compromise the stability of the financial
sector, which was well cushioned and well regulated. Though no serious vulnerabilities
were revealed by the 2002 FSAP and the 2003 update, the mission discussed recent credit
trends and foreign currency exposure of the banking system (the share of foreign currency
loans in total loans was 59 percent as of end-2004 (Table 6)). The authorities are closely
monitoring credit expansion and have stepped up supervision both on- and off-site, while
cooperating with supervisors from Nordic countries. Although specific loan provisioning by
banks has not kept up with the growth in credit, the authorities pointed out that the share of
nonperforming loans had declined significantly and bank profitability was strong (Table 6).
They noted that the foreign currency exposure of the banking system was natural, given the
move toward the euro. Moreover, the ratio of the banks’ net open position in foreign
currencies (other than the euro) to total capital remains below the Bank of Lithuania’s
25 percent aggregate limit. Staff observed that foreign currency exposure of enterprise and
household balance sheets, though in the same range over the past few years, had increased
somewhat in the past year. In line with the FSAP recommendations, the mission emphasized
the value of encouraging specific loan provisioning and maintaining a forward-looking
perspective on currency exposure developments.

Privatization receipts are expected to be 1/3 percent of GDP in 2005.

Box 4. Real Convergence with EU: Some Comparative Lessons
Lithuania’s per capita GDP stands at some 40 percent of the EU average. This presents a
large catch-up possibility with the potential of annual growth rates of about 5½ percent.
However, to achieve that potential—and, perhaps, to exceed it—requires a strong business
environment that encourages investment and productivity enhancement.
A comparison with the recent experience of Ireland and Greece is instructive. During the
1990s, while Ireland grew by about 7 percent a year, Greece grew at a more modest pace of
about 2 percent. A recent comparative study (IMF Country Report No. 05/43) attributes
Ireland’s success in large part to the reform of public finances—particularly expenditure
control—which allowed reductions in tax rates while removing tax loopholes and
consolidating expenditures. Greece’s continued high tax rates reduced competitiveness, and
its fiscal policy magnified economic cycles, which slowed real convergence with the EU.
Greece was also handicapped by a weaker business climate, resulting from rigidities in the
labor market, excessive regulation, and infrastructure and judicial system inadequacies.
Lithuania has demonstrated the capacity to influence how fast it moves toward the living
standards of advanced economies. Despite a per capita income just over 55 percent of
Greece’s, Lithuania has equaled or moved ahead in some dimensions of business climate and
development (Box Table below). Sustained efforts to move closer to Irish levels of business
climate indicators should provide a sizable growth dividend.

The authorities expressed concern about energy security. While adequate
supplies exist to meet domestic demand for electric power following the closure of the first
unit of the Ignalina nuclear power plant on December 31, 2004, the closure does reduce
electric power exports. The authorities are exploring access to additional sources of power to
achieve greater energy security.
31.
Mazeikiu Nafta, the Lithuanian oil refinery, has not yet been affected by the
financial difficulties of Yukos, one of its principal owners. Mazeikiu relies on a
Yukos-controlled pipeline for the delivery of the oil that it refines. Despite the financial
reorganization of Yukos, supplies have been maintained, and the refinery has been operating
at a higher-than-normal capacity utilization rate. The new owner of Mazeikiu is expected to
maintain supplies. The authorities expect that, in the event of a temporary disruption,
alternative but more expensive supplies will be available.
32.
Upon accession to the EU, Lithuania adopted the EU’s common commercial and
agricultural policy. Lithuania has applied all EU bilateral trade agreements, the common
external tariff, and the EU trade defense measures. Since Lithuania’s trade regime has
gradually changed to conform with EU standards, accession with the EU will not in itself
have a major impact on Lithuanian or global trade.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Lithuania’s impressive growth can continue, but the strategy needs to adapt to
the changed circumstances. The plan for early euro adoption appears solidly on course. To
further reduce the risk of breaching Maastricht limits and to achieve successful economic
performance following euro adoption, three areas deserve priority. First, greater attention
than in the past is required to deal with short-term risks. Second, a forceful fiscal
modernization will improve government efficiency and augment private incentives to
increase employment and enhance productivity. Finally, a broader set of structural reforms
will be required to sustain external competitiveness.
34.
Short-term risks need monitoring. Though high or persistent inflation is highly
unlikely, the temporary breaching of the demanding Maastricht inflation criterion cannot be
ruled out. From a medium-term perspective, the size of the current account deficit is within
the range implied by underlying fundamentals. However, the large size of the current account
deficit remains a concern in view of the relatively high rollover requirements of short-term
debt and risks of shifts in capital market sentiments.
35.
Current conditions call for more ambitious fiscal restraint than required by the
Maastricht criteria. With all indicators suggesting that output will remain above potential in
2005, continued fiscal stimulus would add to inflationary pressures and to the current account
deficit, without contributing to long-term growth. Under the authorities’ growth projection,
the 2005 deficit is targeted at 2.5 percent of GDP. Expenditure reduction to achieve a deficit
lower than 2 percent and a faster consolidation thereafter would aid stability and
medium-term growth. Expenditure cuts of some ½ percent of GDP are feasible, particularly

- 26 -

in the areas of goods and services, public sector wages, and health. The staff’s higher growth
projection suggests that a deficit of under 2 percent is likely even without the expenditure
cuts, although these would remain desirable for countercyclical reasons. A midyear
reopening of the budget to allow additional expenditures should be avoided. With the
deployment of EU funds for enhancing agricultural productivity and EU income transfers to
farmers, the need for additional topping-up payments to farmers is reduced.
36.
Tax reforms are needed to reduce exemptions, lower rates, and improve
administration. The importance of VAT revenues calls for renewed efforts to improve
collection. The reduction in the marginal rate of the PIT has deservedly been on the
government’s agenda. On balance, staff views as appropriate creating a single lower rate,
while maintaining the current exemption threshold. The unification of the rate would broaden
the tax base and help raise additional revenues. The rate reduction should be phased in with
appropriate complementary measures to minimize the impact on revenue. Staff concurs with
the authorities’ proposal to institute a more wide-ranging property tax.
37.
Reforms of public expenditure need to be guided by several objectives. First,
greater transparency and control are essential. Second, more effective decentralization will
improve efficiency of operations. And third, the social protection system—including the
pension system, social assistance programs, and the health sector—needs further attention,
with a view to improving effectiveness and achieving financial viability.
38.
To ensure that these long-term fiscal reforms are undertaken and maintained,
the government should consider proposing a Fiscal Responsibility Act to parliament.
With a currency board already providing discipline to monetary policy and the commitment
to the Convergence Program guiding the medium-term fiscal objectives, adoption of such an
act by parliament would provide a comprehensive and transparent framework for efficiently
conducting fiscal policy at all levels of government and ensure the credibility of fiscal
commitments.
39.
The expansion of credit needs monitoring. The mainly foreign-owned Lithuanian
banking system has a relatively low credit-to-GDP ratio and maintains adequate protection
from shocks; the regulation and supervision of banking and securities markets are well
developed. However, the trend growth in consumer borrowing (without an accompanying
step-up in specific loan provisioning) and significant foreign currency exposure of the private
sector require close monitoring of credit quality to track vulnerabilities. An FSAP update
under consideration would examine these issues.
40.
While Lithuania has acquired important competitive strengths, structural
reforms necessary to raise export growth and ensure efficient investment should be
accelerated. The recent decline in export growth may well turn out to be temporary
following a period of robust growth. But in light of the fixed parity of the litas vis-à-vis the
euro and upward pressure on prices, early steps could prevent the emergence of a
competitiveness problem. Besides lower labor taxes, specific steps that could help include
introducing greater flexibility in short-term labor contracts, easing construction and land use

- 27 -

regulations, fostering SMEs through EU business development funds, and deregulating the
health and education sectors.
41.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Lithuania be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ From 2000 onward, five new extrabudgetary funds, which had not been reported before, were added.
2/ From 2001 onward, fees paid to educational establishments and their spending (LTL128 million) were added to general government operations.
3/ From 2002 onward, fees paid by trucks crossing the borders of the country were added. In addition, following the new organic budget law, revenue
of state institutions for provided services was included in municipal budget.
4/ Grants from EU and related expenditures are not included prior to 2002.
5/ For 2001, current expenditure and nonbank financing include LTL72 million of pharmaceutical arrears rescheduled in December 2001 (according to
the definition in IMF Country Report No. 02/8. The entire amount was repaid in March 2002 through a commercial bank loan contracted by the Health
Insurance Fund. The latter operations are recorded in 2002Q1 as domestic bank borrowing for LTL 72 million, and amortization to the nonbank sector
by the same amount. The terms of the loan include repayments in eight equal tranches of LTL 9 million, starting in 2003, with the final payment due on
December 31, 2006.
6/ The early repurchase on January 2, 2003 lowered the 2003 budgeted deficit by SDR 39.244 million, everything else being equal, as this amount, which was previously on-lent to
the monetary authorities, is treated as a repayment in net lending.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ Includes preliminary data as well as estimates.

1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline level plus a two percent shock in 2005. The shock dies out gradually over 2006-2009.
2. Real GDP growth is at baseline level minus a four percent shock in 2005. The shock dies out gradually over 2006-2009.
3. Change in US dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus a one percent shock in 2005. The shock dies out gradually over 2006-2009.
4. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus a three percent shock in 2005. The shock dies out gradually over 2006-2009.
5. Combination of 1-4: all shocks.
6. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2005.

APPENDIX II

LITHUANIA: STATUS OF STATISTICAL DATABASE
42.
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are generally of sufficiently good
quality to support economic analysis. However, frequent and large revisions of national
accounts data, though necessary for improving the accuracy and reliability of the data, tend to
complicate the analysis of economic developments.
43.
In general, the data are available on a timely basis, and the authorities have given the
staff ready access to all available data (see the attached matrix). An IFS page for Lithuania
was introduced in December 1995. Lithuania meets the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) specifications for coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the data, and for the
dissemination of the advance release calendars. Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard in May 1996, and its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the Internet since April 1997. A
significant amount of information is now available on various websites through the Internet
(see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below).
National Accounts
44.
The national accounts are compiled by the Department of Statistics (DOS) in
accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95).
Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled both from the
production and expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to be
more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical
discrepancies between these two estimates are shown in the published figures as the
discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. Good data sources and
sound methods are used, in general, for the compilation of the national accounts, but
difficulties remain in measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These latter
estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic activity using fixed coefficients derived
from a benchmark survey conducted in 1996. The base year for the fixed price series was
changed to 2000 in early 2003.
Price Data
45.
Since December 1998, the CPI weights have been updated each year. The monthly
CPI is available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index
is calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every
year.

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

Public Finance
46.
Data on the central government budget execution are available quarterly, although
these data are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is expected to
improve fiscal data quality substantially. The budget data are only compiled on a cash basis;
compilation of the budget data on an accrual basis would allow for better monitoring of
arrears and facilitate forecasting of future budgetary flows. Monthly and quarterly data on
consolidated central government are still on the different recording bases and they are not
reconciled; MoF plans to introduce unified recording/accounting based on actual expenditure
(not allocations that is the case in monthly data now) in 2005. Further work is needed to
clarify the treatment of public health care providers and of EU transactions, and the
consolidation procedure for government operations. Monthly and quarterly data on the
consolidated central government are not reconciled because they are on different recording
bases. A new classification, incorporating the GFSM2001, was approved in mid-2003.
Money and Banking
47.
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA
on a timely and regular basis. However, there is room to improve the consistency between
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and statistical methodology employed in
such areas as the analytical accounts of the banking sector.
External Sector
48.
The BoL is responsible for compiling the balance of payments, the international
investment position, the external debt and the international reserves statistics. The BoL
compiles balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis using the format recommended
in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). In 1999, BoL set in motion plans
to develop and produce monthly balance of payments statistics to meet the requirements of
the European Central Bank following Lithuania's application for membership of the EU and,
subsequently, of the euro area. Hence, in addition to quarterly balance of payments data, the
BoL has started publishing monthly balance of payments statistics since January 2002. The
monthly data correspond to several key balance of payments components, compiled on the
basis of a sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some
nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated according to the operational guidelines and is
hyperlinked to the Fund’s DSBB.

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

Dissemination of Statistics
49.
The Lithuanian authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the DOS's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments,
and the BoL's monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:
•
Lithuania’s metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data
Dissemination Standard are posted on the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);
•
The BoL website (http://www.lbank.lt) provides data on monetary statistics,
treasury bill auction results, balance of payments, the international investment
position, and main economic indicators;
•
The DOS website (http://www.std.lt) provides quarterly information on
economic and social development indicators;
•
The Ministry of Finance (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on
the national budget, as well as information on laws and privatization; and
•
The National Stock Exchange website (http://www.nse.lt) has information on
stock trading.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Lithuania
On March, 23, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
Following severe economic difficulties in 1999, Lithuania accelerated its efforts to make a transition
towards a competitive market economy. Lithuania acceded to the European Union on May 1, 2004
and entered ERM II on June 28, 2004, as a prelude to possible euro adoption by early 2007. With
its accession to the EU, Lithuania has now embarked on another ambitious transition, this time to
advanced European living standards. The discipline of the Maastricht criteria has added a further
policy anchor to its existing currency board arrangement. This additional anchor is important and
effective because of the wide political support for euro adoption.
Impressive growth continued unabated in 2004. GDP expanded by an estimated 6¾ percent in
2004, driven by vigorous private consumption and investment growth. The unemployment rate
declined to 10½ percent of the labor force but bottlenecks have developed in certain sectors,
exacerbated by migration flows to the EU and the United States. Inflation remained low, with the
consumer price index reaching 1¼ percent in 2004. However, increases in excise taxes and
energy prices, coupled with strong demand, caused inflation to accelerate rapidly in the second
half of the year.
The current account deficit widened in 2004 to about 8½ percent of GDP owing to a deterioration
of the trade balance of some 1 percent of GDP. Larger dividends and repatriated earnings on past

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the Executive Board discussion
based on the staff report.

-2foreign direct investment aggravated the negative income balance, which also worsened by
1½ percent of GDP in 2004.
With strong economic growth and low interest rates, credit expanded rapidly in 2004. Early in the
year, the speed of credit expansion briefly touched 70 percent on an annual basis before coming
down to a still high 40 percent. Credit to households expanded at a more rapid rate than to the
enterprise sector; however, the bulk of the credit continued to be absorbed by the productive
enterprises.
The budget deficit widened appreciably from 1¾ percent in 2003 to 2¼ percent of GDP in 2004,
imparting an expansionary fiscal stance. The widening reflected higher-than-expected pension
reform costs, discretionary expenditures in the midyear budget and prior to the elections in
November, and end-of-year spending on savings and real estate restitution; EU-related cofinancing
expenditures played a smaller-than-anticipated role. Higher-than-expected personal and corporate
income tax revenues helped contain the deficit; however, the single largest source of revenue, the
value-added tax provided receipts that fell short of projections by about 15 percent.
Structural reforms continued in 2004, but deeper reforms remain necessary to keep Lithuania on a
real convergence path with the EU. Further changes are needed to improve the financial viability of
the social safety and health systems, and to enhance the focus, reduce the gaps, and raise the
quality of the numerous social assistance programs. EU funds should be used effectively to help
restructure the agricultural sector, and more generally to enhance the supply side of the economy.
Continued efforts to make the economy more competitive by improving the business climate are
also called for.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors complimented the Lithuanian authorities for the implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. These efforts have helped achieve a lasting
transformation of the economy, rapid growth, and low inflation, paving the way to EU accession
and continued prosperity. Directors welcomed Lithuania’s entry into ERM II and noted that the
economy appears broadly on course to meet the Maastricht criteria and adopt the euro in
early 2007.
Directors cautioned, however, that challenges remain for both the near- and the long term.
A variety of indicators suggest limited slack in the economy. The current account deficit has
widened appreciably in 2004 and is forecast to deteriorate further. Inflation, though low, has
accelerated, and domestic bottlenecks and higher oil prices could raise the inflation rate
temporarily above the Maastricht limit. In addition, a key long-term challenge is to ensure the
implementation of reforms aimed at continued high productivity growth.
With indicators suggesting that output will remain above potential in 2005, an expansionary fiscal
stance could add to inflationary pressures and the current account deficit. Short-term stability
requires a more cautious fiscal policy than that contemplated by the authorities to allow for
automatic stabilizers to operate, and Directors encouraged the authorities to build a safety margin
to be used in the event of a slowdown. In this connection, a mid-year reopening of the budget to
allow additional expenditures should be avoided, and a few Directors suggested that there is room
for cutbacks in current expenditure.

-3Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to lower the personal income tax rate so as to improve
incentives to raise employment and productivity. However, they emphasized that tax cuts should
be phased in together with complementary measures so as not to jeopardize fiscal consolidation.
In this context, the proposals to reduce tax exemptions, introduce a more wide-ranging property
tax, and improve tax administration were seen as appropriate steps.
Directors noted that public expenditure reforms should be undertaken at both the central and local
government levels, aimed at increasing transparency and control. They emphasized that the social
protection system—including pensions, social assistance programs, and the health sector—
needed further attention, with a view to improving their effectiveness and ensuring financial
viability.
Directors supported the staff’s proposal for enacting a Fiscal Responsibility Act. This, together with
the currency board and the commitment to the Convergence Program, would provide a
comprehensive and transparent framework for efficiently implementing fiscal policy at all levels of
government within a multi-year setting.
While recognizing that an expansion of the deficit could be expected during the income
convergence process, some Directors expressed concern about the widening of the current
account deficit in the context of the relatively high rollover requirements of short-term debt, and
risks of shifts in capital market sentiments. They emphasized the importance of close monitoring of
the current account and its financing, and of the need to promote additional flows of FDI.
Directors noted that the regulation and supervision of banking and securities markets are well
developed. They recognized that the mainly foreign-owned banking system has a low credit-toGDP ratio and maintains adequate protection from shocks. However, Directors stressed that the
trend growth in consumer borrowing and significant foreign currency exposure of the private sector
require close monitoring of credit quality to track vulnerabilities. They encouraged the authorities to
proceed with an FSAP update, which would examine these issues.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms necessary to support
increased productivity, competitiveness, and long-run growth. In addition to lowering labor taxes,
the authorities should take specific steps to introduce greater flexibility in short-term labor
contracts, improve training, and ease construction and land use regulations. It will also be
important to improve the business environment by fostering small and medium-sized enterprises
through EU business development funds, as well as by promoting Research and Development and
innovation, and deregulating the health and education sectors.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Republic of Lithuania
and Giedrius Sidlauskas, Advisor to Executive Director
March 23, 2005

On behalf of our Lithuanian authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to the staff
for the constructive discussions in Vilnius and for an interesting and useful set of papers for
the 2004 Article IV consultation. Though the authorities broadly share staff’s analysis and
recommendations, their latest official growth forecasts are more cautious than staff’s with
important consequences for the assessment of the fiscal policy stance.
Following a prolonged period with stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and far
reaching structural reforms, Lithuania became member of the European Union on
May 1, 2004, making this the first Article IV consultation with Lithuania as an EU member.
The authorities take an active part in the current activities of the EU, and bring an example of
rapid reforms and flexibility. Over a very short period of time, Lithuania had to harmonize
laws with EU legislation and rebuild the economy in order to be able to operate under free
market conditions. This required political will and flexibility, as well as determination of the
Lithuanian people to accept difficult and sometimes painful reforms.
While one important milepost has been passed with the EU membership, our authorities are
well aware that this achievement is not reason for complacency and that many challenges lay
ahead, including important short-term risks as noted by staff. The Lithuanian authorities
remain fully committed to ensure continued rapid real and nominal convergence with the
economic and social standards of the EU. Above all, the Lithuanian authorities are firmly
committed to ensure policies consistent with their objective of joining the Euro Area by
January 1, 2007, as further elaborated in the January 2005 update of the convergence
program of Lithuania.
Growth in Lithuania has remained brisk, resulting in continued catching up with the Euro
Area average. In 2003, growth reached one of the highest levels in the world - 9.7 percent and in 2004 settled to a level closer to the long-term growth potential with 6.7 percent
growth. The authorities have taken a prudent stance in projecting future GDP growth and
adjusted fiscal policy accordingly to preserve their fiscal consolidation targets. The
macroeconomic scenario in the authorities’ updated convergence program from January 2005
shows real GDP growth of 6.5 percent in 2005 and a slightly decelerating growth thereafter
to 6 percent in 2007, whereas staff, as noted in their report, expects even stronger growth,
that could reach 7 percent in 2005. Further economic growth is expected to be supported by
robust domestic demand and some fiscal stimulus due to government co-financing of
transfers from the EU, which are projected in the order of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2005 and
4.4 percent of GDP in 2006. The ECOFIN Council in its opinion of March 8, 2005 found the
authorities’ macroeconomic scenario to reflect plausible growth assumptions.

-2-

Fiscal Policy
The key objective of the medium-term fiscal strategy is the approximation to a cyclically
balanced general government budget in line with the principles of the Stability and Growth
Pact.
Preliminary figures show a general government deficit in 2004 of 2.5 percent of GDP, i.e.
lower than the 2.7 percent budgeted in May 2004, thanks to better than expected revenues. At
the same time, our authorities have decided to maintain their deficit targets for 2005-07,
despite the downward revision of GDP growth, thereby emphasizing the importance they
attach to continued ambitious fiscal restraint. The authorities foresee the general government
deficit to remain at 2.5 percent of GDP in 2005 and to decline gradually to 1.8 percent in
2006 and 1.5 percent in 2007. Consolidation is planned to be achieved mainly by a continued
increase of revenues from a low base and, from 2005, also the expenditure side contributes.
A significant public investment program is being implemented, which lifts public
investments from 3.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 5 percent in 2007.
Our authorities very much appreciate the constructive dialogue with staff on fiscal policy
challenges and staff’s useful specific advice, including from the Fiscal Affairs Department.
While being in broad agreement with staff’s recommendations, our authorities would like to
emphasize that a possibly higher GDP growth rate, as expected by staff, does not necessarily
make it easier to implement the necessary strict fiscal consolidation policy. Too optimistic
GDP growth and public revenue projections could complicate their efforts to introduce
measures to compensate for an abolishment of the Road Tax and provide room for future cuts
in personal income taxes. Lower taxes are seen as important in order to suppress Lithuania’s
shadow economy and provide better conditions for the implementation of the authorities’
social policy.
In case growth would be stronger than projected due to higher EU transfers, additional
pressure would be put on the fiscal deficit reduction efforts as the government would incur
higher co-financing expenditures that cannot be compensated for through higher tax
revenues.
In assessing the overall soundness of fiscal policy, due account must be devoted to the public
debt, which declined to 19.7 percent of GDP in 2004, with long-term debt accounting for
94 percent of the debt. In the medium term, general government debt should settle at about
20 percent of GDP. Government debt guarantees have stayed at about 2 percent of GDP and
are expected to decline to 1.2 percent of GDP over the medium term. No guarantees on new
loans have been issued since 2003. As a further element of prudent fiscal policy, the
government has accumulated funds in the Stability Fund corresponding to 1.7 percent of
GDP, which could be drawn upon in case of need to cover the government’s liabilities in the
event of unattractive borrowing conditions in the financial markets. The authorities are fully
aware that to prepare for an ageing population is important in their fiscal planning. However,
the relatively low debt ratio and a successful introduction of a third pension pillar puts
Lithuania in a relatively good position to address these and other social policy challenges.

-3-

The authorities are ready to maintain the good track record in meeting fiscal targets and to
redistribute expenditures to meet budget deficit limits in case co-financing of the EU projects
will require more funds than allocated in the budget. The authorities are committed to follow
the EU Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) and to direct extra budgetary revenues
for further reduction of the fiscal deficit. Above all, they are fully committed to a fiscal
policy stance consistent with their objective of joining the Euro Area in 2007. They are
cognizant that to achieve a high degree of sustainable convergence, it will be necessary to
ensure a sound fiscal consolidation path and an environment conducive to price stability.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Lithuania joined ERM II at the end of June 2004. Following a careful assessment by the
ERM II authorities, it was supported that Lithuania would join the exchange rate mechanism
with the standard fluctuation band, but with its existing currency board in place as a
unilateral commitment. The experience of more than a decade of fixed exchange rate policy
proved that a fixed exchange rate is a valuable anchor for macroeconomic stability and noninflationary economic growth.
The litas has not deviated from its central rate vis-à-vis the euro, and the continued high
confidence in the exchange rate policy is reflected in low and relatively stable interest rate
differentials to the Euro Area. In fact, the short-term interest rate differential against the three
month EURIBOR has been small and continued to decline since the ERM II entry (from
almost 0.6 to around 0.4 percentage points at the end-2004). Long-term interest rates of
relevance for the convergence assessment have been below 5 percent since ERM II entry,
and have stayed significantly below the reference value for the interest rate convergence
criteria. Furthermore, the recent eleven-year Eurobond issue was heavily oversubscribed with
a record low interest rate and a yield spread of only 22 basispoints above comparable
German government securities. Taken together, these indicators are clear evidence of
financial markets’ high confidence in the authorities’ commitment to a continued strong
macroeconomic track record.
The authorities recognize that also legal changes for the central bank are necessary before
Lithuania can join the Euro Area. In December 2004, the Bank of Lithuania approved an
action plan with respect to the adoption of the euro covering the next two years, including an
outline of the necessary measures for the alignment of the legal framework.
Our authorities concur with staff that short term risks concerning inflation need close
monitoring. They stand ready to adjust economic policies as appropriate to maintain an
environment conducive to price stability consistent with their objective of joining the Euro
Area in 2007. The continuous boom of oil prices, rising food prices and changes in
administered prices, as well as adjustment of indirect taxes to promote convergence within
the EU, led to a reversal of an almost two-year period with negative inflation. Inflation
through 2004 is estimated at 2.9 percent (average annual inflation 1.2 percent) and is
forecasted to stay at 2.9 percent in 2005, before declining to 2.5 percent in 2006 according to
the convergence program. In February 2005, inflation reached 3.3 per cent amid rising oil
prices, which influenced relatively strongly Lithuania’s price developments. The latter is
partly due to the fact that the weight of energy items in Lithuania’s HICP is almost two times

-4-

bigger than the corresponding average in the EU. At the same time, other factors are
expected to put downward pressure on inflation over the medium term, including increased
competition in the telecommunication sector and the retail sector. This reflects continued
integration in the EU markets and continued strong productivity growth in line with
significant flows of FDI and strong domestic investments. Moreover, a high degree of
decentralization of the Lithuanian labor market and relatively high wage flexibility should
diminish the risks of second round effects of unfavorable one-off price hikes.
External Sector
The current account deficit increased from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated
8.3 percent of GDP in 2004 due to rapid growth in consumer demand and investments. The
authorities recognize that the size of the current account deficit needs close monitoring. They
also agree with staff that the level of the current account deficit are within the range implied
by the underlying fundamentals and can be explained by the rapid catching up of the
economy. While staff has emphasized risks of shift in capital market sentiments, the
authorities would like to underscore that the current account deficit to a significant extent is
financed by debt-neutral sources, such as foreign direct investments and EU transfers.
Furthermore, a significant share (about 70 percent) of the short-term debt is made up of loans
from parent foreign banks to their banks in Lithuania. Moreover, Lithuania’s net external
debt level remains relatively low – at about 33 percent of GDP.
Some Structural Issues
The banking sector has remained sound and profitable and supervision prudent. However,
our authorities agree with staff that credit expansion needs continued close monitoring.
Credit growth in banking has remained robust driven by low interest rates and high demand
for housing credit, although the increase of lending by banks slowed from 53 percent in 2003
to 40 percent in 2004. At the same time, loan provisions increased slightly, mainly due to
stricter regulations. The authorities look forward to a forthcoming FSAP update.
Affected by the strong growth and an active employment promotion policy, unemployment
has declined steadily. Registered unemployment declined by 1.3 percentage points to
6.8 percent in 2004. Data from the much more comprehensive employment survey shows a
similar trend with unemployment falling from 12.4 percent in 2003 to 11.4 percent in 2004.
The problem of structural unemployment due to skill mismatches has remained, with some
economy sectors having started to feel shortages of labor.
The government has set a plan to restructure and develop health care institutions with the
support of the EU Structural Fund. The personal healthcare network is being streamlined as
well as the network of the specialized healthcare institutions. The authorities also envisage
coherent measures to ensure a more efficient use of energy resources, thus reducing reliance
on imported oil products for domestic use.
