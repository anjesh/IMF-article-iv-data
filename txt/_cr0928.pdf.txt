EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During the policy discussions, there was a broad concurrence of views between staff and the
authorities on inflation, the financial sector, and exchange rate issues. Qatar’s medium-term outlook
is positive, with downside risks from a prolonged global financial crisis, persistently low oil prices,
a large decline in real estate prices, and an escalation in geopolitical tensions.
The authorities
•

Consider containing inflation as a high priority.

•

Remain vigilant on financial sector developments and stand ready to take any action
required to preserve financial stability.

•

Are committed to the implementation of ongoing investment projects, and are willing to
increase government capital spending, if needed, to maintain economic activity.

•

Noted staff’s assessment that the Qatari riyal might be slightly undervalued, and reiterated
their commitment to maintaining a peg to the U.S. dollar in the period leading up to the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) Monetary Union.

•

Indicated that the implementation of a unified financial services regulator in Qatar is likely
to be more gradual than initially envisaged.

Staff recommendations
•

Continue to proactively manage vulnerabilities and expectations arising from the global
crisis.

•

Build an early warning system to identify risks in the banking system. Also conduct stress
tests for a combination of risks and publish results on a periodic basis.

•

Continue to contain government current expenditure and phase the implementation of new
investments as part of inflation management. The freeze on rent increases and price controls
is distortionary and should be applied on a temporary basis.

•

Maintain the peg to the U.S. dollar during the period leading up to the formation of the
monetary union in 2010.

•

Improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics and the provision of international
investment position data to the Fund to strengthen the effectiveness of the surveillance
process.

4
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Qatar’s macroeconomic performance remains strong in 2008, supported by an outwardoriented strategy aimed at developing the country’s vast gas reserves. 1 Falling oil prices have not
influenced ongoing hydrocarbon investments because of committed contracts for liquefied natural
gas (LNG). Non-oil GDP growth has also remained buoyant because of ongoing projects for which
financing has already been secured.
•

Overall real GDP growth is estimated at 16 percent in 2008, driven by expansions in the
production of oil, LNG, and condensates, and a strong performance in manufacturing,
construction, and financial services. At 15 percent in 2008, Qatar’s inflation rate is the
highest among GCC countries, with rent and food prices being major contributors.

•

Broad money is projected to increase by almost 40 percent in 2008, fueled by large foreign
exchange inflows, large public outlays, and a rapid expansion in private sector credit. Credit
growth has ballooned despite the implementation of a lower loan-deposit ratio and increases
in reserve requirements.

•

The overall fiscal surplus (12 percent of GDP in FY2007–08) reflects a strong increase in
revenue and a slowdown in expenditure relative to FY2006–07, partly owing to
improvements in cash management. 2

•

The external current account surplus (about 37 percent of GDP) mirrors a strong export
performance that more than compensated for buoyant growth (47 percent) in imports
(mainly capital goods) and in net services and transfers.

2.
The global financial crisis does not seem to have affected liquidity in Qatar, as deposits
and credit continued to grow at a rapid pace through October 2008. Interbank liquidity remains
broadly comfortable, although the weighted-average interbank rates in one-month maturities rose
(by about 350 basis points) between August and October. The central bank has responded by
introducing an overnight liquidity facility for banks, but use of this facility has been negligible. 3

1

With the world’s 3rd largest proven reserves of natural gas, Qatar is the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.

2

The Ministry of Economy and Finance now transfers funds to spending departments only after expenditures have
actually been incurred, reducing the difference between actual expenditures and disbursed funds.

3

Currently, commercial banks have $6 billion parked with the central bank in the form of reserve requirements,
deposits, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs).

5
3.
Qatari banks are adequately capitalized and profitable, and recent assessments
indicate that the banking system appears sound. At the same time, weak sentiment weighed on
shares and the equity market declined, although the underlying fundamentals remain strong. The
direct impact on the banking system of the recent decline in equity prices has been minimal, owing
in part to caps on exposure to the equity market. However, to strengthen confidence in the banking
system, the government authorized the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to purchase up
to 20 percent (about $5.3 billion) of the enhanced share capital of listed banks (except the
government majority-owned Qatar National Bank) on the Doha Securities Market (DSM).

II. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS 4
4.
Qatar’s medium-term outlook is positive. Real GDP growth is projected at 29 percent
in 2009, as the production of LNG and gas products is expected to almost double with the
commissioning by Rasgas (gas producer) of two trains, and construction, manufacturing, financial
services, trade and transportation, and communications all projected to grow at a strong pace.
Inflation is projected to fall to 10 percent in 2009, as a result of the passthrough of declining
international prices for food and raw materials and a slower increase in domestic rents owing to a
larger supply of low- and middle-income housing. The fiscal and external current accounts are
projected to remain in surplus in 2009, despite the lower projected oil price of $54 a barrel. An
expected deceleration in credit growth to the private sector would reflect the lingering effects of
uncertainties from the global financial turmoil and wealth effects from depressed asset prices.
5.
Output growth is projected to average 12 percent a year through 2013. Contributing
factors include further increases in the production of LNG, gas-to-liquid (GTLs) and
petrochemicals, an expansion in financial services as the single financial market and integrated
regulator is implemented, and increases in knowledge-based and related services associated with the
Qatar Foundation (Box 1). Strong revenue growth from the doubling of LNG exports and a stable
expenditure profile will help maintain overall fiscal surpluses, with the non-hydrocarbon fiscal
balance relative to GDP projected to decline gradually. The external current account surplus is
expected to narrow reflecting the peaking in production of oil and LNG in 2011, lower oil prices
than recent record-highs, and a steady increase in imports. Reserves of the QCB and other official
foreign assets would continue to rise.
6.
Downside risks include a prolonged crisis in the global financial system; persistently lower
oil prices; a large decline in real estate prices; 5 and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. To
estimate the extent of downside risks to the medium-term outlook, staff estimated two alternative
scenarios: (a) one assuming a 5 percent reduction in LNG production in 2009 and 2010 (assuming a
delay in the production capacity of one train), and (b) another assuming in addition to (a) an oil
price of $45 dollar a barrel in 2009 and thereafter increasing proportionately with current futures
prices. In both scenarios, the expenditure profile is assumed to be unchanged over the mediumterm. The simulations show that Qatar could still maintain on average double-digit growth rates in
4

5

All projections are based on the IMF’s December 2, 2008, World Economic Outlook (WEO) baseline.

A possible trigger could be a mismatch in current supply plans and future demand, arising from an outflow of foreign
workers/expatriates and a decline in demand.

10
non-oil real GDP and continue to record fiscal and current account surpluses over the medium term,
although at lower levels.
7.
The price of oil would continue to determine the pace at which investment plans can be
implemented, as well as the rate of accumulating external assets through the QIA. A further
worsening of the global crisis could dampen external demand for hydrocarbon and related products,
pose liquidity and financing risks, delay the implementation of future investment projects, and
adversely affect growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector. However, potential stresses appear
manageable, because the banking sector is well capitalized, and the QIA can diversify its portfolio
by investing in local projects.

11
Box 1. GCC and Qatar Projects: A Medium-Term Outlook
Rising wealth has facilitated the doubling of investment in both the hydrocarbon and
non-hydrocarbon sectors in the GCC since 2007. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E account for the
lion’s share (70 percent). Investments in oil and gas underscore the systemic role of GCC countries
in global hydrocarbon markets.

The investment profiles of GCC countries reflect country-specific diversification strategies,
although projects are generally geared toward addressing supply bottlenecks, diversification, and
employment generation. With the emergence of inflation as the main short-term macroeconomic
challenge, large investments are being channeled to the housing and infrastructure sectors to reduce
supply bottlenecks and expand

for a smaller share, projects in
electricity and water are critical
to meet the needs of the growing

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The policy discussions focused on (a) the impact of the global financial crisis on growth
and financial stability; (b) domestic inflation management; (c) progress in establishing a unified
financial services regulator in Qatar; (d) exchange rate issues; and (e) the GCC monetary union.
A. Impact of the Global Financial Crisis
9.
The authorities do not anticipate a strong impact of the global financial crisis on
Qatar. Although equity prices have fallen, credit default swap spreads have widened (150 basis
points), and interbank rates have increased moderately, domestic and foreign investor sentiment
about the economy remain strong. The global economic slowdown and the sharp decline in oil
prices could weaken somewhat overall economic activity in Qatar, but the authorities pointed out
that most of the hydrocarbon investments are firm and at various stages of implementation, and are
unlikely to be affected because the LNG has been committed under long-term contracts. Also,
investments in the non-hydrocarbon sector—manufacturing (aluminum, steel, power, water,
petrochemicals), transportation (airways), building and construction (Lusail, Pearl, Barwa), and
other infrastructure (ports and airport)—for which financing has already been secured would
continue. In FY 2009/10, the cost of maintaining public spending would be about 3 percent of GDP,
assuming an additional OPEC cut (10 percent) and a $45 a barrel price of oil in 2009. The
authorities also indicated their intention to increase government capital spending beyond ongoing
projects, if needed, to sustain economic activity.
10.
The authorities remain vigilant on financial sector developments. The central bank is
conducting monthly stress testing of banks, which so far shows that the measured risks are
manageable (Box 2). The authorities plan to publish the results through an annual financial stability
report. Notwithstanding their assessment that the banking system remains sound and the liquidity
position comfortable, financial developments are being closely monitored by a central bank
Financial Crisis Committee that meets daily; a coordination committee (including the central bank
governor and the Minister of Economy and Finance) that meets weekly; and a high level committee
involving the prime minister. The central bank stands ready to provide liquidity in case there is a
run on any bank and to implement appropriate crisis resolution measures, if the need arises,
including through bank mergers. At the regional level, GCC countries are in agreement that they
should support their respective financial systems.
11.
The authorities have been proactive in managing market expectations. In addition to the
introduction of an overnight liquidity window at 3 percent, the central bank is currently preparing a
list of acceptable instruments to facilitate collateralized lending to banks. The authorities are also
closely monitoring conditions in the money market and have used moral suasion to urge public
entities to increase deposits in commercial banks without demanding higher interest rates.

14
Box 2. Qatar’s Banking System
Qatar’s banking system is dominated by national banks. The system comprises
16 banks—6 conventional, 3 Islamic, and 7 foreign. Conventional banks assets
constitute 80 percent of total bank assets; Islamic and foreign banks account for
10 percent each. The regulatory capital adequacy requirement is 10 percent. National
banks are under Basel II guidelines for capital adequacy requirements, but the
risk-weighted capital requirements of foreign banks are based on home-country
provisions.
Competition is creating pressures on banks’ return on assets (RoA). Bank
profitability is still high owing to strong private sector demand, but increasing
competition and rising costs have eroded the RoA as well as the return on equity (ROE).
Consistent with lower profitability, risk taking by banks, as measured by the Z-index,
was low during 2003–07.1
Higher interest rates on customer deposits and lower interest rates on credit
facilities have reduced net interest margins since 2005.2 Higher cost-to-income ratios
and lower operating income as a proportion of assets also added to the pressures on
banks’ profitability. Although non-interest expenditure as a proportion of assets
declined, this reflected the rapid increase in assets rather than efficiency gains.
The continued above-trend growth rate of assets in 2008 and the preponderance of
customer deposits (which represented 64 percent of non-equity funding in 2007)
can pose some vulnerabilities to the banking system in the future. However, so far
the rapid credit growth does not seem to have affected credit quality. Although the high
Funding Volatility Ratio (FVR) of banks points to potential liquidity problems in
difficult times, this does not seem to be an issue now.3 However, the central bank needs
to continue monitoring proactively the performance of banks through periodic stress
tests.

____________________________________
1
A proxy measure of bank’s risk taking can be observed by an estimate of a bank’s probability of failure,
called the Z-index. The index is calculated using (a) profitability, measured by the average return on
assets (RoA); (b) leverage, measured by the period average equity-to-asset ratio (K); and (c) return
volatility VR, measured by the period standard deviation of RoA. Thus Z = (R +K) / VR. Z increases with
profitability and equity capital as percent of assets, and decreases with return volatility. Thus, a larger
value of the Z-index indicates a lower risk profile for a bank (De Nicolo, G., P. Bartholomew, J. Zaman,
and M. Zephirin, 2003, “Bank Consolidation, Internationalization, and Conglomeration: Trends and
Implications for Financial Risk,” IMF Working Paper 03/158 (Washington: International Monetary
Fund); Loukoianova, E., 2008, “Analysis of the Efficiency and Profitability of the Japanese Banking
System,” IMF Working Paper 08/63 (Washington: International Monetary Fund). In the case of Qatar, the
Z-index increased marginally between 2002 and 2007, from 2.6 to 3.8.
2

The average one-year weighted deposit rates of banks rose from 3.2 percent to 4.8 percent during
2004–07, while the average 1 to 3 year-weighted lending rate declined from 9.8 percent to 8.9 percent
over the same period.

3

The FVR is calculated as (volatile liabilities–liquid assets) / (total assets–liquid assets). The lower the
ratio, the better the banks’ liquidity profile.

16
B. Inflation
12.
The authorities agreed with the staff that inflationary pressures are likely to ease
in 2009, with international food and raw material prices projected to decline and domestic rents to
stabilize. As investments come on stream, supply bottlenecks will also ease and inflation, which is
expected to remain elevated in the near term, would decline gradually.
13.
Monetary policy will be managed to achieve a gradual reduction in inflation (Box 3).
The central bank intends to carefully calibrate its interest rate and liquidity instruments to ensure
that inflation is reduced and that the growth of assets, credit, and deposits of the banking system is
not choked off. To balance this trade-off, the QCB did not reduce its policy rates on the last two
occasions (since September 2008) when the Federal Reserve cut its rates. At the same time,
however, reserve requirements have been increased by 2 percentage points in 2008, and the QCB is
issuing CDs for maturities of one-, three-, six-, and nine-months, and is also planning to issue 14day fixed rate CDs. Also, central bank regulation has progressively reduced the proportion of
consumer credit. Although the central bank does not see a need to modify its monetary policy
stance at this time, it intends to maintain the current prudential norms, such as the limits to real
estate lending, the loan-deposit ratio, and the liquidity ratio, which have served the system well by
discouraging excessive risk exposure. The authorities are in consultation with the government on
the issuance of government bonds to improve debt management and gain greater flexibility in
money market operations.

17
Box 3. Economic Growth and Inflation Trade-off
A surge in inflation can have a negative impact on investment and growth. In general, inflation is not costly
at low levels, but when it reaches some threshold level further increases are likely to be harmful to growth.1
Qatar is at about the threshold where if inflation persists, it could begin to have an adverse impact on growth.
Consequently, efforts should continue to both monitor and contain inflationary pressures.

Our analysis identifies a threshold inflation level of 12 percent for a sample of 165 countries, above
which a doubling of inflation would decrease real GDP by 1.5 percent per year.2 The results are very similar
when applied to both developing and emerging economies groups (column a), although the estimated
threshold is much lower for advanced economies (about 1% - not shown in the table). For oil exporters, the
threshold inflation level is estimated at 10 percent (column b). Above that threshold, a doubling of inflation
would reduce real GDP growth by about 1.5 percent per year. Similar results are obtained if non-oil GDP data
is used (column c): a doubling of inflation from above the estimated threshold (also 12 percent) decreases
non-oil real GDP by about 1.5 percent per year.

Fischer, S., 1993, “The Role of Macroeconomic Factors in Economic Growth,” Journal of Monetary
Economics, Vol. 32, pp. 485–512, shows that high inflation reduces investment and productivity; and Khan,
M.S. and A. S. Senhadji, 2001, “Threshold Effects in the Relationship Between Inflation and Growth,”
IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 48, pp. 1–21, found that the threshold for advanced economies was much lower than that
for developing countries.
2

The model, based on Khan and Senhadji (2001), is estimated on 5-year averages and controlled for
individual country effects, the business cycle, the ratio of investment to GDP, population growth, initial GDP,
the rate of change in the terms of trade, and the variability of the terms of trade.

18
C. Financial Sector Development
14.
The authorities remain fully committed to having a unified financial regulator for
Qatar. In 2007, the government took a strategic decision to establish a single financial services
regulator that would bring together the functions of Qatar’s three regulators—the QCB, which
supervises banks; the Qatar Financial Markets Authority, which oversees the Doha Securities
Market; and the Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority (QFCRA), which regulates the
activities of institutions licensed by the QFC. When the new regulatory authority—the Financial
Regulatory Authority (FRA)—is created, Qatar will be the second country in the GCC region (the
other is Bahrain) with a single regulator model. Although steady progress is being made, including
on the proposed policy and legal framework, 6 information sharing among the three regulators, and
the convergence of rulebooks into a unified set of standards, full implementation is likely to be
more gradual than initially envisaged. 7 The Fund’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (CFT) assessment was adopted by both Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) and MENAFATF in 2008 as an AML/CFT mutual evaluation. The authorities are
determined to make improvements in their legal framework, in line with the recommendations of
the report.
D. Exchange Rate Issues
15.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintaining the peg to the U.S. dollar
in the period leading up to the GCC Monetary Union. They argued that the peg remains
appropriate under the current circumstances, given that 90 percent of Qatar’s exports are invoiced in
U.S. dollars. Further, changing the peg from the U.S. dollar to (preferably) a basket of currencies
would require choosing the appropriate composition and weights of the currencies—a challenging
task, particularly in light of the uncertainties arising from the global economic turmoil. Also, the
authorities do not believe that the depreciation of the U.S. dollar was a major contributor to
inflation in Qatar, and they are not convinced that a revaluation would solve the inflation problem.
In any event, the authorities argued that the recent appreciation of the dollar against major reserve
currencies has weakened the argument for a regime change. The authorities noted the staff’s
assessment that the exchange rate may be somewhat undervalued (Box 4).

6

The parliamentary legislation proposing the creation of a Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) in Qatar has already
been submitted to parliament.

7

The authorities had planned on completing the transition to the single financial regulator by 2010.

19

Box 4. Qatar—Real Exchange Rate Assessment
Qatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by 15 percent since 2004, reversing the
8 percent depreciation experienced during 2001–03. The depreciation until 2003 reflected relatively low
domestic inflation, together with the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Since then, the
appreciation of the REER has been mainly due to rising domestic inflation. Oil prices spiked between 2003 and
mid-2008, with the sharp improvement in Qatar’s terms-of-trade (TOT) suggesting that the underlying
equilibrium real effective
exchange rate should be more

The macroeconomic balance

for the GCC countries, suggest
some undervaluation. Qatar’s
average external current account
norm for 2013 is estimated at
28 percent of GDP, which is lower
than the observed current account
surplus of 31 percent of GDP
in 2007. Given the current futures

over the medium term,2 the surplus
is projected to decline by 2013 to
below the level of the norm for
2013.

The equilibrium exchange rate
approach suggests that the
level of the Qatari riyal is
broadly in line with the
fundamentals. Low domestic
inflation coupled with
U.S. dollar depreciation during
2000–04 led to undervaluation
(averaging 5½ percent) of the
riyal. However, continued dollar
appreciation and high domestic
inflation during 2003–07, which
coincided with high oil prices,
saw a gradual real appreciation.

Under the external sustainability approach (ESA), Qatar will have to run sizeable but declining budget
and current account surpluses over the medium-to-long term to transform a sufficient amount of oil wealth
into financial assets, suggesting some overvaluation.3 The ESA provides an intergenerational approach to the
use of expected resources, based on the net present value of future wealth. Annuities are calculated under three
different policy objectives: (a) a constant share-of-GDP annuity; (b) a constant real per capita annuity; and
(c) constant real annuity.

Oil prices rose from about $70 a barrel in August 2007 to $147 a barrel in July 2008, before falling to $90 a
barrel in mid-September 2008 and further to under $60 a barrel in mid-November 2008.

The preliminary calculations assume (a) 27 billion barrels of oil reserves and 18.7 billion tons of gas reserves;
(b) 1.5 percent decrease in oil production each year, and no growth in gas production each year after 2013;
(c) annual average growth in real GDP of 3.5 percent; (d) an increase in the non-oil GDP deflator of 3.5 percent;
and (e) a rate of return on external assets at 8 percent.

21
E. GCC Monetary Union
16.
Qatar remains committed to moving toward a monetary union with the rest of the
GCC countries, but implementation may take longer than initially planned. 8 The member
countries are aware of the need to step up progress in the various areas necessary for the monetary
union, including on the coordination of monetary, exchange rate, and reserves policy; the
integration of clearing and settlement systems and common supervisory and regulatory standards;
issues relating to the transition to a new currency; and the harmonization and compilation of
regional economic statistics. However, a number of challenges need to be addressed, including the
use of common fiscal criteria, given differing oil and gas reserves. Progress has been made, in
operationalizing the common market, an important milestone in the process toward economic
integration. The authorities are of the view that the global financial crisis would not have an adverse
impact on the decision to establish a GCC Monetary Union.
IV. STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND STATISTICS
17.
The authorities believe that an expansion of the non-oil revenue base is important to
reduce the economy’s dependence on the hydrocarbon sector. In this regard, they are considering
amending the current tax law in order to lower the corporate tax rate for foreign companies from 35
percent to 10 percent while implementing an initial low rate for national companies, with a view to
unifying the tax rates in the future. The authorities are also studying the introduction of a valueadded tax (VAT) as part of a GCC-wide initiative, and a revision of the existing tax holiday policy
to significantly reduce benefits.
18.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. The authorities are
considering several measures aimed at improving the quality of economic data provided to the Fund
and the general public. They are now compiling and publishing quarterly nominal GDP data, plan to
publish a monthly consumer price index (CPI), are in the process of updating the weights and items
in the CPI basket, and introducing an international transactions reporting system (ITRS) that will
provide more comprehensive data on external positions of reporting financial corporations.
However, the central bank’s plans to improve the coverage and compilation of balance of payments
statistics are not progressing as quickly as envisaged and the central bank is currently assessing its
technical assistance needs in this area. The QIA does not disclose financial information on its
activities. The authorities have indicated that their investment strategy is long-term and driven by
risk-return considerations, with a distinct bias toward foreign opportunities. Staff’s estimate based
on balance of payments and fiscal accounts data suggest that Qatar’s net public International

market by 2007 and a monetary union by 2010.

22
Investment Position (IIP), 9 excluding unknown foreign financial claims and liabilities of the private
sector, is of the order of $70 billion. The authorities have indicated that they will provide an oral
statement on QIA foreign assets to the Board, a similar approach to that followed under the 2007
Article IV consultation.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
19.
Qatar is the fastest growing economy in the GCC region and has so far managed well
the impact of the global financial crisis. The economy is expected to continue growing at a rapid
pace in the near future, driven by a rapid expansion in LNG production (and related industries) and
in investments aimed at economic diversification. The fiscal and external current accounts are
projected to remain in surplus; however, the extent of the global financial crisis and the trend in oil
prices will determine the medium-term policy mix and the accumulation of reserves in the QIA.
Looking forward, the main risks relate to the financial sector if the fall in equity prices continues,
and to the construction sector if some of the projects cannot be completed because of reduced
availability of financing. In this regard, the authorities should continue to proactively manage
expectations and vulnerabilities arising from the global crisis.
20.
Staff supports the authorities’ strategy to build capacity and ease supply bottlenecks to
contain inflation, but underscores the need to continue containing government current expenditure
and to phase the implementation of new investment projects, if needed, to slow the growth in
aggregate demand. Although the freeze on rent increases and the price controls introduced recently
on some commodities and raw materials could help contain short-term inflationary pressures, they
are likely to generate costly distortions and should be applied as temporary measures.
21.
Fiscal expansion is projected to moderate over the medium term, particularly through a
decline in current expenditures relative to non-hydrocarbon GDP. This decline reflects the
containment of wage increases and spending on other goods and services. However, the authorities
are committed to completing committed investments in both hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon
sectors, which could sustain fiscal expansion. Staff agrees that if the global crisis persists,
government may need to resort to fiscal stimulus by increasing spending further on infrastructure
projects to support demand and reduce negative feedback between the real and financial sectors.
22.
Regarding the financial sector, recent global events have demonstrated that market
sentiment can change—even if banks are sound and profitable. In this context, safeguarding the
soundness of the banking system is crucial. Staff welcomes the monthly stress testing of the
banking system by the central bank, and encourages the authorities to consider publishing them on a

23
regular basis in the future. Although tests so far show that the measured risks are manageable and
unlikely to derail the banking system, care must be taken to closely monitor and assess (a) various
combinations of risks, including credit, equity, and real estate shocks, and (b) economic risks from
oil price shocks. Also, it would be advisable to build an early warning system—the starting point
being better and more inclusive efforts at gathering data for assessing risk.
23.
In light of the current global crisis and the authorities’ commitment to establish a
unified regulator for financial services, it would be more appropriate to implement this after
the proposals for strengthening the international financial regulatory framework have been
agreed upon. In the interim, it is necessary for the QCB, the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
and the new regulator to agree on a tri-partite memorandum of understanding spelling out their
respective responsibilities, and to resolve the issue of access to the payments system by
QFC-licensed institutions. Effective monitoring is also needed to close regulatory gaps during the
transition period and to establish appropriate procedures to deal promptly with the issues that may
arise with increased market competition. Staff also suggests that a formal mechanism be put in
place for the QFC to report (during the transition period) to the QCB the financial statistics of
QFC-licensed institutions.
24.
Staff supports the current commitment of Qatar to maintain the peg to the U.S. dollar
during the period leading up to the formation of the GCC Monetary Union in 2010. Although
the peg has facilitated growth and macroeconomic stability and anchored monetary policy, the
inflationary experience of the last two to three years has highlighted the complications for
macroeconomic management when economic cycles and policy needs differ from that of the anchor
country. 10 Recently, the argument for a revaluation of the riyal has been significantly reduced as
international prices for food and raw materials have declined, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated
against major currencies. Staff is of the view that if inflation persists in the period leading up to the
monetary union, and the value of the U.S. dollar reverses course (depreciates) for a sustained
period, the authorities may need then to consider other options, such as pegging to a basket of
currencies.
25.
External borrowing by financial institutions and large corporations needs to be
monitored closely. Presently there are no signs of vulnerability associated with external borrowing,
given Qatar’s large net creditor position, but the level of external debt has been rising sharply, and
the authorities need to monitor the situation by collecting data and maintaining an adequate
regulatory oversight.
10

The pros and cons of alternative exchange rate regimes once the monetary union is established are examined in an
Middle East and Central Asia Department (MCD) paper recently issued to the Executive Board
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4303

24
26.
The authorities should move ahead with their plans to develop a government bond
market. The availability of government bonds would add depth to the financial market, permit the
development of a benchmark yield curve, allow banks to better manage their liquidity, and
eventually pave the way for the establishment of a corporate bond market.
27.
Given the increasing integration with the global economy and the proposed GCC
Monetary Union, the authorities should continue to improve the quality of macroeconomic
statistics. Building on progress made through participation in the GDDS, priority should be given
to improving the balance of payments financial account data, enhancing the timeliness and
availability of data on public sector operations, and improving coordination across government
agencies. Staff also urges the authorities to improve the provision of IIP data to the Fund. In
particular, high priority should be given to expanding the reporting requirements for financial and
other corporations, as well as government agencies in order to facilitate the compilation of IIP
statistics.
28.

It is proposed that Qatar remains on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

ANNEX II. QATAR: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 15, 2008)
Strategic Cooperation Program (SCP)
The program of strategic cooperation with Qatar is recent and is based on ad hoc requests
from the government. Currently, the Bank is holding a series of consultations with the
Government of Qatar on developing a long-term program in the areas of strategic planning,
pension system review, small- and medium-enterprise support, and capital markets
development. The Bank’s main counterpart is the General Secretariat for Development
Planning (GSDP), but there is an ongoing dialog with other entities including the Qatar
Central Bank and the Qatar Foundation.
Ongoing Projects
•

Labor Market Strategy (LMS) Implementation

The World Bank conducted a labor market survey to help identify the main characteristics of
the labor market in Qatar, and prepared an LMS that included an assessment and analysis of
the labor force and a review of labor laws, regulations, and other institutional factors
affecting labor allocation and utilization. The results of the LMS study were presented at a
national symposium in April 9, 2006. Currently, the Bank is assisting the government in the
implementation of the study’s action plan.

•

Moving Qatar Toward a Knowledge-Based Economy

In 2007, the World Bank Institute (WBI) conducted a study on Knowledge Economy (KE)
Development in Qatar; the results of the study were discussed at several high-level
workshops and were well received by the government. Currently, the Bank is supporting
implementation of the KE strategy, in the form of the proposed Knowledge-Based Economy
Campaign (KBEC).

ANNEX III. QATAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data reporting
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There
remains substantial scope for improving the frequency, timeliness, and coverage of economic
data. Recently, the Qatar Statistics Authority (QSA) was formed, to spearhead the
development of statistics in Qatar.
Following technical assistance from the Fund, the timeliness and quality of monetary
statistics have improved. The improvements include a better classification of the government
sector and regular publication of analytical accounts of banks. Some steps have been taken to
strengthen the external current account data, particularly data on trade and services, and there
has been an improvement in the estimation of workers’ remittances. On national accounts,
steps have been taken to publish a wider range of aggregates, including private consumption
expenditure and national saving. In addition, detailed data on oil, gas, and medium- and
long-term external debt have been provided to staff missions.
While monetary data are reported to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) on a regular
basis, there are long lags in the reporting of price indices and other real sector statistics for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Furthermore, international trade
details are reported only sporadically for publication in the Direction of Trade Statistics.
Public finance data were reported for publication in the 2008 GFS Yearbook, but are not
reported for publication in IFS. The April/May 2007 General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) assessment mission was provided with 2005 balance of payments data; however the
data was not sufficiently detailed to present in the format of the Balance of Payments
Manual, 5/e (BPM5) for inclusion in IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
Data dissemination
Qatar has been a participant of the GDDS since December 2005. A 2007 GDDS mission
assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, and identified
major milestones that Qatar would have to reach in order to graduate to the SDDS. To
enhance data dissemination practices, the mission assisted the authorities in developing a
National Summary Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar (ARC). Overall, the
mission found that significant progress had been made since 2005. Nevertheless, significant
gaps in certain datasets still remain to be addressed.

6

Sectoral data issues
Real sector statistics
National accounts statistics are compiled broadly in line with the concepts and definitions of
the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). However, key aggregates are limited to
annual GDP estimates by economic activity and by expenditure at current and constant
prices, and quarterly estimates of GDP at current prices. The base year for constant price data
is 2001. The accuracy of the GDP estimates in current prices is undermined by the lack of
comprehensive source data. The constant price estimates do not follow sound deflation
techniques, mostly due to the lack of reliable price indices and volume indicators. Informal
activities in the construction sector are estimated and included in the GDP estimates. Apart
from this, no adjustments are made for non-observed and/or illegal activities.
Since 2002, the Department of Statistics (now QSA) has compiled a quarterly consumer price
index (CPI), which broadly follows international methodological standards. The index
measures price changes for goods and services consumed by all households in the country.
The CPI list of representative goods and services covers about 1100 items for which prices
are collected; the frequency of price collection depends on the item. Prices for vegetables,
fruit, and fish are collected at least once a week, but most prices are collected quarterly.
The eights have been derived from a household budget survey (HBS) that was undertaken
during October 2000–September 2001. Prices are collected from about 400 outlets, with the
selection of outlets based on purposive sampling. The CPI is usually completed about one
month after the end of the reference quarter. No explicit adjustments are made for quality
changes; however, when a new product replaces an old one, the method of overlapping is
applied. Missing prices are replaced with prices for the preceding quarter. The elementary
indices are calculated using geometric means, in accordance with current international
recommendations.
Employment statistics are compiled and disseminated annually and whenever a census is
conducted. The last two censuses were conducted in 1997 and in 2004, and the next census is
expected to be conducted in 2010. The annual data are disseminated within six months after
the end of the reference year. Preliminary census-based employment data are first published
within 9 months after the census.
Hydrocarbon sector
Detailed oil and gas sector data are provided to staff by the Ministry of Energy and
Petroleum and Qatar Petroleum (QP) 1 at the time of the Article IV consultation discussions.
In addition, the authorities also present information about medium-term plans for oil and gas,
liquefied natural gas (LNG), financing, and other QP-related industrial activities.

7

Government finance statistics
Government budget data should be presented according to Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM) guidelines, including greater detail on major expenditure and non-oil
revenue categories. In addition, the data on financing items should be consistent with the data
on the public sector in the depository corporations survey and the balance of payments. The
country has a number of—largely commercial—public sector entities that should not be
mixed with the central government accounts. The authorities have reported annual data for
2004–07 for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Monthly and
quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS.
The 2007 GDDS mission found that the Ministry of Finance (now Ministry of Economy and
Finance) was giving priority to the implementation of the recommendations of the GFSM,
with the objective of starting the dissemination of complete annual government finance
tables. A preliminary set of fiscal data in GFSM format was provided to the 2008 Article IV
mission.
Monetary and financial statistics
Data for the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks are generally timely and of
high quality. The QCB uses the Standardized Reporting Forms to report monthly monetary
data to STA for publication in IFS and the IFS Supplement. Monthly and quarterly data are
also published in the Quarterly Statistics Bulletin.
External sector statistics
The 2007 GDDS assessment mission found that the QCB had made some progress in the
compilation of balance of payments statistics. International Transactions Reporting System
collection forms have been expanded and reporting forms introduced to collect data on
current account and financial account transactions for the major oil and gas companies and
affiliates. The results from these new report forms are being reviewed to assess the quality of
the data collected.
However, serious omissions remain in the balance of payments (BOP) statistics, owing to the
absence of timely and reliable source data. There is no compilation for inward or outward
direct investment, there are no portfolio investment data compiled for the nonbank sector,
and errors and omissions remain large. Moreover, official statistics seem to underestimate
total imports. Source data for government external assets are not provided to the QCB.
Although an estimate for flows of government external assets, based on the budget data, is
included in the balance of payments, no information is provided on the government’s stock
of external assets, which makes it difficult to estimate the level of investment income with
any degree of confidence.
In addition, there is an inconsistency in coverage in flows and stocks of official reserves.
In the BOP, flows of official reserves include changes in the stock of QCB reserves and an

8

estimate for the change in stock of the external assets of the government. However, the stock
of official reserves published in IFS includes only the stock of QCB reserves. Progress in
implementing recommendations of technical assistance missions has been steady but slow.
The authorities have been working with STA to report their BOP data in BPM5 format, but
there has been insufficient detailed information available to complete this process.
No official information is published on the amount or breakdown of external debt. However,
detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are provided to missions
during the Article IV consultation discussions. In recent years, Qatar has issued several
international bonds and some of the proceeds were used to retire other external debt. It is,
therefore, important to improve the flow of information on external debt and its maturity
profile.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Qatar
January 21, 2009
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Qatar that has become
available since the staff report was circulated to the Board on January 5, 2009. This
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The oil price baseline assumption for the World Economic Outlook (WEO) was
revised downward in January 2009 to $50 a barrel for 2009 (from $54 a barrel assumed in the
staff report). The Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced a
further cut in its crude oil production ceiling by 2.2 million barrels a day (mbd), with effect
from January 1, 2009 (in addition to a cut of 1.5 mbd in September 2008). Assuming that
Qatar fully implements its share of the cut in production and an unchanged expenditure
profile, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth would decline by 1 percentage point in
2009 to 28 percent; the fiscal surplus would decline by 1 percentage point to 3.6 percent of
GDP; and the current account surplus, at 9.4 of GDP, would be 3 percentage points of GDP
lower than envisaged, all compared with the baseline scenario presented in the report. 1 Over
the medium-term, Qatar will still maintain on average double-digit growth rates in non-oil
real GDP and will continue to record fiscal and current account surpluses, although at lower
levels.
3.
Financial conditions remain stable. Monetary data through November 2008 show
comfortable levels of liquidity in the interbank market, deposits and lending by the banking
system have continued to grow moderately, and interbank rates have moved back to below
2 percent—near the level before the global crisis. However, the weak sentiment in the stock
market continues, with the market declining by more than 30 percent since September 10,
2008. On the policy front, the central bank did not reduce its policy rates when the U.S.
Federal Reserve lowered rates in December 2008.
4.
The potential for a sharp drop in real estate prices is of less concern in Qatar since the
real estate market is characterized by excess demand, which has been the main cause for
rental inflation. New units are being completed and, following the introduction of the cap on
rents, rent inflation is beginning to decline.

1

In estimating the downside risks to the medium-term outlook, the staff report assumed (i) an oil price of $45 a
barrel in 2009; (ii) a larger cut in oil production than was subsequently agreed by OPEC; and (iii) a 5 percent
reduction in liquefied gas production (LNG) relative to the baseline (para 6 of the staff report).

2

5.
On December 30, 2008, the Heads of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) approved
a draft accord for the monetary union and a system governing the monetary council. The
agreement must now be signed by the countries' heads of state for final approval, and is
expected to come into force by the end of 2009. The GCC countries continue to meet all the
convergence criteria, except for Qatar where the inflation rate is higher than the
benchmark. 2,3

2

Fiscal deficits not to exceed 3 percent of GDP; public debt to GDP ratios not to exceed 60 percent; inflation
rates not to exceed the GCC weighted average of inflation rates plus two percentage points; short-term
interest rates not to exceed the average of the lowest three interest rates amongst the member countries plus
two percentage points; and foreign exchange reserves to cover at least 4 months of imports.
3

Data for September 2008 show that the average inflation rate for the first three quarters of 2008 was about
15.5 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 28, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On January 21, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Qatar. 1
Background
Qatar’s macroeconomic performance was strong in 2008, notwithstanding the global financial
crisis. Overall real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated at 16 percent in 2008,
driven by expansions in the production of oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and condensates, and
a strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and financial services. However, inflation
remained high at 15 percent, reflecting high rent and food prices, as well as large public outlays
and a rapid expansion in private sector credit. The overall fiscal surplus (12 percent of GDP in
FY2007–08, April-March) reflected a large increase in oil revenue and a slowdown in
expenditure relative to FY2006–07. The external current account recorded a large surplus
(about 37 percent of GDP) despite the almost 50 percent growth in imports (mainly capital
goods).
The global turmoil has had a limited impact so far on the banking system. Recent assessments
indicate that potential stresses are manageable. At the same time, weak sentiment has weighed
on shares and the equity market declined (30 percent), although the underlying fundamentals
remain strong.
Qatar is expected to perform at least as strong in 2009, driven by a rapid expansion in LNG
production (and related industries) and in investments aimed at economic diversification.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Inflation is projected to fall in 2009, as a result of the passthrough of declining international
prices for food and raw materials and a slower increase in domestic rents owing to a larger
supply of low- and middle-income housing. The fiscal and external current accounts are
projected to remain in surplus in 2009, despite the lower oil prices.
Qatar’s medium-term outlook is positive, with continuing strong growth, gradually declining
inflation, and fiscal and external current account surpluses. The main risks to this outlook
include a prolonged global financial crisis, persistently low oil prices, a large decline in real
estate prices, reduced availability of financing for projects, and an escalation in geopolitical
tensions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the Qatari
authorities for the impressive macroeconomic performance in recent years, which has
strengthened the economy’s resilience to the current global financial crisis and economic
downturn. They noted that prudent macroeconomic policies have contributed to booming
investment and exports, resulting in double-digit growth in both the hydrocarbon and
non-hydrocarbon sectors and in sizeable external and fiscal surpluses, which leave Qatar’s
economy well placed to withstand shocks.
Directors considered the medium-term outlook favorable, and noted that the key challenges
facing the authorities are to lower Qatar’s high rate of inflation, continue to shield the economy
from the global financial crisis, ensure that rapid credit growth does not undermine bank
soundness, and diversify the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbon production
and exports. They welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to sound macroeconomic
management to achieve these objectives. Directors agreed with the assessment that inflationary
pressures should ease gradually because of lower food and raw material prices and an increase
in the supply of residential and commercial properties. They encouraged the authorities to avoid
the distortionary effects of price and rent controls, noting that these measures should at best be
temporary.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to moderate fiscal expansion and broaden the nonoil revenue base over the medium term. They supported the emphasis on building capacity in
infrastructure and, easing supply bottlenecks, while containing government current expenditure
to reduce inflation. Directors agreed that, should the global crisis persist or external financing
difficulties arise, a temporary increase in government investment spending would be warranted
to support demand without undermining the effort to contain inflation.
Directors noted that Qatar’s banking system is well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable. They
welcomed the central bank’s proactive stance to maintain confidence in the financial system
and encouraged the authorities to continue to monitor closely financial sector developments,
implement international standards against money laundering and terrorism financing, and
upgrade financial sector surveillance capabilities. Directors supported the central bank’s use of
stress testing of financial institutions and endorsed the development of an early warning system
to identify financial sector vulnerabilities. They also welcomed the consultation between the

central bank and the government on the issuance of government bonds to improve liquidity
forecasting and debt management.
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made so far in establishing a unified regulator for
financial services. They agreed on implementing the unified regulator gradually, preferably after
proposals for improving the international financial regulatory framework have been agreed
upon. In the interim, coordination should be enhanced among existing regulators and further
improvements to the regulatory framework should be continued.
Directors agreed that the peg to the U.S. dollar continues to provide a credible anchor for
monetary policy and maintain external stability. They noted the staff’s finding that the level of
the Qatari riyal appears to be in line with economic fundamentals. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to the GCC Monetary Union, and the decision to launch the Monetary
Council by the end of 2009.
Directors commended the establishment of the Qatar Statistics Authority. They urged the
authorities to continue improving the quality of economic statistics, particularly data on national
income, the balance of payments, and the international investment position.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
