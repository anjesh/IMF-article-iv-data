IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mauritius
On March, 11, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation 1 with Mauritius.
Mauritius has continued to grow at a moderate rate of 3.4 percent in 2015, as weak external
demand, protracted decline in construction, and the collapse of a large financial conglomerate
group more than offset the positive impact of favorable terms of trade. Inflation remains low (0.4
percent in January 2016), reflecting in part declining oil prices and shipping costs.
Unemployment hovers around 8 percent, although it is higher among women and the youth. The
external current account deficit narrowed to about 5 percent of GDP and international reserves
increased to 6.5 months of imports, supported by continued capital inflows.
The monetary policy stance remains broadly appropriate against the backdrop of subdued
inflation. The Bank of Mauritius reduced its key policy rate by 25 bps in November 2015, to 4.40
percent, in order to support the domestic economy, while making progress in mopping up excess
domestic currency liquidity.
In the financial sector, credit growth is gradually recovering and overall, the banking system
remains well capitalized. Nonetheless, domestic non-performing loans have been rising and
provisioning has not kept pace with the decline in asset quality. In addition, the authorities face
macro-financial challenges stemming from risk exposures and potential spillovers from the very
large offshore sector and its sizeable inter-linkages with domestic banking activities.
The budgetary performance turned more prudent in 2015, reversing the deterioration of recent
years. In 2015, both the overall consolidated deficit and the primary deficit remained below
earlier budget projections, and improved relative to 2014. Nonetheless, public debt continued to
increase (by more than 2 percentage points of GDP) due to the government’s interventions in the
financial sector and the impact of the depreciating rupee on external debt.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The country’s statistical capacity continues to be strengthened as the authorities actively pursue
efforts to improve the coverage of the offshore sector in official data, and to introduce a real
estate price index.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment
and foster a more diversified economy. While the country’s economic outlook is favorable, they
noted the macro-financial risks from a potential slowdown in offshore activities and
vulnerabilities in the banking sector. They encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen
macroeconomic and financial sector resilience and to pursue structural reforms to raise
productivity and growth.
Directors urged the authorities to address potential spillover risks from the complex interlinkages between large offshore activities, the banking system, and the domestic economy. They
underscored the importance of upgrading the macro-prudential policy framework, and
recommended creating a macro-prudential authority with a central role for the bank regulator to
improve the assessment and mitigation of systemic risks. They also emphasized the urgency of
addressing information gaps regarding offshore business companies and their role in
conglomerate groups.
Directors stressed the need to improve consolidated supervision and oversight of mixed
conglomerates, in line with the FSAP recommendations. They recommended reconsidering tax
incentives that distort bank risk-taking toward cross-border and offshore activities; promoting
better foreign currency liquidity management at domestic banks; strengthening the ability of the
Bank of Mauritius to supervise bank holding companies and monitor cross-border risks;
developing a comprehensive framework for crisis prevention and management; and upgrading
the bank resolution framework prior to introducing deposit insurance. Directors also noted that
the financial inter-linkages and potential spillover risks warrant a further bolstering of foreign
currency buffers, and encouraged the authorities to seek appropriate financial insurance
mechanisms. Directors supported the cautiously accommodative monetary stance in view of the
subdued inflation environment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to halt the fiscal deterioration in recent years and
stressed the importance of putting in place a credible medium-term strategy to safeguard debt
sustainability. With a view to creating space for growth-enhancing infrastructure investment,

they recommended containing current spending while better targeting priority social expenditure,
broadening the tax base, improving the efficiency of public entities, and targeting divestiture
proceeds for debt reduction. They also underscored the need to introduce an operational
framework for monitoring fiscal risks and contingent liabilities arising from public-private
partnerships.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to raise growth and competitiveness by
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and skills mismatches, reducing the cost of doing business,
and facilitating further diversification of the economy. In this context, they underscored that
increased female labor force participation and immigration of skilled workers would help
mitigate the impact on growth of the projected labor force decline.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 26, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Mauritius’ upper-middle income economy has continued to grow at a
moderate rate; inflation is low; and the external position has improved. Macroeconomic
conditions remain stable but the authorities face macro-financial challenges stemming
from the recent collapse of a large financial conglomerate, which affected the real
economy, as well as risk exposures and potential spillovers from the massive offshore
sector and its sizeable inter-linkages with domestic banking activities. These challenges,
discussed in the FSAP and in the consulta tion as a macro-financial pilot, require a
significant strengthening of the macro-prudential and financial stability policy
frameworks. The authorities are also resolute to avoid the middle-income trap, but face a
tight tradeoff, anchored by a statutory medium-term debt target, between spending on
social entitlements versus infrastructure upgrading, much needed as competiveness and
productivity have been eroding and investment rates declining. Given the low female
labor force participation in a shrinking labor force, the consultation with Mauritius is also
a pilot for the analysis of gender inequality.
Outlook and Risks: Despite these challenges, the medium-term outlook remains
favorable, as economic growth is set to be boosted by continued low fuel prices and the
start of important investment programs. However, there are downside risks to the
baseline from a potential slowdown in the activity of the offshore financial center;
banking sector vulnerabilities affecting private sector credit expansion; subdued growth
in Mauritius’ main trading partners; and fiscal vulnerabilities.
Focus: Discussions centered on mitigation of systemic spillover risks from the off-shore
center and re-establishing the credibility of the medium-term fiscal anchor. Staff and the
authorities agreed on the characterization of the inter-linkages with the domestic
economy, and the need to upgrade regulation and oversight of the financial system.
The authorities also agreed on the need to strengthen reserve buffers, as well as to
continue to reduce excess domestic currency liquidity in the banking system.

financial sector, providing further development momentum but also stronger potential spillovers from
volatile external conditions.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
In 2015, Mauritius continued to grow at a moderate rate, reflecting subdued activity in its
main trading partners and a challenging domestic environment (Figure 1). Real GDP growth is
estimated to have slowed somewhat, to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in 2014, as weak external demand,
a protracted decline in construction, and the collapse of the BAI financial conglomerate group (Annex I),
more than offset the positive impact of favorable terms of trade. The unemployment rate hovered
around 8 percent, although it was higher among women (11 percent) and the youth (23 percent). With
low inflation (0.4 percent in January 2016)—reflecting in part declining oil prices and shipping costs2 —
the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) reduced its key policy rate by 25 bps in November (to 4.40 percent) to
support domestic demand.
5.
Domestic credit is gradually recovering from the 2014 contraction, in part induced by the
adoption of macro-prudential measures to address increasing nonperforming loans (NPLs) in tourism
and construction (Box 1). Credit growth remained weak in the aftermath of the BAI group collapse, and
while it has ticked-up recently, it is only projected to grow in-line with GDP over the next few years.
While the banking sector overall remains well capitalized, as confirmed by the FSAP solvency stress test,
there are significant differences across banks and vulnerabilities have increased. Tier 1 capital ratios
(above 15 percent at end-June 2015 in aggregate) were significantly lower in two small institutions,
which were recently merged into a state-owned bank. Moreover, NPLs have risen to about 8 percent of
domestic loans, and provisioning has not kept pace with the deterioration in bank asset quality (Box 1).
6.
Fiscal policy turned more prudent in 2015, reversing the deterioration of recent years.
The overall consolidated balance and the primary deficit not only remained below earlier budget
projections, but also improved relative to 2014 (by almost 1 and by ½ percent of GDP respectively),
although this was largely driven by cuts in capital spending3. Nonetheless, public debt continued to
increase (by more than 2 percent of GDP, to 63.7 percent at end-2015), reflecting the government’s
intervention in the financial sector—1.3 percent of GDP, due to capital injections in two ailing banks
(0.4 percent of GDP in total) and a line of credit to refund policyholders of single premium products
issued by BAI (0.9 percent of GDP)4— and the impact of the depreciating rupee on external debt.
7.
The balance of payments has improved. Driven by strong exports of goods and lower
shipping costs and fuel prices, the current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to about

5 percent of GDP in 2015. International reserves increased to US$4.2 billion by end-2015, supported by
continued GBC-related capital inflows. The rupee lost 14 percent against the US$ through end-2015,
while remaining broadly stable against the euro.
8.
Overall, the baseline medium-term outlook remains favorable. GDP is projected to grow
moderately in 2016 (3.8 percent) and hover just above this rate in the medium-term, boosted by the
impact of low oil prices and the gradual implementation of important investment programs. On the
other hand, the baseline reflects the likely plateauing of domestic credit relative to GDP, due to the
need for bank balance sheet repair in a rather saturated domestic market. Reflecting capital goods and
cement imports for investment projects, the current account deficit is expected to stay around
5 percent of GDP, accompanied by a moderate gain in competitiveness supported by the planned
investment projects addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and various structural reforms (see ¶34).
Under the baseline, the GBC sector is assumed to continue generating substantial (net) inflows, and
international reserves are expected to stabilize at around 6¾ months of imports.
9.
This baseline is subject to a number of risks (see the Risk Assessment Matrix). Lower-thanexpected growth in Europe could adversely affect tourism, trade and FDI. On the domestic side, while
risks from the public debt profile should be manageable, given the low external debt with long
maturities and favorable terms, vulnerabilities could arise if public debt is not reduced from its relatively
high level (about 64 percent of GDP). Most important, external balance and domestic financial stability
conditions are crucially dependent on continued funding from non-residents and the GBC sector, which
could be affected by a revision of the DTAA with India, and on the absence of adverse spillovers on
domestic banks from their large exposure to credit risks on cross-border lending operations (around
100 percent of GDP). There is also a risk that domestic credit growth may be lower than projected
should bank balance sheet strains worsen. On the upside, the authorities target more ambitious growth
rates (5-6 percent) through further diversification and improvements in a variety of infrastructures.
Nonetheless, reaching growth prospects to that extent hinges upon resolutely addressing constraints to
factor accumulation and productivity development, and sounder banking conditions supporting
stronger credit expansion.

Box 1. Domestic Bank Lending Cycle and the Rise in NPLs
Bank lending built-up significantly over the pas t decade, increasing from around 70 percent in 2004-05 to the
current level of around 100 percent of GDP (Figure 1.1). After peaking at nearly 110 percent of GDP in 2013, credit
contracted following the adoption of macro -prudential measures (limits on loan -to-value and debt-to-income
ratios for property purchases). Bank lending remained weak during the problems at the BAI Group, but there are
indications that it started to recover after the January 2015 decision to rescind the previously introduced macro prudential measures. Finally, the lack of property price data hampers commercial banks’ risk management, and
systemic risk assessment by the authorities.

Note: The credit-to-GDP trend is estimated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter.

The credit boom has led to a rise in NPLs (Figure 1.2). NPLs are highest in construction sector (Figure 1.3),
following a period of elevated lending growth, although NPLs are also high for trading, manufacturing and
individuals. NPLs for GBCs (the third largest recipient of domestic credit) remain relatively low. Provisioning has
not kept pace: coverage ratios (provisions to NPLs) fell to 40 percent in June 2015 an d un-provisioned NPLs
reached 17 percent of bank capital (Figure 1.4).
Domestic credit is no t projected to grow much faster than GDP. Bank asset quality has deteriorated, there is a
widespread view among banks that the domestic market is relatively saturated, and banks tend to ask for property
collateral, which is limited in supply and with low turnover. This all suggests that domestic credit may have reached
a plateau relative to GDP. Indeed, banks are increasingly shifting to offshore operations, given the clear tax
advantages of cross-border and offshore business relative to domestic lending. This outlook for domestic and
foreign credit is incorporated into the baseline projection for a moderately growing economy and the expected
increase in bank net foreign assets.

MACRO-FINANCIAL LINKAGES AND SPILLOVER RISKS
A. Macro-Financial Structure of the Mauritian Economy5
10.
The striking feature of Mauritius’ financial system relates to the enormous size of the
GBC sector, intrinsically linked to the domestic economy through the balance of payments and the
banking system. Profiting from tax exemptions on foreign-sourced income, GBCs have become a
key pillar of the economy6, and account for assets estimated at over US$630 billion, some 50 times
the level of GDP (Figure 2, panel 2). This massive order of magnitude has become evident following
the authorities’ efforts, supported by IMF technical assistance, to collect survey data on GBC1s for
use in balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics. Nonetheless,
GBCs’ statistical coverage has still important gaps as GBC2s remain largely unmonitored.
11.
The GBC sector plays a vital role in financing the balance of payments, offsetting the
large current account deficit for the rest of the economy (13 percent of GDP in 2014).

are with non-residents), they still represent
close to 100 percent of Mauritius’ GDP—largely in the form of domestic bank deposits. In addition,
there are very large (and poorly understood) domestic cross-holdings within the GBC sector (around
300 percent of GDP; Figure 2, panel 4). GBCs also contribute to tax revenues, paying almost

5

Mauritius’ financial system is dominated by banks with around 330 percent of GDP of total banking assets at
end-2014, while the assets of the insurance and pension sectors were equivalent to some 34 and 40 percent of GDP
respectively. Stock market capitalization was about 62 percent of GDP.
6

The offshore sector is made of two types of GBCs: GBC1 and GBC2. As of end 2014, the sector comprised
approximately 10,300 GBC1s and 10,140 GBC2s. A GBC1 is a tax resident in Mauritius and is often used when
overseas income is largely in the form of dividends, royalties, interest and capital gains. A GBC2 is not a tax resident
and can carry out business only with non -residents and in foreign currency. It cannot benefit from DTA treaties, but is
fully exempt from taxes on worldwide profits. The GBC2 license is often used for setting up special purpose vehi cles
for holding shares abroad.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

1.3 percent of GDP in taxes in 2014 (around 6½ percent of total tax collection; Figure 2, panel 5). In
contrast, the GBCs’ direct contribution to domestic employment remains modest (Figure 2, panel 6).
13.
GBCs’ foreign currency deposits are a key funding source for banks, which also have
other large cross-border exposures (Figure 3, panel 1). GBCs deposits account for 30 percent of
the banking sector balance sheet (bank assets stood at around 300 percent of GDP) and bank claims
on GBCs represent about 10-15 percent of domestic credit. GBCs can also hold equity stakes in
banks. In addition, banks have large exposures to non-residents, with deposits equivalent to
22 percent of total liabilities, and cross-border loans in excess of 100 percent of GDP (mostly to
borrowers in India and other countries in Africa and Asia). For the banking system as whole, foreign
currency liabilities to GBCs and non-residents are mostly matched by foreign currency assets7,8.
14.
However, exposures to GBCs and non-residents vary significantly across banks
(Figure 3, panels 3 and 4). Under Mauritius’ single licensing regime, banks are free to operate in
both Segment A business (domestically-sourced income) and Segment B business (foreign-sourced
income, including GBCs and non-residents). Large foreign banks tend to focus on Segment B,
drawing deposits from the most reputable GBCs and lending to their global network of customers
with established credit records. The two large domestic banks are currently concentrated on
Segment A. Medium-sized banks have a mix of Segment A and Segment B operations, potentially
constituting a greater channel of spillover to domestic activity. Reflecting the considerable tax
advantage for Segment B activities (80 percent reduction in the 15 percent corporate tax rate), many
banks are planning to increase their Segment B operations going forward. This is a risky strategy
given the challenges associated with assessing the funding risk from GBCs and non-resident
sources, and the credit and counterparty risks involved in cross-border lending.

7

More than 95 percent of banks’ asset and liability exposures to GBCs and non -residents are estimated to be in
foreign currency. No data are available about currency composition of the entire balance sheet of GBCs, but the
GBC’s nature as a conduit of international investments makes it likely that most of the GBCs’ assets and liabilities are
in foreign currency.
8

Only about 11–12 percent of bank deposits and borrowing by domestic residents (non -GBC) are in foreign
currency. The balance sheet analysis does not show major currency mismatches in the domestic economy, although
there are significant data gaps (see Annex V).

B. Potential Spillover Risks
15.
The balance sheet inter-linkages noted above are a source of systemic vulnerabilities.
A decline in GBC or non-resident foreign currency funding, for instance triggered by a significant
revision of the DTAA Treaty with India or by an intensification of initiatives against tax base erosion
and avoidance, could worsen Mauritius’ balance of payments position, lead to exchange rate
pressure, a weakening of reserves, and rising inflation and external debt servicing costs.
The associated decline in GBC deposits in domestic banks could create deleveraging pressures ,
particularly in any small and medium-sized banks with liquidity-risk management systems
insufficient to quickly mobilize foreign currency assets. The resulting funding need could trigger a
cutback of foreign and domestic credit, and broader confidence effects , which would impact the
domestic economy. Indeed several banks operate within financial groups/holdings or mixed

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

13

MAURITIUS

conglomerates with activities in other domestic sectors. Similarly, the large cross-holdings within the
GBC sector could act as contagion channel. There could also be regional spillovers, given Mauritius’
role as financial hub for foreign investments in Africa. Yet, data and non-bank supervisory gaps
prevent a full analysis of the GBC sector and the risks it poses.
16.
Further integration of the offshore sector with the domestic economy entails benefits,
but also increases potential spillover risks. The authorities aim at promoting the GBC sector as a
conduit for investment into Africa, while encouraging a greater involvement of the GBC sector in the
domestic economy by the introduction of “substantial presence conditions”. Although this greater
interconnection with GBCs may have beneficial effects on domes tic economic activity, the strategy
also raises the risk of inward spillovers from GBC-related volatility.

SAFEGUARDING MACRO-FINANCIAL STABILITY
Policy discussions centered on the mitigation of systemic spillover risks from the offshore sector,
regulation and oversight of the financial sector, and implications for adequacy of reserve buffers and
competitiveness. The recommendations to strengthen the stability of the financial sector are largely
guided by the FSAP.

A. Enhancing Regulation and Oversight of the Financial Sector
17.
The recent collapse of the BAI financial conglomerate highlighted weaknesses in
regulation, consolidated supervision, crisis management and resolution. Although the authorities
succeeded in averting a systemic crisis, the lack of an ex-ante bank and financial resolution regime
and of an explicit deposit insurance scheme (DIS) translated into substantial fiscal costs 9, and potential
moral hazard. This episode also highlighted issues of regulatory forbearance, political leaning, and
coordination problems among financial regulators. The consultation discussions noted the systemic
importance of mixed conglomerates, of which several banks are part, highlighting the importance to
upgrade consolidated supervision and cooperation among regulatory a gencies—in particular
between the BoM and the Financial Services Commission (FSC) 10. The authorities have already taken
steps to improve supervisory cooperation.
18.
Mauritius’ financial stability framework needs upgrading, commensurate with the
scale and complexity of the financial industry. In addition to close cooperation among
regulators, a proper assessment of macro-financial risks associated with banks’ large exposures to
GBCs and nonresidents requires the availability of timely information and strong technical capacity
for risk assessment. The authorities recognize that data gaps and incomplete information hamper
9

The fiscal cost in 2015 was around 1.3 percent of GDP (0.4 percent of GDP in recapitalization, and 0.9 percent of
GDP to refund policyholders; see ¶6).
10

The BoM supervises banks and other deposit taking institutions, while the FSC is overseeing non -bank financial
institutions including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, and GBCs.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

their efforts to gauge and respond to these vulnerabilities. In this regard, they also saw the critical
need to establish a stronger legal ability for the bank regulator to require all information needed to
safeguard financial stability from all financial institutions operating in Mauritius. AML/CFT
supervision and customer due diligence measures need to be enhanced in line with FSAP
recommendations, in order to further protect the financial sector against money laundering risks.
19.
Staff also recommended that the authorities create a macro-prudential authority with
a prominent role for the Bank of Mauritius. Due to the size and central role of the banking
system and its supervisory mandate over it, the central bank is uniquely placed for systemic risk
assessment and mitigation through the deployment of macro-prudential tools. In this context, even
before a macro-prudential authority is formalized, the formation of a permanent technical working
group spear-headed by the BoM’s Research and Supervision Departments, and including
representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the FSC, and the Ministry of Financial Services, should
monitor and analyze systemic risks and regularly report its findings and recommendations to the
inter-ministerial Financial Stability Committee.
20.
In this context, the tax structure affecting banking system activities and uneven
reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits are a risk to financial stability and need to
be corrected. The significant tax ince ntive for Segment B activities distorts the allocation of
resources in favor of cross-border operations, affecting competiveness in the non-GBC sector (see
¶26)11. These distorted incentives are likely to be reinforced by differences in reserve requirements
and remuneration, favoring foreign currency deposits relative to rupee deposits 12. The tendency to
move toward segment B activities indicates that banks may not be internalizing the negative
externality these measures impose on the economy in the form of higher systemic risks.
21.
In addition, a special resolution regime for banks reflecting best international
standards and, subsequently, a deposit insurance scheme (DIS) should be introduced.
Official assistance should be strictly confined to systemic cases and used under clear limitations to
be stipulated in the law. An industry-funded DIS, a key part of the financial safety net, should be
introduced subsequently, with coverage limited to small resident depositors only, and be given
powers to facilitate resolution operations. The authorities recognize that improving the resilience of
the banking sector also requires ensuring adequate loan-loss provisioning and promoting better
foreign currency liquidity management by banks.

11

Bank Segment A business has a significantly higher tax rate (10 percent special levy on top of the customary
15 percent tax rate) than Segment B business (80 percent rebate on the customary 15 percent tax rate).
12

Banks need to have reserves equal to 9 percent of do mestic deposits and 6 percent of foreign currency deposits. In
addition, foreign currency requirements are remunerated (based on central bank interest rates), while local currency
deposits are unremunerated.

MAURITIUS

Box 2. Key Policy Recommendations from the 2015 FSAP

Introduce prudential requirements on domestic and foreign currency liquidity. The introduction of a
Liquidity Core Ratio by currency would mitigate liquidity risk, especially in foreign currency, and promote
better foreign currency liquidity management by banks. The prudential limits could vary with the quality of
banks’ liquidity management practices. Consideration should also be given to setting concentration limits on
interbank bank exposures. In addition, to mitigate the risk of systemic foreign currency liquidity stress,
specific reserve requirements on GBC deposits could also be considered.

Improve the supervisory approach for conglomerates and for consolidated supervision. Amend
existing legislation to grant BoM authority over bank holding companies and allow it to monitor intra-group
transactions and those between the group entities and related parties. Dedicated joint or lead supervisors
should be established for each conglomerate and be given adequate on- and off-site supervisory mandate
and resources.

Continue to strengthen the BoM’s capacity to monitor the risks associated with banks’ cross-border
lending. Increased cooperation with host supervisors is recommended for cross-border operations made
through subsidiaries. Where direct cross-border lending takes place, the BoM needs to bolster its capacity to
monitor country risks and understand the nature of the business and the reputation of Mauritian bank
counterparts.

Ensure adequate loan-loss provisioning by banks. Proceed with the planned tightening of prudential
norms on loan classification and collateral valuation.

Enhance the financial safety net and strengthen the crisis resolution and management framework.
Resolution options for systemic and non-systemic cases should be clearly differentiated in the banking law;
the law should also specify the circumstances under which liquidity and/ or solvency support can be
provided. A comprehensive framework for crisis prevention and management (including the preparation of
resolvability assessments for domestic systemically important banks) should be put in place. An industry
funded Deposit Insurance Scheme (DIS) consistent with the rest of the components of the bank resolution
framework should be introduced.

Continue to strengthen the AML/CFT framework to meet the FATF Recommendations. Laws and
regulations should be amended to address the remaining shortcomings, and effective implementation
ensured.

22.
The authorities agreed with the analysis of balance sheet inter-linkages, and are taking
steps to mitigate spillovers and financial stability risks. They acknowledged the need to upgrade
the supervision of the offshore financial sector. A technical group to enhance systemic risk
assessment has been set-up and the authorities will seek a continued dialogue with staff as work
progresses. They are also committed to ensuring that that the BoM and FSC work closely together
to assess and mitigate systemic risks. The BoM plans to enhance its ability to collect data to monitor
financial stability issues. It has also put forward legislation to strengthen regulation by giving the
central bank authority to regulate bank holding companies. Legislation on consolidated supervision
is also planned. A draft bill on Deposit Insurance is already underway, though this should be aligned
with the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems and good international practices.
The authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to support this reform process.

B. Reserve Buffers, Exchange Rate, and Monetary Policy
International Reserve Buffers
23.
International reserve buffers are in-line with standard rule-of-thumb thresholds of
reserve adequacy. Indicators such as the coverage of imports, broad money and short-term debt
suggest relatively solid foreign exchange buffers. International reserves (US$4.2 billion at end-2015)
are equivalent to more than 100 percent of short-term debt; 6.6 months of prospective imports; and
36 percent of broad money.
24.
However, international reserve buffers may not be sufficiently strong for the risks that
could be posed by the financial sector. Annex IV suggests a tailored reserve adequacy metric,
including a role for GBC deposits and taking into account banks’ liquid assets in foreign currency,
and compares reserve adequacy metrics in Mauritius to other emerging markets and financial
centers. This assessment suggests the need to build stronger buffers against external shocks, by
considering insurance mechanisms such as swap arrangements or credit lines with other central
banks as well as a revision of reserves requirements for foreign currency deposits .
After strengthening the prudential framework for liquidity management, the authorities should also
consider creating a limited foreign currency Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) facility mainly
targeted at small and medium-sized banks, with strict access limits, at penalty rates, and backed by
high quality foreign currency-denominated collateral.
25.
The authorities shared the view that the complexity of the financial sector interlinkages should be taken into account in gauging the adequacy of reserves. They noted,
however, that the sterilization costs involved would reduce the appeal of a faster accumulation of
international reserves. They agreed with staff that further analysis of foreign-currency liquidity
management capacity in individual banks is needed to gauge more accurately risks from a decline in
GBC activities on reserves. The authorities are committed to conducting a bank-by-bank analysis to
assess the share of foreign currency deposits not secured by liquid assets or credit lines. In parallel,
they are considering options to seek insurance against balance of payments shocks.

Exchange Rate Policy
26.
Staff analysis suggests that with continued GBC balance of payments inflows, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) appears broadly in line with fundamentals. Results from the
standard exchange rate assessment for developing and emerging markets suggest that the
deviation of the Mauritian Rupee from its equilibrium level is limited (less than 5 percent). This result
is contingent on continued large inflows from the GBC sector, which, as noted abo ve, contributed
more than 7 percent of GDP to Mauritius’ current account balance, and more than 15 percent of
GDP to the capital and financial account balance in 2014. The exchange rate assessment is therefore
highly dependent on these GBC flows. For instance, as an illustrative exercise, excluding GBC flows
from the current account balance would imply other things equal, an over-valuation of the exchange
rate by more than 25 percent.
Monetary Policy
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the monetary policy stance is broadly
appropriate against the backdrop of subdued inflation, which is expected to continue over the
medium-term. Against this background, monetary policy should remain cautiously accommodative,
and the BoM should continue to reduce excess domestic liquidity in a gradual fashion to avoid
sharp rises or volatility in interest rates.
28.
Indeed, despite the authorities’ recent efforts, the monetary policy transmission
mechanism remains hampered by excess domestic currency liquidity in the money market.
Liquidity accumulated over the past few years, mostly due to the conversion of government’s
external borrowing into domestic currency, and to the accumulation of reserves through unsterilized
intervention during 2012–14. Since early 2015, the authorities ramped up efforts to mop up the
excess liquidity, which has fallen from a peak of more than Rs16 billion in April 2015, to under
Rs6 billion in September 2015, though excess liquidity edged up to around Rs 10 billion in December
2015 (Figure 4, panel 1). The decline in excess liquidity has been achieved through the issuance of

BoM bonds and Treasury bills, as well as sterilized interventions in the foreign exchange market.
Interest rates on Treasury bills have started to rise towards the policy rate as e xcess liquidity has

29.
The authorities intend to continue to reduce excess domestic liquidity. They expect that
it will help improve the responsiveness of Treasury bill yields—which are closely aligned with bank
deposit rates—to changes in the Key repo rate or policy rate (Figure 4, panel 2). Over time, this is
expected to improve the monetary transmission mechanism. Nonetheless, declining excess liquidity
could affect a range of market interest rates, not just the Treasury bill rate, and overall money
market conditions should continue to be monitored as excess liquidity declines.

SHORING UP THE FISCAL SITUATION AND
SUPPORTING GROWTH
30.
The 2015/16 budget implied a continuation of the expansionary trend of the last three
years. It involved an overall borrowing requirement of 4.0 percent (compared to 3.8 percent in
2012-14 and 4.4 percent in 2014) and a primary deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP (compared to
1.7 percent in 2014). The budget assumed a generous growth pickup of 5.3 percent in 2015/16, and
significant upward pressures on current spending, including social benefits (with the increase of the
Basic Retirement Pension, BRP) 13, wages (with recruitments in the civil services and public wage
negotiation round under the Pay Research Bureau report), and purchase of goods and services.
Payouts to the remaining BAI policyholders and investors could further worsen the fiscal position.

At a cost of Rs4.7 billion per year (1.2 percent of GDP) in the first years, and increasing afterwards.

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

31.
However, budget execution in 2015 involved a welcomed correction in fiscal policy
(see ¶6 and Figure 1). This was the result of containment of spending on goods and services, but
also of lower-than-planned execution of public investment projects. With a view to build on these
encouraging results, the authorities have indicated their intention going forward to further reduce
the overall borrowing requirement to 3 percent of GDP from 2016/17 onwards (which would keep
the primary deficit under 1 percent of GDP), in order to adhere to the timeframe legally set for
reaching the statutory debt target (50 percent of GDP by 2018/19). Measures to reduce the deficit
would include: (i) further efforts to improve revenue mobilization and broaden the tax base;
(ii) rationalization of spending on goods and services; and (iii) tight control of civil servants’
compensation. In addition, the authorities are preparing a plan for divestiture of public assets
targeted at debt reduction. The greater role envisaged for the private sector in infrastructure
upgrading would further support efforts to contain public borrowing, thereby increasing the scope
for crowding-in private sector investment financing.
32.
Despite improved fiscal conditions in 2015, containing the primary deficit under
1 percent of GDP may not be enough to achieve the statutory debt target. Under this scenario,
the debt target would be missed by some 4 percentage points of GDP (Text Table 1, baseline
scenario). Reaching the 2018/19 statutory debt target would require a more pronounced and
frontloaded adjustment. This would involve a further decline in the primary deficit in 2016/17 (to
0.3 percent of GDP, 1/2 percent of GDP lower than the baseline), and gradually improving in
subsequent years to reach a small primary surplus (0.3 percent of GDP) by 2018–19. While the order
of magnitude of the additional adjustment involved is feasible, it is important to frame it within a
quantified medium-term debt reduction plan consistent with preserving growth. On the revenue
side, there is space for reducing tax expenditures, and improving the banking tax structure (¶20) and
tax administration. An ambitious divestiture effort would also help reduce borrowing requirements
and debt. An illustrative fiscal path is presented in Text Table 1.

33.
On the structural fiscal front, there is a need to place the design of budgetary policies
within a medium-term fiscal framework. In recent years, the annual budget process has departed
from medium- and long-term objectives. Successive budgets have delayed steering public debt
towards the statutory debt target, to avoid policy adjustments postponed to the future. Despite
introducing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Program-Based Budgeting in the
late 2000s, Mauritius does not have a binding mechanism to ensure annual budgets’ compliance
within a medium-term fiscal framework. The limited involvement of Parliament, beyond voting the
annual budget, weakens the accountability of the budgetary process and prevents an assessment of
fiscal strategies to contain public indebtedness. Going forward, the new Public Financial
Management Act could create the conditions to improve compliance with a medium-term fiscal
framework.

Mauritius faces important challenges as it seeks to escape the middle-income trap.
Mauritius has lost seven places in the 2015–16 Global Competitiveness Report, now ranking
46 among 140 economies (Figure 6). Productivity is eroding, unit labor costs have been rising,
infrastructure needs upgrading, and labor regulation is relatively complex. The population (and labor
force) is projected to start shrinking in the

productivity improvement, including by
investments in human and infrastructure
capital.
35.
The 2015/16 budget outlines several measures to deal with these challenges.
To strengthen the business climate, the authorities envisage, among other things, expanding the
powers of the Fast Track Committee to expedite the approval and implementation of major
investment projects and abolishing a large number of licenses and permits which have become
obsolete. The authorities also target to boost infrastructure through a large investment program. As
part of their program, smart cities would be developed which are environmentally friendly, highly
connected and generate their own energy and water. As part of the authorities’ ambition to create
an ocean economy, major investments in the port infrastructure are planned, expanding the
connectivity of Port-Louis to other ports.
36.
Raising female labor force participation rates could help address the challenges of
population aging and enable the attainment of higher income status (Annex VI). Mauritius
possesses a large pool of educated women who currently do not participate in the labor market.
According to a staff study, this has led to an estimated income loss in the range of 22 to 27 percent
compared to a situation witho ut gender gaps in the labor force (Figure 5). The following options
may be considered to increase female labor participation: (i) promoting part-time work and flexible
work arrangements; (ii) increasing the number of childcare centers compliant with minimum quality
standards; (iii) increasing financial inclusion for women by expanding financial literacy training

targeted at micro-enterprises; and (iv) considering the introduction of paternity leave to level the
playing field in hiring decisions and pay of women and men.

37.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s analysis but pointed to constraints to
implement policies related to traditional gender roles. They intend to continue addressing the
skills mismatch in the economy and plan large investment programs to mitigate infrastructure
bottlenecks. Measures to increase female labor force participation, including through training and
employment programs, are ongoing. However, the authorities suggested that some family policies,
such as paternity leave, might be difficult to implement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
38.
Mauritius’s main macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. The coverage
and quality of key statistics, especially BOP and IIP statistics, have significantly improved, but
there are important remaining gaps in offshore sector data. The GBC survey needs to cover GBC2s
as well as GBC1s and collect better information on linkages between GBCs and domestic economy,
including on GBCs’ cross-holdings and GBCs’ role in conglomerate groups. The authorities are
undertaking efforts to introduce a real estate price index and to strengthen the coverage a nd
accuracy of statistics regarding other financial corporations and sectoral balance sheets, supported
by IMF technical assistance.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Mauritius’s macroeconomic conditions are stable, and the outlook is relatively
favorable. Growth continues to be resilient, albeit moderate, inflation is low and the external
position has improved on the back of low oil prices. Economic activity should also benefit from the

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

23

MAURITIUS

envisaged public and private investment projects aimed at addressing infrastructure gaps.
Further growth pickup nonetheless hinges upon the adoption of policies to support factor
accumulatio n, including by mitigating the projected labor force decline through immigration of
skilled workers and an increase in female labor force participation. The authorities’ efforts to further
diversify the economy, address infrastructure bottlenecks and skills mismatches, and reduce the
costs of doing business are welcome and should help raise the growth potential.
40.
Given the complex inter-linkages between offshore activities, the banking system and
the domestic economy, upgrading the macro-prudential policy framework is an urgent
priority. In particular, a macro-prudential authority with a prominent role for the BoM should be
created to assess and mitigate evolving systemic risks. The results of these risk assessment and
related recommendations should be regularly reported to the ministerial-level Financial Stability
Committee. Given the centrality of the banking system in Mauritius’s financial sector and its
supervisory mandate, the bank regulator is uniquely placed in the effort to improve systemic risk
assessment and mitigation through the deployment of macro-prudential tools. It should have the
power to obtain statistical information covering all relevant actors in the financial system for the
purpose of safeguarding financial stability.
41.
Close cooperation among different regulatory agencies is critical to the success of
systemic risk mitigation efforts. Staff welcomes the recent steps taken by the authorities in this
regard. Nonetheless, a significant improvement in the FSC’s ability to monitor and supervise the GBC
sector is urgently needed, prioritizing regulatory and analytical capacity upgrades to achieve better
risk management and supervisory capacity. Equally important, the information gaps on the GBC
sector and financial conglomerates—which currently impede timely policymaking and systemic risk
mitigation—need to be resolutely addressed.
42.
There is also a need to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, in line with
FSAP recommendations. Given the systemic importance of mixed conglomerates in Mauritius, and
given that several banks are part of these conglomerates, the authorities should improve the
supervisory framework to make supervision of mixed conglomerates and consolidated supervision
more effective. Other areas for improvement include promoting better foreign currency liquidity
management at domestic banks; further strengthening the BoM’s capacity to monitor cross-border
risks; ensuring adequate loan-loss provisioning; upgrading the bank resolution framework; and
subsequently introducing a deposit insurance scheme covering small domestic depositors.
43.
Macro-financial vulnerabilities warrant a further bolstering of foreign currency buffers
against external shocks. This objective should primarily be met by seeking insurance mechanisms,
including swap arrangements or credit lines with other central banks , rather than only by further
reserves accumulation, as the latter could involve sterilization costs or run counter to ongoing BoM
efforts to improve the monetary transmission mechanism by reducing excess domestic currency
liquidity. The BoM should also revise the current uneven framework for reserve requirements and
consider the creation of a limited foreign currency emergency liquidity assistance facility with
appropriate safeguards.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

44.
The monetary policy stance is broadly appropriate given the low-inflation
environment. Further excess liquidity absorption should proceed at a measured pace in order to
avoid any sharp increases in market interest rates.
45.
Staff welcomes efforts to halt the fiscal deterioration observed in recent years, and
encourages the authorities to put in place a credible medium-term fiscal policy strategy in the
context of the next budget cycle. Introducing such a strategy would help re-establish the
credibility of the statutory debt target, particularly if it is underpinned by measures to achieve the
target. In this regard, while recognizing that the government faces a tight trade-off between
spending on social entitlements and a much needed infrastructure upgrade, further efforts are
needed to reduce debt and preserve sustainability based on a multi-pronged approach, with
measures aimed at (i) containing the expansion of current spending through better targeting of
social assistance benefits in favor of the people more in need, and improving efficiency in public
entities; (ii) further broadening the tax base, including by reconsidering tax distortions that affect
both incentives for financial risk-taking and income inequality; and (iii) divesting suitable public
assets with proceeds targeted at debt reduction. An operational framework for analyzing fiscal risks
and contingent liabilities is also urgently needed as Mauritius seeks to leverage Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) solutions to finance its ambitious Public Sector Investment Program.
46.
Going forward, the authorities should address the implications of the projected
shrinking of the labor force, including through policies to encourage greater female labor
force participation. Since Mauritius possesses a large pool of educated women who are currently
not in the labor force or unemployed, addressing this problem could help mitigate the effects of
population aging and the risk of a longer-run decline in potential growth.
47.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12 -month cycle.

Annex I. Mauritius: The Failure of British American Investment Co.
(BAI)
The BAI Group, a mixed international financial conglomerate and one of the largest conglomerates in
Mauritius, comprised a number of entities operating in insurance, banking, asset management, retail
and commercial services, with cross border-operations in other SSA countries. The insurance
company had substantial proportion of its assets invested in related companies . In addition, it issued
single policy premium products promising relatively high returns, but suffering from high lapse rates,
that were only sustainable as long as fresh cash was injected into the scheme from new policies, from
the investment proceeds from old policies (mostly in related companies), or from other entities in the
group. The BAI Group is now being resolved.
The BAI Group collapse has had adverse effects on Mauritius’ real economy, including through the
closure or reduction of BAI’s numerous activities and through its contribution to the low domestic
credit growth. The event also highlights weak consolidated supervision and regulatory forbearance.
The mixed international financial conglomerate had no overall supervisor. The FSC (the non-bank
regulator) had concerns about doubtful practices at the BAI insurer, having long required a gradual
reduction of related-party investments (among others, into the affiliated Bramer Bank). The insurance
company, however, was only put into conservatorship in April 2015, and, importantly, only after
Bramer Bank’s license had been revoked by the BoM following persistent liquidity and regulatory
capital shortages. The bank’s problems had persisted for some time, with persistent signs of
weaknesses and elevated risks. Regulatory forbearance allowed the bank to acquire funding through
attractive rates, and to quadruple its size.
Bramer Bank’s collapse was eventually caused by severe liquidity problems and failure of shareholders
to inject fresh capital. The bank was subsequently transformed into a state-owned entity, as the
authorities believed that a disorderly collapse of the bank could spread through the financial system.
The authorities’ intervention helped preserve financial stability, but encouraged moral hazard and
entailed sizable fiscal costs. The bulk of BAI’s liabilities have been transformed into debe ntures with
payment distributed over five years for a total of Rs12.8 billion (3 percent of GDP). The short-term
fiscal cost is estimated at over 1 percent of GDP. Over time, any recovery of the group’s assets may
offset some of the cost of intervention.

Annex II. Main Policy Recommendations in the 2014 Article IV
Consultation and Policy Implementation by the Authorities


Reducing the fiscal deficit.
Policy recommendation: A frontloaded fiscal adjustment in 2014 is necessary to achieve the
primary fiscal objectives. Staff recommended reducing transfers to state-owned enterprises,
further restricting recourse to the contingency reserve, and limiting spending from special
funds.
Policy implementation: The fiscal stance remained expansionary in 2014 during the period
before the election. The authorities began fiscal consolidation in 2015 by reducing the fiscal
deficit by 0.8 percent of GDP.



Reducing excess liquidity which hinders the monetary transmission mechanism.
Policy recommendations: Staff proposed a mechanism to share the cost of monetary policy
and provide incentives to eliminate the structural excess liquidity.
Policy implementation: Excess domestic currency liquidity increased from about 10 billion
rupees at end-2013 to more than Rs16 billion in April 2015. Since then, the authorities have
ramped up efforts and succeeded in decreasing the excess liquidity to about Rs10 billion by
December 2015.



Addressing external imbalances by increasing national savings and fostering
competitiveness .
Policy recommendation: Saving-investment balances should be adjusted through fiscal
consolidation and pension reform. Investments in infrastructur e and human capital are crucial
to improve competitiveness.
Policy implementation: Private savings and investment further declined in 2014. The authorities
plan to expedite major investment projects to boost growth and competitiveness.



Strengthening financial supervision.
Policy recommendation: Collaboration between the Bank of Mauritius and the Financial
Services Commission should be strengthened.
Policy implementation: Collaboration between the two supervisors has improved with more
frequent communica tion and information sharing. However, the BAI case showed that
weakness remains in consolidated supervision, and data gaps should be addressed to fully
understand the financial inter-linkages between the GBC sector, banks, and the domestic
economy.

Annex III. Mauritius: Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows a moderately deteriorating, but manageable, debt outlook
for Mauritius. Under the baseline scenario, public debt indicators remain below their relevant indicative
thresholds over the medium term. The public debt dynamics are most vulnerable to contingent liability,
real GDP growth, and real interest rate shoc ks. External debt is projected to remain at low levels and to
be financed by multi- and bilateral sources at long maturities and favorable interest rates. The main
risk to the debt outlook remains insufficient medium-term fiscal consolidation to create space for
growth-friendly spending.

Background
The last debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Mauritius was prepared in March 2014 and
concluded that the debt outlook was broadly positive. This exercise updates the analysis within
the template for the market-access countries DSA (MAC-DSA).
Public debt increased for the third consecutive year since 2013, further diverging from
healthier debt levels. The ratio of public debt-to-GDP reached 63.7 percent of GDP for end-2015
from 61.5 percent at end-2014, reflecting upward pressures on spending, the BAI bailout, and the
depreciation of the rupee (see ¶6 in the main text). On current policies, and with plans to ramp up
public investment, reaching the statutory debt target of 50 percent of GDP is unlikely, unless a
different fiscal path is adopted (see Text. Table 1, illustrative scenario).
Despite somewhat elevated borrowing needs, Mauritius has not experienced financing
difficulties and funding public sector debt has remained accessible though relatively
expensive. The 10-year bond yield spread over U.S. Treasury bonds was around 386 basis points at
the September 2015 auction, which was below the 600 basis points threshold for vulnerability.
Additional factors that contain vulnerabilities are: (i) no history of debt difficulties; (ii) external debt
represents only around 20 percent of public sector debt and has very advantageous terms; and
(iii) less than one percent of domestic debt is held by non-residents. However, exposure to the
banking sector is not negligible (see ¶5 in Annex V).
From a structural viewpoint, a medium-term fiscal policy strategy should be defined in the
context of the next budget cycle. Introducing such a strategy would help re-establishing the
credibility of the statutory debt target (see ¶32 in the main text).

Public DSA Risk Assessment
There are limited vulnerabilities with respect to the debt profile as none of the upper early warning
thresholds are reached (Figure 1).

Realism of Baseline Scenario
The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for the present DSA are consistent with the
macroeconomic framework underlying the 2015 Article IV report (see main text). The realism of this
scenario for DSA purposes is assessed in Figure 2. Generally, the forecast errors for Mauritius for real
GDP growth, the primary balance, and inflation (deflator) have been low or at least below the
median, which provides confidence in the forecasts.


Growth. Economic activity is projected to accelerate gradually over the medium term, reaching
4 percent in 2020.



Deflator. Inflation and the deflator should slightly pick to reach 2.5 percent by 2020.



Fiscal adjustment. The overall borrowing requirement is cut to 3 percent from 2016/17
onwards.



Boom-bust analysis. See description in Box 1 in the main text.



Current account deficit. Reflecting capital goods imports for investment projects, the current
account deficit is expected to stay below 5 percent of GDP.

Baseline Scenario
The projection is based on the borrowing requirements identified in the budget. In line with the
authorities’ financing assumptions, external financing is mostly based on previously committed
disbursements. Domestic financing has the objective of tilting the issuance towards longer -term
instruments. The amount of domestic financing is in effect the residual of total financing need minus
available external financing, which is assumed to be mostly on favorable terms.
Under the baseline scenario, Mauritius’s debt outlook has deteriorated and would remain on an
upward path (Figures 3 and 4). The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to marginally from 61.8 percent in
2015/16 to about 61.9 percent by 2020/21. High primary balances and elevated real interest rates,
are the principal debt-creating flows in the forecasting period, but the overall debt trajectory is
sustainable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

39

MAURITIUS

Debt levels (Figures 3 and 4). On current policies, the debt outlook is projected to remain broadly
unchanged in the medium-term, as the government increases the role for the private sector in
infrastructure upgrading (¶31).

Stress Tests
The baseline is vulnerable to downside risks on real GDP growth, primar y balance, and real interest
rate (Figure 5):


Growth shock. A lower real output growth by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in 2015
would have significant impact on the level of debt, which would reach 64 percent of GDP in
2021.



Real interest rate shock. An increase in the sovereign risk premia by more than 200 basis
points (bps) starting in 2018 would raise the effective interest rate paid on public debt by about
100 basis points in 2018 and by about 240 basis points in 2021, reflecting a maturity structure
that is tilted toward the medium term.



Primary balance shock. A scenario involving a deterioration of the primary balance of about
0.7 percent of GDP over the next two years increase the gross debt-to-GDP ratio slightly
compared to the baseline.



Combined shock. In a scenario with all the above shocks combined into a single scenario, the
debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 62 percent in 2017 and to about 70 percent by 2021. Similarly,
debt-to-revenue ratios and gross financing needs would also rise in the projection period.
Most of the deviation from the baseline would be driven by the growth and real interest rate
shock.

External Debt Sustainability
External debt dynamics remain sustainable under the baseline scenario (Figure 6 and Table 1).
External debt is estimated at 24 percent of GDP at end-20152. Banks’ gross external liabilities are not
included in the external debt figures as they are matched by external assets almost twice as large
(see Figure 3, panel 1 in the main text). As standard practice in many international fina ncial centers,
it would be misleading to include bank external liabilities in the country’s external debt measure for

2

Numbers were revised to include private external debt transactions as reported in the 2011 Foreign Assets and
Liabilities Survey (FALS).

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

DSA purposes. External debt is projected to increase slightly initially and then decline over the
medium-term, as authorities continue to take advantage of concessional long-term financing from
multilateral and bilateral sources.
The external debt outlook is vulnerable to shocks on non-interest current account and large
exchange rate depreciations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that Mauritius’ external debt remains
resilient to interest rate and growth shocks, but a 30 percent real depreciation would push the
external debt-to-GDP ratio to 31 percent in 2021. A current account deficit that is 3 percentage
points larger than projected in the baseline would also cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase to
close to 28 percent by 2021. Hence, moderating the non-interest part of the external current
account balance would be important to maintain external debt sustainability.

Conclusion
The public debt outlook remains broadly positive, although it has weakened somewhat compared to
the last DSA. Further improvements to this outlook could derive from the planned medium-term
fiscal consolidation and further structural reforms to improve growth prospects and
competitiveness.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

Annex IV. Mauritius: External Balance and Reserve Adequacy1
Based on the exter nal balance assessment for emerging mar kets and developing countries (“EBA -lite”),
Mauritius’ real effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals. A preliminar y
assessment of international reserve adequacy suggests that the adequacy of reserves largely depends
on the nature of GCB’s liabilities on whic h further information is needed.

A.

Recent Balance of Payments Developments

1.

External sector developments (Figure 1). After being on an appreciating trend over the last

decade, Mauritius’ real effective exchange rate depreciated by more than 2 percent year-on-year in
November 2015. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 5 percent in 2015, mainly on
account of the decline in import prices of fuel and other commodities. In the medium-term, the
current account deficit is expected to decline below 5 percent of GDP, due to continued low oil
prices and in line with government’s consolidation plans. The current account deficit would be fully
financed, with continued substantial inflows from the Global Business Companies (GBCs).
International reserves would continue to build up above 6 months of prospective imports
accordingly.

B.

External Balance Assessment

The results of an assessment based on the macroeconomic balanc e approach and index real effective
exchange rate approach for developing and emerging markets (“EBA -lite”) suggest that Mauritius’s
real effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals. However, this assessment is
contingent on contingent on continued strong GBC net inflows into Maurit ius’s Balance of Payments.

Macro-Balance Approach
2.

Methodology. EBA-lite’s macroeconomic balance approach determines the current account

misalignment as follows:

The current account misalignment (
account in 2015 percent of GDP in 2015 (

and the current account norm implied by the

methodology (

). This norm consists of the

(the predicted value of Mauritius’s

current account based on the country’s fundamentals and policies) adjusted by a policy gap which
relates Mauritius’s policies not only to its optimal policies but also to the average policy
misalignment in the rest of the world.
3.

Staff assumes no national policy gap except for the fiscal stance for Mauritius in 2015.

The following considerations were taken into account in terms of national policy gaps:


The openness of the capital account appears appropriate so that international reserves
misalignments do not contribute to the policy gap.



A statistical benchmark (FinStat 2015) implies that private sector credit to GDP in Mauritius is
broadly in line with the median implied benchmark level (Figure 2, panel 1).



For the fiscal stance, we choose the medium term fiscal projection as a proxy for the optimal
(somewhat tighter) fiscal policy in 2015.

Consequently, the total policy gap for Mauritius is a combination of its national fiscal policy gap and
the stance in the other policy relevant variables compared to the policy gap in the rest of the world.
With the national and world policy gaps offsetting each other, the contribution o f policies to the
current account misalignment is lower than 0.1 percent of GDP.
4.

The macro-balance approach suggests that Mauritius REER appears broadly in line

with its fundamentals in 2015 (Figure 2, panel 2). The current account benchmark implied by the
macroeconomic balance approach is -3.9 percent of GDP. The actual current account balance has
improved to -5.1 percent of GDP in 2015. The implied misalignment of the current account is
therefore -1.2 percent of GDP, implying an economically insignificant overvaluation of the REER by
less than 3.7 percent if conservative standard elasticities are used, or an even smaller overvaluation
using Mauritius-specific elasticities.

adequacy metric to account risks from the global business sector. This note assesses Mauritius’
reserves adequacy using a combined metric which captures typical emerging market vulnerabilities
from the following risks: lower export income (X), lower rollover rates of short-term debt (STD),
non-resident capital outflows proxied by the sum of portfolio liabilities and other liabilities excluding
short-term debt (OL), and resident capital flight proxied by broad money (M2). In addition, it
augments the standard metric to account for the complexity of the interactions of the Mauritian
Global Business Company (GBC) sector with the financial sector by including a portion of GBC
deposits at domestic banks, consistently with FSAP findings of vulnerabilities of the financial system
to disruptions in foreign currency funding and taking into account the liquidity of commercial banks’
foreign currency assets. These elements are then combined to a reserve adequacy metric as follows:
+idiosyncratic factors
International reserves buffers appear lower than advisable according to this approa ch (Figure 4).
Augmenting the standard metric with GBC deposits, to capture the importance of the sector in
addition to standard factors of vulnerability, implies an advisable reserve level in a range covering
100 to 150 percent of this metric.

2

Similarly to the macroeconomic balance approach, the REER implied by Mauritius’ macroeconomic fundamentals
appeared higher than the actual level of the REER over the last five years. However this difference had been mainly
driven by large stocks of net foreign assets, largely driven by GBCs.

Annex V. Sectoral Macroeconomic Risks: Balance Sheet Analysis
for Mauritius 1
A shock in the offshore/nonresident sector could spill over into the domestic economy through the
banking sector, which has large exposures to the offshore sector and nonresidents for both assets and
liabilities. However, significant data limitations limit the scope and accuracy of the Balanc e Sheet
Analysis (BSA), particularly in the offshore sectors.

A.

Motivation

1.

The Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) can provide an overall picture of inter-sectoral

linkages in the economy. In particular, this tool facilitates the understanding of foreign currency
risks and external vulnerabilities for each sector, as well as possible contagion risks emanating from
mismatches in assets and liabilities in a given sector, or external shocks. The approach visualizes
possible contagion channels by showing sectoral asset and liability exposures to other sectors. In the
case of Mauritius, the analysis is centered on inter-linkages between the enormous Global Business
Companies (GBC) sector and other domestic sectors, but other linkages among domestic sectors are
also examined to understand possible contagion channels of crises triggered by the offshoreonshore linkages.

B.

Sectoral Balance Sheet of Mauritius

2.

Due to the limited data availability, the sectoral balance sheet of Mauritius is compiled

with various assumptions and estimations. Although data compilation and dissemination is well
advanced in Mauritius compared with other African countries, there are still significant data gaps.
As a result, a number of assumptions are needed in compiling sectoral balance sheets. The main
data gaps exist in the following areas.
The aggregated balance sheet data of entire GBC sector are not available. The authorities’ survey



covers only GBC1s and GBC2s are not covered 2. In addition, the size of GBCs’ claims on and
liabilities to other domestic sectors is not available in the survey. Therefore, in this exercise, the

There are two types of GBCs. A GBC1 is a tax resident in Mauritius, subject to low corporate tax rates and able to
take advantage of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA). A GBC1 can conduct businesses with residents.
A GBC2 has non resident status on purpose of taxation, but should be treated as a resident in a statistical point of
view. GBC2 can only carry out businesses with nonresidents. GBC2s, which are currently not covered by the
International Investment Position statistics or in this exercise, are estimated to have assets of about 10 times GDP.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

GBCs’ sectoral balance sheet only represents GBC1s, and asset/liability exposures between GBCs
and other sectors are estimated with various assumptions.


The Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS) do not cover Other Financial Corporations (OFCs),
including insurance, pension funds, investment managers, etc. The sectoral and currency
breakdown of the OFCs’ assets and liabilities are estimated from balance sheets of individual
OFCs with various assumptions 3.



Sectoral balance sheet data which separately show non-financial corporations and households
are not available. Therefore, both of the two sectors are categorized as “non-financial sectors” in
this exercise.



The balance sheet of the general government is estimated from individual components of the
sector, such as the budgetary central government and the National Pension Fund (NPF).



Data regarding the maturity of exposures (long-term or short-term) are available only for a very
limited number of categories. Therefore, the balance sheet analysis does not assess risks derived
from maturity mismatches.



Non-financial assets (including tangible assets) and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities are
not recorded in the sectoral balance sheets.

3.

The Mauritian economy is characterized by a huge external asset and liability position,

while having a net asset position as a whole. Table 1 shows the aggregated assets and liabilities
positions of each economic sector in Mauritius, as well as of nonresidents’ assets and liabilities to
Mauritius residents. Liabilities of the nonresidents (towards Mauritius) are higher than claims of the
nonresidents on Mauritius, which means that residents of Mauritius have more claims on
nonresidents than their external liabilities. It could be highlighted that both the GBC sector and the
non-GBC domestic sectors have a net asset position to rest of the world. However, the enormous
gross size of assets and liabilities, at more than 35 times GDP, suggests that a small change in values
or a shortage of liquidities could result in a severe consequence for the Mauritian economy.

3

It should be noted that the balance sheet of the OFCs as at end -2014 does not show the picture of the sector after
the failure of BAI in 2015, which held the largest life insurance company in Mauritius in the group before it failed.

Commercial banks could be the key channel of spillovers due to their large exposures

to the GBC sector and nonresidents. As Figure 1 illustrates, the macro-financial structure of
Mauritius is characterized by the huge GBC sector primarily connected with the rest of the world by
more than 30 times GDP of assets and liabilities, respectively. While the GBC sector is sometimes
recognized as an “offshore” financial sector, the sector has sizable linkages with “onshore” domestic
sectors, including commercial banks and non-financial sectors 4. GBCs’ deposits, as well as
nonresidents’ deposits and loans, are a major funding source of banks, and a vast majority of the
claims on and liabilities to external/GBCs are denominated in foreign currencies. If the banks do not
have adequate liquid assets in foreign currencies, sudden withdrawal of the GBC/nonresident
deposits could trigger a banking pressures. As most banks deal with both offshore/external and
domestic business, turmoil in the offshore banking business could spill over into dome stic sectors.

4

The size of assets and liabilities between GBCs and the non -financial sectors are estimated from inadequate data
with various assumptions.

Note: Size of each column does not necessarily represent the size of the balance sheet of the sector.

5.

Besides the banks’ linkages with GBCs and nonresidents, the balance sheets of

domestic sectors do not show significant imbalances which could trigger a crisis.
However, prudent fiscal policy is necessary to contain the government indebtedness.


General government: The overall net asset position is negative, and accumulated debt is a
principal concern for the sector. The government’s negative net asset position of 47 percent of
GDP is mainly due to the accumulation of government debt. The largest holder of government
bonds is the banking sector (at 19 percent of GDP). The external liabilities of the gene ral
government account for 13.4 percent of GDP, while 55.1 % of GDP are from domestic sectors.
Therefore, it can be said that the creditors to the general government are well dive rsified, which
could contain a risk of a specific sector’s herding sale of government bonds making
government’s funding difficult. However, a systemic event in the banking sector could
significantly exacerbate the net liability position of the government. Fiscal costs in the case of a
failure of any systemic banks 5 could be inflated given the lack of a resilient bank resolution

same time, BoM’s net domestic
liabilities have also increased because of the excess cash holdings by banks.


Other financial corporations (OFCs): The net asset balance is slightly negative. The external
assets of the sector account for only about 10 percent of the total assets of OFCs.



Non-financial sector: It is estimated that the non-fina ncial sector has a net asset position.
However, this is uncertain as the estimation is usually calculated as a residual of other sectors,
some of which are also estimated with various assumptions. Also, as separate data for the
corporate and the household sectors are not available, the indebtedness of the household
sector cannot be analyzed from the sectoral balance sheet. Dollarization in the domestic sectors
does not seem the major risk to the macro-financial system, as only about 10 percent of banks’
claims on and liabilities to residents (except GBCs) are denominated in a foreign currency.

C.

Conclusions

6.

The banking sector could be the main channel of possible contagions. Because of the

banking sector’s large exposures to the GBC sector and nonresidents, shocks in the overseas and the
offshore sectors could significantly affect the balance sheet of banks. A banking distress could
significantly worsen the net liability position of the government, which could trigger confidence
effects in the rest of the economy. Banking regulation to contain credit and liquidity risks in the
sector should be strengthened in order to prevent from serious negative spillovers through the
banks. The government should maintain a fiscal buffer to take a precaution against a possible

banking crisis, and a resilient crisis resolution scheme and deposit insura nce scheme should be
established.
7.

Data deficiencies should be addressed. The BSA would be more accurate if all of the

necessary data were available. There are important data gaps in several sectors which could both be
playing an important role in the financial linkages. In particular, the data related to assets and
liabilities of GBCs should be significantly improved in terms of its coverage, granularity and accuracy.
The compilation of sectoral balance sheets is required for Mauritius to join the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard Plus (SDDS Plus), and further improvements are expected.

Annex VI. Mauritius: Increasing Female Labor Force Participation
to Boost Growth1
With population growth stalling, and dependency ratios expected to rise in the next decades, Mauritius’
growth potential could decline. However, Mauritius possesses a large pool of educated women who
currently do not participate in the labor market. This note estimates that real GDP in Mauritius has
been 22 to 27 percent lower in the past compared to a situation without gender differences in labor
force participation and entrepreneurship. Closing these gender gaps over time could mitigate a growth
slowdown resulting from demographic change. Polic ies to expand the supply and quality of childcare,
the extension of parental leave to fathers, programs to increase financial literacy, and the promotion of
flexible work arrangements can complement programs by the Mauritian government to stimulate
female labor supply.

Stylized Facts
1.

The gender gap in economic participation has been decreasing but remains relatively

high, and female unemployment is substantially higher than that for men (Figure A1).
Female labor force participation (LFP) has increased relative to male LFP in the last decades to the
level of the average middle-income country, but remains far below the level usually observed in
upper middle-income countries. The unemployment rate is more than twice as high for women as
for men and one third of the female youth are unemployed (compared to about one fifth of young
men). Men represent the majority of those who are employed but gender gaps vary across
occupations. Few than one-fifth of employers are female; accordingly, men are more than five times
more likely to borrow to start or operate a business. Female representation in parliament has
dropped to 11.6 percent in 2015, from 18.8 percent in 2014. These inequities remain despite broad
equality in educational attainment at the primary and secondary level and high female than male
tertiary enrollment rates 2. In particular, one fifth of unemployed women possessing tertiary
education.

Implications of Gender Inequality for Growth
2.

An occupational choice model helps quantify the current GDP losses due to potential

misallocations of women in the labor force. This note uses the general equilibrium occupational
choice model by Cuberes and Teigner (2015) in which agents have a random entrepreneurship skill

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

MAURITIUS

that determines their optimal occupation. Agents choose to work as either employers,
self-employed, or workers. However, female labor market frictions prevent an optimal choice of
women into these activities: Only a fraction of women can choose their occupation freely. Out of the
group which is excluded from being an employer, only a certain share can choose to be self employed. Finally, only a certain fraction of women can join the labor market in general. These
frictions – which may reflect discrimination, differences in optimal choices of women, or other
demand and supply factors – are calibrated to fit the shares of female and male employers, ownaccount workers and labor force participants, respectively.
3.

The results suggest that past losses from

gender gaps in the labor market appear
substantial. (Figure A2). The results of the
calibration over the last ten years suggest GDP
losses due to gender gaps in Mauritius have

Closing gender gaps in labor force participation and occupations could mitigate the

effects of the projected demographic change on growth (Figure A3). The model is augmented
to capture the decline in the labor force in the next decades, with the following results:


No change scenario: Gender gaps in labor force participation and occupational choice are at
their 2004–13 average; the size of the working of the population contributing to production is
projected to shrink in line with the projected change in dependency ratio. The projected loss in
GDP compared to a situation with constant dependency ratios would be almost 7 percent by
2035.



Participation adjustment scenario: Gender gaps fall in gender gaps by about 2 percent per year
(in line with the average decline observed over the 2004–13 period) which could mitigate the
GDP losses from rising dependency ratios to 1 percent in 2035.



Participation and occupation adjustment scenario: In addition to the above, occupational gender
gaps also decline by around 2 percent per year on average in this scenario. The GDP losses from
the shrinking labor force would be overcompensated by the close in the gender gaps until 2055.

Policy Options to Reduce Gender Inequality in the Labor Market
5.


Several supporting policies are in place or have been adopted, e.g.:
Employment programs. The Back to Work Program places women over 30 years of age in a job
for a period of six months with the payment of a stipend of Rs 5,000 and the opportunity of
training in a registered institution. Employers are refunded the training cost up to a maximum of
Rs7,500 per woman and the stipend for the placement period. The Youth Employment Program
and the Dual Training Program are additional programs which target the skills mismatch,
benefitting both men and women.



Training opportunities for women are offered in several areas, such as in the manufacturing of
jute products, in catering, garment making and agro-processing, and in information and
computer technology. Around 5,000 women are currently registered with the Women Economic
Council which, among other things, provides capacity building to entrepreneurs.



Maternity leave and protection. The duration of maternity leave has been extended from 12 to 14
weeks.



Child benefits. The maternity allowance has been standardized to Rs 3,000 across sectors, from a
range of Rs300 to 2,000 previously. The limit of payments to a maximum of three children in
certain industries is gradually being removed.

These measures are welcome and should be continued; some could be expanded or

could be complemented by additional policies. As two third of women list homemaking activity
as the main reason for not joining the labor
market (Figure A4) policies could target areas to
facilitate women’s market work vs. homemaking

quality standards.


Maternity leave and protection. If fully paid by the employer and unaccompanied by additional
measures, maternity leave can bias the hiring decisions of employers toward men. The
government could consider significantly expanding current provisions parental leave to fathers,
e.g. by extending the total time of parental leave if a certain part is taken by the father.



In-work tax credits. These benefits can increase labor force participation by individuals with lower
incomes and thus stimulate female labor supply. They could be phased out as income rises to
continue the marginal benefit of entering or staying in the labor force.



Financial literacy. Continue and upgrade measures to provide training in financial literacy to
micro-entrepreneurs, a large share of which are woman.



Promote flexible work arrangements, beyond current provision for part time work in the current
legislation.

7.

The analysis argues for a level playing field on the labor market — without taking a

normative stance. Women worldwide contribute significantly to welfare not officially measured in
the national account, such as by providing care for children and through household activity.
This note’s recommendations do not imply any judgment on Mauritius’s social norms but are meant
to support the creation of an environment in which women can easily participate in the formal
economy, should they prefer to do so.

THE JMAP BANK-FUND MATRIX (2016)
(As of February 5, 2016)
The IMF and World Bank Mauritius teams met on December 3, 2015 to discuss a Joint Managerial
Action Pla n (JMAP). The team from the World Bank comprised of Mr. Sienaert (Senior Economist),
and from the IMF of Messrs. Mecagni, Inui, Touna Mama, Ms. Newiak (all AFR) and Mr. Kerry
(SPR).
The IMF’s work program entails continued engagement through the Article IV consultatio n
process as well as technical assistance in: public financial management, tax administration, and
economic forecasting provided through AFRITAC South (AFS); financial sector stability and
monetary/macroprudential policy frameworks through the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department (MCM), and enhancements to macroeconomic statistics with the support of the
Statistics Department (STA).
The World Bank Group’s work program encompasses infrastructure, trade and competitiveness,
public sector reform and the financial and social sectors. A Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD),
prepared by WBG staff in close consultation with na tional authorities and other stakeholders, was
released in July 2015. The SCD assesses the priorities of Mauritius to accelerate sustainable
economic growth while improving the welfare of the less well off. Drawing on SCD findings, a
new Country Partnership Framework for FY 2016-2020 is under preparation. On-going and
planned Bank assistance to Mauritius includes:


Infrastructure. Advisory services relating to energy and water sector investments are
ongoing.



Policy reform support. The Bank is expected to approve in 2016 a new DPL series. The
operation is expected to support reforms to accelerate regional economic integration
through improvements in trade logistics and services.



Poverty and labor market analytics. The Bank has prepared a report on poverty and
income disparity to analyze the impact that recent economic growth has had on income
distribution in the country. Follow-up work is anticipated to inform policies to address
structural labor market challenges such as large gender gaps and skills mismatches, and
to better understand how Mauritius’ fiscal sector affects the income distribution.



Additional advisory services. World Bank analysis to inform policymaking in the
strategic priority area of developing the “Ocean Economy” is ongoing . Continued World
Bank support for education policy reform and implementation is also anticipated, as is
advisory support as Mauritius seeks to lift its international competitiveness including
through reforms aimed at increasing the ease of doing business.

International Finance Corporation (IFC). The IFC has focused its intervention in Mauritius in the
financial services sector along three axes: (1) supporting the banking sector with access to long
term funding to offset local banks’ difficulty in accessing long term foreign exchange to support
trade finance, cross-border south–south initiatives and long term investments in key

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, there are important remaining gaps
in offshore sector data. The GBC survey needs to cover GBC2s as well as GBC1s and collect better
information on linkages between GBCs and domestic economy. Also, real estate price indices
should be introduced. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this
regard.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: The authorities are in
the process of reinforcing the statistical framework. Already, there were significant improvements
in reducing the errors and omissions category in the BOP statistics.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Mauritius and
by Mr. Siradiou Mamadou Bah, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
March 11, 2016
I – Introduction
My Mauritian authorities would like to express their appreciation to the Staff and
Management for the constructive discussion and policy dialogue held in Port Louis during
December 2015 and in Washington last February under the 2015 Article IV Consultation. My
authorities would also like to express their gratitude for the high quality of policy advice and
technical assistance they are benefitting from the Fund in their efforts to make further
progress in moving Mauritius from middle income to upper income economy status.
In a context of slackened global recovery, notably the subdued activity in its main trading
partners, the Mauritian economy has continued to grow at a commendable pace in 2015 and
financial stability has also been maintained. The authorities’ careful policies and continued
reform efforts have enabled the economy to remain resilient to the recent increased volatility
in emerging and frontier markets. The economy has also benefitted from the decline in oil
and commodity prices and shipping costs reflected by the low inflation. International
reserves have increased to US$ 4.2 billion (over 6 months of imports) by end-2015 and the
current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to about 5 percent of GDP. In addition,
the primary fiscal deficit has remained below budget projection and has improved relative to
2014 due notably to the authorities’ more prudent policy implementation.
For the medium to longer term, the Mauritian authorities are putting in place a reform
strategy aimed at moving the country to a higher income status. In this regard, they intend to
implement policies aimed at addressing structural weaknesses, further increasing
competitiveness, productivity and investment. In this regard, they envisage large public
investments with complementary private investments to boost the country’s infrastructure.
They will also pursue the implementation of their reform agenda to strengthen the resilience
of the financial sector in line with the recent FSAP recommendations. They agree on the need
to upgrade the macro-prudential policy framework with a view to addressing the complex
inter-linkages between offshore and onshore activities including the evolving systemic risks.
Furthermore, the authorities will implement policies to enhance the labor force including
adequate steps to encourage female labor force participation.
II – Economic Outlook and Policies for 2016
The authorities concur that Mauritius’ economic outlook remains favorable with a growth
boosted by continued low fuel prices and the execution of important public and private
investment projects. In this context, policies geared at further strengthening economic
diversification, attract foreign investments and address banking sector vulnerabilities will be
pursued to achieve higher sustainable growth and enable the country to avoid “the middle
income trap”.

2

Fiscal Sector
The budget for 2015/16 is being steadfastly but prudently implemented and is expected to
register a lower deficit than budgeted. However, public debt increased due to the intervention
of the government in the financial sector to help recapitalize two ailing banks and the partial
refund of policyholders in an insurance company. The costs were not excessively high, but
they helped to preserve financial and economic stability. For the next budget, the authorities
are studying additional measures to reduce the deficit and also place the debt ratio on a
downward trend. On the revenue front, the authorities intend to further improve revenue
mobilization and broaden the tax base and they are preparing a plan for divestiture of public
assets to be used for debt reduction. Given the decline in import prices which could adversely
affect revenue from value added tax, the authorities plan to seek technical advice from the
Fund to help them compensate the loss on this front. With regard to expenditure, measures to
rationalize spending on goods and services, and tighten control over civil servants’
compensation will be enhanced. In addition, the scope of private sector participation in
upgrading public infrastructure will be increased thus helping to contain public borrowing. In
order to continue making good progress in the fiscal sector, the authorities concur on the
need to put in place a medium-term fiscal strategy to further strengthen the credibility of
statutory fiscal objectives, including the debt target.
Monetary and Financial Sectors
The monetary policy pursued by Bank of Mauritius will remain cautiously accommodative
to subdue inflation. In the same vein, efforts to gradually reduce excess domestic liquidity
will be enhanced to improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism and without
harming the overall money market conditions. The authorities welcome the analysis stating
that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Efforts to continue
preserving this progress will be pursued with a careful monitoring of continued large inflows
from the global business corporate (GBC) sector.
Although international reserve buffers are in line with indicators such as the coverage of
imports, broad money and short-term debt, the authorities share the view that the complexity
of the financial sector inter-linkages should also be taken into account in assessing the
adequacy of reserves. This entails the need to build stronger buffers to external shocks.
Further analysis in considering insurance mechanisms such as swap arrangements or credit
lines with other central banks as well as a revision of reserves requirements for foreign
currency deposits could be envisaged. The authorities will take all necessary steps to
increase financial buffers deemed critical against balance of payments shocks.
My Mauritian authorities welcome the recent FSAP recommendations which will be
implemented to further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. In view of the
systemic importance of mixed conglomerates of which several banks are part, the authorities
plan to improve the supervisory framework, strengthen the Bank of Mauritius’s capacity to
monitor cross border risks and upgrade the bank resolution framework. A deposit insurance
scheme covering small domestic deposits is being introduced, with Fund technical

3

assistance.
Structural Reforms
The authorities aim to raise Mauritius’s economic growth from 3 percent to 5 percent by next
year and to 6 percent by 2018. To this end, they intend to implement major infrastructure
projects to unleash potential growth in the oceanic sector, ports and trade with the African
continent. The authorities remain committed to needed structural reforms in addressing the
skills mismatch in the economy, increase labor force and fight unemployment among youth
and women. Moreover, the business climate will be further improved with the expansion of
the Fast Track Committee to expedite the implementation of major investment projects by
abolishing a large number of obsolete requirements.
III – Conclusion
My Mauritian authorities are mindful of the daunting challenges they face in their efforts to
move the country to a higher income status. In this vein, they will continue implementing
prudent policies and sound reforms to achieve higher and sustainable growth and increase the
economy’s resilience to shocks. They are grateful for the policy advice and technical
assistance received from the Fund and look forward to continued strong cooperation with the
Fund in achieving their economic objectives.
