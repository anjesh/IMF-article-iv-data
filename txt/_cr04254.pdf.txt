I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Mexico’s political transition to a full-fledged democracy has been smooth, and
important progress has been made in building a sound institutional framework for
policymaking. Prudent macroeconomic policies in the aftermath of the 1994–95 crisis,
combined with the impact of NAFTA and other structural reforms, have boosted productivity
and raised export shares. Inflation has fallen to low single-digit levels. Tight fiscal
management has significantly reduced the public sector deficit and debt, and the debt
structure has been strengthened. Market sentiment toward Mexico remains positive, and
domestic financial intermediation has become deeper and more diversified. These
achievements have allowed Mexico to weather a difficult environment in recent years
without major financial strains or loss of confidence in the policy framework.
2.
Nevertheless, economic growth has been disappointing in recent years (Text
Table 1). After a strong performance during 1997–2000, output fell in 2001 in response to
the U.S. downturn. While growth rebounded in the first half of 2002, it has slowed since,
with real GDP growing at only 1.4 percent in the four quarters ended in the second quarter of
2003. This weakness reflects both the effect of the delayed U.S. recovery and sluggish
domestic spending, especially of business investment. Nevertheless, most observers still
expect the economy to recover in the second half of this year in response to stronger U.S.
activity and favorable financial conditions. Inflation should fall below 4 percent by end-year,
approaching the Bank of Mexico’s (BOM) longer-term objective of 3 percent.

Moreover, progress in advancing the authorities’ structural reform agenda has
been limited in some important areas. The administration remains committed to the reform
program outlined in its 2002 medium-term plan (PRONAFIDE). But support in congress—
where the administration’s party (the Partido Acción Nacional, or PAN) is in a minority—has
been lacking. As a result, while financial sector reforms have moved ahead, less has been
achieved in other areas, notably electricity generation, labor market regulation, and tax

-5-

reform.1 Lack of progress in these areas has dampened private investment and led to
increasing concerns about Mexico’s medium-term competitiveness. The inconclusive results
of the July lower-house elections failed to dispel uncertainties, and political analysts believe
there is only a limited window of opportunity for passing measures before campaigning for
the 2006 presidential elections begins.
4.
The pace of fiscal consolidation has also fallen short of that envisaged earlier.
The broad public-sector deficit for this year is likely to be above that projected in
PRONAFIDE and endorsed by the Board last year, with the favorable impact of higher world
oil prices only partially offsetting a wider non-oil deficit. Public debt has edged up in relation
to GDP, in contrast to the declining path called for in PRONAFIDE. Current spending is
expected to rise further in relation to GDP this year, while non-oil tax revenues will remain
roughly constant at the lowest level in the OECD.
5.
The Fund’s policy advice to Mexico in recent years has focused on the need for
further fiscal consolidation, inflation reduction, structural reforms, financial
modernization, and measures to crisis-proof the economy. In some of these areas,
particularly those under the control of the executive branch of the government, progress has
been impressive, notably in lowering inflation, modernizing the financial system, and
strengthening the structure of debt. Mexico has participated in an FSAP, and was the first
major emerging market country to issue bonds with collective action clauses (CACs) last
March. On the other hand, after marked achievements in the latter half of the 1990s, progress
in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms has recently been limited. The authorities have
broadly shared the Fund’s views on the priorities in these areas, but political constraints have
hindered passage of key reform legislation, as it has been difficult to channel the longer-term
economic benefits of these policies into broad popular support.
6.
Against this background, the main issues in this year’s consultation discussions
were:
•

Structural reforms. The authorities and staff agreed on the need for reforms, which
the authorities aimed to advance in the new session of congress. While
acknowledging the political difficulties, staff emphasized that significant steps would
be needed to meet broadly held objectives for income growth and poverty reduction.
The key areas remained: tax reform to reduce reliance on oil revenues and aid fiscal
consolidation; energy sector reform to increase capacity in line with growing demand;
and measures to raise labor market flexibility.

•

Fiscal consolidation. There was agreement on the need for further consolidation. The
authorities intended to pursue consolidation in 2004 in the context of a tax reform
plan. Staff expressed concern that spending pressures might make it difficult to

Report No.02/237).

-6-

reduce the deficit even if tax reform led to higher revenues, and suggested that fiscal
discipline could be enhanced by setting and regularly updating medium-term
objectives for broad definitions of deficits and debt that would effectively discipline
annual budget formation.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
After a brief recovery in the first half of 2002, real growth slowed to 1½ percent
in the second quarter of 2003 over the previous year (Figure 1 and Table 1). The hesitant
U.S. recovery has played an important role, as almost 90 percent of Mexico’s non-oil exports
are destined to the United States. In addition, Mexico’s export share in the U.S. market has
edged down since late 2002, reflecting both the earlier appreciation of the peso and increased
competition from other countries, notably China. On the domestic side, delays in structural
reforms and uncertainties about regional and global developments have dampened private
investment, while household spending has been held back by stagnant employment.
8.
Slow growth has led to rising economic slack. Capacity utilization in manufacturing
remains below mid-2001 levels, while the estimated output gap has widened to 2¼ percent of
GDP.2 The open unemployment rate has risen to 3½ percent, and the number of registered
workers in the formal sector has declined since 2001 (Figure 1).
9.
Wage growth and underlying inflation have continued to decelerate. Contractual
wage increases fell to 5¾ percent in 2002 from 9 percent in 2001, and further to 5¼ percent
in the first half of 2003 (Figure 2).

As the peso recovered and earlier
price shocks unwound in the first half of 2003, headline inflation dropped to 4 percent in
August, while core inflation has stabilized at about 3½ percent.

The BOM tightened its monetary stance starting in September 2002 in response
to rising inflation expectations, although monetary conditions continued to ease in the
first half of 2003. The “corto”, or borrowed reserves objective, was increased to a record
Mex$700 million by March 2003 as inflation expectations rose well above the 3 percent
target for end-2003. In addition, the BOM shortened the reserve accumulation period from
28 days to one day in April 2003. After rising to about 10½ percent in early March, shortterm market rates fell below 5 percent in July as external financing conditions eased, inflation
expectations fell, and domestic activity remained weak. The staff’s real monetary conditions
index (MCI) suggests that this drop in interest rates, following the earlier depreciation of the
real effective exchange rate, led to a significant easing in monetary conditions from early
2002 through mid-2003 (Figure 2).3
11.
The current account deficit narrowed to 2¼ percent of GDP in 2002, and
declined further to 1¼ percent in the first half of 2003. Stagnant non-oil export volumes
since 2001 have been more than offset by higher oil exports and a contraction in imports
(Figure 3 and Table 2). In addition, external interest payments have fallen in an environment
of declining interest rates, while remittances from abroad have risen. The deficit has been
largely financed by FDI inflows. Private external borrowing has moderated since mid-2002,
as firms have increasingly switched from foreign to domestic capital markets to meet their
financing needs.
12.
Financial strains in the region, increasing global risk premia, and concerns
about the pace of structural reforms weighed heavily on the peso during 2002. About
half of the real effective appreciation of nearly 30 percent during 1999–2001 was unwound
by early 2003 (Table 1). The peso then recovered somewhat from March to June 2003, as
global uncertainties declined and a new plan for moderating reserve accumulation was
announced. It fell back to near earlier lows during the summer, however, as domestic interest
rates declined further and concerns were raised in markets about external competitiveness.
13.
A new reserve management mechanism was implemented in May to slow the
pace of reserve accumulation and lower the cost associated with carrying those levels of
reserves. Up to this time, the authorities had followed an approach of buying all of the net
foreign exchange receipts of the federal government and PEMEX, and raising net
international reserves (NIR) by an equivalent amount. The new mechanism involves selling

3

The MCI is a weighted sum of the real effective exchange rate and the real short-term interest rate
(the 28-day cetes rate less a survey measure of inflation expectations), with weights of 0.25 and
0.75 respectively. The weights are based on typical values for other open economies with trade shares
similar to Mexico’s.

half of the BOM’s accumulation of reserves in the previous quarter to the market, as
discussed in Box 1.4 From the time the mechanism was implemented in May through endAugust, NIR fell by about US$2 billion to US$51.5 billion, both because of sales of reserves
under the mechanism and the foreign currency needs of the federal government. Gross
international reserves amounted to 137 percent of estimated short-term external debt by
residual maturity at end-March 2003.
14.
Progress in fiscal consolidation was limited in 2002 (Figure 4 and Table 3). The
public sector borrowing requirement excluding nonrecurring revenues, or the “augmented”
deficit—at 3.4 percent of GDPwas below the budgeted level, primarily due to higher oil
revenues, lower interest costs, and shortfalls in public investment spending from budget
estimates.5 Non-oil tax revenue also fell well short of budget, however, reflecting lower-thanexpected gains from tax and administrative reforms and weak activity. The ratio of gross
augmented public debt to GDP rose to 49½ percent in 2002 from 48 percent in 2001, largely
because of a rise in the peso value of external debt due to currency depreciation.
15.
The 2003 budget calls for the augmented deficit to remain unchanged at
3.4 percent of GDP, compared with the PRONAFIDE objective of just below
3.0 percent. During the first half of the year, revenues were boosted by unexpectedly high oil
prices and nonrecurring revenues. The outturn for the augmented deficit was broadly in line
with the budget, however, as expenditures also exceeded previous estimates, and shortfalls in
income tax revenues were only partially offset by strong VAT receipts.6
16.
Bank balance sheets have strengthened significantly in recent years.
Nonperforming loans have fallen, while loan-loss provisions have increased. In addition,
further steps have been taken to increase the system’s resilience to shocks and bring it into line
with Basle Core Principles, including strengthening the prudential framework, harmonizing

4

An accompanying selected issues paper on reserve adequacy examines the implications of the
mechanism for reserve accumulation.
5

This measure of the deficit includes both the traditional deficit around which the formal budget law is
drafted, as well as other public sector borrowing requirements. As indicated in Table 3, the main
components of the latter are the servicing cost of debt issued for bank restructuring (IPAB and
FARAC), borrowing associated with public investment projects (PIDIREGAS), and financial
requirements of the development banks. Similarly, the “augmented” stock of public debt adds the debt
associated with these operations to the traditional definition.
6

During the first half, income tax revenues fell short of the budget by over 0.2 percent of GDP due to
late changes to the tax law and a Supreme Court ruling against the salary credit tax (ISCAS)
introduced in 2002. It is unclear how many firms will receive reimbursement of the ISCAS, but the
cost is estimated at 0.1–0.3 percent of annual GDP. Higher VAT receipts reflected changes in payment
modalities, specifically a shift to monthly payments and to cash versus accrual accounting.

Mexico’s financial vulnerability indicators compare favorably with
several other emerging market economies with floating exchange
rates. At end-2002, Mexico’s reserves were equivalent to 126
percent of short-term debt with a remaining maturity of less than a
year, and 100 percent of gross external financing requirements, up
from 105 percent and 86 percent respectively at end-2001 (see
figures). In terms of foreign currency deposits at banks, reserves
reached about 740 percent at end-2002.

Under the mechanism, reserve accumulation depends principally on
oil export receipts and government financing operations (including
PEMEX) in international markets. Initial estimates (by market
analysts and the BOM) suggested that total sales in 2003 would be
US$3–4 billion. Given the volatility in oil prices, it is difficult to
anticipate the outcome for the remainder of the year.4

Based on current projections for the balance of payments, it is
estimated that, to maintain recent ratios of reserves to short-term
debt and gross financing requirements, the BOM must accumulate
reserves of about US$2½ billion per year on average. Projections of
actual reserve accumulation are sensitive to assumptions for oil
prices and external financing. Assuming these determinants do not
deviate markedly from recent levels, reserves would accumulate at a
rate that would maintain or raise reserve adequacy ratios.

1/ “Carry cost” is defined as the opportunity cost of holding international reserves as opposed to domestic assets.
2/ “Quarter” refers to a three-month period starting one month after each calendar quarter, e.g. May to July.
3/ However, if the amount to be auctioned in any quarter is less than US$125 million, the mechanism would be temporarily suspended.
Reactivation will not take place until there is an accumulation of reserves greater than US$250 million.
4/ The precise impact is difficult to judge, as the oil price assumptions underlying the initial estimates were not specified. In general,
given the current level of oil exports, each US$1 per barrel decline in the world oil price reduces annual export receipts by US$750
million. The historical “beta” between reserve changes and oil export receipts is about 0.3.

Market sentiment toward Mexico remains generally positive, as reflected in its
investment-grade status.8 Turbulence in emerging markets in 2002 was weathered well, and
sovereign bond spreads have declined to a range of 200–250 basis points since March 2003
(Figure 5). The government has already completed its 2003 external financing requirements,
including the successful issuance of three bonds with collective action clauses (CACs). In
addition, Mexico became the first country to redeem all of its Brady bonds.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
21.
While recent indicators have been mixed, activity is still expected to gather
strength in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. The staff projects GDP growth of
1½ percent for 2003 as a whole, rising to 3½ percent in 2004. Demand is expected to be
boosted by U.S. recovery, reduced global uncertainties, real exchange rate depreciation, and
improving credit availability as a result of financial sector reforms.9 Headline inflation is
expected to fall below 4 percent by end-year (the upper limit of the BOM’s “variability
interval”), and converge to 3 percent by end-2004. The current account deficit would widen
somewhat to 2½ percent of GDP in 2004 as world oil prices fall back (Text Table 2).

Despite the boost to revenues from higher oil prices, the augmented deficit is
projected to remain roughly in line with the budget at 3.3 percent of GDP in 2003.10
Higher oil revenues will be partly spent on public investment, and also used to offset lower
non-oil revenues. Expenditure is also expected to exceed budget estimates, in part due to the
cost of the voluntary separation program and higher spending by public enterprises. As a
result, the non-oil primary deficit would increase by 1½ percent of GDP. While this widening
would provide support to activity, underlying consolidation would fall substantially short of
the path envisaged in last year’s PRONAFIDE scenarios. In particular, there would be
significantly greater reliance on oil and nonrecurring revenues, and no progress in curtailing
primary expenditure growth. The public debt-to-GDP ratio would edge up for the second
consecutive year, mainly due to exchange rate depreciation and slow growth, in contrast to
the declining path projected in PRONAFIDE.
23.
While the staff’s near-term growth forecast is somewhat below the latest
consensus, the downside risks remain significant. Any further delay in U.S. recovery
and/or setbacks to the passage of structural reforms would adversely affect confidence and
activity. There is also the question of the durability of the decline in global risk premia and
the implications for yield spreads and capital inflows. Beyond the easing in monetary
conditions that has already occurred, there is little scope for counter-cyclical policy actions in
response to adverse developments while the credibility of fiscal and monetary policies
remains to be fully established.
24.
Over the medium term, the
staff projects a return to more
robust growth, but the prospects
depend importantly on the depth of
structural reforms. On the
assumption of partial implementation
of the administration’s reform agenda
(the staff’s baseline scenario), real
GDP growth is projected to average
4 percent during 2004–08. The
current account deficit would widen
to close to 3 percent of GDP,

The WEO projection for 2003 assumes a price of US$23.85 per barrel for the Mexican mix
compared with US$18.35 in the budget. The budget includes adjustors such that, if total revenues
exceed budget estimates, one quarter of the excess should be saved, one quarter transferred to the Oil
Stabilization Fund (OSF), and the remaining half spent on infrastructure projects. In the event of
shortfalls in oil revenues, the OSF could, in principle, be drawn down by an amount up to 50 percent
of its balance. In practice, because the OSF contained only Mex$76 million (0.001 percent of GDP) as
of end-June, expenditures would be cut by practically the full amount of any shortfall.

demand and lower world oil prices (Table 6). FDI would continue to finance most of this
deficit. However, downside risks associated with the difficult political climate for passing
structural reforms remain significant, and continued delays in implementation would likely
undermine activity and investor confidence.11
25.
While high oil prices are likely to hold down the augmented deficit this year,
achieving the authorities’ medium-term objectives and reducing fiscal vulnerabilities
will require substantial consolidation measures. Risks to the fiscal outlook include:
mounting spending pressures; continued weak economic growth; a sharp decline in world oil
prices;12 uncertainties about the scope and impact of tax reform, and the potential up-front
cost of public pension reform. If these risks are realized, little progress would be made
toward debt reduction over the medium term even with substantial consolidation measures in
other areas. To illustrate the impact of a stalling of the fiscal consolidation process, the staff
has constructed an alternative “no policy change” scenario that assumes that no new
measures are taken to reduce the deficit (Box 2 and Text Table 3). Even adhering to this path
would require considerable effort given existing spending pressures and rigidities, as well as
the other risks described above. Under this scenario, the augmented deficit would exceed
4 percent of GDP over the medium term, pushing up gross public debt to 53 percent of GDP
by 2008, as opposed to about 45 percent under the consolidation baseline.

The staff’s projection for potential output growth over this period has been reduced to an average of
3½ percent from 4¼ percent in the 2002 Article IV staff report, in part reflecting a more conservative
assumption about implementation of structural reforms.
12

Oil revenues have increased from just over 6 percent of GDP in 1998–99, when Mexico’s export
price averaged US$13 per barrel, to 7½ percent in 2001–03, with an export price of US$21.20.

Box 2. Mexico: Assessment of Debt Sustainability

The staff’s baseline fiscal scenario projects a decline in
gross public debt from 50 percent of GDP in 2003 to
44 percent by 2008, assuming that consolidation
measures are implemented that lower the augmented
deficit to 1½ percent of GDP over this period (Panel
A). The staff has also constructed a “no policy
measures” scenario that assumes no expenditure
adjustments, with primary spending remaining constant
as a percent of GDP at its 2003 level.1 On this
assumption, the gross debt ratio would rise gradually to
53 percent of GDP by 2008, highlighting the necessity
of pursuing active consolidation measures.

1/ Excluding potential infrastructure investment in 2003 financed out of excess revenues. The increase in the
deficit over the medium term in the “no policy measures” scenario is mainly driven by declining oil revenues.
2/ The staff’s work broadly follows the methodology in “Assessing Sustainability,” (www.imf.org). Its main
departure from this framework is the replacement of the nominal interest rate shock with a two-standarddeviation shock to the real effective interest rate over baseline, rather than its low historical average. An isolated
shock to the nominal interest rate implied an unrealistically large shock to the real interest rate, as nominal
interest rates and inflation were on a sharp downward trend in recent years.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
26.
While the authorities remain committed to further fiscal consolidation, they have
not yet formulated specific objectives for the 2004 budget. They acknowledged that
building widespread political support for further consolidation would be difficult, especially
given the already low level of the traditional definition of the deficit (½ percent of GDP) on
which budget discussions focused. In addition, it was not clear how much revenue could be
generated from tax reform measures in the absence of a political consensus on their scope and
content.13 Staff and the authorities concurred that there was a potential risk that revenue gains
from tax reform could go toward meeting expenditure pressures as opposed to deficit
reduction.14
27.
Staff underscored the need to reinvigorate the underlying fiscal consolidation
process, especially for the augmented deficit and debt. The existing broad debt-to-GDP
ratio of about 50 percent was one that had been associated with financing problems in some
other emerging-market countries in the past. Notwithstanding the strengthening of Mexico’s
debt structure, the recent edging up in the ratio raised the risk of an upward drift that could
eventually trigger market concerns (Box 2). The authorities were confident that the recent
upward movement in the ratio mainly reflected the temporary effects of low growth and real
exchange rate depreciation, which they expected to fade. They saw the most likely scenario as
a steady decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, with continued strengthening in the debt structure.
Adhering to the PRONAFIDE path for the augmented deficit, as the staff advocated, would put
the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. But it would require more ambitious
consolidation measures than implied by recent developments.15 As a substantial step in this
direction, with economic activity expected to recover, the staff suggested aiming at lowering
the augmented deficit to 2½ percent of GDP in 2004, with an associated improvement in the
cyclically adjusted non-oil primary balance of about 1 percent of GDP. While large, this
adjustment would only partially reverse the estimated deterioration in 2002–03 of 1½ percent
of GDP. As conventionally measured, the fiscal impulse would amount to -¾ percent of GDP,
13

It was estimated that the original tax reform proposal submitted in 2001, which would have
harmonized the VAT rate on almost all items at 15 percent, would have raised about 1½–2 percent of
GDP in additional revenues. New proposals are likely to be less ambitious. Preliminary discussion
have focused on: a more modest extension of the VAT that would eliminate some zero ratings but stop
short of a harmonized rate; coordinating the introduction of a state-level VAT; reducing the income tax
rate while broadening the base; and various administrative improvements to reduce tax avoidance and
evasion.
14

An example is recent legislation mandating an increase in education outlays from 5½ percent of
GDP in 2002 to 8 percent by 2006, although implementation may partly depend on the availability of
revenues.
15

Even if future deficits could be held in line with PRONAFIDE, debt paths would be significantly
above those envisaged in the plan.

- 21 -

although the actual contractionary effect would depend on the quality of measures taken and
the impact on confidence in medium-term prospects. Within the context of a substantial
adjustment effect on a cyclically adjusted basis, there could be some scope to allow automatic
stabilizers to operate in response to adverse output developments, although such an adjustment
should be applied symmetrically in the face of favorable as well as unfavorable shocks.
28.
The authorities strongly reaffirmed the importance of meeting announced deficit
targets to underpin credibility. Thus far, annual budget deficits based on the traditional
definition of the deficit had been consistent with the 2002 PRONAFIDE. The emphasis on
observing “headline” deficit objectives was underscored by the design and operation of
budget adjustors that implied spending adjustments in response to unexpected revenue
deficiencies. Consistent with their commitment to retaining credibility, the authorities
believed that the need for fiscal restraint to meet deficit objectives could be even greater if
economic conditions were adverse than if they were favorable, as these would be
circumstances in which market sentiment might be most fragile.
29.
The authorities indicated that Mexico’s definition of the augmented balance and
public debt was broader than that used by many other countries. In addition,
PIDIREGAS borrowing was used to finance desirable public infrastructure investment, and
thus did not reduce public sector net worth. Staff acknowledged that debt issued to finance
productive public investment did not, in principle, reduce net worth, but noted several
practical issues that would need to be addressed in implementing a “net worth” approach.
These included the difficulty in judging the productivity of spending under PIDIREGAS
projects, and the need to take into account other unmeasured government liabilities, such as
unfunded pension liabilities. In any event, staff noted that the level of public investment in
Mexico did not appear high by international standards, and that PIDIREGAS borrowing for
public investment represented less than half of the difference between the traditional and
broad deficit measures, with the balance largely attributable to the servicing costs of debt
issued for bank restructuring. Finally, there was a need to place an important weight on
reducing financing vulnerabilities, which were related to gross public debt as opposed to net
worth.
30.
The authorities believed that, in conjunction with tax reform, it would be
important to enact the fiscal responsibility principles proposed earlier to ensure that
deficits fell from current levels. The proposed principles required, among other things, that
the traditional definition of the budget be balanced over a four-year period. Staff agreed with
the general approach of establishing clear medium-term objectives that would effectively
discipline annual budget discussions.16 In contrast to existing proposals, however, staff
suggested that such a framework be designed around augmented definitions of the deficit and

debt, with proper adjustment for oil revenue volatility; 17 that it allow scope for countercyclical policies as fiscal credibility became well established; and that it set clear objectives
for declining ratios of public debt-to-GDP over time. Staff also emphasized that transparency
would be key in ensuring successful implementation of any fiscal rule and, in this context,
that it would be helpful to focus public debate more on augmented measures of deficits and
debt to inform public opinion about the nature of the fiscal problem.
31.
The mission stressed the need to address the issues identified in the 2002 fiscal
ROSC report. Key recommendations included: aligning the institutional coverage of
government with international standards by excluding commercial public enterprises;
presenting budgets in a rolling medium-term framework with clearly specified fiscal
objectives; and incorporating timely information on sub-national governments in the fiscal
accounts. The staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to publish a revised public sector
definition more in line with the new Government Finance Statistics (GFS) in the near future.
B. Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Management
32.
BOM officials and staff agreed that the recent easing of monetary conditions was
appropriate, given the decline in headline inflation and inflation expectations, lower wage
growth, and indicators of economic slack.18 Prospects appeared favorable for bringing endyear inflation within the upper limit of the “variability interval” (with a target centered on
3 percent, and a margin of ±1 percent). BOM officials noted that, if the global economy failed
to recover in the second half of the year, they would not resist a further market-induced
easing in monetary conditions, provided that inflation continued to converge to target.
Indeed, monetary conditions subsequently eased somewhat through the summer, as the peso
reversed its earlier strength. Nevertheless, the corto was left unchanged as inflation
expectations continued to decline.
33.
BOM officials believed that the corto has been very useful as an operating
instrument. In particular, the approach has allowed the authorities to clearly signal their
intentions in terms of reducing inflation, while allowing relatively large and rapid declines in
interest rates in response to observed declines in inflation. They believe that such movements
would have been difficult to achieve without a loss of credibility if interest rates had been
used as an operating instrument. While acknowledging this advantage during the process of
disinflation, staff was of the opinion that the rather loose relationship between the levels of
the corto and that of monetary conditions could be problematic from the point of view of
keeping inflation within a narrow target range (Box 3). The staff also believed this loose
connection could lead to confusing signals being

In this context, the background paper on fiscal issues notes that the balance in the existing Oil
Stabilization Fund (OSF) is currently almost nil, even though oil prices have consistently exceeded
budget estimates since the OSF was established.

- 23 Box 3. Mexico: The Corto, Monetary Conditions, and Interest Rate Volatility
Monetary policy in Mexico has been implemented since 1995 via changes in the “corto”—the aggregate quantity of funds banks borrow from the
BOM to satisfy the requirement that their reserve balances be zero . The BOM achieves its objective for the corto by adjusting peso liquidity
through open market operations. Borrowing from the BOM takes place at a penalty interest rate equal to twice the market rate. Other things equal,
a higher corto should drive up the expected marginal cost of funds for banks, and thus market interest rates.1
In terms of its general effectiveness, a sustained decline in inflation has been achieved since 1999 using the corto as an operating instrument. At
the same time, in the staff’s view the relationship between the corto and the level of market interest rates has been rather inconsistent (Panel A).
This, according to the staff, raises questions about the tightness of control over monetary conditions in the near term, expressed in terms of
variables that have a more direct link to the economy, such as interest rates and the exchange rate (Panel B). 2The recent sharp decline in market
rates in the face of a high corto underscores such questions. A related question is whether use of the corto contributes to interest rate volatility in
Mexico. In this regard, the staff calculations in Panels (C) and (D) suggest that, while the volatility of the peso has been similar to that of other
countries with floating exchange rates, interest rates in Mexico have typically been considerably more volatile.
The BOM has argued that use of corto allows market interest rates to adjust flexibly to shocks, notably to the exchange rate. The authorities have
also underscored that any evaluation of the efficiency of the corto must be based on its impact on inflation and inflation expectations. They also
emphasized that the corto is a signaling device and that market participants extract the signal of the monetary stance from an information set that
includes monetary conditions, the direction and amount of changes in the corto and, possibly, the frequency with which it is modified. In addition,
they noted that interest rate fluctuations in Mexico have been the natural result of a credible disinflation process carried out in the context of an
instrument with an indirect impact on interest rates. Therefore, the authorities stressed that their objective has not been to reduce interest rate
volatility, but rather to minimize the cost of disinflation, arguing that this is better achieved with an instrument that allows significant flexibility of
interest rates, so that they can be reduced as inflation and risk premiums decrease. Moreover, the authorities highlight the difference between
interest rate volatility and flexibility in the context of a disinflationary process.

sent to markets if the authorities needed to move the corto to offset market-induced changes
in monetary conditions that were inappropriate from a monetary policy perspective. The
authorities disagreed with these views, insisting that the efficiency of the corto must be
evaluated on the basis of its success in contributing to reductions in inflation and inflation
expectations. They also emphasized that the other staff concern is unwarranted, since at
present markets understand very well the way the corto works.
34.
The staff argued that shifting to an interest rate as an operating instrument
would be increasingly desirable as inflation converged to the long-term target. It would
enhance the controllability of inflation, and facilitate the clear communication of policy
actions by tying them to a variable of direct impact on output, inflation, and the exchange
rate. This approach had been quite successful in other countries with inflation-targeting
regimes. The authorities noted that they continuously assess the relative merits of various
policy instruments. Thus far, the conclusion had been that there is no clearly superior
alternative to the “corto”. In particular, given the exposure of the economy to external
shocks, as well as the volatility of domestic markets, use of an interest rate as the operating
instrument could imply large and frequent movements in the instrument, causing excessive
volatility in the exchange rate, inflation expectations, and medium-term interest rates, with
adverse effects on the economy.
35.
BOM officials agreed that further refinements to the inflation-targeting
framework should be considered in due course. They noted that the establishment of a
fixed schedule for policy announcements beginning in 2003 had been effective in improving
transparency and market dynamics. On the choice of the measure of inflation to target, they
concurred with staff that core inflation could be a more appropriate objective from some
perspectives, but felt that there are more advantages in using a broader indicator like the CPI
as a reference index. Regarding the publication of inflation forecasts, BOM officials noted
that considerable information was already provided in monthly inflation reports and quarterly
macroeconomic reviews.19 They also underscored the technical difficulties in producing
appropriate forecasts, especially given the attention that market participants would likely pay
to them.
36.
The authorities are firmly committed to letting the exchange rate be determined
by market forces. In this context, Mexico’s low level of dollarization in the banking system
reduces the macroeconomic risk of currency movements, facilitating greater flexibility in
exchange rate policy.20 The authorities expressed the view that market sentiment toward the
peso had become increasingly symmetric in recent years, with the perceived risks of
appreciation better balancing those of depreciation. This change in sentiment had allowed the

Inflation Report.

exchange rate to provide a useful buffer against external shocks, without jeopardizing policy
credibility. Staff endorsed the transparent approach to exchange rate management in
Mexico’s context, noting that exchange rate volatility did not appear to be unduly
complicating policy formation or undermining macroeconomic performance.
37.
The authorities emphasized that the new mechanism for slowing the
accumulation of foreign reserves did not change their transparent approach to
exchange rate and reserve management. Staff and the authorities agreed that the present
level of reserves was adequate, both in terms of coverage of short-term external debt and
Mexico’s gross financing needs (Box 1). In the near term, assuming world oil prices
remained high, further reserve accumulation was likely under the new mechanism.
Nevertheless, staff noted that the longer-term path for reserves would depend importantly on
the level of world oil prices and public-sector external financing, including the prospect that
some PIDIREGAS projects would be financed domestically.21 In light of these uncertainties,
staff emphasized that the reserve accumulation mechanism should be reviewed over time to
ensure that reserves remain adequate in relation to external risks. The authorities affirmed
their intention to ensure that reserves remained at an appropriate level.
C. Financial Sector Issues
38.
The Mexican authorities have actively pursued reforms aimed at modernizing
and strengthening the financial sector. The 2001 FSSA concluded that the resilience of the
financial system to shocks had increased in recent years, and systemic problems were not
likely. Since then, additional measures have been introduced to reduce the BOM’s credit risk
and increase the liquidity of instruments used for repo operations, in line with international
best practice and the recommendations of the FSSA. The beneficial effects of financial
reforms are beginning to be felt in the form of higher credit growth and diversification of
financial instruments.
39.
The authorities noted that legislation is in progress on a comprehensive
framework for prompt corrective action to resolve problem banks. Key elements would
include a clear timeline for early intervention and resolution, improved coordination among
supervisory agencies, and strengthened rules to dissolve and liquidate banks.
40.
The staff stressed that a significant challenge ahead would be to further deepen
financial intermediation without excessive risk-taking. While expressing confidence in the
stability of the banking system, the authorities emphasized the high priority they attach to
strengthening supervisory oversight of nonbank institutions. They noted that there are no
signs of instability in the nonbank sector, but that rapid growth in recent years warrants closer
supervision to avoid inappropriate risk-taking. The authorities also expressed concern that
21

This would reduce the foreign currency inflows associated with external financing, which are sold
automatically to the BOM.

- 26 -

competition among banks might not be sufficiently strong, as indicated by recent increases in
fees and charges, but emphasized that this would be addressed by measures to increase
transparency of costs as opposed to direct controls.
D. External Sector Policies
41.
Concerns have arisen about the leveling off of Mexico’s share of U.S. imports
since 2001, in contrast to the continuing rise in China’s share (Figure 3). In this context,
widespread complaints have been voiced in the private sector that the renminbi is
undervalued, creating unfair competition for Mexican exports. Staff expressed the view that,
with the peso freely floating against the U.S. dollar, issues of overall Mexican
competitiveness could not be ascribed to nominal exchange rate rigidities in other countries.
It was also unrealistic to expect the Mexican share of U.S. imports to continue to rise at the
pace observed since the mid-1990s, as the share of exports in Mexican output was reaching a
level similar to that in other open economies (Box 4). At the same time, staff and the
authorities agreed that restoring robust medium-term growth in real incomes, while
maintaining competitiveness, could only be achieved through advancing the structural reform
agenda.
42.
The authorities are continuing efforts to liberalize trade outside of North
America, including the negotiation of a bilateral agreement with Japan.22 While the free
trade agreement between the United States and Central American countries could affect
Mexico’s maquiladora sector somewhat, the authorities believed that the impact would be
minimal because of Mexico’s more established trade links with North America, and because
the sectors that would be most affected had already fallen in size. The government is
conducting studies to further examine competitiveness issues, including the impact from the
phasing out of textile quotas at end-2004.
E. Vulnerabilities
43.
Substantial progress has been made in strengthening the structure of public
debt. Public external debt has fallen further from 15 percent of total debt in 2000 to
13½ percent in 2002, and efforts have been made to lengthen maturities and switch to fixedrate instruments. Mexico’s pioneering issuance of international bonds with CACs under New
York law earlier this year reflected the high degree of market confidence in Mexico’s debtmanagement policies.23

22

Mexico has a trade restrictiveness index level of 6 (on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 as most restrictive),
reflecting mainly a relatively high most favored nation tariff of 16.5 percent.
23

Analysis of yield spreads indicates that investors demanded little or no premium for the inclusion of
CACs.

Box 4. Mexico: Changes in the Economy after NAFTA—Benefits and Challenges1
NAFTA has helped spur a dramatic increase in trade and financial flows between Mexico and other member countries.,
Mexico’s exports to the United States and Canada tripled in dollar terms between 1993 and 2000, and Mexico’s trade (the sum
of exports and imports) with NAFTA partners rose from 25 percent of GDP in 1993 to more than 50 percent in 2000 (Panel A).
The agreement contained provisions that improved the relative standing of foreign investors in Mexico and expanded the
sectors in which they could operate. This helped boost FDI flows to Mexico. The share of NAFTA partners in total FDI flows
to Mexico increased from 50 percent in 1994 to roughly 80 percent in
A. Trade and FDI Flows in Mexico
2000.
Stronger trade and financial linkages have affected growth dynamics
in Mexico. Contributions of exports and investment to GDP growth
have increased substantially following the agreement. Recent research
suggests that NAFTA induced a significant increase in total factor
productivity in Mexico.2 Mexican GDP growth rose from an annual
average of 2 percent in 1980-1993 to an annual average of roughly
4 percent in 1996-2002 (Panel B).

Moreover, NAFTA appears to have been associated with significant
changes in the Mexican business cycles. For example, there has been a
moderation in the size of business cycle fluctuations. The agreement has
also fostered an increased synchronicity of business cycles in Mexico
and the United States, as reflected in a marked rise in cross-country
correlations of the major macroeconomic aggregates
(Panel C).
However, the growth of Mexico’s trade with NAFTA partners has
begun to stagnate in recent years. After registering impressive growth
rates in the second half of the 1990s, export growth to NAFTA partners
has decreased substantially during the past two years (Panel A). This
dramatic change has been the result of a combination of cyclical and
structural factors. First, after a prolonged period of expansion in the
1990s, the U.S. economy has slowed during the past two years. Second,
some emerging market economies, particularly China, have been rapidly
expanding their market shares in the United States. Mexico’s NAFTA
advantage could erode in coming years, because the United States has
recently strived to sign new regional and bilateral trade arrangements
through which other developing countries would also gain preferential
access to the U.S. market.
These developments emphasize the importance of undertaking
structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of the Mexican
economy in international markets. For example, it is critical to
undertake reforms aiming at relaxing rigidities in the labor market and
improving the efficiency of energy and telecommunication sectors.

44.
Nevertheless, some vulnerabilities remain in public financing. Three quarters of
domestic debt is still either short-term or linked to short-term interest rates. Furthermore,
gross financing needs of the public sector, estimated at US$78 billion in 2003, are sizable.
The authorities intend to further strengthen the debt structure by continuing to increase the
share of fixed-rate domestic instruments, while lengthening average maturity. This is seen as
complementary to the deepening on the demand side of the domestic bond market associated
with increased activity by institutional investors. Increased demand, in turn, has reflected the
prudent economic policy framework and the resulting rise in credibility and financial
stability.
45.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a projected medium-term current account
deficit of close to 3 percent of GDP was manageable, as long as confidence in policies
was maintained (Table 2). About 70 percent of the deficit would be financed by FDI, and
the remainder by public and private sector borrowing (including PIDIREGAS) and portfolio
inflows. With Mexico’s net external liabilities projected to remain stable at about 40 percent
of GDP, and debt-service payments falling as debt is rolled over on more favorable terms,
medium-term sustainability did not appear to be a problem, provided a prudent policy
framework was maintained (Annex V).
46.
Nevertheless, Mexico’s gross external financing requirements create moderate
potential vulnerabilities to adverse shifts in market sentiment. For this year, gross
external financing requirements are estimated at US$57 billion, equivalent to around
8 percent of GDP. Mexico weathered difficult external conditions last year quite well, as
sustained market confidence and an investment-grade rating have largely insulated it from
financial strains elsewhere in the region. The situation would be quite different, though, if
assessments of Mexico’s creditworthiness were to weaken, increasing the risk of constraints
on market access. In any case, the immediate risks are low, as the government has already
met its external financing requirement for the year and liquid market conditions resulted in
strong capital inflows to the private sector during the first half of the year.
47.
Similarly, constraints on market access could cause liquidity problems for the
corporate sector. Corporate sector results for 2002 suggest that defaults and financing
difficulties were associated with company-specific problems, as opposed to systemic factors.
Stress tests suggest that overall liquidity and solvency would not be significantly affected by
a combined adverse shock of two standard deviations to the exchange rate, interest rates, and
economic growth. However, if these shocks were accompanied by market access limitations
(in the form of only 80 percent rollover of one year’s amortizations), most firms would face
liquidity problems. In such a scenario, gross debt of firms in liquidity distress would amount
to around 3 percent of GDP (Annex IV).

- 29 -

F. Other Issues
48.
The authorities give high priority to improving governance and reducing
corruption, which are serious problems in Mexico. 24 Staff noted that widespread concerns
remained about governance of public enterprises, and suggested that it could be improved
through, for example, the vertical disintegration of PEMEX to foster competition,
establishment of corporate structures that promote greater autonomy, commercial
reorientation of operations, and strengthened regulatory oversight. The authorities indicated
that their strategy consists of improvements in the regulatory framework; judicial reform;
better audits and controls of public sector operations; stricter sanctions on corrupt practices;
more transparency in the public sector; and better administration of public property. Actions
include legislation enabling access to public sector information and mandating financial
disclosure by federal civil servants, and more transparent bidding practices in public
enterprises. Legislation improving private corporate governance and protecting minority
shareholders’ rights has also been enacted.
49.
Notwithstanding the decline in per capita real income during 2001–02, Mexico
has made further progress in reducing poverty. Based on the 2002 income and
expenditure survey and official poverty measures, the authorities estimate that absolute
poverty fell from about 24 percent of the population in 2000 to 20 percent in 2002. The
decline was more pronounced in rural than urban areas. In absolute terms, 3.4 million
individuals moved out of poverty. The authorities' view is that these developments reflect,
among other factors, a strengthening of social programs, increased remittances from abroad
(which are an important income source for the poor), and lower prices of basic stables.25
50.
Mexico is a party to the major international anti-terrorism conventions. It has
endorsed the methodology adopted by the IMF, World Bank, and FATF for assessing systems
to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Mexico is also party to the OECD
convention; a final report on actions in this area is expected to be submitted by June 2004.
The recent passage of the Information Act is aimed at increasing transparency.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
The substantial progress made in strengthening policies in the years immediately
following the 1994–95 crisis has allowed Mexico to weather difficult external conditions
since 2001 relatively well. Progress in policy implementation has continued in important
areas, notably modernizing the financial sector, strengthening the structure of public debt,
24

Mexico ranked 63 out of 113 countries in the latest ranking of corruption by Transparency
International.
25

For example, the coverage of social programs such as Oportunidades and Procampo was extended
significantly (by 70 percent in the case of Oportunidades), while remittances rose from US$6.6 billion
in 2000 to US$9.9 billion in 2002.

- 30 -

and bringing inflation down to low levels. Furthermore, the latest economic downturn has not
been associated with a domestic financial crisis, but rather reflects in large part an
unfavorable external environment.
52.
Recent progress in structural reforms and fiscal consolidation has been slower
than earlier envisaged by staff and the authorities, however, largely because of
difficulties in forging a political consensus. The process of lowering the public debt-toGDP ratio has stalled, and the public finances remain vulnerable to adverse movements in oil
prices and interest rates. Congressional approval of key structural reforms to boost growth,
generate employment, and improve the fiscal accounts is urgently needed. Poverty remains
endemic, and there exist sizable regional disparities.
53.
Staff are concerned that progress in fiscal consolidation has faltered. The
augmented deficit has remained at around 3½ percent of GDP in recent years, the overall
debt-to-GDP ratio has edged up, and revenues have been increasingly reliant on high oil
prices. With economic recovery likely to gather momentum, it will thus be important to
provide renewed impetus to fiscal adjustment in 2004, consistent with achieving
PRONAFIDE’s medium-term goals. Early actions to restart the consolidation process are
critical given the medium-term challenges posed by spending pressures in the areas of social
services, agriculture, infrastructure, and pension reform. Achieving fiscal adjustment through
reforms that increase efficiency and boost confidence in medium-term sustainability would
help to minimize any negative impact on short-term growth.
54.
Annual budget discussions should be formally linked to a medium-term
framework, and be framed in terms of augmented fiscal definitions. A fiscal
responsibility law could provide an appropriate framework for observing medium-term
targets, including for the overall debt path, and for reconciling objectives in the areas of tax,
expenditure, and social sector policies. Given its importance, however, design of the
framework deserves careful consideration. Staff encourage the authorities to set and regularly
update specific objectives for the augmented deficit and debt to discipline annual budget
discussions.
55.
Deep and significant structural reforms are needed to achieve the broadlyshared goal of raising income growth and reducing poverty over the medium term. Key
areas for reforms include: the energy sector; tax system; labor market; and the judicial
system. However, implementing these reforms will not be easy given political differences. At
the same time, there seems to be increasing recognition of the need for action in these areas
and the costs of continued inertia in terms of weak growth, external vulnerabilities, and
adverse debt dynamics.
56.
The BOM’s monetary policy stance has been appropriately geared to achieving a
decline in inflation to 3 percent in 2003 and beyond. Staff share the authorities’ view that
headline inflation will converge toward the target by end-2003 given the decline in

- 31 -

expectations, weak activity, and decelerating wage growth. At the same time, the recent
easing in monetary conditions should provide support to activity in the period ahead.
57.
The authorities are encouraged to shift to interest rate targeting in the context of
a more formalized inflation-targeting framework, as inflation and interest rates
stabilize at low levels. The corto has allowed for large and rapid adjustments in interest
rates, which were desirable when inflation was declining rapidly. An approach based on
short-term interest rates as an operating instrument, however, may provide a higher degree of
monetary control for keeping inflation within a narrow target range, and could also enhance
the communication of monetary policy actions. The recent shift to daily reserve accumulation
periods could facilitate a future shift to using a short-term interest rate as an operating
instrument.
58.
Mexico’s flexible exchange rate regime has been effective in cushioning the
economy from external shocks in recent years. The recent level of external
competitiveness appears to be broadly consistent with a sustainable balance of payments
position. International reserves remain adequate in the context of a flexible exchange rate,
both in their coverage of short-term external debt and Mexico’s gross annual financing needs.
The staff agrees that the new rules-based mechanism for accumulating foreign reserves does
not change the authorities’ transparent approach to reserves management and commitment to
a market-determined exchange rate. Nevertheless, flexible implementation is needed over
time to ensure that reserves remain adequate.
59.
Mexico’s banking system remains sound and well-regulated. Further steps taken
in 2002 to move into full compliance with the Basle Core Principles are welcome. In
addition, the minimal level of informal dollarization allowed banks to easily withstand the
impact of currency depreciation in 2002. Yet financial intermediation is only starting to
recover from the collapse in bank lending associated with the 1994–95 crisis. A significant
challenge in the period ahead is to deepen financial activity without excessive risk-taking,
and to streamline financial rules and regulations to encourage innovation and competition.
The staff supports the high priority attached by the authorities to strengthening oversight of
nonbank institutions, which have grown rapidly in recent years.
60.
The authorities are encouraged to address the outstanding issues identified in
the 2002 fiscal ROSC. Key recommendations include publishing a revised public sector
definition excluding commercial enterprises from the coverage of general government, and
incorporating medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal projections in the economic guidelines
underlying annual budgets.
61.
The staff supports the authorities’ commitment to continue reducing
vulnerabilities relating to public debt. In addition to sustained progress with fiscal
consolidation, the structure of the debt stock would be strengthened by continuing to increase
issuance of fixed-rate, domestic-currency instruments and extending the yield curve.
Regarding vulnerabilities linked to private debt, the deepening of the domestic bond market

- 32 -

associated with the rapid growth of institutional investors should diversify financing sources,
lowering liquidity and contagion risk and reducing foreign currency mismatches in firms’
balance sheets.
62.
Mexico’s data are generally of high quality, and are adequate to conduct
surveillance effectively. The authorities are encourage to implement the recommendations of
the 2003 statistical ROSC.
63.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

For 2003 includes Mex$18 billion, or 0.3 percent of GDP, in projected infrastructure outlays and transfers to the Oil Stabilization Fund on account
of higher-than-prorammed revenues.
4/ Includes a loan to governors of Mex$15 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2002, which is projected to be repaid with interest in 2003.
5/ Also includes transfers to IPAB and the debtor support programs
6/ Includes a reduction in the net financial requirements of development banks of Mex$49 billion, or 0.8 percent of GDP, in 2002—
effectively offsetting the effect of closing Banrural on the overall PSBR.
7/ Treats transfers to IPAB, debtor support programs and FARACas interest payments.
8/ Estimated as the PSBR plus the additional tax revenue if GDP was at potential (with unitary elasticity). The cyclically adjusted deficit will be
lower (higher) than the actual deficit if the economy operates below (above) potential.
9/ Apart from the cyclical adjustment described above, revenue is adjusted to exclude oil export revenue and nonrecurrent income. Expenditure
excludes interest payments, including the costs of bank restructuring and debtor support programs, and the financial requirements of development banks.
10/ Excludes oil revenue (oil extraction rights, PEMEX net income, oil excess return levies, IEPS on gasoline) and PEMEX operational expenditure.
11/ Total tax revenue excluding IEPS on gasoline.
12/ Excludes Banrural spending in 2002.

ANNEX II

MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank continues to support closely and successfully Mexico’s development progress.
The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mexico, as discussed by its Board in May
2002, focuses on five strategic objectives: 1) consolidating the macroeconomic framework; 2)
accelerating growth through competitiveness; 3) human capital development; 4) balancing
growth and poverty reduction with environmental protection; and 5) building an efficient,
transparent, and accountable government. The Bank will retain a rich program of analytical work
and offer a three-year (FY2003–05), US$5 billion lending envelope (half of which in fastdisbursing operations) that balances macro- and micro-oriented activities, and caters to the three
levels of government (federal, state, and municipal). Support will depend on the conduciveness
of legal and regulatory environments and, when necessary, on the political consensus for the
required reforms; lacking that consensus, lending will be correspondingly lower.
Using the program flexibility built into the 1999 CAS, the Bank was able to deliver, over the past
four years, assistance both at the broad reform agenda and at the sectoral level. New lending
committed during the FY1999–2002 period remained at a strong US$4.8 billion. The Bank’s
analytical work carried out over the past few years in support of its lending program and policy
dialogue with the Mexican government was summarized in a collection of Policy Notes,1
covering more than 30 different sectors and themes, that served as a highly appreciated,
analytical bridge across administrations.
Recently, the Bank extended several loans that contribute to delivering support for the five
objectives in the CAS. In the area of education, the second phase of a plan to strengthen the
Government of Mexico’s compensatory education program is being supported through a
US$300 million loan. In support of the recent reforms in the area of taxation, especially the
corporate and personal income tax, and to improve tax compliance and reduce tax evasion, the
Bank extended two loans to an amount of US$355 million. The Bank also continues to support
the further strengthening of Mexico’s financial sector, in particular through a US$64.6 million
loan that focuses on increasing the access of rural low-income population to financial services.
Strengthening the ongoing decentralization in Mexican public finance, the Bank also supports a
program aimed at increasing the efficiency of small-scale social and productive, municipal
infrastructure investments, through a US$400 million loan that enhances the administrative and
technical capacity of municipalities.
As of July 2002, the Bank’s portfolio consists of 24 active projects with a total undisbursed
balance of US$3.6 billion. Average annual disbursements over the past four years of
US$1.2 billion have led to a slight decrease in exposure to Mexico, currently at US$11 billion,
comfortably within the Bank’s nominal indicative, single-borrower exposure ceiling of
US$13.5 billion.

ANNEX III

MEXICO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Core data are published on a timely basis and are of good quality. The timeliness, periodicity,
and coverage of published economic statistics and other data made available to the Fund have
improved considerably since 1995. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). Recent data revisions have been reasonable and have not changed
substantially the staff’s assessment of economic policy in Mexico. Regarding fiscal data, both
the preliminary (available with a 45-day lag following the end of each quarter) and the final
(available mid-year of the subsequent year) data are published and submitted to congress,
ensuring that revisions are transparent and subject to public scrutiny.
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several measures
to improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data
on external liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years
broken down by maturity, and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt
service of commercial banks is still not available. International reserves data are compiled
according to the Operational Guidelines for the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity of the IMF (October 1999).
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the
fiscal balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net
cost of public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts
(PIDIREGAS) as well as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not
been previously recorded.
A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 and was subsequently published
as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. The overall quality of Mexican statistics is good. In a
number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS
requirements. However, there are various areas where improvements could be made. The
authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.

MEXICO—AN UPDATE OF CORPORATE SECTOR VULNERABILITIES1
The corporate sector in Mexico remains highly segmented, with access to bank and bond
financing available mainly to top-tier companies, while small- and medium-sized firms rely
mostly on suppliers’ credit. Most Mexican firms finance their operations through suppliers’
credit, with 63 percent of firms using this source in the second quarter of 2003. Firms
reported that high interest rates and economic uncertainty are the main reasons for not using
bank credit.
Vulnerability Analysis2
Leverage continues to be modest. On average, the debt-to-equity ratio remains at around
one for the firms represented in the sample, although it is over 2 for smaller companies.
Despite increased bond issuance in the domestic market, the ratio of foreign currency
debt to total debt has remained high (64 percent). Neither the authorities nor market
participants believe that the Mexican corporate sector is hedging its foreign currency
exposure through derivative operations in a significant volume.
The maturity structure of debt has improved further in 2003. The ratio of short-term debt
to total debt was 48 percent at end-2003Q1, down from 51 percent a year earlier.
Refinancing risks are reduced by increasing access to domestic capital markets. Listed
firms in the stock exchange (BMV) have US$15.7 billion in foreign exchange debt falling
due in 2003, and US$9.2 billion in 2004. The authorities do not believe the rollover of
corporate external payments will cause problems, as the local capital market is now providing
financing for external amortizations.
The net open foreign exchange position of the corporate sector was negative
US$11 billion at end-2003Q1—with assets of US$28.8 billion and liabilities of
US$39.8 billion. The maturity profile of foreign currency liabilities remains sound, with
65 percent being long-term. About 10 percent of firms hold 67 percent of total foreign
currency liabilities. These firms carry out more than half their sales abroad, and 75 percent of
their assets are foreign currency denominated. Companies in the construction sector have the
weakest profile, as 76 percent of their foreign currency liabilities are due in the short term.

The analysis is based on data for publicly traded firms on the Mexico Stock Market (BMV). The
sample is not representative of the entire corporate sector, but it reflects well the companies that have
access to debt financing, especially external financing.

ANNEX IV

Companies in default and with financial difficulties during the last year are limited to
specific sectors (mining, telecommunications, and construction), mainly due to the global
weak economic demand, high leverage, and weak commodity prices. These difficulties
appear not to be systemic.
Stress Test Analysis3
The liquidity and solvency of the corporate sector would not be affected by a combined
adverse shock (of two standard deviations) to the exchange rate, interest rate, and growth.
However, if the shock were accompanied by domestic and external market access limitations
that constrained the rollover rate to 80 percent of the debt amortizations in the upcoming
year; then most of the firms would face liquidity problems, perhaps with default being
widespread. In this case, gross debt of the firms in liquidity distress would amount to around
3 percent of GDP.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 15, 2003
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued to
Executive Directors. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
The government has reduced its official growth forecast for 2003 from 3 percent
to 1.5 percent, in line with the latest WEO projection. Recent indicators confirm the slow
pace of recovery. Growth in the global indicator of economic activity weakened further in
July, as the 12-month change fell to 0.9 percent from 1.2 percent in June. The consumer
confidence index continued to decline in August and September, while business confidence
improved somewhat. In line with sluggish activity, unemployment reached a new peak of
4 percent in August, while formal sector employment fell to its lowest level since December
1998.
2.
The peso has depreciated sharply since July, reflecting weak economic activity
and concerns about prospects for structural reforms. The exchange rate has fallen to a
new low of about MEX$11.3/US$ in recent days, following the announcement by Moody’s
that PEMEX’s debt rating is being reviewed for possible downgrading (currently its rating is
higher than that of the federal government). Since the peak in May, the peso has depreciated
by almost 12 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the real effective exchange rate has
depreciated by about 8 percent.
3.
CPI data for September indicate that the 12-month change in headline inflation
was stable at 4 percent, while core inflation remained subdued at around 3½ percent.
Inflation expectations for end-2003 have continued to decline, reaching 3.7 percent in
September, suggesting that the recent fall in the peso has not jeopardized prospects for
reducing inflation to below 4 percent by end-year (the upper limit of the central bank’s
“variability interval”).
4.
With monetary conditions having eased further as a result of peso depreciation,
the Bank of Mexico (BOM) left the corto unchanged at its meeting last week, citing the
favorable prospects for inflation to decline within the target range by end-year. After
remaining close to 5 percent since the spring, short-term market interest rates have risen by
almost 100 basis points in recent days in response to the weakness in the peso.
5.
Trade data for August showed a smaller-than-expected deficit. Imports declined
by 3.4 percent from the year-ago level, while exports have declined marginally as higher oil
exports partially compensated for a 5 percent decline in manufacturing exports. Net
international reserves stood at US$52.1 billion on October 3, compared with the peak of
US$54.0 billion in early May. On October 7, the government issued US$1 billion of 10-year
bonds to pre-fund 2004 financing requirements. The bond was issued with a yield of 6.063
percent, implying a spread of 179 basis points over U.S. treasuries.

-2-

6.
Fiscal data through end-August suggest that the objectives for the traditional
and augmented deficits for 2003 are likely to be met. Public finances continue to be
boosted by higher-than-projected oil revenues. Through end-September, the price of the
Mexican mix has, on average, been about US$6 above the budget assumption of
US$18.35 per bond, while the exchange rate has been significantly more depreciated than
anticipated. Spending has also exceeded budget estimates, however, and income tax receipts
remain weak.
7.
Political negotiations on structural reforms continue, without any major
breakthroughs. A working group, chaired by Secretary of Finance Gil Díaz, has been
deliberating on tax reform, with a proposal having been advanced to reduce the VAT rate
from 15 percent to 10 percent, while broadening the base. The states would also introduce a
common 2 percent VAT. The administration has also presented a draft bill to opposition
legislators that would increase the scope for private-sector involvement in electricity
generation.
8.
The 2004 draft budget will be submitted to congress by mid-November. The
Secretary of Finance has indicated an objective for the narrow definition of the deficit of
0.3 percent of GDP, broadly in line with the 2002 medium-term framework (PRONAFIDE).
No objective has yet been announced for the augmented deficit.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On October 15, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
After a strong performance from 1997 to 2000, output fell in 2001 in response to the U.S.
downturn. While growth rebounded in the first half of 2002, it has stalled since, reflecting both
the delayed U.S. recovery and sluggish domestic spending. In spite of lower wage growth,
higher administered and agricultural prices pushed up headline inflation to 5.7 percent at
end-2002, compared with the Bank of Mexico’s (BOM) target of 4.5 percent. Stagnant non-oil
export volumes since 2001 have been more than offset by higher oil exports and a contraction
in imports, leading to a narrowing in the current account deficit. The current account deficit has
been almost entirely financed by FDI inflows.
Real GDP remained subdued in the first half of 2003, with growth of 1.4 percent (seasonally
adjusted) in the four quarters ending in the second quarter. While recent indicators of activity
have been mixed, most observers still expect the economy to recover in the second half of the
year, in line with U.S. recovery. Headline inflation also continued to rise in the first months of
2003, but then dropped significantly to 4 percent in August and September, as inflation
expectations declined and earlier price shocks unwound. Core inflation fell to 3.5 percent in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2April, and then stabilized around that level through September. The current account deficit
continued to moderate in the first half of 2003. Private external borrowing also declined in the
first half of the year, as firms increasingly switched from foreign to domestic capital markets to
meet their financing needs.
During 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, net international reserves increased by US$9.3 billion,
largely due to the impact of high oil prices on PEMEX receipts. A new mechanism was
implemented in May to slow the pace of reserve accumulation and lower the cost associated
with carrying those levels of reserves. Gross international reserves amounted to 106 percent of
short-term debt by residual maturity at end-September 2003.
The pace of fiscal consolidation, viewed in terms of the broad public sector deficit, has been
slower than envisaged in the authorities’ 2002 medium-term plan. While the budget target of an
augmented deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP for 2003 is likely to be met, higher oil revenues are
expected to offset shortfalls in other revenues, increasing the sensitivity of the fiscal situation to
swings in oil prices. Expenditures are also expected to exceed budget estimates.
The BOM tightened its monetary stance starting September 2002 in response to rising inflation
expectations. With the subsequent reduction in both headline inflation and inflation
expectations, prospects are favorable for bringing end-year headline inflation below 4 percent.
After rising to about 10 percent in early March, short-term interest rates fell below 5 percent in
July, but have increased in recent weeks in response to the weakness in the peso. At the same
time, the recent depreciation of the peso implies that monetary conditions have eased further,
providing support to activity.
Market sentiment toward Mexico remains positive, as reflected in its investment-grade status.
Turbulence in emerging markets in 2002 was weathered well, and sovereign bond spreads
have declined to a historical low of 200 basis points in recent weeks.
The government has made significant progress in strengthening the structure of public debt.
Public external debt, for instance, has fallen further from 15 percent of total debt in 2000 to
13½ percent in 2002. The government successfully issued five bonds with collective action
clauses this year. The latest issue (US$1 billion of 10-year bonds) would pre-fund part of the
2004 financing requirements on terms favorable to Mexico. In addition, Mexico became the first
country to redeem all of its Brady bonds. Nevertheless, some public debt vulnerabilities remain,
with a large portion of domestic debt either short-term or linked to short-term interest rates, and
a significant gross financing need of the public sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mexican authorities for their substantially strengthened
policies, which have helped underpin macroeconomic stability and investor confidence and
enabled Mexico to successfully weather the difficult global and regional conditions of recent
years. They welcomed in particular the continued modernization of the financial sector, the
strengthened structure of the public debt, the reduction in inflation to low levels, and the

-3progress made in reducing poverty. The key challenges going forward will be to diversify the
sources of economic growth, and strengthen medium-term growth prospects sufficiently to
achieve significant further reductions in poverty.
Against this background, Directors urged the authorities to restart quickly the process of fiscal
consolidation and reinvigorate the implementation of productivity-enhancing structural reforms—
areas in which recent progress has been disappointing owing to difficulties in forging the
needed political consensus. Of particular importance will be rapid approval and implementation
of structural reforms with respect to the tax system, the energy sector, the labor market, and the
judicial system, which together will help boost private investment and employment and maintain
competitiveness in an environment of heightened global competition. It was noted in this context
that further efforts to build greater public awareness of the importance of these reforms will be
helpful for achieving the appropriate degree of ambition in their scope and speed. Directors
supported the authorities’ efforts to improve governance, fight corruption, and enhance
transparency, and they encouraged them to persevere in these efforts.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, which calls for further fiscal
adjustment to lower the public debt-to-GDP ratio. To achieve this objective, the authorities will
need to give renewed impetus to the consolidation process in 2004, while ensuring effective
management of oil revenues. Over the medium term, they will also need to address the
challenges posed by the significant reliance of public sector revenues on oil prices and the
growing spending pressures. Fiscal reforms based on measures that increase efficiency and
boost confidence in sustainability will help strengthen the foundations for faster medium-term
growth while limiting any near-term negative consequences.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to renew tax reform discussions. A broadbased tax reform would enhance the efficiency of the tax system and promote fiscal stability.
Directors agreed with the view that formally linking the annual budget discussions to a mediumterm plan that incorporates a comprehensive view of fiscal developments would serve to
strengthen the fiscal framework. In addition, a fiscal responsibility law would provide a useful
framework for setting medium-term targets, including for the debt path, and for reconciling the
tax, expenditure, and social sector policy objectives. Directors suggested that the authorities set
and regularly update specific medium-term objectives for the augmented deficit and debt to
underpin the annual budget discussions.
Directors commended the Bank of Mexico for implementing a prudent and forward-looking
monetary policy, which has served to boost market confidence and promote financial stability.
They considered that declining inflation expectations and economic slack will contribute to the
convergence of inflation toward the target by end-2003, while the recent easing in monetary
conditions will help support activity in the period ahead.
In discussing the operating procedures for monetary policy, Directors noted that the corto has
allowed for large and rapid adjustments in interest rates, and contributed to Mexico’s impressive
record in reducing inflation. Many Directors considered, however, that as inflation and interest
rates stabilize at low levels, a short-term interest rate target would provide a greater degree of

-4monetary control and increase transparency, thereby helping to keep inflation within a narrow
target range and communicating the authorities’ monetary policy intentions more clearly. At the
same time, given the importance of correct timing and careful management of the transition
process, they considered that the authorities are best qualified to define the appropriate timing.
Directors observed that Mexico’s flexible exchange rate regime has been effective in cushioning
the economy from external shocks. They agreed that the new rules-based mechanism to reduce
the pace of accumulation of foreign reserves does not change the authorities’ transparent
approach to reserves management and the commitment to a market-determined exchange rate.
Directors encouraged the authorities to ensure that reserves remain adequate.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to further strengthen the financial regulatory
framework. Important challenges in the period ahead will be to deepen financial intermediation
without excessive risk-taking, and to streamline financial rules and regulations to encourage
innovation and competition. In this regard, Directors welcomed the high priority attached by the
authorities to strengthening oversight of the rapidly growing nonbank institutions.
They commended Mexico’s continued efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of
terrorism.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ commitment to continue to reduce vulnerabilities relating to
the public debt through increasing issuance of fixed-rate, domestic-currency instruments and
extending the yield curve. Directors commended Mexico’s leadership in debt management,
including its recent inclusion of collective action clauses in sovereign debt contracts and the
early redemption of all outstanding Brady bonds. Directors were encouraged by Mexico’s efforts
to deepen the domestic bond market, which will foster the diversification of financing sources for
the private sector and reduce reliance on foreign currency-denominated private debt, thus
alleviating a potential risk factor.
Directors recognized that Mexico’s data are generally of high quality, and are adequate to
conduct surveillance effectively. They encouraged the authorities to implement the
recommendations of the 2003 statistical Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mario Beauregard, Alternate Executive Director for Mexico
October 15, 2003
At the outset, I would like to thank staff for conducting a thorough analysis of the Mexican
economy. The high-quality staff report and selected economic issues paper will serve well to
elevate the public debate on the economic policy in Mexico. Although there are some areas
where differences of opinion persist, my authorities share most of the staff appraisal and
many of staff’s recommendations.
Background
Mexico has further consolidated its position as a leading emerging market economy in Latin
America and the world. Macroeconomic stability has been preserved despite the negative
external environment characterized by a slow economic recovery in Mexico’s main trading
partner as well as crises in emerging markets in the region. Under strict fiscal discipline, the
structure and maturity of the public sector debt have improved; monetary policy has been
managed prudently; external accounts are in order; access to international capital markets has
increased; international reserves stand at historically high levels; public external debt service
as a percentage of exports has more than halved since 2000; and financial strength indicators
have evolved satisfactorily. Investor confidence is also revealed by the flows of Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) to Mexico: as a percentage of total FDI flows to Latin America,
those directed to Mexico rose from 21 per cent in 2000 to 32 percent in 2002 and there are
indications that this trend has continued in 2003. In sum, Mexico’s economic fundamentals
have continued to improve, and the economy is well prepared to take advantage of a global
economic recovery.
Regarding economic growth projections for this and next year, we remain confident that
economic activity in the United States will resume strongly by the end of 2003 and that this
trend will continue throughout 2004. Once manufacturing activity in the US starts to grow, it
will boost economic activity in Mexico. Hence, we share staff’s economic growth projections
for this and next year.
Looking forward, though, the challenges are still significant; one of the most important being
to diversify Mexico’s sources of economic growth by developing a strong domestic market.
Even though macroeconomic stability has been preserved, the immediate challenge lies in
reaching consensus on bold structural reforms.
A long road map of reforms ...
The past ten years have been crucial for Mexico. Key structural reforms have made the
Mexican economy more resilient to external shocks and have set the ground for sustainable
economic growth. It is important to stress though that not all reforms reside in the economic
area; changes in the political sphere--in particular the reform to Mexico’s electoral
institutions--are also fundamental in explaining where we stand today. The latter is important
taking into account Mexico’s economic history, characterized by recurrent deep economic

-2and financial crises coinciding with the change of administration. As staff stressed in the
report, the smooth presidential succession in 2000 was an important step forward for Mexico
in order to consolidate the nascent democratic system.
I would like to highlight a positive development that is not easily noticeable and which I
think is crucial in explaining investor sentiment towards Mexico: the commitment of my
authorities, legislators and the population at large to preserve macroeconomic stability. They
now acknowledge there are no easy or magic solutions to overcome adverse global economic
trends. This commitment has materialized in strict fiscal and prudent monetary policies in
recent years.
This being said, we acknowledge that structural reforms are needed if Mexico wants to
further consolidate its status and continue progressing towards combating poverty.
Competition in international markets is very strong and only through the implementation of
bold structural reforms will the Mexican economy be able to enhance its competitiveness. To
this aim, since taking over, this administration has stressed the need for implementation of
substantive reforms and has already presented to Congress proposals to reform the fiscal area
(2001), the energy sector (2002) and the financial sector (2000-2002), and discussions are
well advanced in the areas of telecommunications and labour. A proposal to reform the
public pension system is also ready.
Despite these efforts, however, limited progress has been achieved so far. With a divided
Congress, the Executive branch has lacked the support of the opposition to approve these
reforms. This does not mean, however, that further efforts will not be pursued. In fact, in his
latest address to Congress, last September, the President reiterated to the different political
parties the need to work together to reach consensus in these important areas. He stressed that
Mexico is at a critical juncture and that not advancing in these areas in a substantive way
would be in detriment of the economy’s competitiveness.
The months ahead will be critical. After the Lower House elections of last July, prospects to
reach consensus have improved. Even though no political party has majority in this Chamber
and the opposition (PRI) has majority in the Senate, there is now a better understanding of
the importance of the reforms. This change in attitude deserves a broader explanation. On
one hand, the world economic slump made it clear that Mexico needs to strengthen its
domestic sources of growth. If the domestic economy is to be an alternative source of
economic growth, we need to enhance Mexico’s attractiveness to domestic and foreign
investments. Another factor is the speed at which other economies have been advancing in
their reforms. Without the implementation of the required structural reforms, Mexico’s
competitiveness vis-à-vis other economies is clearly at risk.
We acknowledge there is only a limited window of opportunity to approve the reforms. That
is why my authorities will concentrate efforts on the fiscal and energy reforms in the months
ahead.
The above being said, I do not want to leave the impression that there has not been progress
in terms of structural reforms in Mexico in the last few years. An area where substantial

-3progress has been achieved is the financial sector. So far, 25 reforms to laws and
amendments to rules and regulations have been enacted (17 in 2001, 7 in 2002 and 1 in 2003)
which have improved the functioning of markets and enhanced corporate governance. A
reform to the private pension system was also approved in 2002. Furthermore, work is well
advanced in the development of a new banking resolution strategy, which would imply
changes to many laws affecting the financial sector.
Another crucial area where substantive progress has been achieved is transparency. The
Federal Transparency and Access to Government Public Information Law was enacted by
Congress in April last year. It mandates, since June this year, all public entities to publish and
update information on several topics as a routine procedure, including their functions,
budget, operations, internal reports and contracts, as well as to answer to information
requests by any citizen.
In sum, the message I would like to convey to the Executive Board is that my authorities are
strongly committed to continue following strict fiscal and prudent monetary policies and to
advance in the implementation of the structural reform agenda. What has been achieved so
far took many years of hard work. The challenge now is to preserve those gains and continue
enhancing the competitiveness of the economy.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities’ track record in pursuing fiscal consolidation is unquestionable. While in
2003 almost all countries with solid financial positions experienced deterioration in their
fiscal position, Mexico did not relax its fiscal stance. Indeed, something that markets
recognize and that have earned Mexico investment grade status is precisely the relevance and
efforts my authorities place to this important issue. However, in order to further consolidate
Mexico’s fiscal accounts, we cannot simply put aside the context in which said efforts are
pursued. Without trying to lessen the importance of further fiscal consolidation, my
authority’s efforts have been hampered by a very difficult economic environment. Still, they
would like to reaffirm their commitment to continue with the fiscal consolidation effort.
For the 2004 budget, my authorities do have a clear and precise objective: to continue
pursuing fiscal consolidation through strict fiscal discipline. However, we consider that the
adjustment should be smoother than the one suggested by the staff. This is the case because
the Mexican economy is now on the lower part of the business cycle and actual GDP is well
bellow potential. Therefore, in cyclically adjusted terms, staff’s proposed contraction is too
severe and less realistic to achieve. In this vein, President Fox announced last Wednesday
that the government will pursue a fiscal deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2004, a figure
consistent with a reduction of next year’s PSBR that is in line with the downward trend
defined in PRONAFIDE.
Regarding public debt management, there are two important developments that took place on
the external front that are worth mentioning. First, Mexico’s decision to include Collective
Action Clauses in their sovereign debt contracts under New York law and, second, the
redemption of all outstanding Brady Bonds, which benefit Mexico by substituting this debt

-4with new one with better financing conditions. On the domestic front, the government
continued to reduce the vulnerability of public financing by shifting domestic securities
issues towards fixed-rate securities and away from floating and indexed-rate securities.
Furthermore, the average maturity of the public sector domestic debt increased from
816 days at the end of 2002, to 914 days at the end of June 2003. It is worth mentioning that
in December 2000 this figure stood at 542 days. Hence, considerable progress has been
achieved so far but it should be recognized this is a gradual process and my authorities
believe it is better to advance hand-in-hand with the market.
In reference to staff’s comments on the difficulty in judging the productivity of spending
under PIDIREGAS projects, my authorities would like to reiterate that such projects are
judiciously evaluated before any authorization is granted and so far have had positive and
high internal rates of return that validate the decision to approve them.
We agree with staff that the broader definitions of fiscal deficit and debt provide more
meaningful information regarding the overall fiscal situation and fiscal consolidation needs.
That is why my authorities developed those statistics and have been using them since
May 2001. In fact, information on the PSBR and the augmented debt is available to the
public. Finally, the analysis by staff of the fiscal situation in Mexico and possible avenues for
reform are well taken and my authorities will evaluate them carefully.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
I would like to underscore the commitment of my authorities to achieving the long-term
inflation target of 3 percent. Recent information confirms that inflation continues its
declining trend towards that objective. My authorities agree with staff that the current
monetary policy stance is appropriate, and that the recent easing in monetary conditions
should provide support to economic activity in the period ahead. They also share staff’s view
that the flexible exchange rate regime has worked well. I would therefore limit my comments
to four issues: i) a brief comment on recent changes to the inflation-targeting framework in
Mexico, ii) the reference index used in said framework, iii) the “corto” and iv) the
mechanism to reduce the speed of accumulation of international reserves.
i.

Banco de Mexico further strengthened the inflation-targeting framework since our last
Board meeting. In this regard, since January this year the Board of Governors has been
announcing its monetary policy decisions on predetermined dates. This change helps to
mitigate the uncertainty regarding the timing of the monetary authority’s decision to
modify its stance; fosters a more efficient operation of financial markets, and improves
the transparency of monetary policy. In sum, it reinforces the effectiveness of monetary
policy measures.

ii.

My authorities have clearly justified the decision to set the Consumer Price Index as the
reference for the inflation target. First, the CPI is the best-known price indicator and the
most widely used by the public to measure the cost of living; second, the CPI is also
widely used as reference in contracts and negotiations; and third, the CPI is published in
a timely manner at regular intervals and it is not subject to revisions. Nonetheless, they

-5acknowledge that core inflation is a very important indicator of medium-term pressures
and it will remain an essential input for monetary policy decisions.
iii.

Banco de Mexico’s operating instrument, known as the “corto”, has a very strong record
of accomplishment. During last year’s Article IV Board discussion most Directors
agreed that the “corto” continued to be a flexible and efficient monetary policy
instrument that allowed for appropriate adjustments in interest rates. There is no reason
to think that this assessment should change since the “corto’s” effectiveness is proved by
the relevant data. In this regard, inflation has continued its declining trend and it is now
approaching the long-term objective as originally planned by my authorities. I would
like to reiterate, as I did last year, that one of the most important advantages of the
“corto” is that it allows for a spontaneous distribution of the adjustment to external and
domestic shocks between the exchange rate and interest rates. This characteristic is of
utmost importance to an economy like Mexico’s, which has been subject to a high
degree of volatility and, up until relatively recently, to an intense pass-through of
exchange rate fluctuations to domestic prices. Another advantage of the “corto” is that it
allows for either reductions or increases in market interest rates as economic conditions
change without explicit intervention of the central bank.
Staff insists that shifting the operational instrument to an interest-rate target would be
increasingly desirable as inflation converges to its long-term target. The Board of
Governors of Banco de Mexico has indeed evaluated the convenience of adopting an
interest rate objective as an operational instrument. They have stated that “the lesser
volatility experienced by domestic markets brings us closer to a situation in which the
necessary conditions to migrate would be met. Nonetheless, given the high degree of
uncertainty currently affecting international markets and the vulnerability of domestic
markets stemming from structural problems of the public finances, the adoption of an
interest rate instrument will not likely occur in the near future”.
Regarding Box 3, the staff argues that “the recent sharp decline in market interest rates
in the face of a high corto” puts into question the usefulness of this operating instrument.
In this regard, I would like to point out that my authorities have publicly explained the
way the “corto” works. The important factor is not the level of the “corto” per se, but the
signalling effect embedded in changes in the operating instrument. Every time the
“corto” has been changed, it has influenced interest rates and inflation expectations in
line with my authorities’ objectives. Hence, we do not see any inconsistency in the
reduction of market interest rates and high levels of the “corto”. On the contrary, it
confirms that the signalling effect of changes in the monetary policy stance through the
“corto” has worked well in affecting inflation expectations, as originally intended.

iv.

We concur with staff that the current level of international reserves is appropriate. The
mechanism to reduce the accumulation of reserves that was introduced last March has
been working very well. Even though there is no formal process to review this
mechanism, my authorities do constantly monitor the adequacy of the level of reserves.

-6Financial Sector
My authorities’ efforts to strengthen Mexico’s financial system have rendered good results. I
would like to highlight two important developments in this sector. First, direct financing of
commercial banks to the non-banking private sector recorded a 6.4 percent real annual
increase in June, registering the seventh straight month of positive gains. It is worth
mentioning that such gains have not been reported since my authorities began to measure this
indicator in 1995. Second, the deepening of the domestic financial sector has continued.
Financial savings increased at a real annual rate of 5.5 percent in the first half of 2003 and
securities issued by the private sector recorded a real annual increase of 32 percent during
same period.
In order to continue strengthening this sector, a package of legal reforms designed to promote
bank lending was approved by Congress in May. One of the most important was the creation
of the Fideicomiso de Garantía, a trust established to guarantee the fulfilment of debtor’s
obligations. The reform seeks to reduce transaction costs related to the recovery of collateral,
thus reducing risk premiums and broadening the possibilities available to use as collateral.
The reform’s main achievements are the increased certainty and speed with which legal
procedures are concluded. In addition to the deepening of the financial markets, my
authorities are pursuing policies oriented to enhance the transparency of banking sector costs,
which will strengthen competition, and smooth access to better financial conditions and
products to a broader public.
Vulnerability Assessment
We concur with staff’s assessment that Mexico’s vulnerabilities are moderate and derive
mainly from the public finances. In this regard, my authorities have reiterated that if the
fiscal reform is not approved, they are committed to adjust as necessary to further pursue
fiscal consolidation. Furthermore, an area where substantial progress has been reported by
staff that mitigates this negative risk is the “robust sustainability of Mexico’s debt”. Along
the same lines, the projected medium-term current account deficit is manageable and its
financing has been, and we expect will continue to be, largely financed by FDI flows.
My authorities have a strong difference of opinion with staff with regard to the comparison
they made on the debt-to-GDP ratio and its association with financing problems in other
emerging market economies. As we have said in the past, such comparisons may cause more
problems than benefits. It is thus important to take into account other factors—such as the
overall macroeconomic policy and the debt maturity structure—in order to arrive to such
bold conclusions. It should be noted that Mexico is not the only country with investment
grade that has a debt-to-GDP ratio near the threshold of 50 percent, and that financing
problems are not perceived in any of those countries, including Mexico. Moreover, staff’s
assessment of debt sustainability concludes that Mexico’s debt is robust to a variety of
temporary shocks to key variables.
With regard to potential risks in the corporate sector, we believe that if they were to
materialize, they would not have a systemic impact on the economy. Mexican firms have

-7been very active since last year in substituting debt denominated in local currency raised in
the domestic market for debt denominated in foreign currency. Besides, many of the
companies that carry large amounts of foreign currency debt are also export-oriented firms,
making it unlikely a systemic crisis-scenario such as the one described by staff.
At the end, a better economic development and income distribution are the main objectives
Governments must pursue sustainable economic growth rates aimed at improving living
standards for all. Although macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition towards
achieving those goals, it is not a sufficient one. Other factors, such as a sound social safety
net, improvements in human capital, better judiciary system and low corruption, have an
impact in attaining those goals.
Recent studies demonstrate that Mexico has been able to advance in this area in the last few
years. However, the challenges are still enormous; poverty levels and income distribution in
Mexico have improved thanks to a more stable macroeconomic environment, among other
factors. A study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC) of the United Nations shows that between 2000 and 2002, extreme and moderate
poverty decreased 17.1 and 4.1 per cent, respectively, and that Mexico reduced income
inequality in the country from 1999 to 2002.1 These results are in line with those reported by
the Mexican government last July and by the World Bank recently.
As I said earlier, the importance of macroeconomic stability is fully recognized in Mexico.
But, at the same time, everyone acknowledges that the quest is still long. In this regard,
today’s discussion will further help to understand the importance of preserving what we have
achieved so far.
