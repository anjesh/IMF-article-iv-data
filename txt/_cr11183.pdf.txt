JAPAN
SPILLOVER REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION1

June 29, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Objective. Spillover reports explore the external effects of policies in systemic
economies, focusing on concerns raised by key partners. In the case of Japan, these
relate primarily to the dynamics of public debt, and the potential effects of delayed
fiscal consolidation. More recently, interest centered on the impact of the March 2011
earthquake; particularly in light of Japan‘s unique role in the global production chain.
Findings. The main messages flowing from the analysis are as follows:
Although the recent earthquake has underscored Japan‘s role as a supplier of
sophisticated technological products, neither fiscal nor monetary policies appear to
have led to significant global spillovers in recent years. However, Japan remains an
important source of demand in Asia, and the lack of policy space and rising public debt
levels in other advanced economies suggests that developments in Japan may have a
larger impact than in the past.
While fiscal consolidation in Japan may result in short-run costs for some Asian
countries, the long-run effect on all regions would be positive. Speedy implementation
of Japan‘s growth strategy would mitigate any negative short-term spillovers. By
contrast, monetary policy spillovers are found to be limited.
Financial spillovers from Japan were found to be smaller than those from other
systemic economies, reflecting a financial sector largely focused on the domestic
economy. Nevertheless, a delay in fiscal consolidation could lead to strains in JGB
markets and losses on bank balance sheets, both of which could affect Japan‘s trading
partners. In particular, a rise in JGB yields could lead to higher interest rates elsewhere,
especially in economies where government debt is already high.
The authorities agreed with the key findings of the report, but cautioned that a robust
methodology for gauging financial sector spillovers effects was yet to be developed,
particularly concerning cross-border confidence effects. They acknowledged that a
failure to consolidate fiscal policy could lead to spillover effects, but suggested that
Japanese banks would not have a large role in transmitting a shock abroad.

The report does not try to capture the full extent and historical significance of Japan‘s influence on the world
economy. Rather, it focuses on key policy-relevant issues raised by partners, and describes the reactions of the
Japanese authorities. Technical chapters underlying the analysis can be found in the accompanying Spillover
Issues Paper.

Spillover Reports

Spillover reports examine the external effects of domestic policies in five systemic economies,
i.e., the S5, comprising China, Euro Area, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States. The
mere existence of external effects does not imply that policy modifications or collective action
is needed—that depends on many considerations, including the presence of economic
externalities. The aim rather is to stimulate discussion, providing a global perspective for policy
advice in Article IV discussions and input for the Fund‘s broader multilateral surveillance. In
each case, key partners are asked about outward spillovers from the economy in question, on
the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate candor, spillover reports do not
cite who raises a specific issue.
For this report, the staff consulted officials and analysts from the other S5 and Korea, as well as
countries visited in the context of other spillover reports. A separate forthcoming report will
summarize the themes emerging from discussions with the S5.

JAPAN 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN’S ROLE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY
1.
Japan’s position as one of the largest and richest economies in the world owes much
to its rise as an export powerhouse in the second half of the 20th century. With its
sophisticated manufacturing base, Japan has enjoyed current account surpluses since the 1970s,
helping the country to become the world‘s largest net creditor. The yen has become a key
international currency, and several Japanese banks were at one time among the world‘s largest
financial institutions. However, Japan‘s ―lost decade‖ of the 1990s, the subsequent deleveraging of
bank and corporate balance sheets, and adverse demographics have since contributed to a more
modest pace of economic expansion.

Japanese Trade: High Value Added
2.
Japan is a global supplier of high-end consumer goods and sophisticated intermediate
products (Spillover Issues: Chapter I). With the United States and China as its largest trading
partners, it accounts for about 5 percent of world trade. Japanese consumers have long ranked
among the most important buyers of finished products from Asia. In this regard, imports from the
region rank third in size behind China and the United States, although Japan‘s contribution to
regional growth has slowed as domestic demand has stagnated in recent years.2
3.
Japanese technology plays a key role in facilitating exports of neighboring countries.
Japanese exports have the lowest share of foreign value added in the region, underscoring Japan‘s
―upstream‖ position in the regional production chain.3 As Japan has increased the sophistication of
its export basket, it maintains a lead in specialized core components.4 This has enabled Japan to
maintain a bilateral trade surplus with most countries in the region, including China, and capture a
significant share of value added in other Asian countries‘ exports (Box 1). For example, Japanese
companies account for about 10 percent of value added in Chinese exports of electrical equipment.
4.
The destruction caused by the March 11, 2011 earthquake has revealed Japan’s
importance in the global supply chain. Earthquake damage and subsequent power outages led to
a halt in the production of key ingredients for car computers, integrated circuit chips, and printed
electronics boards. The resulting supply disruptions, albeit temporary, were felt in factories in many
countries, including Europe, the United States, and Asia (Box 2). According to market analysts, the
2

The extent to which each country‘s income depends on the final demand of others can be measured by the valueadded in the home country induced by foreign trading partners (Spillover Issues: Chapter II).
3

Input-output tables for Asia show that the foreign component in most countries‘ domestic output has been rising
strongly, and that a significant portion of the final assembly of Asian-made products, which used to be assembled
and finished throughout the region, has shifted to China (Spillover Issues: Chapter II).
4

Studies find that is not only how much, but also what you export that matters—countries with more ‗sophisticated‘
export baskets enjoy faster subsequent growth. (Spillover Issues: Chapter I).

Box 1. A Byte of the Apple: The Distribution of Value from iPod to iPad
As an example of regional supply chains, Dedrick, and others (2010)1 suggest that, whereas the greatest
value added from the production of the iPod accrues to the U.S. company (Apple), the second largest share
of value added is captured by Japanese firms, which produce the high-value components of the product.
This research estimated that $163 of the iPod‘s $299 retail value in the United States was captured by
American companies and workers, breaking it down to $75 for distribution and retail costs, $80 to Apple,
and $8 to various domestic component makers. Japan contributed about $26 to the value added (mostly via
the Toshiba disk drive), while Korea contributed less than $1. The unaccounted-for parts and labor costs
involved in making the iPod came to about $110, of which China earned around $4.
A similar breakdown of the iPhone 3G by the research from iSuppli confirms this analysis. The phone is made
in China, but Japanese components account for about $60 of production costs (flash memory, touch screen),
whereas Chinese assembly adds about $6 of total costs.
A breakdown of the iPad, on the other hand, highlights the growing competitive strength of Korea. In the
particular device they examined, the flash memory was provided by Samsung and the touch screen was
made by LG—although iSuppli noted that, for some iPads, Apple still sources these components from Japan.

number of cars manufactured worldwide was expected to drop by up to 30 percent in the two
months following the quake, and to shave as much as ⅓ to ½ a percentage point off annualized U.S.
GDP growth in the second quarter. But any loss in this regard is expected to be offset in subsequent
quarters, resulting in little net impact for the year.
5.
Reacting to competition from low-cost producers, as well as increasing local demand,
many Japanese companies have shifted production to the region. Japan accounts for almost
one-quarter of total advanced-economy FDI in Asia, second only to the United States. Traditionally,
factor price differentials were the key drivers for outward FDI, as labor-intensive production, such as
final assembly, was moved to countries with lower costs. More recently, countries‘ market size has
also become a significant determinant of FDI, with an increasing share of FDI aimed at servicing the
growing consumer markets of Asia (Spillover Issues: Chapter III). Key FDI recipients include Thailand,
Korea, and Taiwan POC, as Japan‘s output share in East Asia dropped from two-thirds in 1995 to
one-quarter in 2008.

Financial Markets: Largely Domestic
6.
Owing to its large external surpluses, Japan has accumulated the world’s largest net
foreign asset position. Japan‘s $3 trillion net international investment position reflects both official
reserves (mostly held in the form of U.S. Treasuries), and a large net private position in bonds.5 The
private position (about $1½ trillion) primarily consists of the outward investments of banks, life
insurers, and corporate pension funds in U.S. Treasuries and both U.S. dollar and yen-denominated
corporate bonds.
5

Japan still enjoys a current-account surplus of around 3 percent of GDP, and provides almost $200 billion of capital
each year for other countries to borrow.

Box 2. The Supply-Chain Spillovers of the March 11, 2011 Earthquake
Japan is a globally important source of essential components and capital goods—representing, for
example, one-fifth of the world's semiconductor production. In particular, Japan is a critical upstream
supplier for many countries across the globe. In the machinery and reactors sector, for example, Japan
accounts for more than a third of global exports of machinery and wafers (ISIC code 8486), providing more
than 50 and 35 percent of U.S. and Chinese imports, respectively. Lengthy disruptions to exports of these
components could have important spillover effects for production worldwide.

The earthquake has highlighted the fragility of tightly integrated global-production networks. The
main issue is the specialization and concentration of upstream manufacturers— as you go further up the
supply chain, volumes are lower, reducing the need for multiple factories or firms. Often one small company
with a single factory can have an 80 percent global market share. It therefore takes much less damage to
throw the whole supply chain into disarray.
 In addition to producing one-fifth of the world's semiconductor supply, Japan also controls 90
percent of the world‘s production of bismaleimide-triazine (BT) resin, which is used to manufacture
substrates, the basic raw material for the production of integrated circuit chips and printed electronics
boards. Production was suspended for two months at Mitsubishi Gas and Chemical, which accounts for
50 percent of the world‘s supply.
 In the auto sector, a particular source of concern has been the supply of microcontroller units
(MCU), which are small, single-chip computers that are used in a variety of automotive applications,
including engine control and safety electronics. A critical producer (Renesas), which provides MCUs for
Japanese production worldwide, was hard hit by the disaster, and is operating at reduced capacity
With few immediate alternatives, and with long lead times in the construction of new supply facilities, most
firms in Japan and abroad have had to simply absorb added losses until Japanese production recovers,
either by drawing down their inventories or by temporarily scaling back production.
Recent equity-price developments can help assess the worldwide significance of earthquake-related
disruption. Cumulative abnormal equity returns since the earthquake captures the market‘s assessment of
firms‘ ability to cope with key supply-chain bottlenecks (see table below).
These data suggest that the global impact of the earthquake will be short lived. In the high-technology
sectors, initial market concerns seem to have eased, and international equity prices are recovering. Market
analysts generally expect worldwide semiconductor production to pick up in July-September, and to have
largely normalized by the end of the year.

Box 2. The Supply-Chain Spillovers of the March 11, 2011 Earthquake (concluded)
Similarly, the immediate impact on automobile production has been notable both in Japan and abroad. But
looking forward, most analysts expect a normalization of supply
toward the end of 2011, so that the net impact will be to shift production from 2Q11 to subsequent
quarters.

1/ Firms in red are those directly impacted by the earthquake.

Nonetheless, downside risks remain. A key concern in this regard is the speed of Japanese reconstruction
and the reinstallation of key infrastructure. Semiconductor production, in particular, requires a stable supply
of electricity and clean water. Prolonged power shortages or unexpected blackouts would continue to
constrain activity—even beyond the disaster zone—and would significantly hamper the normalization of
production, both in Japan and abroad.
The longer-term implications for other countries are mixed. In contrast to the short-term costs of
reduced output and exports, the disaster may offer Japan‘s neighbors some longer-term opportunities. Most
obviously, it presents regional firms with a window to step up their production of intermediate products. The
medium-term impact of the crisis, therefore, may be to provide an added impetus for countries climbing up
the value-added chain, especially for those with a more-advanced industrial base.

7.
Japanese debt and equity markets are among the top 5 international markets in size,
but are primarily geared toward domestic investors. Only 5 percent of Japanese government
bonds (JGBs) are held by foreign investors, of which about one-fifth are located in Asia (Spillover
Issues: Chapter IV). By comparison, more than 30 percent of U.S. Treasuries and around 55 percent

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN

of German bunds are held abroad. However, officials indicated that foreign investors account for
about 15 percent of the cash turnover in JGB bonds, and 65 percent of futures markets transactions.
Participation in the equity market is larger, with one quarter of market capitalization held abroad,
but less than one-half of a percent accounted for by Asian investors.6
8.
Given its domestic focus, Tokyo as a financial market place is not a major
intermediator of global capital flows. Foreign issuance of equity and debt in Japan has been
negligible in recent years, and bonds placed by Japanese issuers abroad amount to only 1½ percent
of global outstanding cross-border debt securities. At 14 percent of GDP, the sum of gross capital
inflows and outflows in the Japanese BOP—a crude measure for financial market turnover—is
considerably smaller than in other systemic economies.
9.
The yen remains an important global currency, although its share in global reserve
holdings has declined in the past decade. Yen holdings currently account for 2 percent of
reported foreign exchange reserves, and measured by turnover, the foreign exchange market in
Tokyo remains the third largest in the world—albeit well behind London and New York. In recent
years, the yen has been a funding currency in foreign exchange carry trades, as well as becoming a
preferred investment destination during bouts of global turmoil. This has contributed at times to
relatively abrupt currency movements, in response to shifts in sentiment.7

Banks: Expanding Abroad Again
10.
Banking links have also become less important since the 1990s, but Japanese banks
are again expanding abroad. Traditionally, Japanese banks have expanded abroad to support the
global expansion of Japanese corporates. This trend has recently picked up again, following the
slowly improving health of Japanese banks‘ balance sheets, and slim margins at home. Japan‘s
cross-border bank claims have more than doubled since 2002, from $1 trillion to more than $2½
trillion, most of which are claims on the United States and other advanced economies. The total
international exposure of Japanese banks, measured relative to GDP, nevertheless remains low
compared with that of European banks.
11.
There is still substantial room for banks to grow their cross-border links with Asia.
Claims by Japanese banks on Asia account for only 10 percent of their total foreign claims, and are
concentrated in Australia and Korea. Lending to the region is rising slowly, and a considerable
portion of this expansion appears to reflect, as before, loans to large Japanese firms and intra-firm
transfers of Japanese conglomerates, largely in support of regional FDI and trade. Market
participants have suggested that some of this expansion is driven by limited lending opportunities
at home; but they have also stressed that Japanese banks tend to face stiff competition from global
competitors as they expand beyond their core Japanese corporate clientele.
6

Foreigners account for 42 percent of equity trading volumes.

7

The sensitivity of the yen to exogenous shocks was revealed by the recent earthquake, when worries about a largescale repatriation of capital initially resulted in a sharp currency appreciation. These concerns appeared to have been
premature, however, and yen volatility quickly diminished after a coordinated one-off intervention by the G7.

SPILLOVER ANALYSIS
12.
This section expands on the stylized facts presented above. It reports the results of
empirical analysis obtained by applying exogenous ―shocks‖ to different models of Japan‘s global
economic and financial market relationships. These shocks are hypothetical, but provide an
important yardstick for discussing the effects of policy changes in the next section.

Growth Spillovers: A Regional Story
13.
In line with findings for other countries, with the exception of the United States,
growth spillovers from Japan on the global economy are likely to be limited:


A simple VAR model analyzing interactions between the United States, Europe, Japan, and
the U.K. finds that the impact of a growth shock in Japan is marginally positive on the Euro
area, but other effects are small and statistically insignificant.8 This result is similar for the
euro area and the United Kingdom. Indeed, only U.S. growth shocks tend to be large and
persistent (Figure 3).



Input-output analysis suggests that, for example,
a 10 percent increase in Japanese import
demand would generate at most a ¼
percentage point export increase from its largest
non-Asian trade partners.9

Staff‘s macroeconomic model calibrated for the

growth shock to Japan would have a noticeable
impact on Chinese output (of the order of 18
basis points) and vice versa.10 A similar regional
relationship is observed between the Euro Area
and the United Kingdom, whereas other spillover

The methodology follows Bayoumi and Bui (2010), "Deconstructing the International Business Cycle: Why Does A
U.S. Sneeze Give The Rest Of The World A Cold?" IMF Working Paper 10/239, whose approach allows both the
identification of causation of shocks and the decomposition into different spillover channels. China could not be
included in the analysis because of data limitations. For Japan, a 1 percent of GDP shock is broadly equivalent to one
standard deviation.



The results are similar when the analysis is refined to focus on Japan‘s regional links. A
Global Vector Autoregressive Model (GVAR)—which includes growth, inflation, and other
macro variables—also finds modest regional spillovers, including for Japan‘s impact on
equity prices and interest rates (Spillover Issues: Chapter V).

15.
These findings are consistent with the projected impact of the recent earthquake.
Taking into account the authorities‘ likely reconstruction efforts, projected domestic output growth
for 2011 has been downgraded substantially by around 2 percentage points. However, the impact
on the United States and Euro area is expected to be minimal, and model simulations indicate that,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN

ceteris paribus, the corresponding effect in Asia (including China) is unlikely to exceed 0.1–0.3
percentage points of growth.11

The Financial Channel: Generally Quiet
16.
While Japanese growth spillovers are comparable in size to most other large
economies, the impact of financial market shocks appears to be smaller. For example, staff
estimates suggest that a ―shock‖ to U.S. bond yields and stock prices would be noticeable in all
global financial markets, and an impulse from Euro area equity markets would still be felt in the
United Kingdom and Japan. In contrast, Japanese financial variables are not found to trigger major
spillovers, consistent with the absence of strong external financial sector links.12 Other findings point
in a similar direction:


Japanese banks score low in ―market distress models‖. Japanese banks are more likely to be
affected by distress in foreign financial institutions than the other way around. When ranked
according to their estimated ability to generate distress in others, no Japanese bank scored
among the global top 10.13



BIS cross-border inter-bank exposures indicate that global financial institutions are fairly
impervious to Japanese credit risk (Spillover Issues: Chapter VI). Furthermore, Japan is found
to be among the most resilient countries to cross-border credit shocks, suggesting that it
would mitigate rather than amplify the transmission of global shocks. The impact of a
hypothetical credit event in a Japanese bank would be comparable, by order of magnitude,
to that of an average medium-sized European economy with low interest rate spreads.

17.

With a few exceptions, these results also hold within Asia:



Network analysis tools can also help simulate the regional impact of hypothetical credit
events in Japan. Under a scenario that includes a credit event and subsequent deleveraging,
some Asian banking systems could experience moderate but not systemic losses (Spillover
Issues: Chapter VI).



Using another approach, staff constructed financial stress indices—statistical indicators
flagging abnormal movements a country‘s key financial markets—for Japan and a range of
emerging Asian economies to analyze their reaction to changes in stress indices in other
advanced economies. The results suggest that financial stress in Japan could indeed spill
over into regional markets, but the impact would be smaller than from other advanced

11

Analytically, the demand-side implications of the shock are complicated by a shift in expenditure toward
infrastructure reconstruction, and additional import demand for energy and materials.
12

Based on the methodology in Bayoumi and Bui (2010), staff extended the VAR approach to include financial-market
shocks. See the U.S. Spillover Report. Spillover Issues: Chapter 1.

economies, and there do not appear to be any spillovers from Japan to non-Asian emerging
markets (Spillover Issues: Chapter VII).

Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s findings, albeit with a caveat that
model-based findings would have to be interpreted carefully. They emphasized that Japan
remained an important source of demand for its Asian trading partners. Officials generally felt that
empirical models provided a useful guide to growth and trade-based spillovers, and suggested that
spillovers into Japan were somewhat more pronounced than spillovers out of Japan. However they
were generally skeptical about the capacity of current models to capture financial market spillovers,
particularly concerning cross-border confidence effects. There was agreement that the absence of
empirical findings on financial spillovers should not be interpreted that economic and financial
developments in Japan could not have a more significant impact on global markets, in particular
during times of global economic and financial uncertainty.
19.
The staff noted that the current macroeconomic environment was conducive to
spillovers being larger than captured by the empirical analysis. During Japan‘s ―lost decade‖,
buoyant economic growth in advanced economies may have helped shield the rest of the world
from a sustained negative output shock in Japan. Today, the world economy is in a very different
position. The growth outlook for advanced economies is more fragile, suggesting that negative
developments in Japan could have a substantially stronger effect on global growth. Although this
result has not been borne out by the experience of the recent earthquake, fiscal strains and nearzero policy rates in many advanced economies imply that there may be less scope for policy makers
to respond to future demand shocks.

POLICY ISSUES
Views Held by Other Authorities
20.
Japan-related discussions with other authorities (held pre-earthquake) focused on the
dynamics of public debt. There was general agreement that growth and financial spillovers from
Japan were limited, but also concerns about the fiscal imbalance. Although a fiscal crisis was not
viewed as imminent, other authorities regarded the current path as ultimately unsustainable, and
they noted that the transmission of a shock would be primarily through global financial markets
rather than the standard growth channels. On the exchange rate, it was noted that the carry trade
from Japan had subsided, replaced to some extent by funding out of the United States. These issues
are examined further below, along with other topics discussed in the Article IV Staff Report.

The Baseline: Fiscal Consolidation and Structural Reforms
21.
Following a large reconstruction effort to repair the damage caused by the recent
earthquake, fiscal policy is set to embark on a sustained consolidation effort. For the purposes
of this report, the baseline case mirrors staff‘s policy-adjustment scenario, where a medium-term
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN

fiscal consolidation effort will start in 2012 with a moderate tax increase to finance earthquakerelated expenditures. Staff estimates that stabilizing the net debt ratio by 2016, and reducing it to
around 135 percent of GDP by 2020, requires a 10 percent of GDP structural primary adjustment
over the next ten years. Given the limited scope for spending cuts, fiscal adjustment would need to
rely mainly on new revenue sources and limits on spending growth. Moreover, structural reforms are
assumed to raise the potential growth rate to 2 percent over the next decade.
22.
Policy simulations are based on the IMF’s GIMF
model (Spillover Issues: Chapter VIII). In the short run,
fiscal adjustment will reduce domestic demand. Over the
longer run, lower public dissaving will help reduce interest
rates, spur investment, and boost permanent income. At
the same time, the growth-strategy reforms will help spur
investment and boost aggregate demand. Although
productivity rises only gradually, it ultimately results in a
substantial increase in future income, which increases the
confidence of forward-looking households and supports
current consumption.

Spillovers to other economies would be
modest relative to the impact in Japan. The main impact
of fiscal consolidation would be to release a pool of
savings for other countries to borrow. For Japan, increased
savings translate into a larger trade surplus and real
depreciation. For other countries, Japan‘s trade surplus
corresponds to lower net exports and reduced output. This
would be offset to varying degrees by (i) accommodative
monetary policies, and (ii) an increase in local permanent
income owing to falling global interest rates. The average
impact on other economies is a ¼ percentage-point drop
in their current account balance.

24.
Japan’s growth strategy could help offset the decline in demand from fiscal
consolidation, and so will reduce negative spillovers in the short- to medium term. By
supporting Japanese consumption and investment; growth-enhancing reforms help scale back
Japan‘s trade surplus and depreciation. Even so, Asian economies with rigid exchange rates may still
face short-term output costs, albeit less than in the case of a pure fiscal consolidation.
25.
Strengthening the credibility of the fiscal program can limit the demand-side costs of
adjustment. The model‘s results suggest that the short-term costs of adjustment depend strongly
on expectations of future productivity and income, and so will be shaped by the credibility of the
authorities‘ strategy. Uncertainty over the government‘s long-term commitment would add to the
short-term drop in demand, and hence would exacerbate the short-term negative spillovers to
Japan‘s trading partners.

A Rise in Long-Term Interest Rates
26.
As noted before, the main concerns of other country authorities focused primarily on
the medium-term dynamics of public debt. The growing debt stock is making Japan‘s fiscal
position increasingly vulnerable to upward movements in interest rates (Spillover Issues: Chapter IX).
The prospect of a shock still seems remote, however, given Japan‘s projected current account
surpluses, net creditor status, and large size of foreign exchange reserves. The authorities and staff
agreed that delayed fiscal reform would increase the risk of a rise in yields, in part because private
saving may decline with population aging. A protracted slump in growth resulting from disruption
caused by the earthquake would exacerbate revenue shortfalls and further raise market concerns
about fiscal sustainability.14 There is also a risk of unexpected shifts in the portfolio preferences of
Japanese investors (Box 3).
27.
A rise in JGB yields resulting from a spike in risk premia could induce capital losses on
bond holders, and possibly trigger deleveraging by Japanese banks. The direct effect on foreign
investors would likely be moderate, given their relatively small overall holdings.15 But a bond shock,
particularly if accompanied by an equity price drop, could hurt balance sheets of Japanese banks,
which hold over 40 percent of outstanding JGBs, accounting for one fifth of their total assets. Capital
losses could raise counterparty risks and force banks to deleverage their balance sheets, including
by withdrawing from their positions abroad. FSA officials recognize, in general, that a level rise in
interest rates would also increase profit opportunities for banks, especially if it was the result of a
strengthening economy, and that the authorities‘ concern was more with discrete shifts in the shape
of the yield curve rather than an upward shift
14

Over the past decade, Japan has witnessed several episodes where 10-year JGB yields picked up by 100 bps or
more (e.g., the VAR shock in 2003, the 1998 Fiscal Investment and Loan Program shock). Furthermore, events in
Europe have demonstrated that once confidence in fiscal sustainability erodes, authorities can face an adverse
feedback loop between rising yields, a deteriorating fiscal situation, and a contracting real economy.
15

Total foreign holdings of JGBs amount to $390 billion, which is equivalent to around 1 percent of the combined
global market for sovereign bonds, and 4 percent of the U.S. market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN

Box 3. The Impact of Japanese Investors on Global Interest Rates
Staff has analyzed the potential impact of a portfolio shift by domestic savers, including large
institutional investors. Japan has long displayed a relatively strong degree of home bias, but the trend
toward greater international diversification and the demand for higher returns is slowly gathering
momentum (See Japan: Selected Issues, Country Report 07/281). Following the portfolio-balance framework
16
of Neely (2010) ,staff has therefore considered how a steady shift of investment toward foreign bonds
might impact interest rates in Japan and elsewhere (see China, Spillover Issues, Annex X).
As a hypothetical example, suppose Japanese investors were to sell $500 billion of JGBs, and
purchase instead $200 billion of both U.S. Treasury Bonds and German Bunds, together with another
$100 billion of U.K. Gilts and other advanced-market bonds. This shift would roughly double the stock of
JGBs held by foreigners, and the overall impact would be to raise Japanese interest rates by around 160 bps,
while lowering yields elsewhere by around 40 bps. This is broadly comparable to the estimate by Warnock
and Warnock (2009)1 which found that a $500 billion foreign purchase of U.S. Treasuries would lower U.S.
yields by almost 70 bps.

28.
The results of a structural macroeconomic model suggest that significant deleveraging
would only materialize in the event of a major shock (Spillover Issues: Chapter X). In a stress test,
Japan‘s top banks were found to be able to absorb a 300 bps hike in JGB yields without breaching
an (aggregate) 8 percent core Tier I capital ratio.

Beyond that, banks would need to scale back their
foreign lending. For example, assuming that

Foreign banking systems would be
expected to withstand such a deleveraging,
given their relatively small exposure to
Japanese banks. According to network analysis based on interbank flows, banks located in the
United Kingdom and South Korea would be most exposed by a loss in funding (Spillover Issues:
Chapter X). The authorities cautioned that, in an extreme scenario, the combination of higher JGB
yields and counterparty risk could trigger a squeeze in foreign banks‘ Japanese derivatives
operations, possibly requiring them to sell assets in other business areas. The confidence effects of
such a shock were hard to predict, but could add to tensions in other wholesale markets.

30.
Finally, spillovers could also be caused purely by market sentiment, translating a rise in
JGB yields into higher interest rates elsewhere. An extreme value theory (EVT) framework
provides only weak evidence of large movements in Japanese long-term interest rates prompting
large movements in bonds and equity markets elsewhere, possibly including the United States
(Spillover Issues: Chapter XI). However, history

financial spillovers, both sides agreed that
higher JGB yields could lead to higher interest
rates elsewhere, especially in economies
where public debt is already high.

Comprehensive Monetary Easing and the Yen
31.
In this scenario, the Bank of Japan is assumed to continue its comprehensive monetary
easing (CME) policy for another 2 years to provide support to the economy. In the staff‘s GIMF
model, monetary easing is expected to raise inflationary expectations, and thus support demand by
lowering real interest rates. This support would be sufficient to raise growth by an average ½
percentage point over three years in Japan; yet hardly any spillovers—either positive or negative—
would be seen abroad.
32.
The lack of spillovers from monetary policy also extend to the exchange rate. It is
conceivable that continued monetary easing could weaken the yen by lowering longer-term interest
rates and widening the interest differential vis-à-vis other currencies. Empirical estimates, however,
do not provide support to this hypothesis:
An event-study analysis of the BoJ‘s large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) confirms that LSAPs
have had a modest impact on local bond yields (around 15–25 bps) but little effect on the
term premium or the exchange rate. Financial markets in the United States and Europe have
remained largely unmoved.17

Drawing from these results, staff have simulated the impact of further LSAP, assuming that
purchases continue up to the authorities‘ current allowable limit. Again, spillovers are
modest, with the peak impact on other economies ranging below 0.1 percent of GDP.18



33.
Any revival of the carry trade would depend on monetary policy abroad. Although
cross-country interest differentials are at an historic low, many other economies are expected to
recover somewhat faster than Japan, which implies that their monetary policies may begin to
normalize somewhat earlier.


Forward-looking measures of risk-adjusted gains are significantly lower for the Australian,
New Zealand, and U.S. dollar compared to the precrisis period, reflecting much narrower
interest-rate differentials against the yen and a higher level of implied volatility priced into
current markets owing to the crisis.



Position and leverage indicators also suggest lower appetite for carry trades. Prior to the
crisis, noncommercial accounts held large short yen futures positions on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Since the last quarter of 2007, however, these accounts have mostly
held net long positions.19



Market observers agreed that a sudden return of the carry trade was unlikely. Nonetheless,
they concurred that, as rates increase in the United States and elsewhere, there might be a
growing interest in using the yen as a funding currency, putting further downward pressure

18

This is likely to be an upper bound, as a large portion of the impact of LSAP is felt on announcement.

19

Similarly, the call-money liabilities of foreign banks suggest that hedge funds and other speculative investors have
a much more challenging time building up leverage in the post-Lehman environment.

18

on the exchange rate. Staff simulations suggest, however, that the marginal impact on the
currency is likely to be limited (Spillover Issues: Chapter XIII).20
34.
The impact of any CME-related depreciation would mostly occur outside Asia.
Simulating the impact of even a sizeable nominal effective depreciation on regional trading
patterns—using a more detailed, partial-equilibrium framework—Asian trade responds relatively
sluggishly, leaving Asia‘s role as Japan‘s dominant partner largely unchanged. This likely reflects the
nature of Asia‘s production chain, where the costs of severing a trading relationship may be higher
than elsewhere, and where Japan retains significant market power. Trade with the United States and
Europe, on the other hand, is more sensitive to exchange rate changes (Spillover Issues: Chapter I).

A Regional Trade Agreement
35.
A key part of the authorities’ growth
strategy includes efforts to build a regional FTA,
possibly through the Trans-Pacific Partnership
Agreement (TPP). Aside from any short-term
dislocation costs, the macroeconomic impact of
this policy will likely center around a sustained
improvement in productivity and income—officials
estimated that the net gain to Japan could amount
to about ½ percentage point of additional output
growth. Also, the TPP could help entrench a rulesbased framework for new trade areas: such as
medical services, pharmaceuticals, and insurance.

TPP would generate welfare gains for
members and minimal losses for nonmembers. Staff has employed a computable general
equilibrium (CGE) framework to assess the impact and benefits of the TPP to the region as a whole,
and to isolate the marginal contribution of Japan‘s membership.
37.
On average, without Japanese membership, the TPP would generate efficiency
benefits equivalent to a one-time boost of 0.1 percent of GDP for regional members. If Japan
joins the partnership, these benefits increase to 0.2 percent (Spillover Issues: Chapter XIV). These
estimates only reflect static effects in the CGE model, however; the gains could be considerably
larger if increased competition as well as the expansion of rules-based frameworks in TPP member
countries led to additional investment and further productivity gains.

20

Regression analysis relating movements in the currency to U.S. market developments suggest that, since early 2007,
the yen has been particularly responsive to movements in the U.S. 10-year bond yield (U.S. Spillover Report: Spillover
Issues, Chapter 2). However, this result may reflect the abrupt carry-trade unwinding of 2008–09, and Japan‘s safehaven status during recent European turmoil, and so may not serve as a guide to the likely impact of higher U.S.
yields going forward.

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

JAPAN

CONCLUSIONS
38.
Notwithstanding its position among the world’s largest economies, there has been
little evidence of significant policy spillovers from Japan. To be sure, the recent earthquake has
revealed the importance of Japanese intermediate inputs in the global supply chain, with Japanese
technology a key input for industrial production in many of its trading partners. Japan also remains
an important and steady source of final demand for its Asian neighbors, but neither economic nor
financial policies appear to have had a significant growth impact on partner countries in recent
years.
39.
Nevertheless, developments in Japan matter. For one, many other advanced economies
have become more vulnerable than they were during Japan‘s ―lost decade,‖ suggesting that the
impact of Japanese outcomes may be larger than it was in the 1990s—both on the upside and the
downside. Moreover, among foreign policy makers, the currently unsustainable fiscal trajectory has
triggered concerns about the buildup of public debt, and there is broad agreement on the need for
a credible medium-term adjustment strategy. In the staff‘s view, insufficient fiscal adjustment could
lead to a spike in JGB yields which, even if the effects were contained, could trigger financial
volatility and prove highly disruptive.
40.
Apart from heading off tail risks, fiscal consolidation in Japan would have medium to
long-term benefits for its partner countries. The main impact of fiscal consolidation would be to
release a pool of savings for other countries to borrow, while putting downward pressure on Japan‘s
real exchange rate. Over the short run, for Asian countries that peg their exchange rates to the
dollar, this might initially translate into higher real interest rates and reduced output. Over the long
run, however, all regions benefit from lower world interest rates; and speedy implementation of
Japan‘s growth strategy would help offset negative short-term spillovers.
41.
Exchange rate-related spillovers on foreign financial markets are found to be small
and depend partly on policy developments abroad. Going forward, as monetary policies in other
countries are likely to normalize earlier than in Japan, there could be renewed downward pressure
on the exchange rate. However, the regional impact of a yen depreciation on foreign financial
markets and trade is likely to be modest. Spillovers from regional trade agreements would be
slightly positive for countries that joined the initiative.

Japan’s role in regional trade. Intra-regional trade has expanded rapidly since 1990,
largely owing to dynamic economies such as China (Figure 1). Nonetheless, Japan‘s intraregional exports as a share of global GDP have remained remarkably stable—even during
the crisis—and account for more than two-thirds of industrial countries‘ intra-regional trade.
Japan‘s deepening regional integration has largely been driven by the outsourcing of
production by Japanese firms to neighboring countries, especially China, Hong Kong SAR,
and Singapore. This integration has implications for the interpretation of changes in Japan‘s
export structure.
Shifting export structure. The share of high-technology goods in Japan‘s overall exports
has fallen from 34 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2005. This partly reflects a shift in
Japan‘s trade structure—from the export of high-tech final products toward a focus on
sophisticated intermediate inputs, combined with an outsourcing of the low-tech stages of
production to emerging Asian countries. Japan has thus established itself as an important
supplier of sophisticated manufacturing inputs at the global and regional levels, especially in
the transport and electrical-machinery sectors (Table 1). Even though they may not
constitute a large share in Japan‘s overall exports, these items account for a significant
share of global exports in the semiconductor and auto subsectors, and are an important
input not only for Asian countries but also for the United States and European Union.
Rising similarity with export structures of emerging Asia. Although it continues to
compete with other advanced countries—based on the export similarity index (ESI)2—the
export structures of countries such as China and Thailand are also converging with that of
Japan (Figure 2). Further, competitive pressure from Korea appears to have increased
recently, in part due to its ability to brand and market products in China and other Asian
countries. Japan‘s increased outsourcing and upstream position has facilitated the shift in
technology content to other Asian countries, adding to the apparent convergence in export
structures. Rising similarity could thus reflect increased complementarity, as well as
competition.
Position in the supply chain. Japan is clearly upstream in the Asian supply chain and is an
important source of foreign value added (FVA) in the gross exports of other Asian countries
(Table 2). Japan‘s contribution to FVA is especially high in countries engaged in assembly
or processing activities, such as Singapore, Taiwan and China—particularly for high-tech
exports, such as electronic equipment and motor vehicles (Table 3). Japan has thus
become more integrated in Asian regional trade, implying that a disruption in production of
key intermediate inputs could spill over to other countries in the supply chain.

The ESI measures the similarity of export patterns across pairs of countries, and takes a higher value for pairs with similar
shares of each product category.

3
Role of Japanese FDI. Japan‘s role in the Asian supply chain is strongly linked to its vertical
FDI and its role in the spread of technology. Vertical FDI by Japanese multinationals has
traditionally been motivated by factor-price differentials; in contrast, U.S. FDI has generally
been motivated by market-access considerations. Broadly speaking, the labor-intensive
stages of Japanese production, such as final assembly, have been moved to countries with
lower unskilled labor costs, while activities that are relatively intensive in skilled labor—such
as marketing, patenting and innovation—have been retained in headquarters. As such, even
though the share of Japan‘s high technology exports may have declined, it has retained
those aspects of production with the highest value added. Analysis of the iPod suggests that
the second largest share of value added is indeed captured by Japanese firms, which
produce the high-value components of the product. This also explains why Japan has
consistently outperformed other G-7 countries in terms of increasing the income level of its
exports (EXPY) (Figure 3).3
B. Estimating Spillovers: A Sectoral Trade Elasticities Approach
Analytical framework. A simple model that combines a partial equilibrium approach with
input-output analysis is used to analyze the response of sectoral trade flows to changes in
relative prices.4 The simulation assumes a relative price decline that could arise from a
10 percent real depreciation; and then outlines changes in the structure of Japanese trade
across sectors owing to differences in import demand and substitution elasticities, as well as
in the amount of imported intermediate goods. The analysis does not model the drivers of
these exchange rate changes, and does not account for indirect supply-side effects such as
inter-industry reallocation of production factors.
Aggregate effects. The simulation suggests that a change in relative prices results in
important long-run responses on trade flows. Assuming full pass-through of exchange rate
changes to import prices, the Japanese trade balance improves by more than 3 percentage
points of GDP, largely driven by a strong export response. The relatively large trade
response reflects Japan‘s upstream position in the Asian supply chain and the limited share
of imported content in its exports. This likely represents an upper bound; however, as
imperfect exchange rate pass-through and pricing-to-market are likely to mitigate the
adjustment in trade flows to exchange rate changes. Also, adjustment is likely to be gradual,
given high fixed costs in production and trade relationships.

3

For each product category, the EXPY index notes the average income level of those countries producing the same product—
capturing the fact that goods produced by industrialized countries will likely embody higher quality/value added. See
Hausmann, and others (2007) ―
What You Export Matters‖ J. of Ec. Growth, Vol.12.

Sectoral effects. A depreciation results in an increase in the share of medium-high
technology exports, largely driven by the auto sector. In fact, a depreciation would reinforce
Japan‘s comparative advantage in medium-high technology exports and allow it to recover
its relative specialization in the auto sector, which has been increasingly lost to countries
such as Germany and France. Medium-high technology exports are generally more
responsive to relative price changes, reflecting both higher domestic value added, and the
discretionary consumer character of this sector, which is captured in income elasticities.
Supply chain effects. Trade with Asian partners is less sensitive to relative price changes,
so that trade-balance adjustment takes place mainly outside the supply chain (Figure 4). In
response to a depreciation, exports to (imports from) supply-chain partners would increase
(decline) by a smaller amount, compared to the rest of the world. The net result is a greater
outward reorientation of Japanese trade beyond the region, and a rebalancing with the rest
of the world. Note that this effect is symmetric i.e., in response to an appreciation, trade with
Asian partners would react less, resulting in greater regional reorientation of trade flows.

CHAPTER II. ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL SPILLOVERS THROUGH THE ASIAN INPUT-OUTPUT
TABLE5
The Asian International Input-Output Tables (Asian IO tables) provide a systematic
description of intermediate- and final-goods trade flows, and allow a quantitative
assessment of regional interdependence among ten economies, including the NIEs3,
ASEAN4, China, United States, and Japan.6 The analysis in this chapter covers the period
from 1995-2008: actual published tables are available until 2000, whereas the 2005 and
2008 tables are extrapolated from past data (see April 2010 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic
Outlook, Chapter III).
First, the analysis considers production-inducement coefficients (PICs), which capture the
amount of production in a country that is induced by an additional unit of final demand in
another country. These are based on information in the IO Table‘s inverse-Leontief matrix,
and reflect the strength of economic linkages between economies through multiple rounds of
intermediate trade. PICs attributed to foreign economies have risen in most cases,
suggesting deepening interdependence.

Coefficients provide quantitative information of production by countries induced by an additional
unit of final demand in one country.
2
For example, one unit increase in final demand in Indonesia in 2008 induce total 1.3 unit of
production, in which 1.0 unit to home while 0.3 unit to foreign countries.

Note: The four bars represent data for respectively, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008.

Japan plays key role as supplier of basic and capital-intensive parts/products at the
upstream stage of regional production chain. Although the size and share of production
induced by Japan has fallen over the past 15 years, it still remains sizeable, at around
20 percent of total foreign inducement in 2008. While the degree of production inducement
to NIEs3/ASEAN4 economies has remained constant, the amount induced by China has
increased dramatically through the 2000s, offering a clear contrast with Japan. This is

A breakdown of the value-added content of exports confirms Japan‘s upstream position in
the production chain. The general increase in the share of foreign value-added for most
countries‘ exports suggests a process of deepening trade integration. Countries with a
higher foreign value-added share (such as China) focus more on assembly and processing
and are considered ―
downstream‖. In contrast, Japan is considered ―
upstream‖ with the high
domestic value-added share in its own exports, and the high contribution to the foreign
value-added shares of other Asian countries‘ exports.

Moreover, the income dependence analysis illustrates Japan‘s key role as one the regions‘
largest consumer markets, following the United States. The income dependence analysis
captures the extent to which an Asian country‘s income depends on Japan‘s final demand.
Japan remains important, although its share has fallen recently—in contrast, China is
gaining importance as final demand destination, and has become the largest consumer
market for NIEs3/ASEAN4, exceeding even the United States in 2008.

CHAPTER III. JAPAN’S OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT7
Japan’s stock of outward FDI is concentrated mainly in the United States, followed
closely by Asia. Since 2000, Japan‘s FDI has moved progressively away from the United
States towards Asia, reflecting the increased presence of Japan‘s corporations in the region.
The Euro Area has continued to attract around one quarter of Japan‘s outward FDI.

Japan’s outward FDI flows can be modelled by employing a gravity-model framework.
The specification is as follows:8

log( FDI )it  C  1 log(Y )it   2 log( DpcY )it  3 log(Trade)it 1  ui  vt   it
The dependent variable is Japan‘s outward FDI flows to host country i as of year t. Y is the
host country‘s GDP, which captures its market size. |DpcY| is absolute difference in per
capita GDP between Japan and host country, which proxies for differences in labor costs or
factor endowments. Trade is bilateral trade between Japan and the host country, lagged by
one period to account for potential endogeneity. Other control variables include one-period
lagged variables of host-country characteristics (GDP growth as a proxy for productivity and
the ratio of private credit to GDP as a proxy for financial depth). The variable u is a fixedi

effect (capturing host-country invariant factors, such geographical distance from Japan and
domestic institutions); v is a time-effect (which captures factors affecting all host countries in
t

a similar fashion); and ε is error-term.
tt

The model is estimated using panel OLS (two-way fixed effects), based on a panel of 129
economies over 1989-2008. To check for robustness, other estimation methods were tested
(e.g., Tobit estimation), with broadly similar results.

8

Variables are transformed using a semi-log procedure of the form, x=sign(x)log(1+|x|), in order to include entries with recorded
values of zero.

represent statistical significance at 10, 5, and 1 percent respectively.

Key results include:


The coefficient on income differences is positive and statistically significant in all
samples (equations (1) to (9)). This suggests that labor cost differentials—vertical
integration—has been main driver of Japan‘s FDI.



The coefficient on the host country‘s GDP is significant only for developing economies
after 2000 (equations (7) to (9)), suggesting that the host country‘s market size has
recently become another important driving factor for Japan‘s outward FDI. This is also
consistent with the expansion of Japan‘s multinational operations, especially in Asia, to
develop local demand.



There is a clear positive relationship between Japan‘s outward FDI and bilateral trade
over the full sample (equations (1) to (6)), although this relationship weakens in the
latter part of the sample for developing economies (equations (7) to (9)). This is
consistent with the idea that originally, Japan‘s outward FDI was complementary to its
trade pattern (e.g., exporting parts/capital goods to factories/subsidiaries financed by
Japan‘s FDI); while since 2000 it has become increasingly aimed at servicing local
markets, substituting for its exports.

CHAPTER V. EXTRACTING AGGREGATE SPILLOVER INDICES FROM THE GVAR MODEL10
A. The GVAR Model
The GVAR (Global Vector Autoregressive) model is designed to examine the role of
unobserved global factors on country-specific variables. The model is estimated in two
steps.
First, individual country-level models are constructed, with country variables such as real
GDP as a function of a constant, a trend, their own lags and, finally, contemporaneous and
lagged trade weighted averages of corresponding foreign variables:

xit  α i  β i t  γ 'i1 xi ,t 1  ...  γ 'ip xi ,t  p

 φ'i1 x*i ,t 1  ...  φ'iq x*i ,t q  δ'i d t  ε t

, (1)

where x is a vector of endogenous variables for country i at time t, and x* is a vector of trade
weighted averages of endogenous variables for the trading partners of country i, α is the
intercept and t denotes the time trend.
Second, these individual models are combined in a consistent manner to create a global
model, which can generate impulse responses or forecasts for all of the variables
simultaneously. The country specific models (1) are subsequently aggregated by
recognizing that the explanatory variables in equation (1) can be written as:

x 
z it   *it   Wi  xt , (2)
 xit 
where W matrix contains trade weights for every country. The variables include: log of real
GDP, inflation, real equity price, nominal exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, short and longterm interest rates and the oil price. The data set covers 25 countries and the Euro Area.11
The sample period is from 1979Q4 to 2009Q4.
B. Aggregate Spillover Indices
It is possible to use the GVAR to assess the importance of a particular country as a
source of spillovers.12 One of the outputs from the GVAR model is the generalized
variance decomposition matrix, which shows how much a shock to a particular variable
contributes to the forecast error variance of another variable, accounting for the correlation
structure. This information can be used to define an ―
aggregate spillover index‖.
The aggregate spillover index is calculated for every variable according the following
three-step procedure: (i) subtract the total contribution of the variance of domestic
10

Prepared by Sergejs Saksonovs (SPR).

11

Not all variables are available for all countries and some missing data is interpolated from annual levels. Euro Area variables
are defined as a GDP weighted aggregate of eight countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands
and Spain.

12

See Pesaran, and others (2004), ―
Modeling Regional Interdependencies Using a Global Error-Correcting Macroeconometric
Model‖, J. of Bus. & Ec. Statistics 22(2) and Dees, and others, (2007) ―

Global VAR Analysis‖, J. of Applied Econometrics, 22.

15
variables from the total forecast error variance; (ii) add up the variance shares due to the
variables of every particular country and divide them by the total contribution due to variance
of foreign variables; and (iii) normalize the resulting scores by subtracting the mean and
dividing by standard deviation.
The resulting index shows the importance of all Japanese variables to the forecast
error variance of a particular variable in all other countries. When the aggregate
spillover index is less (greater) than 0, Japanese variables contribute less (more) to forecast
error variance than the average contribution of other trading partners. Since the index is in
terms of standard deviations, a number greater than 2 can be interpreted as high.
The results can be summarized as follows:


When the intensity of trade linkages is averaged over the period from 1980 to 2009,
Japan's importance to its trading partners is higher than the importance of the
average trading partner (Chart 1). In some variables (output, inflation and real equity
prices) the average aggregate spillover index is higher only relative to the region.13
For exchange rate, short-term and long-term interest rate the situation is reversed
presumably because these variables are more linked with other advanced
economies.



The importance of Japan to its trading partners has declined over time (Charts 2 and
3). When focusing on the second half of the sample, Japan contributes less to the
forecast error variance of its trading partners than the average country and its
aggregate spillover indices are less than zero.



Among the S4 countries, Japan contributes mostly to the forecast error variances of
inflation and exchange rate (Chart 4). The Euro Area and the United States are by
far the most important economies when compared to Japan or the United Kingdom.
Japan is generally ranked third after the United States and the Euro Area.

13

Regional countries are Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Philippines and
Thailand.

CHAPTER VI. GLOBAL AND REGIONAL BANK LINKAGES14
This analysis traces the network spillovers resulting from hypothetical credit events
to specific banking systems.15 It is based on the methodology in Espinosa-Vega and Sole
(2010) and relies on a matrix of BIS country-level bank exposure- and capital data for 26
countries.16 Two simulations are performed: a simulation of a banking system under distress
that is unable to repay interbank loans to others (a credit shock); and a simulation of a
distressed banking system that is not only unable to repay its loans, but is also unable to
rollover its funding to others (credit shock plus funding shock) (Figures 1a and 1b).17
Bilateral exposure data suggest that Japanese banks are mostly exposed to the U.S.
and U.K. banking systems. Among Asian countries, Japan‘s largest exposures are to
Australia, South Korea and China, while the remaining countries account for less than
1 percent of Japan‘s bank global exposures. Among Asian countries, China, Taiwan and
Australia are the main funding countries, but these linkages remain small.
Network analysis results confirm that Japan is most at risk from exposures in the
United States and the United Kingdom. Under the extreme scenario (λ=1, ρ=0.5, δ=2),
there are eight instances in which Japan is expected to fail owing to distress in various U.S.
and European banking systems. In particular, Japan‘s banking system is expected to lose
57.6 percent (35.8 percent) of its pre-shock capital if the U.K. (U.S.) banking system suffers
a credit event (Table 1). If the event is combined with a funding shock, then the United
States could trigger distress in Japan, but only in the third contagion round.
Among Asian countries, Japan is most at risk from Australia and South Korea, but the
potential impairment is below 5 percent of the pre-shock capital of the Japanese banking
system; the combined shock does not substantially increase the distress from these
countries (Table 1).
If Japanese banks become distressed, Australia and South Korea are most at risk.
Even under extreme circumstances, this is not expected to have systemic consequences in
Asia, with the exception for South Korea, which could suffer a credit event owing to secondround contagion effects from European and the U.S. banks. The most affected are the
European and U.S. banks. (Table 1).

The analysis is based on BIS locational statistics as of September 2009. This allows for a broad sectoral breakdown and rich
set of Asian countries.

16

Countries included in the analysis are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. Note that global exposures of banks in China, Indonesia,
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are extracted from data on liabilities of the countries‘ counterparties.

Network analysis confirms the limited spillovers that Japanese banks could have on
the region. Given the modest role of Japanese banks in the region (compared to the rest of
the world), very few banking systems would face systemic difficulties if the Japanese
banking system were to become distressed.

CHAPTER VII. THE TRANSMISSION OF JAPANESE FINANCIAL-SECTOR STRESS18
The global recession demonstrated forcefully how strains in the financial sector of
one country can rapidly affect financial stability in another. Although Japan has not
been at the core of the recent financial crisis, the size of its financial sector suggests that it
might nonetheless be a potential source for spillovers.
This chapter explores the extent to

and the banking sector into a

composite index. It tracks market-price
movements relative to past levels or
-5
trends and defines stress as the
-10
deviation from historical norms. The
index captures the most important
stress episodes identified in the literature,20 and has been compiled for 17 advanced
countries and 26 emerging economies using monthly data. A detailed description of the FSI
is provided in the 2009 Spring World Economic Outlook.
To explore the spillovers from stress in Japan to other emerging regions, staff have
employed a two-step approach. In the first step, staff extract a common stress component
for Asian and other emerging economies (FSI-EM) derived the from common time effects of
an unbalanced panel of emerging-economy stress indices from 1997-2010. In the second
step, the common time-component of emerging-economy stress is related to the FSI for
Japan (FSI-Japan), as well as the FSI for other developed regions (FSI-G6), and a range of
global control variables (Globalfactors).
FSI-EMt = f (FSI-Japant,FSI-G6t , Global factorst )
Asian economies are found to share a large common stress time-component. For
Asian economies, the common time-component explains about 80 percent of the time
variation of the FSI across economies. This compares to about 55 percent for other nonAsian emerging economies (e.g., Turkey, Brazil, and Russia). The FSI subindices with the
strongest time co-movement are security and exchange markets, while comovement in
banking-sector strains are less common among emerging economies.

Financial stress in Japan has measureable spillovers to financial markets in Asia. A
one standard-deviation increase in Japan‘s FSI raises financial stress in the region by
around 0.2 standard deviations. This effect is small relative to the spillovers from other G7
economies (with a coefficient of 0.3-0.5) but is robust to the exclusion of the global crisis
from the sample (3rd column). Stress spillovers from Japan to other emerging economies are
small and not statistically significant (last three columns).
Rapid transmission of financial stress illustrates the strength of international linkages
across securities markets. Lag-structure tests (not shown) indicate that transmission of
financial stress occurs within one month. And robustness tests confirm that the results are
not sensitive to changes in the method for extracting the common stress component, or to
the potential endogeneity of advanced-economy stress in the second-stage regression.

21
CHAPTER VIII. GIMF SIMULATIONS OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND GROWTH STRATEGY21
Several scenarios are run to show spillovers from Japan’s policies to other regions
using IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF). 22 The first set of
simulations show the implications of financing earthquake-related expenditures and
subsequent fiscal consolidation based on staff‘s debt sustainability analysis; the second set
examines the spillovers from the authorities‘ growth strategy; and the final set presents the
spillovers from their joint implementation.
Simulations show that fiscal reforms would benefit the rest of the world in the long
term once the adjustment is fully completed, but may involve short-term costs. In the
medium-term and during the transition, the net effects would depend on relative importance
of trade linkages, permanent-income effects, exchange-rate flexibility, and monetary
accommodation. Once the adjustment is fully completed, however, lower long-term real
interest rates supported by higher public savings would benefit all regions. Some of the
short-term negative spillovers to the other regions could be eliminated by implementation of
the growth strategy and monetary accommodation in Japan. As the model focuses mainly
on macro-level trade channels, spillovers could be larger if supply-chain linkages and other
financial contagion channels, such as carry trades, are considered.
A. Fiscal Consolidation
The government has announced broad outlines of a medium-term fiscal strategy, but
key details are not yet clear. The government‘s Fiscal Management Strategy (released in
June 2010) aims to halve the primary deficit by FY2015 and put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a
downward path from FY2021 onwards. On June 30, 2011, the authorities outlined their
social security reform plans to support their medium-term fiscal strategy. The plan proposes
to double the consumption tax to 10 percent in stages by the mid-2010s, and to use the
proceeds to fund social security. The tax increase would allow the government to meet its
deficit target for FY2015. The plan also proposed to raise the pension retirement age and
adjust nominal pension benefits for deflation, but did not stipulate steps beyond FY2015 for
meeting the final target of reducing the debt ratio starting in FY2021 at the latest.
According to staff’s analysis, stabilizing the net debt ratio by 2016 and reducing it to
around 135 percent of GDP by 2020 would require a 10 percent of GDP adjustment in
the structural primary balance starting in 2012. While there are various possible options
to achieve such adjustment, given the limited scope for cutting expenditure, fiscal
adjustment would need to rely mainly on new revenue sources and constraints on spending
growth.

21

Prepared by Pelin Berkmen (APD).

22

The model covers five regions: Japan, the United States, Euro area, emerging Asia, and remaining countries. The calibration
is slightly different from the version used for Japan 2010 Article IV, with updated monetary policy parameters and steady state
debt.

22
The consolidation scenario assumes a gradual 10 percentage point increase in the
consumption tax (Chart 1). A moderate increase in the consumption tax could start in
2012, when a cyclical recovery is underway, to limit bond issuance and strengthen the
commitment to fiscal reforms. A gradual but sustained fiscal consolidation starts in 2013.
Adjustment of about 2½ percent of GDP would come from the expiry of the fiscal stimulus
package and modest expenditure adjustment, which are already incorporated in staff‘s
central WEO projections. The scenario further assumes a phased increase of the
consumption tax (with some frontloading) raising revenues by 5 percent of GDP, and an
increase in personal income tax by ½ percent of GDP. At the same time, corporate income
tax is lowered, reducing revenues by ½ percent of GDP. In addition, the scenario builds in a
decline in government consumption by 1¾ percent of GDP and in public investment by
¼ percent of GDP. The rest of the adjustment comes from transfers. The simulations
assume that the package is fully credible in that the entire adjustment is anticipated, so that
private agents adjust their behavior starting from the initial period.
Consolidation without supporting structural reforms would lower Japanese growth in
the short-run but is likely to bring long-run benefits (Chart 2).


In the short-run, fiscal adjustment would depress GDP growth for several
years by about ½ percentage points relative to a non-adjustment scenario. The
increase in the consumption tax, personal income tax, lower government
consumption and investment reduce domestic demand.



Some of the negative effects in the short-run can be offset by accommodative
monetary policy in Japan (Chart 3).23 Keeping nominal interest rates low while
inflation returns to its steady-state growth would lower the short-run real interest
rates.24



In the medium-run, real GDP could rise above the baseline, but would depend on
various factors, including the impact from lower long-run real interest rates, a fall in
precautionary savings, a switch to less distortionary corporate taxes, and confidence
effects.



Fiscal consolidation increases the trade balance. While a decline in private
savings could offset some of the increase in government savings, world real interest
rates would also change. As overall savings increase, Japan‘s trade balance
improves, requiring a real depreciation of the yen.

Relative to the impact in Japan, the spillovers into other economies are muted, with
the largest impact on emerging Asia. Exports decline in all regions as a result of lower
demand from Japan. The impact on imports and overall GDP, however, depends on various
factors, including a) exchange rate flexibility and b) the increase in domestic demand—

23

This scenario assumes that interest rates will stay low for the initial two years.

24

While the decline in demand creates downward pressure on inflation, depreciation of the yen and the increase in
consumption taxes pull it up.

23
particularly in the United States and Euro Area—arising from the impact of lower long-run
interest rates on investment, supply, and permanent income.


Over the next 5–10 years, fiscal consolidation reduces demand for imports by Japan,
but the net effect on GDP in the region depends on the monetary-policy response,
permanent income effects in other regions, and the flexibility of exchange rates.



On the one extreme, if the exchange rate is fixed, tradable inflation declines for
Japan‘s regional partners, pulling up real interest rates and reducing domestic
demand and imports. As a result, real GDP declines. This negative impact on
domestic demand would be lower for countries with restricted capital mobility. In
such a situation, the interest rate is not forced to increase as much, limiting the
negative spillovers.



At the other extreme, if the exchange rate adjusts fully, real interest rates do not
increase as much, dampening the impact on GDP (Chart 4).



In other regions where the trade linkages are more modest, permanent income
effects dominate—so that lower real interest rates result in higher investment and
consumption.

Once fiscal consolidation is complete, all regions benefit from lower long-run interest
rates. As a result of fiscal adjustment in Japan, world real interest rates are lower, pulling up
investment and consumption in all regions.
B. Growth Strategy
The simulations also capture the impact of increasing productivity and enhanced
competition in labor markets, in line with the authorities’ growth strategy. The growthstrategy scenario assumes that trend growth will gradually increase by about 1 percentage
point over a 10 year period, owing to productivity increases in both tradable and nontradable
sectors, as well as reductions in labor market mark-ups by 2 percentage points (Chart 5).
The government‘s growth strategy sets a target of 2 percent real growth for the coming
decade, focusing on key sectors, such as environment, health, Asian integration, and
tourism
A broad-based productivity increase will reduce the trade balance in Japan. With
higher productivity in both tradable and nontradable sector, consumption and investment
start to improve even in the short-run, and this together with the associated appreciation of
the currency leads to higher imports than otherwise.
In the absence of fiscal consolidation, spillovers to other economies from the growth
strategy are small relative to the impact on the Japan, with the net gains depending
on the relative importance of trade and real interest rate effects.


In the short run, all regions benefit through trade linkages with higher demand from
Japan. However, the short-term impact on real GDP depends on the monetary policy
reaction in the United States and the Euro Area. If monetary policy does not react to

24
higher inflation in other regions, real GDP increases along with the higher trade
balance.


Over the medium- to long-run, all regions benefit from higher productivity and lower
real interest rates, but again the benefits are relatively small, particularly in the
absence of fiscal consolidation. While the benefits to Emerging Asia accrue over the
shorter horizons through trade linkages, the benefits to other regions accrue over
longer horizon.

C. Combined Policy Package of Fiscal Consolidation and Growth Strategy
The short-term negative effects from fiscal consolidation would be mitigated by
structural reforms. Overall, structural reforms would help Japan‘s GDP increase gradually,
limiting the decline in imports and rise in current account surplus under the fiscal
consolidation scenario, thereby reducing the negative trade spillovers to the rest of the
world. The short-run growth spillovers from structural reforms in Japan would depend on
exchange rate and monetary policy responses, but negative spillovers to emerging Asia
could be significantly dampened through the trade channel. Other regions would benefit
from lower real interest rates caused by a credible fiscal consolidation plan and higher
productivity, particularly over the medium-run.25

25

The improvement in emerging Asia‘s current account stems from import suppression originating from the decline in demand
prompted by to higher real interest rates. Similar to the fiscal consolidation scenario, with flexible exchange rates, import
suppression is much less, dampening the impact on emerging Asia‘s trade balance.

CHAPTER IX. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY, BORROWING COSTS, AND THE IMPACT OF A FISCAL
CRISIS26
A. Context
The earthquake has interrupted Japan’s nascent recovery, and has placed greater
attention on the dynamics of Japan’s public debt. Large fiscal deficits and sluggish
activity have pushed public debt to unprecedented levels, leaving the government‘s
financing requirements at around 50 percent of GDP, almost twice that of the United States.
The fact that JGB yields remain at historic lows suggests that creditors are confident about
the authorities‘ ability to come up with a sound stabilization plan. To stabilize debt and place
it firmly on a downward path, staff have recommended a 10 percent of GDP improvement of
the structural primary balance over the next 10 years.
Japan’s debt-sustainability projections are particularly sensitive to assumptions on
the future path of interest rates. For example, with
Figure 1. Japan: Net Public Debt

economy.
B. Fiscal Crisis Scenarios
Staff have simulated a range of fiscal crisis scenarios originating in Japan, featuring
different assumptions regarding the impact of the crisis on worldwide market
confidence. These results are derived from a refined version of the structural
macroeconometric model of the world economy documented in Vitek (2010), which features
extensive linkages between the real and financial sectors, both within and across G20
economies.27
The first scenario features a fiscal crisis that is contained within Japan. A
sudden loss of confidence in fiscal sustainability is represented by a positive term-

27
premium shock, which raises the long term nominal interest rate by 450 basis points
on impact (bringing Japanese yields in line with other similarly rated sovereigns).
Heightened risk aversion also hits the stock market, represented by an equity riskpremium shock which reduces equity prices by 60 percent on impact (similar to
stock-market declines in many other financial crises). In addition, households and
firms postpone their consumption and investment, owing to reduced confidence,
decreasing domestic demand by 1 percent, while a fiscal consolidation reduces it by
a further 2 percent. Finally, there is a run on the yen, represented by an exchangerate risk premium shock which results in a 30 percent nominal effective depreciation
on impact. Overall, this fiscal crisis is estimated to generate a weighted-average
peak output loss of 4.4 percent in Japan, 0.1 percent in peripheral European
countries, 0.2 percent in other advanced economies, and 0.4 percent in emerging
economies.


Under the second and third scenarios, heightened risk aversion in Japan
spreads progressively to bond and stock markets in the European periphery
and emerging markets. Although Japanese financial markets are relatively isolated,
during periods of uncertainty global financial markets face elevated risks of falling
market confidence and herd behavior. In this context, the scenarios augment the first
with additional shocks to foreign long term nominal interest rates, equities, exchange
rates, and demand (Table 1). Depending on the extent of spillovers to market
confidence, the costs to other countries can reach as high as 3 percent of GDP.

CHAPTER X. THE IMPACT OF A FISCAL CRISIS ON THE REGION: FINANCIAL-SECTOR
SPILLOVERS28
Most JGBs are held by Japanese financial institutions. This suggests that a shock to
JGB yields might have a direct spillover to other markets, by impacting Japan‘s financialsector balance sheets and prompting a withdrawal by Japanese financial firms from foreign
markets. Banks and insurance companies combined account for almost 90 percent of the
financial sector‘s JGB holdings. They also account for the majority of the financial sector‘s
foreign loans and investments. Therefore, this chapter looks at the impact of a JGB shock
on local banks and insurance companies, focusing in particular their financial soundness
and potential spillovers to Japan‘s regional neighbors.

Note: Figures are the ratio of each financial institution's JGB holdings, foreign securities and loans to total financial
institutions excluding the central bank at the end of 2010. JGB is the sum of treasury discount bills, government securities
and Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP) bonds. All foreign loans are assumed to be conducted by banks.

The effect of a JGB shock on the Japanese banking sector.
Japanese banks have strengthened their capital recently, but still hold a large amount
of JGBs and Japanese equities. They have also recently started to increase loans to
foreign countries, especially Asian economies. Megabanks in particular—MUFG, SMFG,
and Mizuho FG—account for most of the banking sector‘s JGB and equity holdings, and are
also responsible for most foreign loans. We therefore stress test the balance sheets of the
three megabanks to gauge the effect of a JGB shock on bank stability and foreign lending.
We consider five stress scenarios: a 100bps, 200bps, 300bps, and 400bps parallel shift
in the yield curve, as well as the fiscal-crisis scenario considered in Chapter IX. The Q-JEM
(Quarterly Japanese Economic Model)29 is used to estimate the follow-on impact of an
interest-rate shock on stock prices and GDP growth in the first four scenarios. For the fiscalcrisis scenario, the assumed shock entails a 450bps increase in interest rates, a 60 percent
decline in equity prices, and 4.4 percent decline in growth.
The stress test estimates the impact on profits, tier I capital, and foreign loans. The
first step provides an estimate of the immediate losses on banks‘ JGB and equity holdings,

as well as expected losses in the loan portfolio.30 The second step calculates the resulting
Tier I capital ratio, assuming that risk-weighted assets remain unchanged. Finally, the drop
in foreign lending is estimated by assuming that megabanks maintain the targeted Tier I
ratio by reducing their foreign loans.31

The results show that the megabanks are resilient to JGB shocks. Only in the extreme
scenario do they reduce their foreign portfolios significantly. In the first three scenarios their
Tier I ratios remain above 8 percent. In the fourth 400bps scenario, the average Tier I ratio
drops to 7.8%, prompting a slight scaling back of foreign loans to bring the ratio back up to
8 percent. In the crisis scenario, the Tier I ratio drops to 6.7 percent. Although this meets the
minimum requirement level of 6 percent, in order to bring capital back to 8 percent, the
banks would have to reduce foreign loans by 45 percent.

The Bank of Japan‘s default rate function—outlined in Financial System Report, April, 2007—is used to estimate GDP-related
losses in the loan portfolio. In addition, the three mega banks‘ core operating profits are assumed to be the same as 2010.
31

Megabanks are assumed to aim at an 8 percent Tier I ratio.

30
Even under the most severe scenario, the regional impact of a reduction in foreign
loans is limited. Assuming that the banks reduce their foreign loans in proportion to their
share of loans to each jurisdiction, the impact on local banking systems is relatively minor,
ranging from 0–2 percent expressed as a fraction of total domestic credit. The key
exceptions are the offshore financial centers, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, where the
impact ranges from 3–6 percent. As these centers are effectively cross-border
intermediaries, the effect on the local economy will likely be limited.
Interbank network analysis confirms that a withdrawal of Japanese funding-would not
be severe enough to trigger systemic distress in other countries.32 In the event that
regional banking systems experience a 45 percent withdrawal their funding from Japan,33
the most vulnerable country is South Korea, which could experience a 14 percent decline in
pre-shock bank capital. Other exposed countries are Australia, and to a limited extent,
Indonesia and Thailand. In no case would a JGB-initiated shock push any of the regional
banking systems to failure.
The presence of Japanese investors in regional capital markets is limited, so a
withdrawal of Japanese banks will have a relatively small impact. Japan‘s equity
holdings, as a fraction of local market capitalization, are significant in both the United States
and Europe—ranging from 3–6 percent—but are much smaller in Asia (0–2 percent). A
similar pattern applies to Japan‘s debt holdings.
The effect of JGB shock on the insurance sector
Japanese insurance companies have substantial financial buffers. The average
solvency margin of the major firms is 932 percent, well above the minimum requirement of
200 percent, and representing a sizable cushion against JGB shocks. Applying same stress
scenarios, the result shows that even in the most severe scenario, the insurance companies‘
solvency margin ratio remains above 300 percent. Therefore, JGB shocks would not force
them to reallocate their financial assets or liquidate their foreign investment positions.

maturity of JGBs is 10 years and the average coupon rate is 1.2 per cent.

32

We repeat the network analysis used in Chapter VI to simulate a funding shock restricted within the region.

33

Again, local banks will need to need sell some of their assets at fire-sale prices, and we assume a discount of 50 percent.

CHAPTER XI. CAPITAL MARKET CONTAGION AND EXTREME TAIL DEPENDENCE34
The size of the public debt and the potential cost of post-earthquake reconstruction
raise the issue of whether investors will continue to enthusiastically buy Japanese
government bonds (JGBs). While it is difficult to estimate the risk of a sudden withdrawal,
past episodes of large changes in JGB yields could shed light on the potential spillover
effects to G7 financial markets.
This chapter assesses the cross-border spillovers of large changes in the 10-year JGB
yields and equity returns. Key stylized facts about the correlations between excessive equity
returns and bond-yields include:35


Large negative equity returns and large increases in bond yields are not necessarily
correlated within major countries, such as the U.S., Germany, and Japan. This
means that changes in these two market types are driven by separate events.
However, greater correlations are found within some smaller countries, such as
Greece and Ireland.



Large negative shocks in equity returns are significantly correlated across countries,
but vary in degree. For instance, correlations are <0.30 with Japan, >0.6 within
Europe, and around 0.5 between U.S.-Canada and U.S.-U.K.



Large positive changes in 10-year bond yields are not very correlated across
countries. In fact, there are no coincident yield-spikes in Japan and the major
countries at the 99th percentile tail. If the threshold is lowered to 95th percentile
(where 10-year yield change>18bps counts as exceedance), then there are small but
significant correlations with European countries. The correlations lie between 0.2–0.3
between U.S.-France and U.S.-Germany but are higher within Europe.

To control for common shocks, an extreme value theory (EVT) approach is used to
examine the conditional-correlation between extreme returns in Japanese financial
markets and those elsewhere. This is done by means of logit-regressions, in which
exceedances in (say) the United States are regressed on exceedances elsewhere (including
in Japan), controlling for common factors such as global equity returns, changes in global
risk aversion (denoted by changes in the VIX), and extreme events in the euro-area
periphery. The regressions also include lagged dependent variables to absorb other
country-specific effects.
Four sets of results are presented in Tables 1–4. Spillovers from extreme increases in
10-year bond yields to similar bonds in other countries (―
bond-to-bond‖) are presented in
Table 1. The matrix shows the association (+/-, significance) between extreme increases in
bond yields in ―
trigger‖ countries (rows) to the ―
affected‖ countries (columns). The effects are

See Annex 1 for the definition and methodology for calculation of exceedances.

32
in terms of the probability of experiencing extreme movements in the affected countries,
given an extreme movement in the trigger. Table 2 shows the association between the
affected countries‘ probability of experiencing extremely negative equity returns conditional
on the event that one of the triggers is also experiencing extremely negative returns (―
equityto-equity‖). Tables 3 and 4 present results for cross-asset correlations across countries.
The results can be summarized as follows:


Extremely large increases in 10-year JGB bond yields are associated with a higher
likelihood of a hike in France‘s 10-year bond yields and, to a much smaller extent,
the United States (Table 1). The equity returns of European stock indices are more
likely to be adversely affected than their 10-year bond yields, especially in France
and Germany (Table 2).



Large negative equity returns in the Japanese stock index tend to be correlated with
large negative returns in the United States, and to a much smaller extent, France
(Table 3). There is almost no impact of large negative equity returns on large
increases in bond yields in advanced countries (Table 4).



When global equity markets (MSCI world) are doing better, chances of large
negative equity returns fall for all countries, including Japan. There are some cases
in which the chances of a large change in yields increase when the world equity
markets are doing better, but the evidence on that is thin (mainly on Germany and
the United States).

33
Annex 1. Methodology used in the extreme-value analysis
Step 1: We use daily (5-day week) equity returns and week-on-week changes in 10-year
bond yields for France, Germany, Italy, Japan, U.K., and the United States. Other variables,
used as controls, include the VIX, MSCI-World equity returns, and the equity returns and
bond yields for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland. The extreme value threshold for the
data is calculated by the 5th percentile tail.
Step 2: All observations exceeding the threshold are assigned a value of 1; others are 0.
These series are called exceedances.
Step 3: The spillover analysis is done by estimating the probability that the equity return of a
country is in exceedance (takes the value of 1), conditional on Japan and other countries
being in exceedance. This coexceedance is estimated from a logistic regression with an
exceedance as the dependent variable (say country X‘s exceedance) and other
exceedances (countries Y1, Y2…) and a lagged-dependent variable as explanatory
variables. The weekly changes in MSCI-World and VIX, and the sum of exceedances in
Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain (0-4 variable), are added as controls for common
factors. A significant positive coefficient on any right-hand side variable is interpreted as: the
probability of X being in exceedance is higher if Y1 is in exceedance (positive coefficient),
but not so if Y2 (non-significant coefficient) is in exceedance (for instance). Then, country X
and Y1 are said to coexceed with each other. Four sets of regressions are estimated for
each of the large advanced countries. The first one looks at coexceedances in bond-yields;
the second, coexceedances in equity-returns; the third, coexceedances from bond-yields to
equity returns; and, the fourth, from equity returns to bond-yields.

CHAPTER XII. ASSESSING DISTRESS DEPENDENCE AMONG SOVEREIGNS36
The behavior of CDS spreads over the past few years suggests that financial-market
spillovers between sovereigns tend to be elevated during times of market distress.
This distress dependence might be due to fundamental factors, such as trade or capital-flow
linkages. It may reflect the cross-border activities of globally-active financial institutions. Or,
it may instead result from psychological factors, such as herding behavior, or a global shift in
risk aversion.
As a measure of these potential spillovers, it is possible to compute the probability of
sovereign distress in one country given default in another.
The probability of sovereign distress in country A given a default by country B—P(A|B)—is
obtained in three steps:


The marginal probabilities of distress (PoD) for countries A and B, P(A) and P(B)
respectively, are extracted from the individual-country CDS spreads, using data from
Bloomberg.



The joint probability of distress (JPoD) of A and B, P(A∩B), is obtained using the
methodology developed by Segoviano.37 This is a non-parametric approach that
estimates the JPoD without imposing a (pre-determined) distributional form; subject
only to the constraint that the implied PoD for each country is the same as that
extracted from market data. This differs from traditional approaches, in which
parametric copulas have to be chosen and calibrated explicitly—usually a difficult
task.



Finally, the conditional probability of distress (CoPod) P(A|B) is obtained from:
P(A|B)= P(A∩B )/ P(B)

The joint distribution is estimated for each date, providing a series of time-varying
probability estimates for each country pair. Such pair-wise estimates provide insights
into market views concerning the potential for confidence spillovers from one country to
another. In the case of Japan, overall CoPods tend to be relatively low, but are elevated
during times of global turmoil. Moreover, they appear to be currently elevated for some
European countries with perceived fiscal vulnerabilities, as well as for some European
banks.

CHAPTER XIII. MONETARY POLICY SPILLOVERS38
The Local and International Impact of Large-Scale Asset Purchases
The Bank of Japan has pursued powerful monetary easing since Dec 2009, introducing
a new fixed-rate provision of funds, an asset purchase program take involves government
and corporate bonds, and equity exchange-traded funds and real estate trusts. It has also
introduced new growth-focused lending.
Event-study analysis suggests that the easing has had a modest impact on local
sovereign yields and equity returns (Table 1), but the impact on corporate credit and
economic activity is not yet clear.39 The impact on the exchange rate, or on foreign markets,
has not been significant (Tables 2 and 3).
The Impact of Further Easing: Model Simulations
Spillovers from additional easing will likely be limited. Simulations are based on a
refined version of the structural G-20 model.40 The scenario investigates a larger easing
effort, and is calibrated by scaling up the above eventFigure 1. Peak Impulse Response to
study results, assuming that the authorities increase
Japanese LSAP (percent of output)
their asset purchases up to the current allowable limit.
The result is a sequence of term premium shocks that

Rising Interest Differentials and the Return of the Carry Trade
Prior to the global financial crisis, persistently low interest rates and historically low
volatility made the yen a favored funding currency for carry trades.42 Moreover, the
strong appetite for risk that characterized 2003–07 led to a steady build up in these
positions, and rendered the carry trade a significant driver of cross-currency positioning.
Quantifying the size and destination of these positions is challenging. The range of
instruments associated with the carry trade has grown over the years, including complex offbalance sheet transactions that are less easily detected in BoP and capital-flow statistics.
The trade has also come to encompass a range of different investor classes, from ―
Mrs.
Watanabe,‖ to more sophisticated global brokerage houses and hedge funds. In 2007, near
the peak, estimates of the yen-funded carry trade ranged from $100 billion to $2 trillion.
Currently, the prospects for a return of the carry trade do not seem strong. Compared
to the precrisis period, forward-looking measures of risk-adjusted yields are relatively low for
the Australian, New Zealand, and U.S. currencies; reflecting narrow interest-rate differentials
against the yen and a higher level of implied volatility. Notably, only the Brazilian real
appears to be climbing towards the elevated levels of 2008, and market contacts indicate
that Brazilian assets have become a favorite destination for Japanese retail investment trust
accounts.
Position and leverage indicators suggests less capacity to hold yen-funded carry
trades. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noncommercial traders are currently holding
net long positions in the yen, whereas net short positions were the norm prior to the crisis.
Leverage indicators, such as the call-money liabilities of foreign banks in Japan, also
suggest a significant decline in the trade‘s attractiveness. This is consistent with anecdotal
reports that hedge funds and other speculative investors now find it more difficult building up
leverage in the post-Lehman shock environment.
Forecasting the Carry Trade
Looking forward, monetary normalization in other advanced markets suggests that
interest differentials will widen once more. Following the methodology of Shin (2009), we
can take the net interoffice assets of foreign banks operating in Japan as an indicator of the
scale of the yen-funded carry trade. Arguably this is a better guide than using foreign-bank
liabilities in the Japanese cash market, as it excludes funds used to purchase Japanese
securities.
These net interoffice assets can then be modeled as a function of international policy-rate
differentials (JPN vs. average of AUS/US/EUR) and the VIX.

A―
carry trade‖ exploits opportunities presented by of low borrowing costs in one market combined with higher returns in
another. Its success as strategy has long been a puzzle for economists, given that it violates the hypothesis of uncovered
interest parity—the so called forward premium puzzle.

Key results:


Extending Shin‘s original regression to an updated dataset, the relationship with the
VIX breaks down—again, this may reflect that fact that, after the Lehman shock,
banks and hedge funds are more constrained in using their balance sheets for
speculative purposes.



By including a post-Lehman interaction term on the VIX, however, we recover Shin‘s
original relationship. A similar interaction term on the interest differential, and a postLehman dummy, are both insignificant.



The residuals of the OLS specification suggest substantial autocorrelation. The
preferred model, therefore, includes a lagged dependent variable. (The choice of
specification, however, makes little material difference to the ultimate projection of
net interoffice assets).

43
Projections
Assuming Japanese rates remain unchanged over the next two years, we can then use the
expected increase in policy rates abroad (median forecast from Bloomberg) to project the
likely increase in the scale of the carry trade out of Japan. To summarize, the average
interest differential is expected to widen by about 220 bps by end 2012, prompting an
increase in the carry trade of around ¥4.3 Trillion ($51 billion).
The next step is to map the change in the carry trade into actual exchange rates. A good
price indicator is the JPY/AUD pair. Drawing from the recent relationship between this rate
and net interoffice assets, staff project the (marginal) impact on the JPY/AUD of the
anticipated increase in the carry trade. Projections are based on a simple VARX framework.
Overall, the carry-trade increase is expected to prompt a 5 percent depreciation of the yen
against the AUD. The impact on other rates, such as the JPY/USD is uncertain. But as a
general guide, 5 percent might be considered as an upper bound against other rates.

CHAPTER XIV. THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT—IMPACT ON JAPAN AND OTHER
MEMBERS43
Background. The origin of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is the 2006 Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. In 2010,
an additional alliance between the United States, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam
was announced and talks began about extending the TPP to these five countries. Japan,
Korea, Thailand, Canada and Mexico have expressed interest in joining. Negotiations are
progressing under U.S. leadership. The TPP is envisioned as a high-standard, 21st century
trade agreement that includes commitments covering all aspects of trade and investment.
The TPP is also seen as a starting point for a broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific
(FTAAP). In June 2010, as part of its new growth strategy, Japan announced its intention to
join TPP as a means of opening up the country and revitalizing agriculture.
Key proposals under the TPP. Trade liberalization would extend to all chapters of the
Harmonized System; coverage is therefore expected to include agreements on agriculture, a
potentially controversial sector for both Japan and the United States. The TPP also features
a strong focus on services liberalization—an area of particular interest to U.S. service
suppliers. At the Sixth Round of negotiations in April 2011 in Singapore, the United States
tabled proposals related to labor rights, environmental protection, and intellectual property
protection—potentially contentious issues in TPP talks. Ambitious demands by the United
States in these three areas may induce TPP countries to demand more in market access to
the United States or to give less. At the same time, the United States also tabled a legal text
on regulatory coherence; the first time this issue has featured in a trade agreement.44 The
plan is for TPP to be concluded during the APEC-leaders meeting hosted by the United
States in November 2011.45

43

Prepared by Nagwa Riad (SPR).

44

Regulatory coherence is aimed at making the regulatory systems of the TPP countries operate more seamlessly and
addressing so-called ‗behind-the-border‘ issues that pose increasing barriers to U.S. business in trying to access foreign
markets. The intent would be to establish oversight regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs (OIRA).

45

The next round (seventh) of negotiations on TPP will be held during the week of June 20, 2011, in Vietnam.

45
Potential impact of Japan’s membership. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is
used to assess the impact and benefits of TPP on Japan as well as other Asian countries.46
The analysis is ‗static‘ in the sense that it only captures the economic efficiency impact of a
tariff removal; no allowance is made for more dynamic adjustments such as incorporating
the impact of capital accumulation and productivity improvements, as in Kawasaki (2010).47
Following Wignaraja (2011), the analysis covers 10 countries.48 The analysis considers
different scenarios regarding coverage (i.e., with and without agriculture liberalization) and
membership (i.e., with and without Japan). The impact should be read as a one-time effect
on GDP, exports, and utility (in the form of higher purchasing power as a result of tariff
removal). The results are presented in Figure 1 (detailed data in Table 1).

Key results include:
TPP membership generates welfare gains for Japan and most other members,
especially if agriculture is included. Potential losses for nonmembers are also higher
when Japan is included due to higher trade diversion.

Wignaraja, Ganeshan (2011), ASEAN or TPP? Pathways Towards East Asian FTA Consolidation, presentation at the Fund in
February 2011. His analysis assumes a TPP-11 which includes: Australia, Brunei, Chile, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru,
Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam. GTAP however does not cover Brunei, and is therefore not included in our
analysis.

46


For Japan, the marginal contribution of TPP membership in terms of a one-time real
GDP increase is somewhat modest—about 0.05 percent (including agriculture)—but
is much higher for export volume (more than 3 percent).



For other members, projected welfare gains are highest for Vietnam and Malaysia
(poorer members gain more from FTAs). The marginal contribution of Japan‘s
membership in terms of a one-time increase in real GDP ranges from 0.5 percent for
Vietnam to 0.03 percent for Korea; for export volume the gains range from 2 percent
for Vietnam to about 0.07 percent for Chile.



Our results at the aggregate level are qualitatively similar to Kawasaki (2010) but
much smaller in magnitude. Again, the latter allows for the impact of dynamic
aspects of capital formation and productivity improvements on economic outcomes.

In general, our results are consistent with the balance of existing literature on the impact of
FTAs suggesting that: (i) FTAs in Asia generate welfare gains for members and modest
losses for nonmembers (mainly through trade diversion); (ii) broadening the membership of
the FTA generates more gains; (iii) results vary depending on the assumptions underlying
liberalization and membership but the sign—gain or loss—is quite robust; and
(iv) production of sectors with comparative advantage will increase under the FTA.
Preliminary considerations. Our empirical analysis suggests a positive welfare impact
from membership, both for Japan and other Asian countries. Second, Korea (Japan‘s key
competitor in Asia) has been quite active on the FTA front and could have FTAs in place
with the United States by the end of 2011 and with the European Union and China by 2012.
Japanese export sectors may therefore find themselves at a competitive disadvantage if
they find themselves facing a widening tariff gap. Finally, financial liberalization is a key
feature of TPP. Japanese financial institutions could therefore benefit from improved access
to rapidly growing emerging nations‘ financial markets.49
