IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Lao People's
Democratic Republic
On January 30, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
Real GDP growth is expected to moderate from 7.5 percent in 2015 to 7 percent in 2016.
Domestic activity has slowed following a less favorable external environment, and credit growth
has also moderated from a high level. Inflation is expected to remain low and stable at around
2 percent at end-2016, aided by a strengthening kip exchange rate. The current account deficit is
expected to remain high at 17 percent of GDP in 2016 but has narrowed from 20 percent of GDP
in 2014. Gross international reserves, at 2 months of prospective imports of goods and services
(US$998.6 million, September 2016) remain low by partner country standards. While the overall
banking system is well capitalized, state-owned bank balance sheets show signs of weakness,
with rising nonperforming loans (NPLs) and weak capital and profitability. The fiscal deficit is
expected to have widened to 6 percent in fiscal year 2016 owing to weak tax revenue growth and
rising current spending. Public-and-publicly-guaranteed debt (excluding arrears) is projected at
68 percent of GDP in nominal terms (56 percent of GDP in present value terms) at end-2016, a
level which elevates the risk of debt distress from medium to high.
As growth continues to moderate in the near-term, inflation is projected to remain in low single
digits. The current account deficit is projected to widen to around 19 percent of GDP in 2017 due
to the execution of large infrastructure projects with foreign direct investment, and reserves are
expected to remain at around 2 months of imports. On current trends without the resumption of
fiscal consolidation, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain at around 5 percent and the public
debt could rise to around 70 percent of GDP. Risks are on the downside. A failure to consolidate
the fiscal position and bring down public debt could undermine confidence in the government’s
macro policy framework, raise public debt further and worsen the external position. The

economy is also exposed to external shocks, notably a further regional growth slowdown and a
deterioration in terms-of-trade and capital inflows. Financial risks could also present risk to
macroeconomic stability, particularly the growing foreign currency debt financed by foreign
borrowing, and the existence of balance sheet currency mismatches in the private non-bank
sector.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong macroeconomic performance and
progress on poverty reduction despite economic challenges. Directors noted, however, that there
are significant vulnerabilities in the external, fiscal, and financial sectors, and that risks to the
outlook could materialize from a regional growth slowdown, tightening in global monetary
conditions, and capital flow volatility. Against this background, Directors emphasized the need
for resuming fiscal consolidation, tighter monetary conditions with gradually increased exchange
rate flexibility over the medium-term, strengthened financial sector supervision, and reforms to
support economic diversification and private sector development.
Directors considered that growth-friendly fiscal consolidation anchored on reducing public debt
to 55 percent of GDP over the course of the next 5 years would reduce the risk of debt distress
and help strengthen the external position. They welcomed efforts to contain the public sector
wage bill, improve tax administration, and reduce non-concessional financing. To ensure
successful consolidation and space for well-targeted social and capital spending, Directors
recommended increased measures to mobilize tax revenues, reduce exemptions, and rationalize
current expenditures. Efforts to formulate a medium-term fiscal framework, enhance fiscal
transparency, and reduce fiscal arrears were also encouraged.
Directors noted that the exchange rate remains overvalued and international reserves are low for
precautionary purposes, particularly in the context of a large current account deficit, although
they also noted that in the past the current account has largely been financed by foreign direct
investment. They recommended the authorities continue allowing the exchange rate to move
gradually within the official band, supported by tightening of kip liquidity, to help accumulate
gross international reserves and reduce external vulnerabilities. Directors agreed that a cautious
approach was warranted, given currency mismatches in the non-bank private sector, and the use
of the exchange rate as an anchor for inflation. Further reform of the monetary and financial
framework would help facilitate more flexibility in the future.
Directors noted the rise in nonperforming loans (NPLs) and undercapitalization of state-owned
banks. To safeguard macro-financial stability, they recommended promptly addressing NPLs,
phasing out regulatory forbearance, strengthening sound lending practices and supervision, and
recapitalizing state-owned banks. Directors emphasized the importance of addressing

supervisory weaknesses and developing a crisis management framework. They welcomed the
AML/CFT law, and encouraged full implementation of the action plan as agreed with the
Financial Action Task Force.
Directors welcomed progress on product and labor market openness and gains in poverty
reduction. To support more inclusive and broad-based growth, they encouraged further reforms
aimed at diversifying the economy, boosting private sector activity, and improving the business
climate. In this context, trade integration and improvements in education and health
infrastructure were encouraged. Enhancing financial deepening and financial access by small and
medium-sized enterprises would also support macro stability and growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ interest in improving the quality and publication of
economic and financial data, with technical assistance from the Fund and other development
partners as needed.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth remains strong, although it has slowed as the economy faces
headwinds from major trading partners, low metals prices and a slowdown in
agriculture. Inflation has risen slightly but remains contained. Domestic risks include a
sustained reversal of fiscal consolidation, high public debt and weak public banks. On
the external front, a tightly managed and overvalued exchange rate, low reserves and
dollarization make Laos vulnerable to terms of trade shocks or capital flows reversals.
Main policy recommendations.
Policies should focus on increasing buffers, preparing for exchange rate flexibility in the
medium-term, and addressing structural constraints to boost medium-term growth.


Fiscal policy: Resuming fiscal consolidation will support sustainability, increase fiscal
space, help contain the current account deficit and accumulate reserves.



Monetary and financial policy: Building capital buffers in banks and improving
regulation and supervision will increase resilience to shocks. Removing caps on
interest rates will support efficient allocation of credit, market development and
de-dollarization. Accumulating international reserves will help address external
risks.



Exchange rate and markets: Developing local money, foreign exchange and
government debt markets to support the implementation of an active monetary
policy framework, and developing the institutional framework for monetary policy,
will allow for increasing exchange rate flexibility in the medium-term. Allowing
limited flexibility in the short-term will support the accumulation of reserves,
foreign exchange market development and risk management.



Structural policies: Addressing constraints in the ease of doing business, upgrading
human capital and financial inclusion will help support diversification,
competitiveness, and more inclusive growth.

CONTEXT
1.
Context. Lao P.D.R. is a small, landlocked economy that has experienced rapid growth based
on capital intensive investments in the energy sector. Progress has been made in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals, but poverty remains high, inequality has increased (Figure 1), and
Laos’ growth model needs to become more inclusive, in particular by integrating the mainly agrarian
population into more productive activities. The authorities have maintained macroeconomic stability
by anchoring inflation to a stable exchange rate and bringing down the fiscal deficit in FY 13/14 and
FY 14/15.1 However, fiscal progress was reversed in FY 15/16 and the economy has accumulated
vulnerabilities in the form of high public debt, a progressively overvalued real exchange rate and
pockets of weakness in the banking sector. With few buffers to address shocks, the economy
remains vulnerable to a rapid deterioration in the external environment, a sustained deterioration in
the fiscal position, or a rapid reversal of foreign capital flows.
2.
Past IMF Advice. Fiscal consolidation was introduced in FY 13/14 and FY 14/15, in line with
IMF advice, but was reversed in FY 15/16. The exchange rate remains tightly managed with respect
to the US dollar, inhibiting the accumulation of international reserves. Meanwhile, public debt has
continued to rise. The authorities have been working to improve bank supervision, assess risks and
address weakness in state banks. IMF policy advice has been supported by technical assistance on
macroeconomic policy, revenue and customs administration, interbank market development, and
banking supervision.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
Growth and inflation. Real GDP growth decelerated from 8 percent in 2014 to 7½ percent
in 2015, and is expected to decline further to around 7 percent in 2016. A real-time coincident
indicator of economic activity (see chart) shows that activity has been slowing in 2016.2 The
economy faces headwinds from a slowdown in major trading partners, lower metals prices, and poor
weather in agriculture (30 percent of the economy). Headline inflation decelerated to around
1 percent in 2015 following international oil prices, but has rebounded to around 2 percent in
October 2016 on higher domestic food prices. Core inflation remains below 1 percent due to the
pass-through of lower international fuel prices and a strengthening of the currency.

1

The fiscal year in Laos runs from October 1 to September 30. Starting in 2017, the fiscal year will coincide with the
calendar year.

2

The coincident indicator is constructed using a state-space model and Kalman filter estimation (see Rafiq, S. 2016,
IMF Working Paper No. 16/214), using three high frequency indicators of economic activity: real exports (to proxy for
industrial production); real imports (to proxy for domestic private consumption); and tourism growth (to proxy for
service sector activity). A value greater than zero indicates above trend growth; a value below zero indicates slowing
economic activity.

The Laos coincident index is constructed using a state-space model and Kalman filter estimation (see Rafiq, S. 2016. IMF
Working Paper 16/214). The coincident indicator is constructed using three high frequency indicators of economic activity:
(i) real exports to proxy for industrial production; (ii) real imports to proxy for changes in domestic private consumption;
(iii) tourism growth to proxy for changes in the service sector growth. A value greater than zero indicates above trend growth,
and a negative value indicates slowing economic activity.

4.
The external sector remains vulnerable. Staff’s assessment is that there continue to be
significant vulnerabilities to external shocks and the external position needs strengthening (Box 4).
While the current account deficit fell by 4 percentage points of GDP to 16.8 percent of GDP in 2015,
mainly due to a decline in imports related to new hydropower projects, the non-resource current
account deficit (excluding mining and hydropower) fell by only 1 percent of GDP and remains high
at 7½ percent of GDP. Gross international reserves are low at 1½ months of imports and 34 percent
of foreign currency liabilities in the banking sector. The nominal exchange rate has been maintained
within a very narrow band with respect to the US dollar.3 While this has helped anchor inflation
expectations, it has led to an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate (estimated at between
20 and 40 percent), as Laos’ major trading partners have allowed their currencies to depreciate
against the US dollar.
5.
Credit growth has slowed to a more sustainable level, and broader financial
conditions have tightened, but risks related to dollar lending remain (Boxes 2 and 3). A
combination of fiscal consolidation, a deterioration of bank and nonbank private sector balance
sheets, and slower economic activity led to a decline in credit growth in 2014–15. In response, the
authorities introduced a cap on kip deposit and lending rates in mid-2015. Credit growth recovered
to around 25 percent in mid-2016, although the acceleration was mostly in foreign currency lending,
raising worries about re-dollarization. The increase in dollar lending is also associated with a sharp

While the de jure arrangement is a managed float, since January 2015 the kip has been maintained within a 2
percent band against the U.S. dollar, and the de facto classification is a stabilized arrangement.

to improve gradually to 5 percent of GDP as
overall revenues recover and expenditure is
contained. The current account deficit will
widen slightly reflecting higher imports to support hydroelectric and railway projects, financed by
private capital inflows, but will narrow in 2021 as project-related imports fall and electricity exports
come on line. Gross international reserves are expected to remain low at around 1½ months of
imports. Credit growth is projected to remain at around 20 percent in 2016–17, broadly supportive
of growth but below a rate that, in staff’s assessment, would raise concerns about financial stability
(Box 2). Under an adjustment scenario with a resumption of fiscal consolidation, greater exchange
rate flexibility, bank recapitalization and structural reforms, short-term growth would be lower but
the medium-term growth path would be more robust and near-term vulnerabilities would be
reduced (Box 5).

There has also been a sharp rise in claims by BIS reporting institutions on banks in Laos. As of the third quarter of 2015, BIS
exposure was approximately 10 percent of GDP, compared to 1 percent of GDP in 2012.

The main risks to this outlook include:



Domestic fiscal risks. A sustained reversal in the momentum of fiscal consolidation driven
largely by weak revenue growth would lead to further increases in the public debt ratio and a
deterioration of the external position. This would have a negative effect on confidence and
growth, given that the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) puts Laos’ public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt at high risk of debt distress (Debt Sustainability Analysis).



Banking sector risks. Risks could also
materialize in the undercapitalized state-owned
banks (accounting for around 45 percent of the
banking system by assets), through deposit
flight, and an abrupt depreciation of the
exchange rate, which could further undermine
solvency, impairing economic growth.



Dollarization and currency mismatches
(Box 3). The high level of dollarization and
foreign borrowing has led to balance sheet
mismatches in the non-bank private sectors
estimated conservatively at about 4 percent of GDP. A kip depreciation of 30 percent (on the
order of the estimated current overvaluation) would add another 4 percent of GDP to bank and
nonbank private sector liabilities, further exacerbating balance sheet weakness, increasing NPLs
and affecting growth in a negative feedback loop (Box 3). Public sector liabilities are also
vulnerable to exchange rate movements as about 60 percent of the public debt is denominated
in US dollars.



Other domestic risks. Continued erosion of competitiveness from the kip’s real appreciation,
coupled with weak productivity and low private investment, would damage growth prospects,
particularly for nascent non-commodity exports.



External risks (Box 1). With a thin reserves cushion, the exchange rate remains vulnerable to a
reversal in private capital flows or a rapid deterioration in the terms-of-trade. In the worst case,
an abrupt depreciation of the exchange rate could undermine banking system confidence and
financial stability. A sharp slowdown in China would impact commodity and agriculture exports
and tourist arrivals. A disorderly unwinding of financial conditions in China or globally would be
felt through lower foreign direct investment and capital flow reversals.

The authorities broadly concurred with the near-term outlook and risks. They
acknowledged the likelihood of lower growth but emphasized the importance of more inclusive and
diversified growth going forward. They agreed that rising public debt posed a risk, and on the need
for resuming efforts to increase fiscal revenue and consolidation. While they acknowledge weakness
in public banks they pointed to the overall soundness of the system, efforts to improve supervision,
and plans for restructuring. They also emphasized that external sector risks are mitigated by the
large FDI inflows into the hydro and energy sectors and the fixed foreign currency price and quantity
contracts for electricity exports, which are not affected by the exchange rate. While they
acknowledged that the managed exchange rate had some costs, they considered that the risks to
inflation and balance sheets of introducing greater flexibility warranted caution.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The key policy challenges are to safeguard macroeconomic stability and put in place the conditions for
sustainable medium-term growth. To reduce risks and rebuild buffers, fiscal policy should resume the
momentum for growth friendly consolidation, and weakness in the banking sector should be addressed. At
the same time, reforms should focus on preparing for greater exchange rate flexibility and accumulating
reserves. Gradually allowing the exchange rate to depreciate in line with market forces will support these
objectives. Addressing structural constraints, integrating the population into productive activity and
increasing financial inclusion will further support inclusive growth.

A. Fiscal Policy: Rebuilding Fiscal Buffers
9.
The momentum of fiscal consolidation has been reversed, and the composition of
spending has deteriorated. The overall deficit in FY 15/16 is expected to rise to 5.9 percent of GDP
from 2.7 percent of GDP in FY 14/15, due to a
large decline in tax and non-tax revenue. Tax

of a more structural nature which needs to be addressed.
10.
Public debt has risen and has become less concessional. The PPG debt ratio reached
65.8 percent of GDP at end-2015, from 62.5 percent at end-2013. The increase is mainly due to a rise

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

in the stock of domestic treasury bills and bonds, higher borrowing from Thailand and China for
investment in power generation projects, and the issuance of sovereign bonds in the Thai market
(DSA Box 1). The increase in debt has been accompanied by a decline in the degree of
concessionality, with 12.8 percent of the debt on commercial terms at end-2015, compared to about
3 percent at end-2013. As a result, the DSA assesses Laos at high risk of external debt distress, a
deterioration from the previous DSA, where it was on the borderline between moderate and high
risk (DSA). Given the high proportion of public debt denominated in foreign currencies (especially
the US dollar), the DSA also highlights the vulnerability of the public balance sheet to a large
exchange rate depreciation.
11.
It is urgent to restore fiscal space by resuming a growth friendly fiscal consolidation
and reducing the debt ratio. This will safeguard macroeconomic stability, particularly under a
tightly managed exchange rate, and would build financial buffers to address real and financial
shocks. Fiscal policy could be anchored to reducing the public debt ratio to 55 percent of GDP by
2021, a level that would lower the debt distress rating from high to moderate. Including the cost of
public bank recapitalization, this would require maintaining an average overall fiscal deficit of
around 3½ percent of GDP and a non-mining fiscal deficit not greater than 4½ percent of GDP over
the next five years (Box 5).5 Achieving this goal would require strong and permanent revenue and
expenditure measures so that the burden of adjustment does not fall on priority social and capital
expenditures, and the fiscal adjustment is sustainable. In particular:


Tax policy and administration. A key reform objective is to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to build
space for priority spending and investment. Non-commodity revenues could be raised by
broadening the tax base, including by reducing exemptions, and strengthening tax
administration. The authorities have taken some important measures recently, improving the
valuation of imported vehicles to calculate import taxes, eliminating exemptions for oil imports
in public projects, revising excise taxes, and better administering the VAT. Nevertheless, further
work is necessary to reach revenue targets:
 Revise exemptions. The exemption regime in Lao P.D.R. is extensive and anecdotal evidence
suggests there are important leakages. A first step in revising the regime is to conduct a tax
expenditure study to understand where exemptions are concentrated. Centralizing the
administration and issuance of exemptions, and ensuring regular reporting, will lead to a
more transparent regime. In addition to the exemption regime, unifying the VAT rate
between the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and the rest of the economy would simplify VAT
administration and improve tax efficiency.
 Revenue Measures. Gradually increasing excise rates on automobiles and other luxury
goods, and introducing a land tax or property tax on buildings, would support the revenue
base.

5

The cost of recapitalizing public banks is estimated at about 1.8 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

 Improve Tax Administration. Short-term priorities for reform include: improving
compliance of large and medium taxpayers; restructuring the tax department to better
reflect priority functions; establishing a full Large Taxpayer Office (LTO); and bringing district
tax offices formally under the control of the Director General of the Tax Department. It will
also be important to carefully manage the implementation of the government’s planned
investments in information technology for the tax office. The authorities’ plan to introduce
point-of-sale (POS) recording of transactions for retail businesses and to require
strengthened bookkeeping for presumptive taxpayers are welcome.


Public financial management reforms. Focus should also be on restraining non-capital
spending by accelerating civil service reform to lower the public sector wage bill; curtailing nonessential expenditures and off-budget capital spending; and eliminating fiscal arrears. To
enhance the tracking of the government’s financial operations, reduce off-budget spending, and
strengthen control over expenditure, the authorities should push ahead with a Treasury Single
Account (TSA).



Medium-term fiscal and debt management framework. Developing a medium-term fiscal
framework, that includes a revenue strategy for modernizing tax and customs policy, the legal
framework and administration, as well as a public expenditure review to identify opportunities to
improve efficiency, would support a well-planned sustainable fiscal reform that could identify
and protect essential social spending and support growth. A medium-term debt strategy could
also help anticipate and manage financing challenges as Laos moves towards middle-income
country status.

12.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the fiscal deficit should be put on a
downward trend to reduce fiscal risk and contain growth in the public debt. They emphasized that
future borrowing would remain mainly on concessional terms and oriented towards necessary
investments. On exemptions, they plan to revise two laws (Investment Promotion and Special
Economic Zones) and review the application of exemptions, particularly for vehicles and construction
materials. On tax policy, they are planning to introduce a land tax in 2017 and revise some rates on
existing taxes. On tax administration, they agreed that large taxpayers should be managed centrally
and were planning to transfer this function from provincial offices to the central tax office. In
addition, they expect that the POS recording of transactions would help improve tax compliance.
Finally, they also cited the recruitment of more personnel for the tax office.

B. Ensuring a Sound Banking System
13.
Lao P.D.R. has weaknesses in parts of its commercial banking system. Public banks that
make up almost half the system are undercapitalized. NPLs in public banks have risen from
2 percent to 8 percent while the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is estimated by staff to have fallen to
around 3 percent. This partly reflects a lack of control over public investment spending in previous
years at the state and local level, which resulted in arrears and cash-flow problems at some local
firms.6 Some domestic private banks are also well below the mandated capital levels, although these
are not systemic. Weak accounting standards mean the level of NPLs could be significantly
understated. According to international evidence, the ROA and ROE of the banking system (at
0.2 percent and 0.6 percent respectively) could be consistent with NPLs above 10 percent. The
recently mandated caps on local currency deposit and lending rates have also likely contributed to
reverse progress in de-dollarization and may affect the profitability of already weak segments of the
banking system.

14.
The authorities have made efforts to improve banking supervision and detect risks.
The Bank of Lao (BOL) is working to amend its legal framework to strengthen risk-based supervision
and move toward Basel-core principles, including improvement of prudential regulations. A plan to
restructure public banks starting in 2017 is underway, as well as implementing CARs to comply with
BASEL II (likely in 2018). The central bank is also working on upgrading the payments system, and
other information requirements for the securities markets. As credit growth resumes (Box 2) it will be
important for the BOL to monitor liquidity conditions and control a further buildup of risks. In
particular:


Address weakness in the banking sector. It is urgent to repair bank balance sheets to reduce
the possibility of an external shock being amplified by the banking system. Eliminating
forbearance and ensuring that all banks meet the mandatory minimum CAR of 8 percent is a
first step. Introducing regulations to better account for NPLs would help clarify recapitalization

6
The process of off budget public investment spending at the state and local level was ended in 2014, and a
committee has been established to resolve arrears.

11

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

estimates and restructuring options. Recapitalizing public banks should be a first priority, with
potential recapitalization costs estimated at US$ 250 million (1.8 percent of 2016 GDP).


Continue to improve supervision. Supervisory capacity is stretched given rapid growth of the
banking system and the large number of banks. In light of emerging risks, there is a need to
maintain the moratorium on new bank licenses, and to quickly improve supervision, including
risk-based supervision in the medium-term. Collecting corporate and household balance sheet
information (with appropriate safeguards) and assessing the balance sheet risks in the banking
system would improve the BOL’s ability to monitor and manage the economy’s exposure to
exchange rate risks.



Develop the crisis management framework. This should include a contingency plan for the
banking sector in the event of financial distress, including strengthening the institutional setup
for crisis management with resolution authority, a sound emergency liquidity assistance
framework with appropriate safeguards, a bank resolution framework, and a communications
strategy.



Address foreign currency lending risks. The recent rapid rise in dollar lending, financed by
foreign borrowing, may present additional macrofinancial risks. While there are limits on bank
net open positions, and restrictions on foreign currency lending to non-foreign currency earning
clients, the BOL should also consider macroprudential tools, including further raising foreign
currency reserve requirements (which, at 10 percent, are already higher than kip reserve
requirements), setting limits on loan-to-deposit ratios for foreign currency lending or additional
unremunerated reserve requirements in foreign currency, to contain these risks.



Reduce dollarization. Although dollarization has fallen, Laos remains a highly dollarized
economy, with 45 percent of deposits and 48 percent of private credit in foreign currencies. A
market based approach to reduce dollarization would begin by removing the caps on kip
lending and deposit rates, strengthening the deposit insurance arrangements for local currency
deposits, and introducing measures to promote the use of kip (e.g., lower cost and convenient
services for kip use, larger spread between foreign currency and kip reserve requirements).
International experience also shows that gradually introducing a small measure of exchange rate
flexibility helps reduce dollarization.

15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that, despite pockets of weakness, the
banking system as a whole is stable and sound. In addition, public disclosure of audited statements
of all banks will be enforced in 2017 to enhance transparency. In the area of accounting they are
considering upgrading requirements in line with IFRS. On bank licensing the authorities have
upgraded fit and proper criteria to safeguard against AML/CFT risks. The authorities are also aware
of foreign currency lending risks, and are considering additional macroprudential measures. The
authorities see interest rate caps as a way of broadening access to credit, but emphasized that these
were temporary until a well-functioning financial market is developed.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

C. Strengthening International Reserves and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
Reserve coverage metrics for Lao P.D.R. are significantly lower than the level desirable
for countries with a tightly managed exchange rate and a highly dollarized financial sector,
according to the IMF’s standard metrics (Box 4). In light of the low level of reserves, the
authorities should use the flexibility in their current regime (which allows the kip/US dollar exchange
rate to move within a band of plus or minus 5 percent per year) to gradually let the kip/US dollar
exchange rate depreciate in line with market forces. This, combined with tighter fiscal policy would
support a gradual buildup of reserves towards a goal of at least 4 months of import cover. Low
inflation provides an opportunity to let the kip depreciate gradually and accumulate reserves with a
limited impact on price stability. Greater exchange rate flexibility would also better help manage
volatility of fiscal revenues associated with changes in commodity prices.
17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities
consider the level of reserves to be adequate,
although they agree that a higher level would
further safeguard stability. The central bank
calculates reserves at end-2015 at 6.4 months
of imports due to a different estimate of trade
flows and the exclusion of imports related to
FDI projects.7 Using the central bank’s overall
import figure, and not excluding FDI imports,
puts reserve adequacy at around 2 months of
imports, still well below recommended levels.

Lao P.D.R. should move quickly to put in place the preconditions for greater exchange
rate flexibility. The de-jure exchange rate regime is a managed float, and moving to more flexibility
would help Laos adjust to external shocks and reduce vulnerabilities. However, a successful move
requires an alternative nominal anchor for price stability, as well as preparing the bank and
corporate sectors to deal with greater volatility (in particular limiting their open foreign exchange
positions). As these preparations will take time, the transition will need to be gradual.

7

The authorities’ estimate of trade flows is lower than the duly adjusted partner country data. Discrepancies are
concentrated in trade with major partners and can be explained by differences in valuation, under-recording due to
exemptions, informal border trade, and contraband. For a systematic study of the discrepancies, see Hamanaka, S.
(2011), “Quality of the Trade Statistics of the Lao P.D.R.,” South East Asia Research, 19, 3, pp 595–633. Staff have

19.

The following sequence of reforms is recommended:
i. Develop the functioning of local financial markets. This includes implementing
reforms that would allow for the smooth functioning of the interbank money market, the
interbank foreign exchange market, and the government debt market.8
ii. Actively manage liquidity and steer market interest rates. Once local financial
markets are sufficiently developed, the monetary policy transmission mechanism should
begin to function so that a short-term policy interest rate can be used by the BOL to
transmit the desired monetary policy stance to the market. This will require removing caps
on deposit rates and intermediation spreads, and using open market operations and
exchange rate intervention to affect the market interest rate. Active liquidity management
based on stable and low excess reserves will also support market development.
iii. Develop the institutional framework for monetary policy. Upgrading the monetary
policy framework will require institutional, technical and operational reforms. The basic
elements include: a) a clear mandate and operational independence for the central bank to
pursue price stability; b) development of the technical capacity to design and implement a
transparent, forward-looking monetary strategy; c) a clear and effective framework for

Detailed recommendations have been made in this area by the IMF Technical Assistance mission on Interbank
Market Development in July 2015, and include as a first step the development of the Bank of Lao’s liquidity
management framework.

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

monetary control; and d) a framework for forecasting and managing banking system
liquidity.9
iv. Develop the foreign exchange market and introduce systems to manage exchange
rate risk. Market participants need to develop internal risk management and information
systems to measure foreign exchange risk, and an adequate prudential and supervisory
framework should be in place to monitor direct and indirect exposure. Cautious
development of derivatives in the foreign exchange market will support hedging instruments
necessary for market development.
20.
During this process, allowing some controlled and limited flexibility early on is
important. Allowing for a two-way variation in the exchange rate at an early stage (e.g. by gradually
allowing the exchange rate to float within the 5 percent plus or minus band) helps reduce one-way
currency bets. Such variation also stimulates foreign exchange market development and provides
incentives for risk management, while supporting the accumulation of international reserves
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized that there are risks associated with the
managed exchange rate, but they saw these as manageable. They pointed to significant benefits
from stability including macroeconomic stability and trust in the currency, and they saw significant
risks to introducing flexibility in the short-term. Nevertheless, they viewed the tightly managed
exchange rate as a temporary arrangement, and agreed that more flexibility is desirable in the
medium term. In this connection, they agreed that it is important to put in place preconditions to
reach this objective.

regional integration through the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will require addressing these
structural constraints.10
23.
Integrating a higher proportion of the population into productive economic activity
would boost growth and reduce poverty. Over two-thirds of the population remains in
agriculture, where productivity has consistently been the lowest in the region. A large skills gap
impedes movement to manufacturing or services employment. School enrollment is high, but
outcomes are low, and Lao P.D.R. has the highest rate of adult functional illiteracy in the region
(33 percent urban and 66 percent rural). A lack of skilled labor has also contributed to low levels of
investment in manufacturing, and the majority of labor in Special Economic Zones is foreign.
Creating better economic opportunities will require investing in rural infrastructure, education and
training. It is also necessary to improve basic health outcomes, including reducing malnutrition and
maternal mortality, where Lao P.D.R. lags behind low-income country averages.
24.
Policies that increase financial inclusion will help promote macro-financial stability
and enhance growth. While Laos has experienced rapid financial deepening over the last decade,
financial inclusion remains low. Access to financial institutions is limited to about one-third of the
population, and Laos has the third-lowest level of financial access in ASEAN (only Cambodia and
Myanmar rank lower). To enhance financial inclusion, policies should focus on: increasing the supply
of financial services (access to ATMs, branches, and accounts); financial literacy programs (as used in
Bangladesh and India); and the delivery of financial services and information through microfinancial
institutions.11

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that there were significant structural constraints
to growth, reflected in the narrow base of production and exports, low fiscal revenue and a lack of
inclusive growth. In addition to continuing to implement WTO commitments and enhancing further

integration with ASEAN, they agreed that further efforts were necessary to improve the business
environment, including through infrastructure investment. A particular area of focus was the
promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The new laws on Investment Promotion and on
Special Economic Zones are also aimed at reducing red tape, and new regulations on Public Private
Partnerships should help finance new infrastructure.
26.
Statistics. Significant constraints are imposed on surveillance by weak data, particularly in
external sector and financial statistics, although some progress has been made since the last
Article IV consultation (Informational Annex). Shortcomings are largely due to a lack of capacity.
Development partners (including the Fund) have devoted significant resources in Laos to capacity
development in this area. In this connection it is encouraging to note the authorities’ interest in
joining the e-GDDS and bringing statistical quality, coverage and dissemination in line with their
peers in ASEAN.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Economic setting. Growth is expected to slow to under 7 percent as the economy faces
headwinds from a less favorable external environment and a slow-down in agriculture. Inflation has
risen slightly but is expected to remain contained. Private sector credit growth will remain between
15 and 20 percent, concentrated in construction and services. In the medium-term growth is
expected to rebound slightly to around 7 percent, supported by hydro-electric projects and
transportation investments. The external position is assessed to be vulnerable to shocks and requires
strengthening.
28.
Risks. The outlook is subject to domestic and external risks. On the domestic side, a
sustained reversal in fiscal consolidation would lead to a further increase in public debt, a loss in
confidence and a deterioration of the external position. Weakness in the banking system, coupled
with high dollarization, could also lead to deposit flight and pressure on the exchange rate.
Continued erosion of competitiveness from the kip’s real appreciation, coupled with weak
productivity and low investment, could threaten growth. On the external side the thin reserves
cushion and a tightly managed exchange rate make Laos vulnerable to a deterioration in the terms
of trade or a reversal of capital flows. A slowdown in China would affect FDI, exports and growth.
29.
Resuming fiscal consolidation. Anchoring fiscal policy on a goal of reducing the public
debt ratio to 55 percent of GDP by 2021 will lower the debt distress rating in the DSA to moderate,
and help build fiscal buffers. This will require sustained efforts to increase revenue and rationalize
expenditure. The authorities’ initiatives on tax administration, exemptions and new taxes are
welcome. A revision of the exemption regime and the efficiency and composition of expenditures
will further help achieve a growth-friendly consolidation. In this connection, the formulation of a
comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework, including a medium-term revenue strategy, a
medium-term debt strategy and a public investment review, would allow for a sustained approach
that could be executed over a number of years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

30.
Putting the debt ratio on a downward trajectory. The DSA assesses Laos’ external PPG
debt to be at high risk of debt distress, which is a deterioration from last year’s Article IV
consultation. The high proportion of public debt in foreign currency makes it particularly vulnerable
to changes in the exchange rate. In the transition to a lower debt ratio it will be particularly
important to continue to emphasize concessional financing, and adopt clear guidelines for the
issuance of sovereign debt and guarantees and the use of such borrowing. In particular, the
continued issuance of foreign currency sovereign bonds in the Thai market on non-concessional
terms (DSA Box 1), and the use of part of the proceeds for current spending, seems to be in conflict
with desirable debt management practices.
31.
Addressing banking sector risks. The authorities have made commendable efforts to
improve supervision and detect risks, and their plan to restructure public banks is welcome. Moving
rapidly to address bank weakness, including through the prompt recapitalization of state-owned
banks, and further improving supervision, will be important to reduce the risk of an external shock
being amplified through the banking system. At the same time, addressing foreign currency lending
risks through additional macroprudential measures will help reduce balance sheet risks. Developing
the crisis management framework would also help the central bank prepare for possible
contingencies. An early removal of interest rate caps will be important to developing local financial
markets and reducing dollarization.
32.
Moving towards greater exchange rate flexibility and accumulating reserves. Even as
Laos puts in place policies to support the tightly managed exchange rate in the short-term, it is
necessary to put in place conditions that will allow it to adopt more exchange rate flexibility in the
medium-term. The sequencing of reforms should include: a) developing local financial markets;
b) actively managing liquidity to affect market interest rates; c) developing the framework for
monetary policy; and d) developing the foreign exchange market and tools to manage exchange
rate risk. During this process allowing some limited exchange rate flexibility will support the
accumulation of reserves and promote the development of foreign exchange risk management and
the foreign exchange market. A higher buffer of international reserves is needed to address foreign
currency risks, given the high current account deficit, the tightly managed exchange rate,
dollarization and balance sheet mismatches in the non-bank private sector.
33.
Addressing structural constraints will help secure more sustainable and inclusive
growth. Improving the business environment and upgrading skills and human capital will support
investment and productivity growth, and the diversification of exports, and help Laos take
advantage of growing export opportunities in the region. Enhancing financial inclusion will also
support macro-financial stability and growth.
34.
The collection and dissemination of economic and financial statistics continues to
require improvement. Sustained effort will be required to secure progress, which will be important
for informed policymaking and surveillance. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to
improving statistics.

Box 2. Lao P.D.R.: Unlocking the Credit Cycle and Its Phases1
After a rapid episode of financial deepening, credit growth has slowed, due to both weaker demand and banking
sector weakness. The credit cycle is currently in the repair/recovery phase and risk appetite seems to be recovering.
Laos has experienced rapid financial deepening as measured by

Box 3. Lao P.D.R.: Dollar Credit Cycle, Dollarization and Private Currency Mismatches:
How Large Are Risks?1
Laos’ economy is highly dollarized, and currency mismatches on balance sheets are a potential source of macro-financial
risk. The data shows that private currency mismatches principally exist in the non-bank sector, which has significantly
increased its foreign borrowing in recent years. To mitigate vulnerabilities, financial safety nets need to be pre-emptively
strengthened, while surveillance of cross-border financial flows should be improved.
Laos is a highly dollarized economy, and the risk-taking
channel increases the potential for valuation mismatches
arising from exchange rate effects. These risks have grown
since 2010 as US dollar cross-border bank and non-bank
borrowing has grown significantly. Available data shows:





Laos’ total net FX exposure, according to BIS data, is
around 4.2 percent of GDP: 1.2 percent of GDP for banks
and 3 percent of GDP for the non-bank private sector.
The non-bank private sector in Lao P.D.R. is a larger net
debtor to the rest of the world than banks. The non-bank
sector in Laos is, therefore, a potential conduit for the
transmission of global financial conditions to the
domestic economy.
Balance sheet data from two public banks in Lao (BCEL
and BFL) show FX assets to be, in total, around 1 percent
of GDP larger than liabilities.

estimates are likely to be very conservative since BIS data does not include Chinese banks, which are an important
source of project funding in Laos.
Lao P.D.R. is a net debtor to the rest of the world, and balance sheet risks call for preemptively widening and
deepening financial safety nets. In addition:



The Bank of Lao should gradually make more use of the exchange rate bands to allow for greater exchange rate
flexibility, which would help sensitize economic agents to the risks of foreign borrowing.



De-dollarization policies should be expedited, and focus on market-based measures to promote the kip (interbank
market development), supported by credible macro prudential policies.



Banks’ net open positions should be closely monitored and surveillance of cross-border financial flows should be
enhanced.

Trends in the balance of payments are consistent with
the overvaluation of the kip. A significant proportion of
Lao’s balance of payments is inelastic to price and
exchange rate movements, particularly imports related to
FDI projects, electricity exports under fixed price and
quantity contracts, and natural resource exports (metals)
priced in dollars. Nevertheless, even as the overall current
account deficit fell by 4 percentage points of GDP from
2014 to 2015, the non-resource current account deficit,
(which remains high at 7½ percent of GDP), only fell by
one percentage point, reflecting slow growth in tourism
and non-resource related exports and higher growth of
non-resource non-petroleum imports.

Source: IMF staff estimates.

Reserve coverage metrics are significantly lower than the level desirable for countries with a fixed
exchange rate regime and highly dollarized financial sector, according to the Fund’s reserve adequacy
metric. As of December 2015, reserves were equivalent to about 1 month of prospective imports of goods
and services, about 13 percent of broad money, 30 percent of foreign currency deposits and about 8 percent
of GDP. These reserve coverage levels are significantly below the traditional metrics of at least three months
of prospective imports or up to 50 percent of broad money, respectively. Although the authorities consider
reserves as adequate under their methodology (which excludes a measure of FDI-related imports), the
numbers used by IMF staff are consistent with the IMF’s internationally comparable methodology.
Staff’s overall assessment is that the external position is vulnerable to shocks and requires
strengthening. Fiscal consolidation and a gradual depreciation of the exchange rate within the current
regime would help reverse the trend appreciation and increase international reserves.

Box 5. Lao P.D.R.: Adjustment Scenario 1
An adjustment scenario including recommended policies would result in lower growth in the near term, but more
robust and sustainable growth in the medium-term. It would also result in a less risky path for the economy and
make it more resilient to external shocks, including lower debt, a smaller current account deficit and the
accumulation of reserves.
The adjustment scenario is based on the following assumptions:

 Resumption of fiscal consolidation. Sustainable fiscal and expenditure measures would bring the fiscal
deficit to 3½ percent of GDP on average, which would be sufficient to lower the debt to GDP ratio to
55 percent of GDP, including the additional 1.8 percent of GDP cost of recapitalizing public banks.

 Gradual exchange rate adjustment. The real exchange rate would adjust by 23 percent over 5 years, through
both nominal depreciation and productivity growth, realigning the REER with long-term fundamentals.

 Banking sector reforms. Strengthening of state-owned banks management and recapitalization
 Structural reforms to boost competitiveness and long-term productivity.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
Markus Rodlauer (IMF)
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

The risk of Lao P.D.R. facing external debt distress has risen from moderate to high.2
External debt distress indicators are more elevated than in the 2014 DSA, owing to the
higher initial external PPG debt stock and projected debt flows to support public
investment. Some external debt indicators breach the respective policy-dependent
indicative thresholds for some years, indicating limited buffers in the case of adverse
shocks. Also, the present value (PV) of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the
benchmark for some years. Given the considerable share of foreign-currency-denominated
debt, a large and sudden exchange rate depreciation could significantly raise the level of
those indicators, putting debt dynamics on an unsustainable path. Though revenues from
large resource projects are expected to mitigate risks over the long term, external
borrowing should remain on concessional terms as much as possible to reduce the debt
burden. The deterioration of the debt distress risk rating suggests the urgent need to
recalibrate fiscal policy to rebuild fiscal buffers, adopt clear guidelines for the issuance of
sovereign debt and guarantees to help contain and monitor contingent liabilities, and
strengthen the debt management capacity, including developing a comprehensive
medium-term debt management strategy and regularly performing a debt sustainability
analysis to inform borrowing decisions.

1

This DSA has been prepared by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the Lao P.D.R. authorities.

2
The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to
manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are policy-dependent. In the LIC-DSF, the quality of a
country’s policies and institutions is measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index and
classified into three categories: strong, medium, and weak. Lao P.D.R.’s policies and institutions, as measured by the CPIA, averaged
3.34 over the past three years. Since its average CPIA index has been above 3.25 for three years in a row, Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance remains classified as medium according to the “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries” (www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf). Therefore, the relevant
indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports
ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt
service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

This DSA reclassifies
the risk of debt distress from moderate to high, due to increased external borrowing. The indicative
debt distress thresholds remain unchanged from the 2014 DSA, since the classification of Lao P.D.R.’s policy
performance, according to the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, remains
moderate.3 Under the baseline scenario of the current DSA, some of the external and public debt distress
indicators breach the policy-dependent indicative thresholds for some years, although the net present
value (PV) of external debt follows a downward trend and returns to levels below the respective thresholds
in the medium term. Under the alternative scenarios, some indicators also breach the thresholds for some
periods. The breach of at least one indicator both under the baseline and alternative scenarios classifies the
risk of debt distress as high.

2015, due mainly to higher
borrowing from Thailand and China and sovereign bond issuance in the Thai market. The rise in debt was
in part driven by heavy investment in power generation projects, part of the strategy to use the country’s
abundant hydropower resources to export energy to the rapidly growing neighborhood.4 Thus, the PPG
external debt rose from 50.9 percent of GDP at end-2013 to 51.7 percent of GDP at end-2015. The
corresponding net present value (PV) of PPG external debt increased from 39.8 percent of GDP at end2013 to 40.1 percent at-end 2015, which is above the 40 percent indicative threshold.

Lao P.D.R.’s CPIA index declined from 3.36 in 2014 to 3.29 in 2015 and averaged 3.34 over the past three years, not
sufficient to change the classification of its policy performance, which remains moderate.

The installed capacity in Lao P.D.R.’s power system increased from around 600MW in early 2000 to above 6,000MW

reach above 10,000MW by 2020.

Bilateral creditors have been a greater source of loans than multilateral creditors in 2015,
and this trend is expected to continue in the projection period. Bilateral creditors—mainly China,
Russia, Thailand, Japan, and Korea—account for 64.4 percent of total external PPG debt at end-2015.
Multilateral creditors consist mainly of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB––12.2 percent of total external
PPG debt), and the International Development Association (IDA––7.8 percent of total external PPG debt).
Sovereign bonds have also been issued in the Thai capital market starting in May 2013 and the outstanding
sovereign bonded debt at end-2015 was US$838 million, 12.8 percent of total external PPG debt (Box 1).
Box 1. Lao P.D.R.: Sovereign Bond Issuance in the Thai Market
Lao P.D.R first issued baht-denominated bonds in Thailand in May 2013, followed by three more issuances in
December 2013, October 2014, and June 2015. In December 2015, Lao P.D.R. also issued its first US dollardenominated floating-rate bonds, amounting to US$182 million. The bond proceeds have financed the
budget deficit as well as the government’s share in power projects. The table below summarizes the
sovereign bond issuances since 2013.
The outstanding bonded debt at end-2015 was US$838 million, accounting for 12.8 percent of total external
PPG debt. The authorities have indicated that they intend to continue to issue bonds in the Thai market after
2016.
The issuance of bonds with different maturities, ranging from 3 to 12 years, indicates the authorities’ goal to
establish a yield curve. A credit rating agency based in Thailand (TRIS Rating Co., Ltd) provided an
investment grade rating of BBB+ for the Lao government bonds in the Thai market. This rating is based on
strong growth, Lao’s abundance of natural resources, rising government revenue from hydropower, and the
government’s commitment to modernize the economy and alleviate poverty.

About 60 percent of total external PPG
outstanding debt was contracted in U.S. dollars. The
rest consists of yen, euro, Thai baht and others.
Currency composition has moved significantly towards
U.S. dollars at end-2015 compared with end-2014, from
about 51.1 percent of total outstanding debt to 59.8
percent.

The high level of concessionality of official
borrowing helps to reduce the external debt service
burden. PPG external debt service-to-exports ratio is
expected to remain below the policy-dependent

the baseline scenario. However, PPG external debt service-to-revenue ratio is expected to exceed the
threshold for some periods. Furthermore, given high share of U.S. dollars in the currency composition of
outstanding external debt and declining concessionality of new borrowing under the current DSA
assumptions, these debt service ratios are sensitive to large sudden currency depreciation shocks.
7.
The rising external debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-revenue ratios, as well as near-term
threshold breaches, underscore the need to strengthen debt management capacity, including
drawing up a comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy. When contracting new debt,
debt sustainability considerations should be taken into account, particularly because the country is
expected to shift from concessional to more market-based terms as it graduates from Least Developed
Country (LDC) status. Additional near-term external borrowing, for example to finance large projects, could
push the debt-to-GDP ratio further over the indicative thresholds for a protracted period, potentially
undermining debt sustainability. A mitigating factor for Lao P.D.R.’s external debt burden lies in the
prospective returns on the hydropower and mining projects that have been financed in part by the external
PPG debt. The long-term power purchase agreements for these projects and the resulting government
revenues in the form of royalties, dividends, and profit tax payments help reduce the risk of debt distress in
the long run.
8.
Recorded domestic PPG debt rose from 11.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 14.1 percent
of GDP at end-2015. Domestic debt consists of bond/T-bill holdings and the legacy of Bank of the Lao
P.D.R.’s direct lending to local government’s off-budget infrastructure projects in the past. Given higher
costs of domestic borrowing, the share of domestic PPG debt remains relatively small. Going forward, as
domestic financial markets deepen, the share of domestic public debt is likely to increase. Total domestic
and external PPG debt stood at 65.8 percent of GDP at end-2015, up from 62.5 percent at end-2013.

report—projects annual GDP
growth to moderate to 6.9 and 6.8 percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Average real GDP growth over
the projected period (2016–36) is expected to be 6.3 percent, lower than in the 2014 DSA, reflecting lower
economic growth momentum due to a less favorable external environment, including a slight slowdown in
major trading partners and lower prices of key exports such as commodities and food. GDP deflator growth
(in USD terms) is projected to be about 2.1 percent, higher than in the 2014 DSA, in line with a pickup in

global inflation. The non-interest current account deficit is projected to widen to 11.3 percent of GDP. On
the fiscal side, the primary deficit is expected to deteriorate from an historical average of 1.9 percent of
GDP to an average of 2.8 percent over the projection period due to weaker tax revenue growth.
10.
As a result, a higher level of financing is assumed than in the 2014 DSA. To meet the country’s
financing needs, a higher level of new borrowing is projected to finance investment that would support the
country’s ambition to graduate from LDC status by 2020. External financing is assumed to remain largely
on concessional terms in the near future except for sovereign bond issuance on the Thai market. Going
forward, however, the new disbursement schedule is assumed to rely less on multilateral creditors, and
more on bilateral and commercial creditors. Multilateral assistance will slowly shift from grant- to creditbased conditions, and the AsDB and the World Bank Group are expected to remain the principal suppliers
of multilateral credit, with IDA loans slowly phasing out and being replaced by IBRD loans with less
concessional terms. The level of grant financing is projected to decline over the projection period, adding
to the higher projected borrowing needs. As the domestic financial market deepens, the private sector is
assumed to rely more on domestic sources of financing, lowering the need for foreign borrowing in the
long term.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
11.
Under the baseline scenario, the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be above
the policy dependent indicative threshold and decline in the medium term (Figure 1). This indicates
that the debt distress risk is more elevated than in the 2014 DSA. The change is driven primarily by the
higher debt stock at the end of 2015, and higher projected new borrowing, with less concessional terms
going forward, as Lao P.D.R. graduates from the LDC status. As a result, the current DSA forecasts a breach
of the policy dependent indicative threshold for some periods with respect to three indicators: 1) the PV of
external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio, 2) the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, and 3) the debt service-to-revenue
ratio. Other debt and debt service indicators, namely the PV of debt-to-exports ratio and the debt serviceto-exports ratio, remain below the policy-dependent indicative threshold during the entire forecast period
under the baseline scenario.
12.
Under the historical scenario, in which key variables are set at their historical averages, debt
dynamics become unsustainable for all debt indicators. The historical scenario is based on 10-year
averages of higher current account deficit, real GDP growth, and growth of exports of goods and services
than assumed under the baseline scenario, requiring higher debt accumulation rates and putting debt
dynamics on an unsustainable path. As shown in Figure 1, all debt indicators except the debt service-toexports ratio are projected to breach the respective policy dependent indicative thresholds.

Box 2. Lao P.D.R.: Baseline Scenario—Underlying Assumptions (2016–36)
Real GDP growth is projected to average 6.8 percent during 2016–21. Growth has slowed in 2016, partly
due to a less favorable external environment, including a slowdown in major trading partners and lower
metals prices. Real GDP is expected to moderate to 6.3 percent on average during 2016–36, as production in
the resource sector reaches maturity. Graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status is projected
around early-2020s.
Inflation (measured by GDP deflator in USD terms) is projected to average about 2.1 percent in 2016–36, in
line with a possible pickup in global inflation.
The balance of payments continues to be driven by developments in the resource sector, which has an
important bearing both on the current account and the capital and financial account. The non-interest
current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed to about 14.3 percent of GDP in 2016 and is expected
to widen over the medium term, as the railway project is implemented, before it declines to 11.3 percent of
GDP on average in the longer term, as the resource balance improves due to the beginning of operation of
large-scale power projects. FDI inflows are assumed to be vigorous, driven by growing investment inflows
into both resource and non-resource sectors.
External financing is assumed to remain largely on concessional terms in the near term. In the longer-run,
however, the degree of concessional financing decreases with economic development, while the new
disbursement schedule will shift from multilateral to commercial and bilateral creditors.
 Multilateral Creditors: Projected loan disbursements in the medium term are relatively higher than
the authorities’ projection. New disbursements from IDA is expected to be US$70 million. Lao P.D.R.
is expected to gradually establish IBRD creditworthiness which will result in gradual transition from
IDA and increasing borrowing at IBRD terms over the projection period. Over the longer term, the
share of multilateral loans in total disbursements is expected to decline.
 Bilateral and Commercial Creditors: Over the medium and longer term, project loan
disbursements increase, as donors provide support to the government’s development agenda. This
DSA assumes a US$480 million loan from China to build the Lao-China railway (Box 3). As Lao P.D.R.
exits from low income country status, a larger share of external borrowing is expected to come from
bilateral and commercial creditors, with lower degree of concessionality. This DSA incorporates
historical and projected sovereign bond issuance in the Thai market and assumes their continuous
roll-over and new bond issuances in the medium term.
Fiscal policy is projected to be neutral in the medium-term. The primary deficit is projected to peak at
4.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and decline gradually to about 3.5 percent of GDP on average over the medium
term. Over the long-term the primary deficit is expected to average around 2.8 percent as improvements in
non-mining revenue collection come on line, while capital expenditure is expected to decline and other
expenditure categories are expected to remain constant as a percent of GDP.
Domestic debt is expected to increase over the long-term as the country relies more on domestic funding.
Going forward, as global interest rates are projected to rise and domestic financial markets deepen, a larger
share of financing needs is likely to be satisfied by domestic creditors.

Box 3. The Lao P.D.R. Section of the Kunming – Singapore Railway Line
The project involves the construction of a 420 kilometer single track electrified rail line from Vientiane to the
border with China on the North. Around 60 percent of the railway line will go through tunnels or on bridges.
The railway line is a section of the proposed Kunming – Singapore Trans Asian Railway corridor. The start of
works on the section of the proposed corridor going through China was announced earlier in 2016. Other
countries on the corridor have announced plans for upgrades to existing lines and construction of new lines;
however, actual works have not been initiated.
The Lao P.D.R. section project has been estimated at US$6.7 billion, out of which 30 percent will be provided
by a joint venture company already formed between Lao P.D.R. and China. Lao P.D.R. will need to contribute
with 30 percent in the capital of this company (or around US$700 million) in annual installments over the
medium term. Out of this, US$480 million will be borrowed from China while the remaining funds will be
provided by the Budget. The joint venture company will need to secure the remaining 70 percent of the
project costs. Lao P.D.R. Ministry of Finance has noted that no sovereign guarantee will be provided.
According to the 2012 Feasibility Study, the IRR is 4.56 percent and the repayment period of investment is
23 years.
The formal start of works was announced in December 2015. However, progress has been slow due to still
unresolved property issues as well as detailed design works. More recently, six lots for construction works
(covering the full length of the proposed railway) were tendered with the awards being given to two Chinese
companies with considerable experience in the field. The Lao P.D.R. Ministry of Finance envisages start of
construction activities at some point during 2017.

13.
Debt dynamics are markedly worse under the stress test scenarios, with the exchange rate
depreciation risk having the largest impact. An abrupt exchange rate depreciation remains the most
important risk to sustainability, given a large share of foreign currency debt and a very thin international
reserves cushion. As shown in Figure 1, a one-off 30 percent depreciation shock would cause the breach of
the indicative threshold of the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio, the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, and debt serviceto-revenue ratio over a prolonged period. While the PV of external PPG debt declines over the projection
period, liquidity indicators worsen, as indicated by the increasing debt service ratios. In addition, an
assumed negative shock to FDI inflows––a scenario with net official transfers and net FDI falling in 2016–17
below their historical averages—deteriorates the debt trajectory, forcing Lao P.D.R. to reduce its current
account deficit in order to avoid worsening the external debt position.

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
14.
The PV of public sector debt in percent of GDP is projected to breach the benchmark for
many years and decline over the long run under the baseline scenario. Current public sector debt
dynamics show a worsening situation than in the 2014 DSA. The PV of public sector debt was estimated at
54.1 percent of GDP in 2015 and is expected to exceed 56.0 percent of the public debt benchmark for
many years in the baseline scenario. The breach is primarily driven by a faster amortization schedule on
existing 2015 debt and a higher projected disbursement schedule necessary to support growth. The public
sector debt is estimated at 65.8 percent of GDP at end-2015 and expected to rise to 70.3 percent of GDP
by 2018 before declining over the long run.

15.
The deterioration in the baseline and stress test scenarios compared to the 2014 DSA
highlights the growing risk of debt distress and the importance of fiscal consolidation over the
medium term. As shown in Figure 2 for the fixed primary balance scenario, which assumes an unchanged
primary balance from 2016 for the entire projection period, the PV of the debt-to-GDP and debt-torevenue ratios would be higher than the baseline over the projection period.
16.
The PV of public sector debt remains sensitive to a large, abrupt exchange rate depreciation
and the realization of contingent liabilities. Owning to significant reliance on external borrowing, a
sudden 30-percent depreciation of the kip against the U.S. dollar would immediately raise the PV of public
sector debt-to-GDP in the medium-term, indicating unfavorable implications for debt sustainability. Also,
given the fragile public banks, recapitalization costs, which are estimated to be at least about US$250
million (1.8 percent of GDP), could add to the debt burden.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
17.
The authorities broadly agree with the overall assessment, recognizing that the increased
public debt puts pressure on the government budget, and the importance of focusing on servicing
existing debts rather than creating new debts. The government has an explicit debt target for external
PPG debt of 50 percent of GDP and has taken steps to limit the contracting of additional debt to
concessional borrowing. A new legal framework for the contracting and management of public debt is also
being prepared, and the Ministry of Finance has been reorganized to merge the management of all debt
(domestic and foreign) in one department. The government has also eliminated the contracting of central
bank financing of off-budget investments.
18.
The authorities highlight that a significant part of the external debt is related to large,
commercially viable hydroelectric projects and do not foresee difficulties in servicing debt. They
project that energy projects will generate high and stable economic returns upon completion and will
supply enough foreign exchange to service debt. A relatively long maturity profile of loans, as well as U.S.
dollar returns of the exporting sectors, would help mitigate the risks of debt distress. The authorities
anticipate a decrease in disbursements of new funds from some bilateral donors between 2016 and 2022
given that the authorities are no longer allowed to start new investment projects not included in budget
passed by the National Assembly. Borrowing is expected to shift from external to domestic sources over
time, as domestic debt markets deepen and financing becomes cheaper.

CONCLUSION
19.
Lao P.D.R.’s risk of external debt distress is reclassified from moderate to high, suggesting
the urgent need to tighten fiscal policy, strengthen public financial management, and develop a
comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio, the
PV of external debt-to-revenue ratio, and debt service-to-revenue ratio breach the respective policydependent indicative thresholds for some years. Also, the PV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio breaches
the benchmark for some years. The projected increase in debt undermines fiscal space for countercyclical
needs and potential banking sector or other contingent costs. Given the considerable share of foreign

8

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

currency denominated debt, a large sudden exchange rate depreciation could significantly raise the level of
those indicators, putting debt dynamics on an unsustainable path. To reduce debt burden, external
borrowing should be contracted on concessional terms as much as possible. The authorities should
recalibrate fiscal policy to rebuild fiscal buffers through stronger revenue mobilization efforts and
expenditure rationalization, adopt clear guidelines for the issuance of sovereign debt and guarantees to
help contain and monitor contingent liabilities, and accelerate the strengthening of the debt management
function including developing a comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy and a regular
debt sustainability analysis to inform borrowing decisions.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate c
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure arrangement is a managed float. Since January 2015, the kip has stabilized within a
2 percent band against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was
reclassified to stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 22, 2015. The authorities’
objective is to limit currency fluctuations vis-à-vis major currencies, including the U.S. dollar and
Thai baht, within ±5 percent per annum. The Bank of the Lao P.D.R. (BOL) sets a daily official
reference rate, which is calculated as a weighted average of the previous day’s interbank rates.
Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to maintain their buying and selling
rates within ±0.25 percent of the BOL’s daily reference rate for the U.S. dollar. For the euro and
baht, the buying and selling rates may not exceed a margin of 0.5 percent. For other currencies, a
margin of 2 percent applies.
On May 28, 2010, Lao P.D.R. accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4,
following the elimination of one restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII arising
from a requirement to obtain tax payment certificates for some transactions. Lao P.D.R. now
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions, except for restrictions imposed solely for the preservation of
national or international security notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Vientiane during October 16–28, 2014 and
were concluded by the Executive Board on January 14, 2015. The staff report (Country Report No.
15/45) was published February, 2015.
Technical Assistance
Over the past three years, Lao P.D.R. has received technical assistance in the areas of: banking
supervision and interbank market development; customs, tax and natural resource revenue
administration; price statistics; external sector statistics; government finance statistics; and the
national accounts. A Bangkok-based IMF office was set up in September 2012 to facilitate technical
assistance to Lao P.D.R. as well as Myanmar, and has provided technical assistance in
macroeconomic analysis and forecasting, monetary operations and public financial management.
Resident Representative
Jonathan Dunn assumed the Resident Representative post for Vietnam and Lao P.D.R., based in
Hanoi, on October 16, 2015.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The World Bank and the IMF country teams for Lao P.D.R. met on October 1, 2016 to discuss
economic issues and outlook and to coordinate the two teams’ work for FY2015. The teams were led
by Mr. Evgenij Najdov (Senior Country Economist, Macro and Fiscal Management Global Practice,
World Bank), and Mr. Geoffrey Bannister (IMF Mission Chief for Lao P.D.R.).
The teams agreed that although Lao P.D.R. has made progress on macroeconomic stabilization,
significant vulnerabilities remain. While fiscal consolidation has been initiated, more efforts could be
made to reduce external vulnerabilities and restore fiscal sustainability. Tighter fiscal and monetary
policies, a more flexible exchange rate and strengthened banking supervision will be needed to
build international reserves and ensure macrofinancial stability. In the longer run, a key challenge is
to promote inclusive growth and poverty reduction through more diversification into non-resource
sectors and sustainable development of natural resources. Much progress has been made in recent
years on product and labor market openness and poverty reduction. Further trade integration will
improve the business climate, and promote private investment and institutional reform. Upgrading
health and education infrastructure will raise the growth potential and help reduce inequality.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012–2016 is
aligned with the government’s Eighth Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan,
2016-2020. It promotes inclusive and sustainable growth and poverty reduction through (i)
engagement in four priority sectors (agriculture, natural resources and rural development;
education; energy; and water and other urban infrastructure and services); and (ii) more effective
private sector development, gender equity, public sector management and regional cooperation
and integration as crosscutting concerns. The CPS aims to maximize efficiency and sustainability
through larger operations implemented over a longer period; maximize synergies with the
implementation of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) strategic framework 2012–22; and also
increase responsiveness to emerging issues in a rapidly changing economy. The new CPS 2017–2021
is under preparation. The performance-based allocation of the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
based on the country performance assessment (CPA) finalized in 2014, provided Lao P.D.R. with an
ADF allocation in the amount of US$116.6 million for the biennial period 2015–16. The CPA exercise
for the next allocation period (2017–18) was endorsed by the ADB’s management in October 2016.
As of end-2015, active loans/grants were worth US$761.8 million, of which US$356.9 million had
been disbursed. During 2015, contract awards totaled US$67.7 million and disbursement was
US$65.8 million. ADB approved three new loan projects and three new technical assistance (TA)
projects for a total of US$95 million and US$1.7 million in 2015 respectively, including Health Sector
Governance Program, Second GMS Corridor Town Development Project and Vientiane Sustainable
Urban Transport Project; TA projects related to Second Technical Vocational Education Project,
Support for Governance and Capacity Development, and Northern Rural Infrastructure Development
Project – Due Diligence of Additional Financing.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Lao People's Democratic Republic—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of December 6, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, especially
regarding national accounts, government finance, and external sector statistics. These
shortcomings are mostly due to lack of capacity, which could be addressed through further efforts
on the part of the agencies involved. The IMF is conducting technical assistance (TA) and training
programs to address the specific needs with a focus to mitigate near-term risks, covering the
areas of national accounts, prices, government finance statistics, monetary and financial statistics,
and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts (NA) comprise annual estimates of GDP by activity at current
and constant prices (base year=2002), broadly following the System of National Accounts (SNA)
1993. Lao P.D.R. participated in the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) project to implement the
SNA and International Comparison Project (ICP), funded by the government of Japan through the
Japan Administered Account for Selected Activities (JSA), and has received technical assistance
(TA) to improve annual national accounts and develop quarterly national accounts (QNA). Under
this project, Lao PDR made some methodology improvements in the annual GDP by activity
estimates, and has moved closer to completing a new annual expenditure measure of GDP and a
preliminary GNI series. Some progress had also been made toward the development of a new
quarterly GDP series. The compilation of a new benchmark GDP figure based on a supply and use
table for 2012 has been carried out with the help of a World Bank expert; the new benchmark
GDP figure together with some back series are expected to be released by the end of 2016.
Price Statistics: Lao P.D.R. compiles a monthly CPI. A new base year of 2015 (December 2015=100)
has been applied since July 2016. There are two major changes in the estimation including: 1) the
items in the basket increased from 245 to 485 items; and 2) all 18 provinces are covered instead
of 12 previously. The updated weights are based on the 2012 Lao Social Indicator Survey (LSIS).
The major change in the weights is a higher weight of Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages from
36.5 percent to 46.1 percent. However, the full list of the updated weights has not yet been
disclosed. The 2015 Population Census was launched in October 2016. The 2015 Statistical Year
Book was available in October 2016. The Lao Labor Survey is planned to start in November 2016
with support of International Labor Organization and will finish in July 2017. The Enterprise Survey
design is underway and it will be completed in December 2016.
Government Finance Statistics: Government finance statistics remain weak. The timeliness of fiscal
reporting needs significant improvement. Off-budget activities are not included in the fiscal data,
although they have expanded rapidly in recent years. Annual budget and outturn data formats do
not follow international standards for government finance statistics. Except for the annual data
disseminated in the Official Gazette, no fiscal data are disseminated in the country. STA appointed
a Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Advisor to the IMF Technical Assistance Office for the Lao
PDR and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (TAOLAM) in September 2014, whose activities
are funded by the government of Japan. The main focus of the advisor is to assist the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) in upgrading the compilation and dissemination procedures of fiscal data in line
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

with the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014) and improve timely data
dissemination to the IMF, as well as reduce fiscal data discrepancies. The advisor also has initiated
discussions with the MoF and line ministries to gather information on extra-budgetary funds
administered by government departments for the purpose of compiling consolidated GFS for the
central government sector.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The classification of monetary data by institutional sector and by
financial instrument as well as valuation principles need to be strengthened. The latest monetary
data reported to STA refer to December 2010. The Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which
embody the IMF-recommended framework for compiling monetary statistics, have yet to be
introduced.
Financial sector surveillance: Lao P.D.R. does not produce official Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) yet.

External sector statistics: STA appointed an External Sector Statistics (ESS) Advisor to the Technical

Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar (TAOLAM) in February 2014. While significant room
exists for improving the quality and coverage of balance of payments and external debt statistics
in Lao PDR and for compiling data on the international investment position, recent engagement
between the advisor and Lao PDR officials has been limited to participation in a series of regional
topical workshops on ESS. The missions assisted in reconciling the discrepancy between imports
data published by the Bank of Lao and imports derived from partner countries’ data in the
Direction of Trade Statistics and found that the use of minimum prices to value vehicles and
petroleum imports might explain some of the differences. Greater use of hands-on technical
assistance from TAOLAM could accelerate progress in filling data gaps on and improving the
quality of ESS in Lao P.D.R. In addition, several balance of payments components are missing due
to the lack of source data. The BOL balance of payments compilers have designed an FDI survey
questionnaire in the context of the World Bank’s LAOSTAT-Strengthening the National Statistical
System Project. Coordination on FDI is needed as the European Union has also appointed an
expert to assist on FDI statistics. Implementation of the new international transactions reporting
system (ITRS) is ongoing and testing of the new ITRS is expected by June 2015. The BOL does not
yet compile an international investment position statement.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Lao P.D.R. is currently not a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant. The
government has expressed its intention to collaborate with the IMF in moving Lao’s
macroeconomic statistics closer to the international standards, including to join the IMF’s GDDS,
and use it as a framework for development of the national data compilation and dissemination
practices. No Data ROSC mission has been conducted.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Lao People’s Democratic
Republic and Hung Vinh Nguyen, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director and
Phengphaivanh Sitpraxay, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 30, 2017
1.
The Lao authorities would like to express their gratitude to the mission team for the
constructive and comprehensive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy
issues during the 2016 Article IV consultation held from September 19-30, 2016. They
broadly agree with staff’s assessment and appreciate the invaluable policy advice on
strengthening fiscal buffers, containing external risks, enhancing financial sector resilience,
and undertaking structural reforms to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive growth. The
authorities will take into account staff’s recommendations in formulating future policies, in
particular to support the implementation of the National Socio-Economic Development Plan
(NSEDP) 2016-20.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The Lao economy has been growing robustly in recent years, supported by the
strong performance of the resource sector despite a less favorable external
environment. The economy is projected to grow by 6.9 percent in 2016 on account of
increased investments in infrastructure, real estate development, trade and manufacturing, as
well as significantly higher hydropower generation and tourism receipts. The growth is
however lower than the 7.5 percent recorded in 2015 due to a decline in exports following
lower commodity prices, slowdown in major trading partners and lower agricultural output as
a result of poor weather conditions. Core inflation in 20161 stood at 1 percent, while headline
inflation remained low at 1.6 percent mainly reflecting higher domestic food prices in the
second half of the year which more than offset lower prices in the communication and
transportation sectors. On the external front, the current account deficit declined to
8.5 percent of GDP for the first three quarters of 2016, as a result of improvements in
trade
balance and transfers while FDI flows remained high. The international reserves at endSeptember stood at USD 998.59 million, equivalent to 6.44 months of imports.
3.
The overall fiscal deficit in FY2015-162 rose to 6.9 percent reflecting a large
decline in tax and non-tax revenues. The shortfall in tax revenue was mainly due to the
economic slowdown and the decline in commodity prices, while lower non-tax revenue
reflected the absence of the sale of state assets. Even though capital expenditure was lower in
line with reduced externally financed investment, current expenditure remained high due to
an increase in interest payments and transfers. Money supply grew at an appropriate pace to
support productive economic activities without putting pressure on prices. The exchange rate
Based on the average of actual monthly data in 2016
Lao fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. Starting in 2017, the fiscal year will coincide with the
calendar year.

remains stable, with the Lao Kip moving within the +/- 5 percent range against the US dollar.
The banking system remains sound. Though there was a slight increase in the ratios of
foreign currency deposits and credit to total deposits and credit respectively, dollarization has
continued its downward path. As of end-September 2016, the NPL ratio was at 3.03 percent
which was slightly higher than targeted but still manageable and lower compared to 2015.
4.
The authorities expect real GDP to grow by 7 percent in 2017, underpinned by
increased agriculture production, completion of hydropower projects and higher foreign
investments. Inflation is expected to remain low and below 5 percent. The current account
deficit is projected to narrow in the medium term, following the completion of several
hydropower projects together with an increase in exports and tourism receipts. The
authorities remain positive on sustained FDI inflows and strongly commit to structural
reforms that will enhance the business environment and improve the efficiency of public
investments, which will in turn promote greater economic diversification as well as generate
comfortable levels of official reserves to cover the equivalent of 5 months of imports.
5.
The authorities note staff’s assessment that downside risks to the economic
outlook stem from several challenges, particularly those arising from limited fiscal space,
accumulated public debt stock, undercapitalized state-owned banks and an uncertain external
environment. They therefore commit to exercising vigilance and prudence in their policy
implementation.

The authorities recognize the importance of increasing fiscal buffers to enhance
the economy’s resilience to potential shocks. In this regard, the medium-term budget plan
projects a declining fiscal deficit for 2016-20, with an average of 4.06 percent of GDP, which
is close to staff’s adjustment scenario. The declining deficit will support the authorities’
commitment to bring down public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020. In addition, the
authorities are also working on the “Strategic Public Financial Management Plan
toward 2025”, which is expected to be adopted by mid-2017, as well as in the process of
drafting a law on public debt to strengthen public debt management and limit the off-budget
payment.
7.
On domestic revenue mobilization, measures are being taken to improve revenue
collection and broaden the tax base in line with the recently approved five-year budget
plan. Revenue collection will be strengthened by enforcing compliance of tax and duty
exemptions and VAT deductibles, removing tax exemptions for vehicles and construction
materials for public investment projects, and focusing on large taxpayers and taxes on
vehicles, petrol and luxury goods. The authorities are also reviewing existing tax rates to
ensure they remain appropriate. In addition, taxes on vehicles and luxury goods are expected
to generate higher revenue as they are now based on market prices instead of baseline prices
as was the previously the case. Several major steps are also being taken to improve tax
administration: (i) the central tax office will now be responsible for large taxpayers while the

3
provincial offices will focus on small and medium enterprises; (ii) the central and local
authorities are closely working to reduce tax and other revenue leakages, while transfer of
revenue to central budget from local authorities will also be audited and monitored closely;
and (iii) the authorities will modernize its approach to tax collection from businesses, e.g.
through non-cash payment, which will enable closer monitoring.
8.
The authorities are also committed to pursue expenditure rationalization and
enhancements to public spending efficiency. These include: (i) rationalizing investment
incentives; (ii) upgrading a decree on public procurement to be a law; (iii) containing current
spending by reforming the civil service to lower the public sector wage bill; and (iv)
improving monitoring of contingent liabilities, particularly from public-private partnerships
(PPPs). The authorities recently reformed the SOE committee and are currently drafting a
decree on PPPs. In addition, the restructuring and privatization of some SOEs will be
continued, namely the Enterprise of Telecommunications Lao (ETL), the Lao Airline
Company and two state-owned banks. For example, the state’s share in the ETL has been
reduced to 49 percent from 100 percent.
9.
The authorities commit to keep public debt on a sustainable path. Although nonconcessional borrowings increased in recent years, these borrowings were used to support the
construction of hydropower projects which will contribute to generating foreign currency
income to support repayments. Future borrowings would remain mainly on concessional
terms and oriented towards necessary investments. Moreover, under the current legislation,
external borrowings require government’s detailed consideration of specific amount and
concessionality.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10. The managed float exchange rate regime is an effective policy in anchoring
inflation given the limited effectiveness of monetary policy implementation due to
dollarization and cash-based economy. In a long history of dollarization, expectations of
rapid depreciation could lead to macroeconomic instability. Therefore, the authorities see the
need to minimize volatility and maintain exchange rate stability, while taking steps to
improve market monitoring and building up reserves. While agreeing with staff that greater
exchange rate flexibility would help in building-up reserves, the authorities consider the
current level of reserves to be adequate. To improve the exchange rate policy framework, the
central bank has since the end of 2016 started carrying out foreign exchange rate auctions
with commercial banks and big exchange rate bureaus. In addition, the central bank will
continue efforts to spur the development of the domestic forex derivative market by taking a
lead role in operating forward, future and swap arrangements.
11. The authorities will continue to manage the growth of broad money in line with
supporting growth and price stability. In order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary
policy and to promote the use of Lao Kip, efforts will be directed at strengthening the
transmission mechanism, developing payment systems and the inter-bank money market, and

4
introducing a liquidity management framework. At the end of 2015, the authorities
introduced the ad-hoc interest rate policy to provide commercial banks with guidance to
lower the cost of lending in Lao Kip to more appropriate levels in order to promote greater
access to credit by SMEs. This temporary arrangement is expected to have positive effects on
productive sectors of the economy. In addition, the authorities are strictly enforcing the
Foreign Currency Management Law to limit the use of foreign currencies and promote the
use of Lao Kip, such as issuing a guidance at the end of 2016 to support transaction for
vehicle retail sales to be made via bank transactions and in Lao Kip only for cash payments.
12. The authorities recognize the importance of capacity building in supporting their
efforts to improve the policy frameworks and therefore, are appreciative of ongoing
Fund TA. In addition, the authorities have devoted resources to developing economic models
to support policy evaluation and formulation as well as improving the quality of statistics
towards meeting international standards.
Financial Stability
13. To maintain a stable and sound banking system, the authorities are implementing
policies consistent with the “Lao Strategic Financial System Development Plan 20162020 and Vision toward 2030”. These policies include improving the central bank’s legal
framework to strengthen risk-based supervision and transition towards adoption of most
Basel-core principles and the Basel II standard; restructuring state-owned banks and
enhancing transparency of their operations; upgrading accounting standards in line with the
International Financial Reporting Standards; revising guidelines for bank licensing in line
with AML/CFT standards; and developing the crisis management framework. In this regard,
the authorities are in the process of drafting a master plan and action plan for BASEL II
implementation. In addition, they are considering additional macroprudential measures to
curtail potential risks from a rise in funding from non-core foreign sources. At the end
of 2016, the authorities introduced amendments to regulations related to overseas funding
of commercial banks in order to support their domestic lending as well as improve
tracking records of funding flows and ensure the repayment ability of the banks.
14. In addition, as part of continued efforts to strengthen financial stability, the authorities
appreciate Fund TA on on-site and off-site supervision manuals, as well as the World Bank’s
TA to improve banking supervision tools and relevant regulation frameworks. The authorities
are also in the process of improving the compilation of financial soundness indicators which
have benefitted from Fund/Bank TA.
Structural Reforms
15. Structural reforms continue to be the policy priority of the government, together
with efforts to continue improving the quality of life, enhancing the business environment to
attract more FDI, and diversifying the economy for sustainable development. To improve
living conditions, the authorities will remain actively engaged in the improvement and

5
prioritization of education and health care. On health care, the authorities will continue to
focus on improving maternal health, early childcare, and nutrition in line with improving the
quality of public health services. On education development, efforts will continue to be
directed at enhancing the quality of primary education in the rural areas and promoting
technical and vocational training to address skill mismatches and promote specialization. The
authorities are working with the World Bank to improve the efficiency of public investments in
education and health care.
16. The authorities are prioritizing public infrastructure projects in roads, railways,
bridges, and transmission lines, which are essential in improving the rural areas and
diversifying the economy. The completion of key hydropower projects in the near term will
help to meet the energy needs of a growing economy and thus, enhance the business climate
and competitiveness. To attract more investment inflows, the authorities have continued to
improve the regulatory framework, such as by amending the investment law in early 2016, to
allow for targeted and time-bound tax exemptions for businesses that invest in the rural areas
and allowing a lower tax rate for investments made in the special economic zone while
preparing to upgrade a decree on special economic zone to be a law in 2017. To promote
sustainable development, the authorities are introducing measures to safeguard the
sustainability of natural resources, such as suspending licenses for new mining projects and
export of unprocessed wood. To increase financial inclusion, the authorities have introduced
“BCEL Community Money Express” in 2015, which allows microfinance institutions to
utilize commercial banks’ branches to expand their outreach to the rural areas. The
authorities are also close to completing a draft national financial inclusion strategic plan
for 2016-20.
Conclusion
17. The Lao authorities are in the process of implementing the new NSEDP to address the
remaining bottlenecks to graduate from the least developing country list by 2020 as well as to
meet the Sustainable Development Goals. The authorities note that economic expansion
needs to bring a durable reduction in poverty and substantial improvements in socioeconomic conditions. The authorities are committed to maintain macroeconomic and
financial stability, promote sustainable and inclusive growth, and stand ready to implement
any measures deemed appropriate. Mindful of the challenges ahead, efforts will be
intensified to improve efficiency of public service delivery, reform public financial
management, strengthen the banking regulatory and supervisory framework, and enhance the
business environment.
