INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Germany
Approved by Marek Belka and Tamim Bayoumi
December 9, 2008
Executive Summary
Germany faces the prospect of a sizeable, and possibly extended, economic downturn. Following
contraction in the second and third quarters of 2008, a further four quarters of negative GDP growth
appear likely. In 2009, GDP is projected to fall by 0.8 percent and a sluggish 0.5 percent growth in
2010 would be well below the potential of about 1½ percent. The risk is that corporate and financial
sector stresses, thus far dissociated from each other in Germany, may become more intertwined. The
longer the global shocks persist, the more severe and prolonged would the weakness be.
The authorities have stepped in to protect financial stability. Following the public commitment to
fully protect household deposits, the newly-constituted Financial Market Stabilization Fund (FMSF) is
to address urgent vulnerabilities—banks’ liquidity, short-term funding, and capitalization. A few
transactions have been completed. However, banks face new risks through weakening corporate credit
and exposures to emerging markets. It remains important that the Landesbanken be downsized and
merged to form viable financial entities for private ownership and operation. The authorities
acknowledge the challenge and are examining various options.
This crisis has highlighted the need—and created an opportunity—for overhauling the
framework for financial stability and prudential regulation. Though faced by legal and political
constraints, the authorities are exploring instituting a bank resolution mechanism that can respond in a
more timely manner, while also rationalizing the patchwork of deposit insurance schemes within
Germany. The global lessons from the crisis will require regulatory and supervisory enhancements.
And, as the authorities also recognize, the process of further clarification of authority and
accountability within the German system of prudential regulation and supervision must continue.
The generally sound fiscal position leaves room for a sizable but targeted stimulus to counter the
adverse developments. The authorities regard the measures taken so far as sufficient, but to be
complemented, if necessary, with additional stimulus. Staff argued for a more ambitious stimulus now.
Targeted payments to economically-weak households could initially raise confidence and spending.
Bringing forward the planned reductions in social security contributions and accelerated infrastructure
spending could have a stimulus effect with longer-term benefits. However, commitment to long-term
fiscal sustainability through the proposed fiscal rule is necessary, as the authorities recognize. Cost
efficiencies in healthcare and reform of fiscal federalism remain medium-term challenges despite
recent commendable gains in the state of public finances.

Given strong spillovers, policy measures to contain the risk of a self-reinforcing
and costly slump will achieve more if coordinated internationally. Global impulses, felt
forcefully in Germany, are rapidly transmitted to other economies. A German economic
slowdown lowers growth in the rest of Europe, which feeds back to Germany. Moreover, a
likely reduction of German banks’ exposure to emerging markets would generate cascading
spillovers. Thus, giving due consideration to its domestic objectives, Germany stands to
benefit from an internationally coordinated approach to managing global risks.
•

In this regard, actions to strengthen the financial safety net will buttress the recent
initiatives. Germany’s request for an FSAP update is timely.

•

A similar risk management philosophy should apply to economic, especially fiscal,
policy

grow at 1.7 percent in 2008, followed by a
contraction of 0.8 percent in 2009 (Table 1). The projection of a tentative recovery in 2010
reflects the assessment that the recent upswing was not associated with sustained productivity
gains, and financial restructuring will also dampen growth. Corporate and financial sector
stresses, thus far dissociated from each other in Germany, may become more intertwined.
Moreover, the longer the global shocks persist, the more severe and prolonged would the
weakness be.

A. Shocks to Growth
6.
The primary shock has been slowing world demand. Since the mid-1990s, German
growth has been powered by exports. Not surprisingly, the principal source of the current
slowdown has been the curtailment of foreign orders. The projected weakness of the world
economy (and especially the U.S. economy) implies that this source of growth will remain
heavily restricted. Movements in the euro exchange rate have some bearing on German
exports, but staff analysis suggests that they mainly cause a shift in composition rather than a
significant overall change.
Germany has been reliant on export growth.

This, in turn, contributed to the slow
consumption growth in recent years.
Increased GDP volatility and Germany’s
above-average stock market volatility added to
the concerns about tail risks (extreme losses
with low probabilities). For precautionary
reasons, consumers have preferred to restrain
consumption and build buffer-stock savings.
During 2002-2007, this effect lowered
consumption growth by ½ percentage point.

such, limits on bank credit
availability have apparently not constrained growth. That may be changing. Staff analysis
suggests that banks have been competing on tightening margins, substituting in some cases
for the drying up of the corporate bond market. The authorities agree that with higher funding
costs and worsening asset quality, a sharper contraction of credit is likely, contributing to a
financial accelerator-like process.
10.
The corporate bond market is pricing in significant economic weakening. A
financial accelerator is evident in corporate bond spreads, which have proved a keen predictor
of German GDP growth (Figure 2). The

C. Spillovers
11.
With its strong international linkages, spillovers into and from Germany are
substantial. The Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV consultation concluded that U.S. and
European growth impulses have a significant bearing on German growth, manifest at present
in Germany’s sharp response to the deceleration in world trade. Growth impulses from
Germany were contained in the past but are more prominent now. The authorities agree that
an economic slowdown in Germany lowers growth in the rest of Europe, which feeds back to
Germany.
12.
Over time, Germany has become more exposed to emerging market shocks, with
implications for ongoing developments. German economic ties to Central Europe are
particularly significant: through FDI, trade, and bank subsidiaries (Figure 4). From June
2007, just before the crisis started, to September 2008, German banks’ exposure to emerging
markets via loans and credit derivatives doubled to about $450 billion (Table 2), 4 percent of
all German banking assets and 12 percent of all German banks’ foreign claims. This
expansion occurred at a time when other lenders and investors were retrenching from
emerging market assets. A likely scaling back of German banks’ exposure to emerging
markets would generate cascading spillovers.

2

The 2008 WEO shows that elevated financial stress is associated with longer duration of weakness and
substantially-larger output losses.

Spillovers are also manifest in a heightened concordance of sentiment,
particularly in an economic downturn. Sentiment in the eurozone becomes more closely
aligned when economic prospects worsen. Today, sentiment is more tightly aligned than in
the recent past, suggesting that a strong negative reinforcement could continue to hurt
growth. German loss of confidence contributes to the contagion of pessimism in the
eurozone.
Euro Area sentiments are more closely aligned in economic downturns.

Box 2. Pass Through from Global Fuel and Food Prices
The influence of global fuel and food prices felt in Germany is broadly in line with the impact
observed in other advanced economies. International fuel prices are passed through to domestic
commodity prices to a significantly greater extent than are food prices. However, once passed through,
food prices have a larger impact on core inflation. The size of these transmission coefficients—the
extent of prices transmitted over a year—is consistent with the relatively modest effects that were felt
in Germany during the recent run up in food and fuel prices.

III. RISKS TO FINANCIAL STABILITY
15.
The global financial crisis has highlighted important vulnerabilities of the
German financial system. Though traditionally conservative, segments of the banking
system were exposed to substantial risks. The exposures interacted vigorously with global
financial turbulence. As of end-September 2008, Germany accounted for about a quarter of
European bank write downs. Of these, about two thirds have been in public or quasi-public
sector banks. Two large private banks—Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank—have sought
assistance through the government’s financial stabilization package, as discussed below.
Looking ahead, the system faces two key vulnerabilities:
•

The rollover of wholesale funding: funding conditions remain tight, and bunching of
maturing debt obligations creates rollover risk.

•

The availability of adequate capital buffers: the low absolute level of capital will be
further stressed as profits fall and asset quality worsens with the economic slowdown.

manifest even in the highly-secure
covered bond (Pfandbrief) market. Backed by high-grade mortgages retained on their
books (with loan-to-value ratios in the 60–80 percent range) or by loans to the public sector,
German covered bonds have been considered almost as safe as Bunds. However, since the

14
spring of 2008, spreads on these bonds have tended to increase, and, following the sharp rise
in September, have stabilized at historically-high levels. Trading in the secondary Pfandbrief
market has nearly halted since early September, as bondholders are apparently using their
Pfandbrief positions as collateral for receiving liquidity from the central bank. Planned issues
of covered bonds have been cancelled or cut in volume as the primary market demand has
shrunk. Wholesale investors apparently prefer the large ongoing and expected issues of
directly government-guaranteed debt.
Even in the covered bond market, liquidity has dried up.

19.
The need for more capital is also dictated by the heightened financial volatility.
Since the start of the crisis in July 2007, market assessments of the probabilities of default on
bank debt have increased (Figure 2). This has been a function primarily of increased
uncertainty regarding the quality of assets amid deteriorating credit conditions reflected in the
low market valuation of German bank relative to European peers. As a consequence, a large
share of German banking assets has moved into sub-investment-grade credit ratings
categories while overall default risk has increased.

Looking ahead, the economic slowdown will generate further pressures. The
relatively low debt ratios of companies and households and the significant role of retail
deposits in the funding of banks will continue to cushion the impact of the current shocks.
The low debt ratios have been accompanied by modest increases in equity prices and flat
house prices. Despite that, the nonfinancial sector is now more broadly affected than during
the earlier stages of the crisis. The borrowing costs for nonfinancial corporates, especially for
the lower-quality borrowers have increased sharply as perceptions of default probabilities
have increased. This has occurred across various sub-sectors (construction, automobiles,
engineering, and chemicals) and not only for low-grade entities, as would be expected during
a slowdown, but also for highly-rated corporates.

IV. RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS
A. The Stabilization Package
21.
The Financial Market Stabilization Fund (FMSF) has been vital to shielding the
financial sector. The FMSF is the conduit for a €100 billion package available until
December 31, 2009. 3 It includes €20 billion as provision to back up guarantees of up to
€400 billion to secure market borrowings by banks and up to €80 billion for capital injections
or purchase of assets. The envelope of available guarantees is expected to cover upcoming
funding needs. The guarantees for select newly issued debt securities and liabilities (with
maturities of up to 36 months) will complement the political commitment to protect
household depositors and together these should alleviate rollover and funding risks. The
capital injections address the banks’ need for capital and should ease solvency concerns.
22.
As elsewhere, the package has helped calm markets. The improvement in
sentiment is reflected in the decline in banks’ CDS spreads, which are now off their peaks,
although still at elevated levels. In the short run, the guarantees to creditors are crucial to the
continued thawing of funding and interbank markets. Hypo Real Estate has drawn on the
guarantee window. Commerzbank is to receive capital support in the form of a silent
participation and can call on guarantees. Several Landesbanken have publicly expressed
interest in assistance from the FMSF.
3

Based on a decision by the EU Commission, a review is required after six months since enactment. The Länder
will share 35 percent of the costs (although capped at € 7.7 billion) and, in addition, will absorb the costs
associated with the Landesbanken.

18
23.
The German package is sizeable but the approach, unlike in the U.S. and the
U.K., has thus far been more hands off. The authorities are relying on banks’ assessments
in seeking public assistance. They indicated that they are not yet ready to implement a more
proactive approach, as suggested by staff. The conditionality associated with the FMSF’s
assistance appears milder than in the U.K. but more stringent than in the U.S. Also, the
German authorities are able to provide Tier I capital through silent participations that do not
dilute existing shareholder positions. This approach appears appropriate based on the banks’
current solvency position, but might need to be revised and tightened, on a case-by-case
basis, to more aggressively dilute shareholders if significant additional losses are identified.
The challenge for the authorities will be to support viable banks while providing incentives
for the recourse to private capital markets. Regular financial reporting and audits will provide
transparency and accountability. 4
24.
The proactive restructuring of the Landesbanken requires early attention. The
economic role of the Landesbanken is in question, highlighted by their investments in
imprudent ventures. Moreover, the financial crisis has revealed the serious risks—to their
viability and, thereby, to systemic stability—associated with their wholesale funding
approach. Downsizing these banks, separating them into “good” banks and “bad” banks, and
incorporating the “good” banks (to enable the introduction of private capital) should be
among the options for their restructuring. Proposals to combine these troubled institutions
need careful assessment since larger troubled banks would pose even greater systemic
problems. The authorities agree that the Landesbanken must be restructured but believe that
the Lander, as principal owners, must take the initiative. Staff recommended that SoFFin
could work with the Landesbanken and their owners to break the impasse.
B. Strengthening the Safety Net
25.
Reforms to achieve early intervention and effective bank resolution are essential.
The German bank resolution framework is not in line with sound international practices or
the recommendation of the Financial Stability Forum that calls for a broad range of resolution
tools. Banks play a key role in the economy, and run specific risks that may materialize
quickly with a major impact on the economy. In return, banks should be subject to a special
resolution regime, typically including the ability for the authorities to take a range of quick
and decisive actions concerning failing banks that would permit limiting shareholders’ rights.
The German legal framework is constrained in this regard by the general corporate legal
regime, which is more respectful of property rights. As a consequence, bank resolution, often

certainty to transactions.

19
under the leadership of the associations, may take longer and possibly result in declining
asset values and delays in depositor access to their funds.
26.
The authorities have taken a first step in this direction and are exploring further
enhancements. The financial stabilization package allows for speedy shareholder dilution in
recapitalizations. These powers need to be broadened beyond the 50 percent dilution
currently allowed for the FMSF. The deposit protection scheme for cooperative banks, where
shareholder voting rights are less of a concern, has successfully been used to fund a full range
of resolution tools to deal with its financially distressed/insolvent member banks. The
authorities are exploring ways to strengthen the bank resolution framework.
27.
The authorities are considering broader changes to deposit insurance, in concert
with recent European initiatives. A sound deposit insurance framework is a key component
of the financial safety net. The recent crisis revealed important limitations of the patchwork
of statutory and private schemes, which offer differing levels of protection to depositors
(Box 3).
•

The lack of public awareness about relevant coverage and features (including
financial strength and the legal obligations of the schemes) created incentives for
sudden movements of deposits between different segments of the banking sector.

•

Coverage under the statutory schemes (€20,000; 0.7 times GDP per capita) is low by
international comparison and includes a coinsurance element that risked undermining
depositor confidence.

•

The time limits for depositor reimbursements under the statutory schemes are rather
long and prevent prompt access to deposits, further contributing to uncertainty.

20

Box 3. Germany’s Fragmented Deposit Protection1/
Commercial banks: statutory scheme—The coverage provided for deposits in private commercial
banks under the statutory scheme is low by international comparison (0.7 times GDP per capita), and
includes an element of coinsurance (up to € 20,000 /90 percent of deposits per depositor and bank).
Reimbursement of deposits is initiated by a declaration by BaFin and should be completed within
3 months (an extension for another 3 months is possible).
Commercial banks: private scheme—The Bankers’ Association offers for its member banks
additional coverage amounting to 30 percent of the bank’s capital per depositor, constituting a de facto
full compensation scheme (though not legally enforceable by depositors). While resources have been
built up reportedly amounting to € 4.6 billion in September 2008, the parameters for ex post burdensharing arrangements among banks in times of financial turmoil and heavy claims are not clear.
Savings banks (Sparkassen) and Landesbanken—Partial ex ante funding (risk-based) is built up
under regional arrangements and coupled with additional ex post burden-sharing provisions (including
contributions from the local authorities that sponsor the institution) to protect the institutions in their
entirety. Further support is provided under the inter-regional arrangement and master arrangement, if
needed (without legal obligation). Public banks (other than savings banks and Landesbanken) have
their own statutory and private schemes administered by the Association of German Public Sector
Banks.
Cooperative banks (Volks- und Raiffeisenbanken) —The protection scheme run by the National
Association of German Cooperative Banks is intended to protect cooperative banks in their entirety. Ex
ante funding (risk-based) is complemented by limited guarantees. When called upon, resources may be
committed for broad purposes but there is no legal obligation to provide assistance. The Association
takes the lead in resolving failed member banks, typically through purchase-and-assumption
transactions or mergers.

__________________________________________________________________
1/ While financial statements for the various schemes must be submitted to BaFin and the Bundesbank, no information on
their actual financial strength is made publicly available.

28.
A step forward would be the creation of a single fund for the statutory deposit
insurance coverage that spans the pillars of the German banking sector. This fund would
replace the funds run by the various associations. It would provide for unified terms of
coverage, thereby enhancing transparency and legal certainty for depositors. Such a fund
would be more diversified in its risks than the existing funds and it could be tapped to
facilitate resolutions of banks. More ex ante funding of deposit insurance is preferable to the
current predominantly ex post practice that in an economic downturn will be procyclical. The
authorities indicated that there is a clear need for change, but the political will for such
change is limited. Evolving EU rules should guide policies with respect to deposit insurance.
This would entail increasing minimum coverage under the statutory schemes (initially to

21
€50,000 and possibly to €100,000 when adopted as the EU minimum) and procedures put in
place to facilitate prompt access to insured deposits. In light of the experience with Northern
Rock and subsequent removal of coinsurance in the U.K., Estonia, and others, the authorities
should remove the coinsurance feature of the statutory schemes. Supplementary coverage
could be allowed provided it did not compromise transparency.
C. Prudential Regulation and Supervision
29.
Beyond the immediate crisis response, lessons from the crisis call for
enhancements to the regulatory and supervisory framework. The authorities are taking
steps to implement Pillar II of Basel II and to introduce recommendations that respond to the
recent crisis. In this regard, the consultation paper on the European Capital Requirements
Directive (CRD) has identified three salient issues: a college of supervisors for cross-border
banks, capital requirements for securitization, and binding limits on interbank exposures. The
enhanced capital requirements for securitization will force German banks, some of whom
have recently engaged heavily in these transactions, to face their responsibilities and also to
leave traces in their prudential returns to more easily draw supervisors’ attention. Additional
recommendations by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) that will require attention include:
the review of banks’ liquidity contingency plans, sharing with other countries’ authorities of
their crisis management experience, and consistent approaches to liquidity for cross border
banks. The authorities indicated that salaries at BaFin are at the lower end of supervisory
compensation in Europe, which could impede acquiring the expertise to oversee the complex
risks and the new challenges.
30.
At the same time, the case for a tighter bank regulatory and supervisory process
has become more compelling. To respond promptly to problem situations, supervisors have
a heightened need for information on the current status of bank soundness. As such, greater
consolidation of regulatory and supervisory resources could yield significant benefits. This
implies:
•

Significantly reduced reliance on external auditors. Such reliance creates the scope for
significant delays in identifying financial stress.

•

Prudential regulation and supervision should be linked to a system of macrosurveillance and stability analysis.

•

As recommended by the FSF, Bundesbank would need ready access to firm level
supervisory information to facilitate their emergency liquidity support activities.

31.
Alternative structural approaches could improve supervision. Should all
prudential oversight be placed under the authority of the Bundesbank, as provider of liquidity
to the banking sector, its operational independence would need to be assured. Another option
would be to place all supervision in BaFin, but here compensation limits could become

22
problematic, especially since the specialized skills for the implementation of Basel II are in
scarce supply. Under either option, the authorities may wish to also explore the “twin peaks”
model whereby prudential and market conduct supervision and regulation of the financial
sector are placed in separate agencies. This model is being used by the Dutch authorities. The
authorities indicated that they plan to retain the “integrated supervisor” model but intend to
undertake a more detailed review by March 2009.
V. COMPETITIVENESS
32.
The authorities agree that Germany enjoys a small competitiveness advantage,
though the CGER methodology results in divergent assessments. It is customary to take a
simple average of the three

current account surplus is that needed to maintain net foreign assets at the current level. But
since Germans evidently prefer to save to accumulate foreign assets, as the macro-balances
approach recognizes, the external sustainability approach overstates the competitiveness
advantage.
33.
The equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) measure, which reflects a
disadvantage, may also not be an appropriate
measure for Germany. The ERER measures
competitiveness using the CPI-based real
exchange rate (REER). While German inflation
has moved with that in the eurozone, German
wages have fallen in real terms and, in particular,
relative to major European countries. With

VI. BALANCING TENSIONS IN PUBLIC FINANCES
35.
Following impressive expenditure-based consolidation in prior years, the
headline deficit is set to be balanced in 2008. The pressure on the deficit increased in 2008
on account of revenue losses (of about ½ percent of GDP resulting from corporate income tax
reform and the reduction in

has not had an impact on the deficit
since the support leads to an acquisition
of a financial asset; but it does imply higher public debt that finances the support.
36.
For 2009, the headline deficit will rise with the cyclical downturn. Policy
measures approved in fall 2008 to raise social benefits, change social security contributions,
and provide investment incentives are expected to raise the deficit by about 0.2 percentage
point of GDP in 2009. The bigger impact on the headline deficit will come from the
worsening economic situation. As a result of cyclical pressures, the general government
deficit is expected to be 1.1 percent of GDP. The authorities currently project the deficit at
½ percent of GDP, but with the likely revision in their economic outlook assumptions, their
projection will be close to that of staff.

Significant frontloaded and internationally-coordinated fiscal stimulus is
necessary. Staff viewed the authorities’ measures as relatively modest, especially in 2009
when they are most needed to boost demand. Staff proposed that, assuming multipliers of

and may prove ineffective if multipliers are smaller. Staff acknowledged this risk, but argued
that this concern needs to be weighed against the threat that with anxiety at unusually high
levels—and even with the benefit of the FMSF—a self-reinforcing costly loss in output could
ensue. The authorities and staff agreed that—given extensive evidence of trade, financial, and
sentiment spillovers—the stimulus would be particularly effective if German actions were
part of a joint European effort to bolster demand.
39.
The international experience points to important lessons for making a stimulus
effective. Drawing on these lessons, the practical implications for Germany were discussed
(see text table below for possible measures and their likely effectiveness):
•

Staff expressed concern that private investment incentives (through accelerated
depreciation) and increased lending to small- and medium-sized firms through the

26
development bank, KfW, were unlikely to raise investment while business confidence
was low.
•

The stimulus could be initiated by transfer payments to vulnerable households (to
impart an immediate demand impulse). The focus on the poorer households would
direct funds to where they would most likely be spent and also mollify those who
have felt that the dividend from the recent upswing eluded them. The existing system
of means-tested social benefits already identifies likely recipients.

•

Bringing forward the proposed reduction in social security contributions—by
increasing immediately the federal government contribution to the Health fund—
would reduce high labor tax rates and, while boosting sluggish private consumption,
also support potential growth.

•

Accelerating maintenance investment and infrastructure projects already in the
pipeline could significantly boost output and, therefore, confidence, but, as most
infrastructure investment is undertaken at the local level, these may require federal
top-up payments to municipalities.

•

In contrast, a value-added tax rate reduction would be less appropriate. Staff agreed
with the authorities that a VAT cut would be ineffective because it would raise policy
uncertainty by reversing the 2007 hike and it would counteract the long-term goal of
moving towards indirect taxation.

Though cautious about the efficacy of transfer payments, the authorities agreed that lowering
the social security contributions, and accelerating public infrastructure projects are sensible
measures, and could be part of a package, should one be needed at a later date. For the time
being, they will monitor the economic situation, and the effectiveness of the already
announced measures.

B. Ensuring Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability
40.
Sustainability of public finances requires a recommitment to a fiscal rule. The
authorities aim to amend the Basic Law to establish a rule that limits the structural budget
balance to close to zero from 2011. The importance of such a rule is even greater now that the
stimulus will add to the challenge of ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. The proposed
fiscal rule—which staff stressed should be applied also to the states—would provide the
mechanism to regain lost ground with ambitious initiatives to achieve fiscal sustainability as
the economy embarks on its recovery path. The authorities welcomed staff’s emphasis on this
principle. Reintroduction of a wealth tax, greater flexibility in the retirement age, and cost
efficiencies, especially in health care and fiscal decentralization, will need to be actively
considered.

28

41.
Despite the Agenda 2010 labor market and social security reforms, public
finances remain vulnerable. The authorities estimate that, under a benign scenario, public
sector debt could stabilize at about
10 percent of GDP. Staff projections—

42.
Further cost savings measures could be generated beyond the 2007 healthcare
reform. In particular, further rationalization could be achieved in pharmaceutical
expenditures. Also, incentives for efficiency-enhancing competition could be strengthened.
From 2009, a Health Fund, financed by the federal budget and individual contributions, will
allocate funds to insurers of the public health insurance system. In addition, the insured will
be required to pay fees directly to the insurers, of on average, five percent of the total
estimated costs for the year. While this set up provides some incentives to insurers to reduce
costs—because lower fees charged to the insured will attract more clients—it also creates
incentives to attract the healthier and wealthier. The OECD has suggested that alternative fee
structures may create stronger cost saving incentives. The authorities recognize that easing
the pressure of healthcare costs will continue to require new efforts.
43.
States need to contribute to fiscal consolidation. To date, states have added to the
accumulation of public debt. The cooperative system of uniform spending standards and
equalizing fiscal transfers, characterized by a high degree of revenue sharing by international
comparison, has muted incentives for fiscal discipline. In particular, states receiving net
transfers have engaged in pro-cyclical expenditure and delayed debt consolidation (Box 4).
Several reforms should be considered: (a) structural-deficit or expenditure-based fiscal rules
at the federal and state levels to strengthen fiscal discipline and reduce pro-cyclicality; (b) a
surveillance mechanism, based on consistent reporting standards; (c) increased state-level tax
autonomy to increase incentives for revenue collection and reduce dependence on supplementary federal grants. The authorities welcomed the staff’s support for a fiscal rule which
would help long-term fiscal sustainability. They agreed also that a broader federalism reform
would be desirable but did not see much scope for progress during this legislative period.

Box 4. Fiscal Discipline in Germany: A Federal Matter?
Germany’s arrangement for financing subnational spending stands out in two ways. First, subnational taxing autonomy is severely limited with own-source revenue accounting for less than 2 percent of total state revenue. Second, an extensive system of transfers ensures an almost complete (and
constitutionally mandated) equalization of resources across states. After initial stages of allocating joint
taxes and redistributing VAT, revenues are further equalized through horizontal transfers (totaling
0.3 percent of GDP in 2007), to which supplementary federal grants (totaling 0.6 percent of GDP in
2007) are added in a final stage.
Two main implications derive. First, strong reliance on transfers encourages states to spend without
due consideration for debt sustainability (the so-called ‘soft budget constraint’). In addition,
dependence on transfers to finance spending can result in pro-cyclical spending, especially in good
times.
Staff analysis confirms that reliance on transfers

Moreover, these states have pursued pro-cyclical
policies, particularly by raising expenditures in good times. Net contributing states, in contrast, have
ensured fiscal sustainability through expenditure adjustment and been less pro-cyclical.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Germany faces the prospect of a sizeable, and possibly extended, economic
downturn. Following GDP contraction in the second and third quarters of 2008, a further
four quarters of negative GDP growth and sluggish recovery thereafter appear likely. In 2009,
GDP is projected to fall by 0.8 percent and the 0.5 percent growth in 2010 would be well
below the potential of about 1½ percent. The risk is that corporate and financial sector
stresses, thus far dissociated from each other in Germany, may become more intertwined. The
longer the global shocks persist, the more severe and prolonged would be the weakness.
45.
Given strong spillovers, policy measures to contain the risk of a self-reinforcing
and costly slump will achieve more if coordinated internationally. Global impulses, felt
forcefully in Germany, are rapidly transmitted to other economies. A German economic
slowdown lowers growth in the rest of Europe, which feeds back to Germany, despite its
small competitiveness advantage. Moreover, a necessary reduction of German banks’
exposure to emerging markets would generate cascading spillovers. Thus, giving due
consideration to its domestic objectives, Germany stands to benefit from an internationally
coordinated approach to managing global risks.
•

In this regard, continued actions to strengthen the financial safety net will buttress the
recent initiatives. Germany’s request for an FSAP update is timely.

•

A similar risk-management philosophy should apply to fiscal policy.

46.
The Financial Market Stabilization Fund (FMSF), which has been vital to
shielding the financial sector, could be a stepping stone for broader financial reforms.
The German approach has differed from that in other countries: it is voluntary and banks may
choose from a range of stabilization measures. Given the low absolute level of capital in
several banks, a more proactive recapitalization is desirable, particularly in view of expected
asset quality deterioration. Moreover, SoFFin, the agency administering the FMSF, could use
its authority more broadly for enhancing the soundness of the financial sector.
•

The proactive restructuring and downsizing of the Landesbanken requires early
attention. SoFFin could fruitfully work with the Landesbanken in achieving this goal.

•

The authorities should possess the ability to act expeditiously under a special bank
resolution regime. A move in that direction has been made for bank recapitalizations
under SoFFin allowing dilution of shareholder rights. In this line, further
modifications of the legal framework for orderly bank resolutions are warranted.

47.
A critical element of the financial safety net, deposit protection should be
strengthened. The multiple protection schemes have typically relied on ex post burdensharing, which elevates risks in periods of stress. A base layer of mandatory deposit

31
insurance—ex ante funded by contributions from all banks—would provide unified terms of
protection for depositors and reduce incentives to shift deposits among the existing schemes.
Evolving European Union rules should provide guidance on policies related to deposit
insurance.
48.
The case for a tighter bank regulatory and supervisory process has become more
compelling. To respond promptly to problem situations, supervisors have a heightened need
for information on the current status of bank soundness. This implies, first, significantly
reduced reliance on external auditors. Additionally, prudential regulation and supervision
should be linked to a system of macro-surveillance and stability analysis. As such, greater
consolidation of regulatory and supervisory resources could yield significant benefits.
49.
Additional significant fiscal stimulus that is frontloaded, well targeted, and
internationally coordinated is necessary. Following sustained fiscal prudence, the
authorities have rightly taken steps to stimulate the economy. But their net size, timing, and
focus on bolstering private investment imply that the immediate benefit will be limited.
•

Bringing GDP growth to zero in 2009 would require a fiscal stimulus of 1½ to
2 percent of GDP. Such an effort would be particularly effective if German actions
were part of a joint European effort to bolster demand.

•

The German stimulus would likely be most effective if initiated by transfer payments
to vulnerable households (to impart an immediate demand impulse), followed by
bringing forward the proposed reduction in social security contributions (to lower
labor taxation) and accelerating infrastructure projects (possibly through top-up
federal payments to local communities). In contrast, a value-added tax rate reduction
would be less appropriate.

50.
These actions must be accompanied by a credible long-term commitment to
fiscal sustainability. This remains a concern, especially with regard to trends in healthcare
costs and the debt accumulation by the states.
•

Containing healthcare costs requires further rationalization of pharmaceutical
expenditures and strengthened efficiency-enhancing competition.

•

More states taxation autonomy and a redesign of supplementary federal grants are
required to improve states incentives for fiscal discipline.

•

The proposed fiscal rule, limiting the structural budget balance to close to zero,
should be applied also to the states, and would help regain lost ground and ensure
fiscal sustainability.

51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

*projected based on historical trend.
1/ Foreign claims include all international claims plus local claims of foreign affiliates in local currency.
The difference between the claims to all countries and the sum of mature and emerging market
exposures is due to offshore center exposures.
2/ BIS data is based on the consolidated lending statistic compiled by the Bundesbank (end-Sept. 2008).
3/ The data are derived from the "Groß- und Millionenkreditmeldung" stipulated in §§ 13 and
14 KWG (Credit Services Act). Under the Credit Services Act, debtors are obliged to register all loans (and other
credit-like obligations) of EUR 1.5 million or higher with the Bundesbank on a quarterly basis. In this context, the
definition of credit also included equity and counterparty risk exposure from credit default swaps (CDS).
Specific details on the obligation to register are stipulated in the Groß- und Millionenkreditverordnung
(GroMikV). Credit derivative exposures are recorded as off-shore transactions at their nominal value
if available, otherwise the book value applies. The presented data reflect gross amounts without
recognition of collateral.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted
for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with
the procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or
international security.
VIII.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

The authorities have moved towards a more risk-based approach, in which the intensity of
audits and inspections should reflect institutions' AML/CFT risk. A dialogue with the
associations of certified public accountants and other auditors has led to a revised AML/CFT
assessment methodology in 2005. Legal revisions also granted the BaFin the power to freeze
funds without a court order or other involvement of prosecution authorities if facts suggest
that funds serve the purpose of terrorist financing. BaFin can now also require financial
holding groups and financial conglomerates to develop a coordinated risk management
approach for the whole group. An assessment under the international standard for AML/CFT
will be conducted by the Fund's Legal Department in May 2009. The assessment will address,
amongst other matters, improvements of AML/CFT laws concerning non-bank financial
institutions and concerns surrounding remittance flows either through or from Germany to
allegedly fund terrorist activity.

ANNEX II. Germany: Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Germany has a full range of statistical
publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A
ROSC Data Module report was published in January 2006. The authorities make substantial
use of the Internet to facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics
generally follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and
definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the
sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service industries could be
improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important
contributor to short-term deviation in the trend GDP growth rate, is lacking. There is no
systematic, proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of
local units and products between rebases of the producer price index.
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government
finance and balance of payments statistics. However, although explanatory documentation
exists, differences between the general government data in the ESA95 classification and the
general government cash data on an administrative basis is impairing fiscal analysis;
Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and
balance on an accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and submits annual data for
publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format.
Monthly data are only disseminated on a cash-basis.
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). In 2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a
comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata.

GERMANY
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Marek Belka and Tamim Bayoumi
January 13, 2009

This supplement provides information on economic developments since the staff report was
issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Plummeting sentiments and orders have required a large downward revision in
GDP growth projections, especially for 2009. A much worse than anticipated fourth quarter
is estimated to bring growth in 2008
down to 1.3 percent, as against the

from -¾ percent.

2.
These revisions reflect an extraordinary drop in world trade and a sharp rise in
corporate stress. German exports are decelerating rapidly along with world trade. Corporate
stress is reflected in increasing bankruptcies and in corporate bond spreads, which shot up
after the failure of Lehman Brothers and have remained high despite easing in the credit and
money markets. Weakening world trade and corporate stress are feeding on each other
worldwide: Germany, with its high dependence on exports, is caught in that spiral. Domestic
consumption and investment can be expected to remain weak. The fiscal stimulus (including
the likely addition) will help prevent a further weakening of domestic demand, absent which
the 2009 outcome would have been dire.
3.
Recovery in 2010 is likely to be slow. Assuming that the fiscal stimulus plans—in
Germany and also in the United States and China—remain on schedule, they will help the
recovery. However, with the continued weakness in corporate balance sheets, the global

2
investment cycle is unlikely to resume with sufficient vigor for German exporters to see a
strong renewal in orders and for consumers to feel confident about their employment and
income prospects.
Global consensus forecasts for 2009 have been sharply
lowered.

Business assessments, especially
expectations have steadily declined.

The authorities have announced a significant increase in the fiscal stimulus.
Under a new package, as widely reported in the press, 50 billion euros are expected to be
spent over two years. The additional 0.9 percent of GDP envisaged for 2009 will bring the
total stimulus for this year to 1¼ of GDP (Text
Increase in General Government Deficit
Table). The Staff Report had recommended a

reduction in social security contributions is in
line with the recommendation of the Staff Report, as is the step up in public infrastructure
spending. The commuter subsidy and the cut in personal income tax rates are likely to be less
effective, in staff’s view. The total stimulus in 2010 will amount to 0.6 percent of GDP.
5.
Support by Soffin has provided stability to the financial system, but further
asset quality deterioration will imply continued need for such support. CDS spreads of
financial institutions are off their post-Lehman peaks. Bank lending has remained in positive
territory. Guarantees issued by Soffin will facilitate rollover of banks’ funding. But funding
conditions remain tight, as reflected in the Deutsche Bank decision to pay the penalty
required to extend a maturing obligation. Moreover, with deterioration in bank asset quality,
capital needs are likely to rise. Commerzbank recently required a second capital injection. In
this regard, regular financial reporting of FMSF transactions, including their approval status
by the European Commission, would provide transparency and bolster confidence. Finally,
the continuing need for support to Landesbanken remains a concern. The burden of this
support has appropriately fallen on the states, but the implication is that rationalization of
these financial institutions should be high priority.
CDS spreads of German financial institutions have been lower than
in other hot spots.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On January 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Germany. 1
Background
After robust growth in 2006 and 2007, real GDP slowed in 2008 and is now set to
decline sharply. World demand is decelerating and confidence indicators are
deteriorating. Financial market stress has spilled over into sentiment and the real
economy. The German consumer’s conservatism under the current uncertain conditions
will amplify the export slowdown and investment decisions are likely to be postponed. In
2008, GDP is projected to grow at 1.3 percent. An economic contraction of 2½ percent
is projected for 2009, followed by a slow recovery in 2010. The risks remain tilted to the
downside.
The financial market turbulence has exposed vulnerabilities in the German financial
system. Already in summer 2007, the failure of IKB and Sachsen LB required
government intervention. In the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers in Fall 2008,
confidence in the system was again threatened by the liquidity rollover requirements at
Hypo Real Estate. A public commitment to protect household deposits provided initial
stability. This was followed by a comprehensive package in mid-October 2008 to
support market liquidity and bank capitalization as part of a globally-coordinated effort.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

Fiscal consolidation in recent years along with growth in incomes and employment
during 2007 supported a balanced budget in 2008. In 2009 and 2010, however, the
deficit is expected to widen with a weakening economy and labor market. The
authorities’ stimulus package is expected to provide a needed impulse to domestic
demand, but will also increase the deficit. To address concerns with regard to long-term
fiscal sustainability, the authorities aim to introduce a deficit rule that would constrain the
structural fiscal balance to about zero. But more ambitious plans for fiscal federalism
reform have been postponed until 2019.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, in the past three months, Germany has come under
heightened pressure from the global economic and financial turmoil, reflecting the
economy’s high degree of openness and integration with the world economy. With the
sharp drop in world trade and continuing weakness in domestic demand, Germany
faces the prospect of a sizeable, and possibly extended, economic downturn. Corporate
and financial sector stresses in the German economy—thus far relatively dissociated
from each other—risk becoming more intertwined in the period ahead. Against this
background, Directors welcomed the recent initiatives by the German authorities to
strengthen significantly the financial safety net and to give valuable economic stimulus.
They recognized that the fundamentals of the German economy remain strong, and
applauded the sustained fiscal prudence of the last few years that has created the
needed room for a sizeable fiscal boost to the economy.
Directors welcomed the German authorities’ continuing priority to maintaining financial
stability and stabilizing the real economy. Global policy actions and measures to contain
the risk of a costly global self-reinforcing slump should preferably be coordinated
regionally and internationally for maximum effect. Germany has a special leadership
role to play in this process, given the size of its economy and the substantial spillovers
into and from Germany.
Directors noted that the global financial crisis has highlighted important vulnerabilities of
the German financial system, which could be intensified by the economic slowdown in
Germany. They welcomed the authorities’ decisive response, noting in particular the
creation of the Financial Market Stabilization Fund (FMSF) as vital to shielding the
financial sector. A number of guarantees have been issued, which will help banks meet
their short-term funding needs. Directors also welcomed the efforts to buttress capital
positions. Given the low level of capital in several banks, further recapitalization may be
desirable in view of expected asset quality deterioration. Directors also recommended
that the agency administering the FMSF use its authority more broadly for enhancing
the soundness of the financial sector. In particular, Directors called for a proactive
restructuring and downsizing of the Landesbanken, which are a continuing drain on
public finances and a threat to financial stability.
Directors called for strengthened deposit insurance, a critical element of the financial
safety net, given the risks associated with the existing multiple protection schemes that
have typically relied on ex post burden-sharing. A base layer of mandatory deposit
insurance—ex ante funded by contributions from all banks—would provide unified terms

3

of protection for depositors and reduce incentives to shift deposits among the existing
schemes. The evolving European Union rules should provide guidance on coverage
limits.
Directors observed that the case for a tighter bank regulatory and supervisory process
has become more compelling. To respond promptly to problem situations, the
authorities were encouraged to place greater reliance on timely supervisory
assessments independently of the banks’ annual external audit cycle, and to link
prudential regulation and supervision to a system of macro-surveillance and stability
analysis. In this context, greater consolidation of regulatory and supervisory resources
could yield significant benefits.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ conjunctural fiscal stimulus packages in the past
four months aimed at supporting domestic demand and guarding against cumulating the
drop in consumer and business confidence. They considered these packages timely.
Directors welcomed in particular the significant impetus offered by the latest package.
Among the components of the package, they noted that the accelerated reduction in
social security contributions and the step up of spending on infrastructure projects are
well-targeted and likely to provide both short-term stimulus and lasting benefits.
Directors acknowledged the complexity of judging precisely the degree of optimal fiscal
impulse when the global situation is in rapid flux, often in unexpected ways. In view of
the sizeable recent deterioration in economic prospects and given Germany’s
fundamentally strong fiscal position, a number of Directors would have favored an even
more proactive stimulus. A number of others, however, supported the authorities’
considered approach of maintaining equal emphasis on discretionary measures to spur
the economy and adhering to fiscal prudence. All Directors welcomed the authorities’
reiteration of their commitment to medium-term fiscal sustainability, which will be crucial
for ensuring the long-term credibility of public finances in accordance with the Stability
and Growth Pact.
Directors noted that trends in healthcare costs and debt accumulation by the states
remain a concern. Further rationalization of pharmaceutical expenditures and
strengthened efficiency-enhancing competition remain attractive avenues for containing
healthcare costs. Directors noted the possible benefits from more state tax autonomy
and a redesign of supplementary federal grants to improve states’ incentives for fiscal
discipline. They welcomed the proposed fiscal rule limiting the structural budget balance
to close to zero, and recommended that it be applied also to the states.

Statement by Klaus-Dieter Stein, Executive Director for Germany
January 9, 2009
We would like to thank the staff for a concise and focused report which offers a balanced
reflection of what my authorities considered to be a very constructive and candid
dialogue during the consultations.
We broadly share staff’s assessment that the environment for conducting economic and
fiscal policy has become extremely challenging given the worsening of economic
indicators as the financial crisis spills over to the real ecnomy. However, employment
and real disposable income have expanded in Germany almost up to the end of 2008 as
some key elements which have triggered and reinforced the crisis of the global economy
have not featured highly in the past course of the German economy: housing prices
remained stable in recent years, predominantly deposit-based financing of lending, low
exposure of pension system to capital market developments, low debt ratios of corporates
and households. To be clear, however, my authorities have and will act forcefully to the
abrupt change in economic conditions. Essentially, this crisis will be temporary and the
crisis response of the German government is being carefully framed in order to protect
the economy from harm, yet not foregoing the commitment to credible economic and
fiscal policies based on sound principles which my authorities deem crucial to master the
long-term budgetary challenges and to maintain confidence in a sustainable fiscal policy.
Economic Situation
Highly integrated in the world and European economies, Germany faces severe
strains from a global demand shock as the financial crisis leaves its marks on the
real economy. The economy has entered a recession in 2008 and GDP is likely to
contract sharply in 2009 as production will continue to decline following a reversal in
export demand. Revised growth forecasts of major economic research institutes range
between 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent for real GDP growth in 2008 and between -2.7
percent and -1.2 percent for 2009. For 2010 the economy is expected to gradually
stabilize. The government will issue a revised official growth forecast on 21 January.
The high degree of uncertainty at the current juncture notwithstanding, my
authorities consider the fundamentals of the German economy as still being
reasonably strong. The corporate sector has in recent years moved forward with consolidation of balance sheets and the maintenance of strong cash-flows while pricecompetitiveness has been favorable. Thanks to higher wage growth and a turnaround in

2

commodity prices, aggregate demand conditions have been upheld. Nevertheless,
domestic demand will not be able to make up for the drastic drop in German firms’
foreign order volume – identified as the primary shock and principle source of the current
slowdown.
Although the private sector has until recently resisted the economic downturn, a
significant fall in demand for capital investment goods and tighter credit conditions
will leave their mark. A credit crunch triggered by financing shortfalls in the banking
sector is however unlikely at the current juncture. Nevertheless, corporate sector
investments will be scaled back significantly given lower capacity utilization, revised
profit forecasts and more restrictive financing conditions as corporate bond spreads have
increased.
My authorities concur with staff that business sentiment has been deteriorating
more rapidly than in previous downturns. Yet, they emphasize that the danger of selffulfilling pessimistic expectations is clearly prevalent. Against this background,
“proactive” projections are to be avoided as indicators more directly mirroring real
developments draw a more benign picture. For example, in October, industrial capacity
utilization was still slightly above its long-term average. Furthermore, the projected
decline in the output gap is not exceptionally strong compared with the previous
downturn.
Financial sector
The current situation in the financial sector remains strained. Interbankmarkets are
still not functioning properly and confidence is still lacking. The profit situation of
financial institutions remains depressed by the high losses ascribed to structured and
other products, and falling interest margins. Yet, an important segment of the market has
based its business model mainly on deposits and is therefore more shielded against the
risks of the wholesale market. Overall, financial sector stress is nevertheless expected to
persist for the next quarters as the economy is not likely to recover before 2010.
The government has responded speedily and decisively to the financial crisis. The
new financial market stabilization law has been implemented rapidly and the stabilization
fund (Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung - SoFFin) is increasingly used by banks.
From the start, the financial rescue package has had a dual approach aimed at promoting
liquidity and solvency. In order to eliminate liquidity shortages and to support
refinancing in the capital markets, SoFFin has been authorized to guarantee newly issued
refinancing instruments. The Fund may also recapitalize financial institutions, in
particular through the purchase of shares or silent participations. With the option of

3

acquiring problematic assets, it can also improve capital ratios. At present, 95 bn euros of
guarantees are committed (out of an overall envelope of 400 bn euros) and 8.2 bn euros
in recapitalization support (out of maximum envelope of 80 bn euros).
The central principle of SoFFin – its balanced focus and voluntary participation –
has so far proven adequate. The originally feared stigmatization of participating
institutions cannot be confirmed. The principle of voluntary participation ensures that
primarily the owners are accountable for the solution of individual problems of their
institutions. SoFFin is only intervening on a subsidiary basis. In fact, several banks
managed a recapitalization on their own without using the recapitalization credit line of
SoFFin. In 2009, a new asset-class will be established (government-guaranteed bank
bonds) clearly improving incentives for banks to participate in SoFFin.
My authorities share staff’s recommendation to move forward with the
restructuring of the Landesbanken. They consider that substantial reform including a
downsizing and the development of a viable business model is needed. State governments
have indicated that they would like to preserve their decision autonomy with respect to
the future role of their institutions. The institutions concerned have also already
considered various options by themselves.
My authorities consider the German bank resolution framework as broadly
adequate. Section 46b of the Banking Act provides the possibility to (i) issue a ban on
sales and payments by the concerned institution and (ii) prohibit the acceptance of
payments not intended for the discharge of debts to the institution (moratorium).
Objections by the institutions (and their shareholders) have in principle no postponing
effect. This moratorium allows the supervisor, shareholders, and other stakeholders to
negotiate a rescue plan. Therefore, my authorities consider that BaFin as the supervisor
has sufficient instruments at hand to deal with a quickly evolving problem situation in an
institution.
As to supervision, the revised guideline governing the respective responsibilities of
BaFin and the Bundesbank ensures the clear division of labor in the field of banking
supervision in Germany. Cooperation during the recent financial crisis has proven to be
efficient. The division of responsibilities ensures on the one hand that the Bundesbank
has access to all supervisory information. On the other hand, synergies from banking
supervision and monetary policies can be gained without questioning the independence of
the Bundesbank.
Fiscal policy

4

The German government is fully committed to the rules of the Stability and Growth
Pact at EU level. This pact provides the framework under normal circumstances to
achieve and maintain a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus. For
exceptional circumstances, it provides the budgetary space to weather any economic
downturn, in the first place through the full operation of automatic stabilizers and, if
needed, also through additional fiscal policy measures.
EU level coordination of additional fiscal policy measures requires primarily a
common understanding on the application of the Pact at the current juncture –
given the exceptional circumstances. In light of the unusual degree of uncertainty about
the impact of any specific measures, it is crucial to give due account of countries’
individual circumstances. For my authorities, structural consolidation of public budgets
remains the key objective given the challenges to long-term sustainability of public
finances. Framing short-term (temporary) policy responses accordingly will avoid putting
hard-won structural consolidation at risk. This is crucial for confidence-building
underpinning that policies are viable to guarantee sound public finances in the monetary
union.
The government has responded to the global economic slowdown speedily and
decisively with an important fiscal stimulus package - which is already in effect designed to secure growth and employment. The package adopted by the Cabinet on 7
October and 5 November 2008 predominantly contains growth-oriented measures that
can be implemented in a timely manner. The objective is to create strong stimuli for
private and public-sector investments, inter alia by investment funding to SMEs, tax
incentives, targeted support to families and infrastructure investment. Furthermore, the
Federal Constitutional Court has reinstated the commuting allowance (tax subsidy) which
has an additional stimulus effect. The total volume of both, the package and the
commuting allowance in 2009 and 2010 will amount to approximately 40 bn euros (or
over 1 ½ percent of GDP).
My authorities underline that the decisive factor with regard to actually stimulating
economic activity is not solely the level of public sector spending, but the economic
impact of the measures adopted. The high degree of uncertainty on the impact of
specific policies notwithstanding, the measures adopted by the federal government are
targeted and will mainly remain in effect for a limited time only, while having a lasting
impact. In the coming years, some measures of the package will facilitate investments
and orders from enterprises, private households and regional and municipal governments.
The measures will cost 11 bn euros in two years but are expected to trigger 50 bn euros in
private investment. An additional fiscal stimulus package is currently under
consideration.

5

My authorities emphasize that a short-term fiscal spending strategy - without
ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability - may not deliver the effectiveness
wished for. A loss of confidence in fiscal sustainability would significantly aggravate the
crisis. The government is considering the implementation of a new constitutional fiscal
rule which would ensure a compensation of short-term discretionary fiscal policy
measures in the next upswing. My authorities explicitly welcome the staff’s assessment
on the usefulness of such a rule which is currently being discussed in the Federalism
Commission II.
Furthermore, my authorities welcome the staff’s recommendation for a new
preventive budget surveillance mechanism. To this end, my authorities have
recommended the establishment of a stability council. On the other hand, staff
recommends that fiscal rules at the level of individual states need to be altered to ensure
greater tax autonomy and to avoid pro-cyclical expenditure behavior at state level. My
authorities are more cautious to these recommendations as, (i) the expenditure
fluctuations of individual states would be higher without the federal financial
equalization and (ii) the revenue base, in particular between east and west German states,
is very different so that more tax autonomy would reinforce revenue shortfalls and render
budget consolidation in the end more difficult.
Structural Reform
The structural position of the German economy remains sound, but reform
challenges remain. German economic policy has – over the recent years preceding the
crisis – been targeted (i) at further increasing trend growth and implementing policy
responses to the challenges posed by population ageing, while (ii) at the same time
anchoring reforms in a sufficiently broad consensus balancing efficiency considerations
with social security concerns. The strategy has served Germany well and will remain
valid over the medium-term. Going forward, the government will advance further
reforms in the health care sector as cost-saving measures and efficiency-enhancing
competition in the health care system are important to ensure sustainable public finances.
Continual effects of previous growth-oriented structural reforms. The structural
reform measures referred to in the context of last year’s Article IV consultation, the
business tax reform and the significant reduction of contribution rates to unemployment
insurance result in the coming years in a relief for enterprises and individuals of well
above 1 percent of GDP per annum. In addition, federal budget spending for research and
development will continue to increase in 2009 and 2010.
