REPUBLIC OF PALAU
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 24, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has recovered strongly from the 2008–09 downturn, led by
a rebound in tourist arrivals. An overarching challenge for Palau is to achieve selfsufficiency when the renewed Compact grants expire in FY2024.
Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to be favorable at 3 percent in FY2012 and
average 2 percent over the medium term. But the outlook is clouded by an unsettled
global environment and downside risks dominate. Highly dependent on tourism, imports
of food and fuel, and foreign aid, Palau remains vulnerable to external headwinds and
has limited policy space to counter these risks.
Fiscal sustainability. The authorities have made commendable efforts to reduce the
current fiscal deficit (excluding grants) markedly during FY2010–11, but the deficit
remains sizable. For FY2012, a reduction of 2 percent of GDP in the deficit is advisable,
given the positive near-term outlook and the need to boost government cash reserves.
Beyond FY2012, an average annual consolidation of 1½ percent of GDP through the rest
of the decade is needed to achieve fiscal sustainability. This would require
comprehensive tax reform and sizable reductions in wage bill and subsidies.
Public financial management. Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to implement
a medium-term budget framework in FY2013. There is also considerable scope to further
strengthen budget execution and cash management.
Financial sector. The banking system remains sound and the Financial Institutions
Commission (FIC) has made welcome progress in strengthening banking supervision. To
safeguard stability, a priority is to bring non-bank financial institutions, including the
National Development Bank, under the FIC’s oversight.
Private sector development. A vibrant private sector is key to complementing the
needed fiscal consolidation. Further efforts to promote private sector development are
advisable.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1. One of the smallest Pacific island
countries, Palau depends on tourism and
foreign aid for its livelihood (Figure 1).
Annual tourism receipts amount to about
50 percent of GDP. Grants, in particular under
the Compact Agreement with the United
States, averaged 25 percent of GDP during the
last decade. However, renewed Compact grant
assistance is set to end in FY2024.1 Palau is on
track to meet Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015. General elections are due in
November 2012.

2.

An overarching challenge for Palau is
to achieve self-sufficiency when the
renewed Compact grants wind down.
Against this background, the 2012 Article IV

discussions focused on policies to achieve
fiscal sustainability, improve public financial
management, strengthen the financial sector,
and promote private sector development.
3. The authorities have been responsive
to the Fund’s advice. During the past two
fiscal years, they have tightened government
spending and achieved fiscal adjustment in
line with the Fund’s recommendation. They
have also made efforts to strengthen the
budget process and improve the business
climate. The Financial Institutions Commission
(FIC) has continued to build up its supervisory
capacity and strengthen bank oversight.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
4. The economy has recovered strongly
from the 2008–09 downturn. Real GDP
growth is estimated to have reached about
6 percent in FY2011 (Table 1). This was driven
by a 25 percent increase in tourist arrivals,
surpassing pre-crisis levels (Box 1). Annual
inflation increased from 1½ percent during
2009–10 to 3½ percent in 2011, due to a sharp
rise in food and fuel prices during the first half
of the year.
5. The fiscal position has improved
markedly, but the deficit remains sizable at
14 percent of GDP. Thanks to spending
restraint and economic recovery, the current
fiscal deficit (excluding grants) declined
cumulatively by 3½ percent of GDP during the
past two fiscal years (Table 2 and Figure 2).

________________________________
1

The renewed agreement for FY2010–24 is pending
U.S. Congressional approval.

Nevertheless, government cash reserves stood
at only US$7 million (about one and a half
months of government spending), while arrears
amounted to about US$15 million (7 percent of
GDP) at end-FY2011.
6. The rebound in tourist arrivals led to an
improvement in the external position. The
current account deficit (excluding grants)
declined to 11 percent of GDP in FY2011,
despite a rise in imports from higher
commodity prices (Table 3 and Figure 3). FDI
flows have remained subdued. The Compact
Trust Fund balance has stabilized at around
US$150 million, albeit still 15 percent below its
pre-crisis peak.

B. Outlook and Risks
7. The recovery will likely continue in the
near term, supported by new scheduled
flights and hotel construction. The economy
is projected to grow by 3 percent in FY2012
and average 2 percent over the next few years,
with expansion in the tourism sector offsetting
the expected fiscal consolidation (Table 4).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

PALAU

Barring a spike in global commodity prices,
inflation is expected to stay around 2 percent
over the medium term.
8. Downside risks dominate and mainly
stem from external factors. If a severe
downturn spreads to Asia, the main tourist
source region for Palau, the tourism sector
could take a big hit (Box 1). This would have
significant adverse effects on broader economic
activity. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar amid
heightened risk aversion could also reduce
Palau’s external competitiveness and further
affect the tourism sector. Although the renewed
Compact grants are unlikely to be affected,
other aid flows may be delayed as donors face
tighter
finances.
Given
Palau’s
heavy
dependence on imports, a sharp rise in food
and fuel prices could depress domestic demand
and weaken both the fiscal and external
positions. Finally, while losses in Palau’s
overseas investments, notably the Compact

Trust Fund, would not have an immediate fiscal
impact, 2 larger fiscal adjustments may be
required over time to achieve sustainability.
Given the sizable fiscal deficit and the absence
of monetary and exchange rate policies, Palau
has very limited policy space to counter these
risks. In a downside scenario, Palau may need
to seek concessional external assistance.

Authorities’ Views
9. The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment of the economic prospects and
risks. They were particularly concerned about
the impact of higher fuel prices on Palau’s
inflation and fiscal position. They concurred
that Palau may have to seek concessional
external assistance in the event of large
negative shocks.

2

Budget withdrawals from the Compact Trust Fund are
specified under the Compact Agreement and have
been US$5 million annually. The Fund is invested in
U.S. equities (65 percent) and bonds (35 percent).

Box 1. Palau’s Tourism Sector
Tourism contributes considerably to the economy of Palau, one of the world’s top diving
destinations. Travel receipts amount to about 50 percent of GDP, more than twice the Pacific island
average and among the highest in the world. Tourism is also a main source of growth in Palau, through
employment generation and spillover to broader economic activity. A one percentage point increase in
the growth rate of tourist arrivals is estimated to raise real GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points on
average.

Visitors from Japan and Taiwan Province of China
account for the bulk of tourist arrivals. In contrast,
other Pacific island economies, such as Fiji and
Vanuatu are dominated by tourists from Australia
and New Zealand. During the last decade, visitors
from Korea and Taiwan Province of China to Palau
have risen sharply, while tourists from Japan remain
an important source. Tourists from other Asian
markets such as China have also grown rapidly
during the last two years, albeit from a very low
base.

Global economic and financial conditions have
profound implications on tourist arrivals and growth in Palau. Palau’s visitor arrivals were hit hard
during the recent downturn, suffering a cumulative decline of about 20 percent over the period FY2008–09.
Tourist arrivals have since rebounded—reflecting the global recovery, more scheduled flights,
strengthened marketing, and the U.S. dollar’s weakness relative to Asian currencies—and capacity
constraints in the tourism sector are emerging. The literature on tourism suggests that tourist arrivals to
small island countries are affected by economic developments in source countries, price considerations,
external shocks, and supply factors, such as foreign direct investment and airlines services. Going forward,
Palau’s tourism sector could benefit from further efforts to improve the business climate and attract more
investment. Preserving Palau’s pristine environment will also go a long way toward ensuring sustainable
development of the tourism sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
10. Palau needs sizable adjustment to
achieve long-term fiscal sustainability.
When the renewed Compact grants expire in
FY2024, government expense will need to be
financed mainly by domestic revenue and
withdrawals from the Compact Trust Fund. To
prevent a sharp correction in spending or a
depletion of the Compact Trust Fund, an
average annual reduction in the current fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) of 1½ percent of
GDP through FY2019 is warranted (Appendix
I). This would lead to a sustainable deficit of
3 percent of GDP and almost double
government net worth (largely the Compact
Trust Fund) to 90 percent of GDP, which will
provide a sustainable source of financing
going forward.

necessary and feasible, given the positive
near-term outlook and the need to boost
government cash reserves. This would raise
cash reserves or reduce arrears by about
US$1 million. Revenue windfalls should be
saved. In a downside scenario, there is only
limited room to lower the size of adjustment,
given the large deficit and the need for fiscal
sustainability.
 Ahead
of
concerted
efforts
on
comprehensive tax reform (see below), staff
supported the initial proposal to hike the
hotel room tax from 10 to 15 percent, while
allowing needed preparation time. Staff
also encouraged quick implementation of
the green fee increase. Additional measures
should include raising water tariffs as
scheduled and continuing to strengthen
revenue
administration
(including
upgrading the IT system), with assistance
from the Pacific Financial Technical
Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Altogether,
these measures are estimated to lead to
revenue gains of ½ percent of GDP relative
to FY2011.

11. Staff analysis of the draft FY2012
budget under deliberation suggests no
adjustment. 3 The latest budget draft
proposed to hike the hotel room tax from
10 to 12 percent (compared to the
government’s initial proposal of 15 percent)
and raise the environment protection fee
(i.e., green fee), with implementation set
toward the end of the fiscal year. While the
draft kept nominal current expenditure (i.e.,
expense) broadly unchanged from last year, a
likely supplemental budget could raise annual
expenditure growth to about 5 percent. If no
additional revenue measures are enacted,
staff projects the current deficit to remain
unchanged. Financing the deficit could
considerably reduce the government’s cash
reserves.

 Staff advised capping expense at FY2011
levels, resulting in a reduction of
1½ percent of GDP. The reduction would
require prioritizing spending among all
government arms and agencies on the
national budget, given the needed transfer
of US$1.2 million to the Palau Public
Utilities Corporation (PPUC) following a
major fire. In light of a public wage bill out
of line with peers, staff encouraged the
authorities to reduce the number of
temporary workers and continue to freeze
hiring, enforce mandatory retirement, and
allow only incremental salary increases. 4
There is also scope to cut goods and
services, particularly operational costs, and
government transfers (excluding the oneoff transfer to the PPUC), while protecting

12. Staff recommended a reduction in the
current deficit of 2 percent of GDP in
FY2012 relative to FY2011. The reduction is

targeted social spending to low-income
households.

 More than half of Palau’s domestic budget
(including only the Compact budget
assistance) is spent on wages and salaries,
which is unsustainable as the Compact
assistance winds down. Palau’s public wage
bill also exceeds the average of nonCompact Pacific island countries by about
4 percent of GDP. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that the average public sector
wage is higher than that of workers with
similar skills in the private sector. With
assistance from development partners, civil
service reform in a phased manner is
needed to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services while
reducing the wage bill. However, this
process will need to be carefully planned
and managed to minimize adverse social
impact. With assistance from the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB), commercializing
water and sewage services as planned and
outsourcing certain government functions
are also vital for achieving a sustained
reduction in expenditure.

13. Beyond FY2012, Palau needs to
embark on comprehensive revenue and
expenditure reforms. These reforms are
essential for resolving long-standing fiscal
imbalances and achieving the needed
adjustment of 7½ percent of GDP over the
next 5 years.
 At only 14½ percent of GDP, Palau’s tax
revenue is among the lowest in the Pacific.
Staff advised the authorities to continue
improving
revenue
administration,
eliminate import duty exemptions, and
move to cost, insurance, and freight (CIF)
evaluation for imports. These measures
could be implemented relatively quickly
and yield gains of 2–3 percent of GDP.
 Comprehensive tax reform is long overdue.
The current inefficient system needs to be
overhauled, replacing the gross revenue tax
with a corporate income tax and moving
from taxing imports to consumption, by
introducing for example a value-added tax
(VAT) of 10–15 percent. These measures
could potentially raise revenue by
1-2 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Consideration should be given to initiating
efforts soon to build a national consensus
on tax reform.

14. Staff welcomed the government’s
efforts to clear arrears in a transparent and
prioritized manner. At end-FY2011, the bulk
of government arrears (defined as accounts
payable) were payments owed to other public
entities, with arrears to private businesses at
about US$2 million (1 percent of GDP). Staff
welcomed the settlement of US$3.2 million
arrears to the PPUC in early 2012 and
supported the plan to use part of the AsDB
loan to pay down arrears.5 Discussions have
also been underway on how to use arrears
clearance grants under the renewed Compact
agreement. Staff stressed that improving the
budget process is critical in preventing new
arrears.
15. Weak budget planning and execution
as well as the lack of fiscal space are at the
root of long-standing arrears. The
government has made revenue projections

The loan of US$16 million is for commercializing

percent of GDP in FY2013 due to a full-year effect.

PALAU

more realistic in budget proposals, but the
projections are sometimes inflated during
deliberation. Moreover, final approved
budgets often do not take into account all
obligations, such as grant co-payments and
arrears clearance. Budget execution is based
on appropriations rather than cash availability,
resulting in the drawdown of cash reserves
and/or the accumulation of arrears. The use of
supplemental budgets to increase spending
has also weakened budget credibility. Palau’s
structural fiscal issue (low tax revenue and
high wage bill) and the lack of consensus on
how to resolve it place additional pressure on
the budget process.
16. A medium-term budget framework
(MTBF) and better cash management
would help the budget process. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
implement an MTBF in FY2013, with
assistance from the AsDB. The MTBF would
entail a more comprehensive and realistic
approach consistent with a sound fiscal policy
strategy,
thereby
enhancing
budget
credibility. To prioritize spending, the MTBF
would need to involve all government arms
and agencies on the national budget. Staff
also emphasized the importance of cash
planning and spending controls. A priority is
to make budget execution contingent on cash
availability.
Establishment
of
a
cash
management committee could also help
ensure transparent cash allocations based on
spending priorities.
17. Staff welcomed ongoing efforts to
reform government-owned utilities. With
assistance from the AsDB, progress has been
made in commercializing water and sewage
services. Water tariffs should continue to be
raised as scheduled so as to achieve cost
recovery by FY2016. Electricity tariffs have
been charged at below cost recovery levels,
reducing incentives for energy conservation
and contributing to maintenance shortfalls
and the PPUC’s financial challenges. Staff
encouraged timely implementation of the
new tariff structure, which will reduce
subsidies to middle to high-income

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

households and increase tariffs to cost
recovery levels. 6 Doing so could also lower
Palau’s reliance on fuel imports and reduce
external vulnerability.
18. Palau’s Civil Service Pension Fund
(CSPF) and Social Security Fund face large
unfunded liabilities, last estimated at
about US$130 million (60 percent of GDP).
In particular, the CSPF has been running
negative cash flows since 2000 and is
expected to deplete its reserves within ten
years. To put both plans back on a viable
path, staff advised the authorities to seek
technical assistance and adopt measures early
on,
including
increasing
employee
contributions, raising the social security
entitlement age, adjusting the benefit
structure, and moving to a definedcontribution scheme.
19. An
effective
fiscal
and
legal
framework centered on a petroleum fund
is essential for managing potential oil and
gas revenue. With assistance from the World
Bank, the National Petroleum Revenue
Management and Sharing Act and the
Petroleum Act were recently passed. Given
the large uncertainty associated with the
timing and size of petroleum revenue, staff
supported the authorities’ decision that it is
too early to factor in such revenue when
deriving fiscal adjustment needs.

Authorities’ Views
20. The
authorities
reiterated
their
commitment
to
achieving
fiscal
sustainability. They noted that it was
important to get all stakeholders on board a
comprehensive tax reform, which could take
time. The authorities also acknowledged the

Inflationary and social impacts are expected to be
limited, as the bulk of adjustment comes from a
reduction in the threshold for subsidized household
tariffs. Electricity tariffs for businesses and low-income
households will increase only slightly, while water and

expected to have much impact on their monthly
expenditure.

PALAU

need for public sector rationalization, but
underscored its political difficulty.
21. The
authorities
pointed
to
improvements in the budget process in
recent years. Revenue projections have
become more realistic. The authorities were
keen to implement a medium-term budget
framework in FY2013. They noted that the
substantial arrears built up over the last
decade would require some years to clear.
Incoming cash is used to pay down arrears to
ensure continued service delivery, keeping
cash reserves thin while generating new

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

arrears. In their view, the US$10 million
Compact assistance earmarked for arrears
clearance is key to improving the budget
process.
22. The authorities were mindful of the
need to ensure the sustainability of the
pension funds. They have been seriously
considering converting the CSPF from a
defined-benefit to a defined-contribution
scheme. An actuarial study of the CSPF will be
conducted soon, which will help them make
an informed decision, including whether
additional measures are warranted.

B. Financial Sector
23. The overall banking system remains
sound. Banks are liquid and profitable, but
provide limited credit to the private sector.
The presence of FDIC-insured U.S. banks helps
mitigate risks to the financial sector. Three
U.S. bank branches hold about 90 percent of
total assets and 95 percent of total deposits,
and have a non-performing loan ratio of less
than 1 percent. Palau’s domestic banks are
relatively weak, with an average nonperforming loan ratio of 40 percent. This
largely reflects their operational weaknesses
and business models of a small deposit base
and more risky lending. Nevertheless,
domestic banks maintain adequate provisions
and do not pose a systemic risk to overall
financial stability due to their small size (about
3 percent of total bank assets).7
24. Staff commended the FIC’s proactive
approach
to
bank
regulation
and
supervision. The well-funded FIC has
strengthened its capacity to conduct on-site
examinations. It also implemented a new
7

One domestic bank voluntarily ceased deposittaking activity and transitioned into a finance
company in late 2011. Due to limited business
activity, the only uninsured foreign bank branch also
notified the FIC of its decision to cease operations in
Palau in 2012. Both banks are monitored and
inspected by the FIC throughout the closure process.
The number of banks in Palau will be reduced to
5, including 3 FDIC-insured U.S. bank branches and
2 domestic banks.

off-site monitoring program and submitted
Palau’s first annual banking report to
Congress in 2010. Staff supported the FIC’s
efforts to further strengthen capacity,
particularly regarding the supervision of
problem banks and conducting in-depth
analysis. Domestic banks need to continue
strengthening lending policies and writing off
bad loans. As an independent and wellfunctioning FIC is crucial to sound supervision,
the remaining vacancy on the FIC Board
should be filled quickly with a qualified
candidate.
25. Oversight of non-bank financial
institutions needs to be strengthened. A
priority is for the FIC to have the mandate to
supervise the government-owned National
Development Bank. Although the bank does
not take deposits, its lending activities have
implications for overall financial stability. It is
the only residential mortgage lender and the
largest commercial lender in Palau, with assets
amounting to ¼ of total banking sector
assets. Although currently small, potential
fiscal risks could also arise from the bank’s
loan guarantees. Regarding other non-banks
such as finance companies, while anecdotal
evidence suggests that these institutions are
small, the lack of information and inadequate
supervision do not allow proper assessment
of their potential risks. Staff advised that these
non-banks also be brought under the
oversight of the FIC, the only institution in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PALAU

Palau with the ability to conduct financial
supervision. The FIC will need to be equipped
with adequate resources should its mandate
be expanded to non-banks.
26. Staff welcomed continued efforts in
anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). An
amendment to the AML legislation has been
sent to the Office of President and takes on
many of the recommendations contained in
the 2008 AML/CFT assessment report. The
Financial Intelligence Unit has also continued
to build up its ability to conduct examinations.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue
their efforts to align the AML/CFT regime with
the 2008 recommendations and to ensure its
effective implementation.

Authorities’ Views
27. The authorities saw merits in bringing
non-bank financial institutions under the
FIC’s oversight. They would like to study the
cost and benefit before making a final
decision. With continued capacity building
and adequate resources, the FIC expected to
be able to fulfill a mandate expanded to nonbanks. There was some concern in Congress
that too strict regulation and supervision may
put local financial institutions at a
disadvantage. The authorities agreed that an
effective FIC is essential for sound supervision
and would fill the remaining FIC Board
vacancy soon.

28. Blessed with natural beauty and
located close to fast-growing Asian
markets, Palau has great potential to
further develop a vibrant private sector.
Palau lags behind many of its peers in the
World Bank’s ease of doing business
indicators. According to the AsDB, key
obstacles include a restrictive FDI regime,
foreign labor regulations that distort hiring
practices, complex and opaque licensing
arrangements, the lack of secured access to
land, as well as inadequate access to bank
credit. Foreign companies face minimum
investment requirements and are subject to
restrictions on the type of business activities.
They are also required to pay higher foreign
worker fee than domestic companies and to
employ a minimum share of Palauan
employees while domestic businesses are not.
These distortions create incentives for front
businesses (foreign companies with a Palauan
as a front). Foreign workers have a lower
minimum wage than Palauans, likely
contributing to higher unemployment among
Palauans. Regarding land, obtaining leases
can be a long and burdensome process for
foreign investors and titles can be contested.
Finally, due to high credit risks and limited
domestic investment opportunities, banks

place most of their assets abroad and provide
limited credit to the private sector.
29. Staff discussed a range of measures to
promote private sector-led growth in the
face of needed fiscal adjustment. The type
of business activities could be managed
through licensing arrangements rather than
the source of capital (foreign or domestic). On
labor regulations, consideration needs to be
given to unifying the minimum wage for
foreign and domestic labor, applying the
same foreign worker fee for foreign and
domestic employers, and controlling foreign
worker inflows through the foreign worker fee
instead of quotas. Staff advised the
authorities
to
establish
a
one-stop

PALAU

arrangement
for
state
and
national
investment licensing requirements. There is
also a need to make land leases precedent
over a change in title to provide greater legal
security for investors. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the legal
framework for movable collateral and
encouraged timely passage of the secured
transaction legislation, which will help
improve access to bank credit.
Authorities’ Views
30. The authorities also viewed private
sector development as a key complement
to fiscal consolidation. They agreed in

principle with many of staff’s recommendations
and pointed to recent progress in making
Palau more business friendly, including
regulatory improvement to the FDI regime
and simplification of the approval process by
individual
government
agencies.
The
authorities noted the difficulty in building
a national consensus on land and labor
reforms. They underscored the importance of
preserving Palau’s cultural and social identity
while attracting foreign investment and labor.
The government supported the secured
transaction legislation and anticipated its
passage through Congress soon.

D. External Stability

33. Continued fiscal consolidation is
crucial
for
sustaining
external
stability. Risks to external stability are limited
in the near term, given Palau’s external debt
of about 35 percent of GDP and large
financial assets. Over the longer term,
insufficient fiscal adjustment in the context of

32. The economy has maintained external
competitiveness and stability. Palau’s real
effective exchange rate is in line with longterm average. During the last decade, tourist
arrivals to Palau grew by 7 percent per year,
compared to an average of 2½ percent in
other Pacific island countries. Furthermore,
the renewed Compact assistance is expected
to continue providing a relatively stable
source of funding over the medium term,
while fiscal adjustments will improve the
current account balance (excluding grants).
A decline in grants could also improve the
balance to some extent by reducing imports.

declining grants could lead to an eventual
depletion of the Compact Trust Fund and/or
an unsustainable buildup in external debt. In
addition, high export concentration in tourism
and reliance on imports of food and fuel
render Palau vulnerable to external shocks.

Marshall Islands

31. Using the U.S. dollar as Palau’s legal
tender remains appropriate. Palau is a small
economy that maintains close financial and
trade linkages with the United States.
Moreover, Palau has very limited capacity to
conduct its own monetary and exchange rate
policy. The U.S. dollar has provided an
important nominal anchor.

Sources: Country authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

Authorities’ Views
34. The
authorities
shared
staff’s
assessment. They noted that Palau’s external
competitiveness cannot be taken for granted,
as Palau faces strong competition from other
tourism-based economies in the Pacific. They
were mindful of the importance of fiscal
prudence in maintaining external stability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PALAU

E. Statistics
35. There is an urgent need to improve the
coverage, timeliness and quality of
statistics. Palau’s statistical capacity has
deteriorated in recent years due to severe
understaffing and inadequate capacity
building. Data need to be used with caution
and have serious shortcomings that hamper
surveillance and policy formulation. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
producing quality and timely statistics as well
as the work program laid out in a draft
Statistics Master Plan for 2012-17. The Office
of Planning and Statistics (OPS) should be
adequately staffed and funded. Capacity

building should also be strengthened,
particularly in the areas of economics statistics
and macroeconomic analysis and framework.
Authorities’ Views
36. The
authorities
reiterated
their
commitment to improving statistics. They
were hopeful that, with the recent return of
two capable staff members to the OPS,
essential statistics can be produced more
timely and with better quality. They indicated
that continued technical assistance from
development partners and PFTAC is key to
capacity building.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37. The outlook remains positive, but
downside risks dominate. The economy has
emerged strongly from the 2008-09
downturn, led by record tourist arrivals.
Expansion in the tourism sector is expected to
continue
supporting
the
economy.
Nevertheless, in the context of a slowing
global economy, Palau faces strong external
headwinds due to its heavy reliance on
tourism, imports of food and fuel, and foreign
aid. Policy space to counter these risks is
limited.
38. Palau’s current economic upturn
presents an opportunity to rebuild fiscal
buffers. The authorities’ efforts to reduce the
current fiscal deficit markedly in recent years
are commendable. A further reduction of
2 percent of GDP in FY2012 is advisable, given
the positive near-term outlook and the need
to boost cash reserves. In a downside
scenario, there is only limited room to reduce
the size of adjustment.
39. Achieving fiscal sustainability calls for
comprehensive reforms. An average annual
reduction in the current fiscal deficit of
1½ percent of GDP through FY2019 is needed.
The adjustment would require an overhaul of
the current inefficient tax system, replacing the
gross revenue tax with a corporate income tax

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and moving from the import tax to a
consumption tax, as well as sizable reductions
in wage bill and subsidies. Measures to
address the large unfunded liabilities of the
CSPF and the Social Security Fund are also
needed.
40. The authorities’ efforts to improve the
budget process and clear arrears are
welcome. Implementing a medium-term
budget framework in FY2013 would make the
budget more comprehensive and improve its
credibility. Execution needs to be contingent
on cash availability and a cash management
committee could be established to help
ensure transparent allocation of cash
resources.
41. Oversight of non-bank financial
institutions needs to be enhanced. The
banking system remains sound. The FIC has
made
commendable
progress
in
strengthening
banking
regulation
and
supervision. To safeguard financial stability,
non-bank financial institutions, including the
National Development Bank, should be
brought under the FIC’s oversight. The FIC will
need to be equipped with adequate resources
should its mandate be expanded.

PALAU

42. By unlocking higher growth, private
sector development serves as a key
complement
to
the
needed
fiscal
consolidation. Further efforts to create a
level playing field for domestic and foreign
investors and to make land leases more
secure are advisable. Staff encourages the
authorities
to
establish
a
one-stop
arrangement for investment licensing and
adopt
the
Secured
Transaction
Act.
Consideration also needs to be given to labor
reforms that help improve employment
opportunities and skills development for
Palauans.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Continued fiscal consolidation is key to
sustaining external stability.
44. Data shortcomings hamper surveillance
and policy formulation. The deterioration in
Palau’s statistical capacity needs to be
addressed
quickly.
The
authorities’
commitment to improving statistics is
welcome.
45. It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on a 24-month
cycle.

43. The
U.S.
dollar
remains
the
appropriate legal tender for Palau. The
economy
has
maintained
external
competitiveness, but is vulnerable to shocks.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

APPENDIX I: PALAU—LONG-TERM FISCAL
SUSTAINABILITY
This appendix assesses Palau’s long-term fiscal sustainability, updating the estimates from the 2010
Article IV consultation. The results suggest that annual fiscal consolidation of 1½ percent of GDP on
average through FY2019 is needed to achieve sustainability over the long run.

A. Framework and Assumptions
Fiscal sustainability is defined in a way where
government fiscal operations satisfy the
intertemporal budget constraint. This is
expressed in the following equation:
W + G + R = C + K,
where the government’s net worth (W) and the
net present values of grants (G) and domestic
revenue (R) are balanced against the net present
values of current spending (C) and capital
spending (K). The current balance (R-C) is set as
the policy variable to satisfy the above equation,
consistent with the authorities’ policy goals.1
Long-term
macroeconomic
and
fiscal
assumptions are in line with historical data.
The nominal rate of return on the Compact
Trust Fund (6 percent) serves as the discount
factor to calculate net present values (NPV).
 Macroeconomic assumptions:
Real GDP growth rate: 2 percent
Inflation: 2 percent
Real rate of return on the Compact Trust
Fund: 4 percent
 Fiscal assumptions:
U.S. Compact current grants: US$160 million
over FY2010-24.
Other U.S. grants: 6 percent of GDP
Other country grants: 4 percent of GDP
Capital spending: 9 percent of GDP
A key exogenous variable is the government’s
initial net worth (W). The net worth comprises
the outstanding Compact Trust Fund and
government cash deposits, less the government’s
arrears and external debt. As of end-FY2011,
government net worth was estimated at
54 percent of GDP, with the Compact Trust

Fund, deposits, external debt and arrears at 67,
3, 9 and 7 percent of GDP, respectively.

B. Findings
Baseline Scenario
Two cases are considered in the baseline
scenario:
Immediate adjustment. Assuming that the
necessary fiscal adjustment is carried out
entirely in the following fiscal year, the current
balance will need to fall sharply from
-14 percent of GDP in FY2011 to -3½ percent in
FY2012. This calls for a deficit reduction of
10½ percentage points in a single year,
highlighting the challenge to achieving fiscal
sustainability. The government’s net worth
would eventually reach 120 percent of GDP,
twice as high as the current level.
Gradual adjustment. The 2010 Article IV
consultation examined a ten-year period over
FY2010–19 to gradually implement fiscal
adjustments. Taking into account the fiscal
consolidation already realized in FY2010–11, an
adjustment of 1.4 percent of GDP per year is
needed over the remaining eight years to
ensure fiscal sustainability. This is similar to the
findings of the 2010 Article IV consultation, as
the impact of the lower growth assumption is
offset by the lower real rate of return. The total
adjustment is 11 percent of GDP during
FY2012–19, slightly larger than an immediate

gradual adjustment assumption with various
combinations of parameter values. Variations
in real growth, inflation and the real rate of
return have a relatively minor impact on the
needed adjustment. Lower valuations of the
government’s initial net worth increase the
needed annual fiscal consolidation.

Scenario with Broad Coverage of Public Debt

The scope of public debt is broadened in this
scenario to include public enterprise debt and
maintenance
backlog,
estimated
at
US$44 million and US$80 million, respectively,
at end-FY2011. As a result, government net
worth falls to -2 percent of GDP.
Immediate adjustment. In FY2012, the current
balance would need to improve to
-2½ percent of GDP, from -14 percent in
FY2011. The needed adjustment is slightly
larger than in the baseline, reflecting lower
initial net worth. The government’s net worth
would rise to 70 percent of GDP over time.
Gradual adjustment. To achieve fiscal
sustainability by FY2019, fiscal adjustment of
1½ percent of GDP per year through FY2019
is required. Cumulatively, the adjustment is
12½ percent of GDP over eight years, larger
than an immediate adjustment.

The government’s net worth would gradually
rise to 30 percent of GDP.
Scenario with Oil-Related Revenue

This scenario incorporates potential oil-related
revenue of US$650 million in NPV terms,
based on World Bank estimates. The revenue
is assumed to come on stream in FY2013.
Immediate adjustment. Large fiscal adjustments
are needed even with substantially more
favorable revenue projections than the
baseline scenario. In FY2012, the current (nonoil) balance would still need to improve by
5½ percentage points to -8½ percent of GDP,
although the size of adjustment is much
smaller. The government’s net worth climbs to
450 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Gradual adjustment. To achieve fiscal
sustainability by FY2019, fiscal consolidation
of ¾ percentage points of GDP per year is
required. The government’s net worth would
rise to 400 percent of GDP.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
GROUP
1.
The Bank team led by Mr. Suri and the
Fund team led by Ms. Sun maintain a close
working relationship and have an ongoing
dialog on a range of macroeconomic and
structural issues.
2.
The teams agreed that Palau’s key
macroeconomic challenges are to achieve
long-term fiscal sustainability and to spur
private sector development, in the absence of
a higher level of grants. To meet these
challenges, Palau needs to achieve significant
fiscal adjustments over a prolonged period
and facilitate private sector development.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified five macro-critical areas for
structural reform:

island average by about 4 percent of GDP.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the
average public sector wage is higher than that
of workers with similar skills in the private
sector. In the absence of stepped-up grants,
the public sector wage bill needs to be
rationalized in a phased manner through
adjustments in both the civil service size and
average pay. However, this will need to be
planned and managed carefully as reductions
in the public sector could have large adverse
knock-on impacts on the economy. Subsidies
on certain government functions, such as
water and sewage services, also remain a
sizeable burden for the government.

(i) Revenue reform. Tax revenue stands at
14½ percent of GDP, one of the lowest in the
Pacific. Measures to boost revenue include
improving tax administration, eliminating
import duty exemptions, and moving to cost,
insurance and freight (CIF) evaluation for
imports. Over the longer term and with
adequate preparation, the current inefficient
tax system needs to be overhauled, replacing
the gross revenue tax with a corporate
income tax and moving from the import tax
to a consumption tax, such as a value-added
tax (VAT).

(iii) Public financial management. Revenue
projections sometimes are inflated during
deliberation and final approved budgets are
not comprehensive. Budget execution is based
on appropriations rather than cash availability,
resulting in the drawdown of cash reserves
and/or accumulation of arrears. With
assistance from the AsDB, the authorities have
been working towards implementing a
medium-term budget framework in FY2013,
which will help improve the budget process.
There is also a need to base budget execution
on cash availability and establish a cash
management committee, which could help
ensure transparent allocations of cash
resources.

(ii) Expenditure reform. More than half of
Palau’s domestic budget is spent on wages
and salaries, which is unsustainable as
Compact grants wind down. While Palau’s
wage bill is the lowest among Compact
countries, it exceeds the non-Compact Pacific

 Public utilities. The Palau Public Utilities
Corporation faces financial difficulties and
maintenance suffers. Electricity tariffs should
be increased towards cost-recovery levels,
with mechanisms to protect the poor. With

regime, establishment of a one-stop
arrangement for business licensing, timely
passage of the secured transaction
legislation, and improvement of land and
labor regulations.

 Potential petroleum revenue. A strong
legal and fiscal framework to manage
potentially volatile oil and gas revenue is
essential. Adequate capacity to manage such
revenue is also critical to translating
petroleum wealth into a broad-based and
sustainable increase in living standards.

 Statistics. The capacity to compile
macroeconomic statistics has deteriorated
due to the loss of key personnel and severe
understaffing. Strong statistical capacity is
critical as serious shortcomings in data
quality and availability impede policy
formulation and surveillance.

 Private sector development. Key obstacles
to private sector development include a
restrictive FDI regime, foreign labor
regulations that distort hiring practices,
complex and opaque licensing arrangements,
the lack of secured access to land, as well as
inadequate access to bank credit. Measures
to promote private sector development
include continued liberalization of the FDI

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK

(PREPARED BASED ON INPUT FROM THE ASDB STAFF AS OF END-JANUARY 2012)
Palau joined the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) on December 29, 2003, as its sixtythird member. While admitted as a regional
country, its country classification was to be
determined. AsDB prepared a Country
Economic Report for Palau and the
Development Status and Country Classification
of the Republic of Palau which served as the
basis for a determination of Palau’s
development status. On December 16, 2005,
Palau was re-classified as a Pacific developing
member country. A more recent report
prepared by AsDB in 2007, Republic of Palau:
Achieving Sustainable Development, provided
a more detailed overview of Palau’s economy.

Palau and the AsDB entered into a new 5 year
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009–13.
The strategy aligns AsDB 's program with that
of Palau's Medium Term Development
Strategy.
The Outcomes or the CPS are: (i) improve
public sector effectiveness to achieve the
medium-term fiscal strategy; (ii) facilitate
private sector development; (iii) deliver safe
water and sanitation services to Palauans; and
(iv) manage the threat of Climate Change.
Bilateral and regional technical assistance
grants scheduled during the strategy are in
the attached tables.

PALAU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT —INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV. RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
Palau has been a heavy user of PFTAC
technical assistance in recent years. In phase
III (FY2009–11) there were 21 missions, spread
across
all sectors,
with
the largest
concentration in public financial management
(PFM), where the focus was on strengthening
cash management and laying the groundwork
for the development of medium-term
budgeting. Other results achieved in phase III
included revenue compliance strategies and
strengthened bank supervision through the
adoption of regulations, improved bank
reporting and the establishment of an on-site
supervision program. Methodologies for
producing a broader range of national income
and balance of payments statistics were also
developed.
Strategy 2011–13
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD
regional strategy note and is planned within the
results framework for current PFTAC (Phase IV)
FY2011–16 funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities
sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and
strengthen the financial sector. Priorities will be
strengthening revenue administration and, in
close coordination with AsDB, strengthening
PFM. Continued strengthening of financial
sector supervision will also be required.
In public financial management, the focus
will be on continuing to support the AsDB
1

PFTAC is a regional technical assistance institution
operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB,
Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. The Centre’s aim
is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective
economic and financial management that can be sustained
at the national and regional level. Member countries are
Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu. It is based in Suva, Fiji.

The results framework and additional detail on recent
activity can be found within the PFTAC Phase IV program
document and FY2011 Annual Report, available at

project
on
developing
medium-term
budgeting. PFTAC will also encourage Palau to
undertake a PEFA assessment and look to
support it in 2013, in line with the objectives of
the regional PFM roadmap. Follow up support
on accounting and cash management may also
be required.
In tax administration and policy, follow up to
recent TA on IT development and improved
corporate strategy, business planning and
compliance will be provided. Ultimately, the
aim is to lay the foundation for a modernized
tax policy and the introduction of VAT.
Assistance in this area is not expected to
commence until 2013. If resources are available,
additional assistance may be available in the
customs administration area, in line with recent
informal discussions with the authorities.
In the financial sector supervision area,
support in the off-site area will be in
developing prudential returns that allow
ultimate integration with the automated
statistical system currently being developed by
PFTAC and RBNZ for implementation in the
South Pacific Central Banks. Capacity building
in on-site supervision will also continue, likely
in late-2012.
In economic statistics, PFTAC will be available
to build capacity to produce National Accounts
and Balance of Payments statistics under the
methodologies developed in phase III and
implemented with ongoing PFTAC support.
However, with significant levels of Compactrelated statistics support expected to begin in
2012, there may not be a demand for
substantial PFTAC TA support.
In the macroeconomic analysis and
frameworks area, little demand for direct TA is
currently anticipated. Officials will though be
encouraged to participate in financial
programming and macro-fiscal issues planned
for 2012.

ANNEX V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of January 25, 2012

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Palau’s statistics have serious shortcomings that hamper surveillance. Shortcomings include the
coverage, timeliness, and quality of economic statistics in all sectors. Since 2009, the Office of Planning and
Statistics (OPS) had just one statistician until a second returned from study leave in the summer of 2011. As a
result, no macroeconomic statistics had been compiled before a PFTAC statistics mission in November 2011.
Staff shortages have also prevented capacity building in recent years. The authorities’ capacity to produce
macroeconomic statistics will remain weak, unless understaffing and inadequate capacity building are
addressed. In general, the quality of data is weak and the statistics, particularly national accounts estimates,
need to be used with caution.
National Accounts: With PFTAC assistance, production-based and expenditure-based GDP estimates through
FY2011 were compiled in November 2011. Expenditure-based GDP estimates, however, have large discrepancies
with production-based estimates. Estimates for the last three years (FY2009–11) suffer from significant
weaknesses in source data availability and quality. These gaps need to be filled before the estimates can be
finalized and adopted as official.
Price statistics: From mid-2009 to mid-2011, the quarterly consumer price index was not compiled on a regular
basis due to the lack of staff. The series was backdated in mid-2011. The data quality needs to be improved,
particularly regarding the precise specification of priced items.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are compiled as part of the annual budget process, but budget data
provide an incomplete coverage of grants, with only “Compact” current grants included. Upon request, the
authorities provide fiscal data using the GFSM 1986 format. Only one staff is able to prepare the data, and data
quality and timeliness are a matter of concern. The most recent audited accounts available are for FY2009.
Monetary and financial statistics: Since Q3 2009, banks have submitted quarterly financial statements,
including balance sheets and profit and loss statements, to the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC). The
submissions enabled the FIC to prepare soundness indicators and publish Annual Banking Sector Reports since
2009.
Balance of payments: Preliminary balance of payments estimates have been compiled through FY2011 with
assistance from the PFTAC. However, there are substantial data gaps for FY2009–11 due to poor source data.
International merchandise trade statistics have not been compiled for FY2010–11. Improvements to data on
tourism’s impact on the economy and a visitors’ survey are needed. More BOP compilers are also needed. Final
government accounts and quarterly social security data are missing from the latest estimations. Errors and
omissions remain high.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Does not participate in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS). Palau has been
invited to participate in a Japanese sponsored
technical assistance project to GDDS participation.

No data ROSC available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to the Statistics Department for publication in Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook, Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook, or International Financial Statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 14, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Palau
On March 12, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation with the Republic of Palau.1
Background
Palau depends on tourism and foreign aid for its livelihood. Annual tourism receipts amount
to about 50 percent of GDP, while grants, in particular under the Compact Agreement with
the United States, averaged 25 percent of GDP during the last decade. An overarching
challenge for Palau is to achieve self-sufficiency when the renewed Compact grants wind
down in FY2024.
The economy has recovered strongly from the 2008–09 downturn. Real GDP growth is
estimated to have reached about 6 percent in FY2011, on the back of a 25 percent surge in
tourist arrivals. Annual inflation increased from 1½ percent during 2009–10 to 3½ percent
in 2011, due to a sharp rise in food and fuel prices during the first half of the year.
The fiscal position has improved markedly but the deficit remains sizable. Thanks to
spending restraint and economic recovery, the current fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
declined cumulatively by 3½ percent of GDP during the past two fiscal years. But the deficit
remained high at 14 percent of GDP. At end-FY2011, government cash reserves stood at
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

2

only US$7 million (about one and a half months of government spending), while arrears
amounted to about US$15 million (7 percent of GDP).
The external position has improved alongside the rebound in tourist arrivals. The current
account deficit (excluding grants) declined to 11 percent of GDP in FY2011, despite a rise in
imports from higher commodity prices. The Compact Trust Fund balance has stabilized at
around US$150 million, albeit still 15 percent below pre-crisis peaks.
The economy is likely to continue expanding, with growth projected at 3 percent in FY2012
and 2 percent over the medium term. Downside risks dominate. A severe downturn in Asia,
the main tourist source region for Palau, could significantly affect the tourism sector, with
large adverse knock-on effects on the economy. Although the renewed Compact grants are
unlikely to be affected, other aid flows may be delayed as donors face tighter finances. A
sharp rise in food and fuel prices could also depress domestic demand and weaken the
fiscal and external positions, given Palau’s heavy dependence on imports. The sizable fiscal
deficit and the absence of monetary and exchange rate policies suggest that Palau has
limited policy space to counter these risks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Palau’s strong economic recovery and positive near-term
outlook. Directors observed, however, that risks are tilted to the downside and that Palau
remains vulnerable to external headwinds. The key challenge is to build the domestic
consensus for reforms that will achieve a sustainable fiscal position and strengthen growth
prospects as Compact grants wind down.
Directors commended the recent improvement in the fiscal balance. They encouraged the
authorities to take advantage of the current economic upturn to further advance fiscal
consolidation and boost government cash reserves. Directors underscored that fiscal
sustainability calls for gradual and substantial adjustment over the medium term, requiring
comprehensive tax reform and sizable reductions in the public wage bill and subsidies.
They also stressed the need to address the large unfunded liabilities of the Civil Service
Pension Fund and the Social Security.
Directors welcomed recent efforts to strengthen the budget process and clear arrears. They
supported the implementation of a medium-term budget framework in FY2013 to improve
budget planning and enhance credibility. Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to reform
government-owned utilities.
Directors noted that the banking system remains sound, and welcomed continued progress
in strengthening bank oversight. To safeguard financial stability, they encouraged
enhancement in the regulation and supervision of non-bank financial institutions, including
the National Development Bank of Palau.

3

Directors welcomed recent progress in improving the business climate. They encouraged
further efforts to promote private sector development, including creating a level playing field
for domestic and foreign investors.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improving the quality and timeliness of
data. They encouraged adequate staffing and capacity building of the Office of Planning
and Statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for the Republic of Palau, and
Mack Kaminaga, Advisor to the Executive Director
March 12, 2012
The authorities in the Republic of Palau would like to place on record their appreciation to
the Fund staff for their constructive engagement which has led to an effective and productive
2012 Article IV Consultation. They found the discussions on various aspects of the Palau’s
economy and the evolving outlook open-minded and useful. They concurred with the views
expressed in the report as it correctly identifies the economic challenges and the way forward
to address the challenges.
Economic Development and outlook
The economy has recovered strongly from the global crisis in 2008 and 2009, supported by
an increase in tourist arrivals of 25 percent in FY 2011. As a result, real GDP growth is
estimated to have reached 6 percent in FY 2011. The economy is expected to grow by 3
percent in 2012 and 2 percent over the next few years after that, driven by expansion in the
tourism sector. The sharp rise in food and fuel prices has contributed to the acceleration in
inflation to 3½ percent during the first half of this year.
Given the favorable increase in the number of tourists coming to Palau, the authorities have
focused on development initiatives that would positively improve the tourism sector. New
hotels are being constructed in order to accommodate increased tourist volumes. The
authorities have also negotiated an increase in the number of scheduled flights to Palau in
response to the demand. Tourism-related activities have also been increased and improved as
well.
The authorities have also embarked on other developmental activities which include
commercializing water and sewage services with the aim to achieve full cost recovery by
2016. The energy sector will also implement a new tariff structure that will reduce subsidies
to middle- to high-income households and increase tariffs to full cost recovery level. The
authorities will soon implement an increase in the ‘green fee’ (tied to visitor departure tax) as
another initiative that would strengthen the fiscal position (see below). The upgrading of
information technology systems is also part of the reform agenda.
While the outlook is positive for 2012 and favorable in the next few years thereafter, there
are growing risks to the forecasts. Risks remain weighted to the downside if a severe
downturn spreads to Asia, (the main tourist source for Palau). A sharp rise in food and fuel
prices would also have a negative impact on the economy, since Palau heavily depends on
imports. Furthermore, Palau’s requirement for ongoing fiscal austerity and the absence of
monetary and exchange rate policies (the economy is dollarized), limit policy space to
counter the risks.
In their efforts to strengthen economic development the authorities intend to develop a
vibrant private sector. They have taken steps to create a business environment that would
allow businesses, both foreign and domestic, to operate successfully through their regulatory

2
improvement to the FDI regime and simplification of their regulations on both land-use and
the labor market.
The authorities understand the importance of attracting foreign investment and labor, as well
as creating a favorable business environment given the importance of the private sector in
economic development. The ADB has identified some of obstacles for ‘doing business’ in
Palau and through the steps mentioned above, hope to address these hindrances. They are of
the view that private sector development is a key complement to the planned fiscal
consolidation. They are also conscious of the need for a dynamic and competitive private
sector to help spur self-sustaining long-term growth and continue to work on improving the
business climate.
Fiscal Sustainability
As a result of five years of negative or near-zero GDP growth due to the downturn in
tourism, the authorities face a considerable number of challenges on the fiscal front. Sizable
adjustment is required in order to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. Staff estimate that
an average annual reduction in the current fiscal deficit (excluding grants) of 1½ percent of
GDP through FY 2019 is warranted. In total a fiscal adjustment amounting to around
7½ percent of GDP (over the next 5 years) will be required. The authorities recognize the
task that lies ahead but also try to balance the adjustment with the need for political support
of the required reforms. These challenges are compounded by the expiration of Compact
grants in FY2024 which have averaged 25 percent of GDP over the past decade.
Given the burden of adjustment, the authorities would need to embark on comprehensive
revenue and expenditure reforms, which are essential to resolve long-standing fiscal
imbalances. Another factor contributing to fiscal imbalances is that more than half of Palau’s
domestic budget is spent on wages and salaries, which will become unsustainable as
Compact assistance winds down.
The current economic recovery has allowed an opportunity for the authorities to begin the
consolidation of the fiscal position. Immediate steps have been taken to strengthen revenue
collection. They have continued to embark on several measures to implement structural, as
well as revenue and expenditure reforms.
Structural reform involves energy sector reform and the current commercialization of water
and sewage services. The authorities are in agreement with the staff that by implementing
higher energy tariffs they will be able to achieve greater cost recovery. This could also lower
Palau’s reliance on fuel imports and reduce external vulnerability. By 2016 water tariffs
should also achieve the level of full cost recovery.
The revenue that would be generated from the ‘green fee’ initiative, as well as possible cuts
in wages and subsidies, would also strengthen the fiscal position.
The authorities noted that comprehensive tax reform will strengthen their effort to re-build
the fiscal position. However, they realize that the current tax system is inefficient and would

3
need to be reformed. Given the importance of tax reform, the authorities have taken steps to
propose an increase in the hotel room tax.
They further intend to improve tax administration, eliminate import duty exemptions, and
move to cost, insurance, and freight evaluation for imports. Included with the tax reform as a
measure of strengthening the fiscal position, the authorities also intend to replace the gross
revenue tax with a corporate income tax and will consider moving from taxing imports to a
value-added tax (VAT) as recommended by the Fund staff.
The authorities have taken steps to implement a medium-term budget framework (MTBF)
given that this would entail a structured, comprehensive, and realistic approach that is
consistent with a sound fiscal policy strategy. An added benefit from this approach would be
enhancing budget credibility and governance. With the MTBF in place, the authorities hope
to exert better control over budget execution (which is based upon cash availability, cash
planning, and spending).
Financial Sector
The banking system remains profitable and well capitalized. The authorities are committed to
ensure that the banking system is stable and safe for depositors. They have implemented
prudential measures through the establishment of the Financial Institutional Commission
(FIC). The FIC is mandated for the purposes of monitoring banking activities in accordance
with the banking regulations. The FIC has been proactive in its mandate and has recently
implemented its new off-site monitoring program.
The FIC continues to serve in its supervisory role and to safeguard the banking activities.
While the FIC does not have the mandate to supervise the National Development Bank of
Palau or other finance companies, the authorities intend to legally give this mandate to the
FIC given that potential fiscal risks could arise without proper and independent supervision.
The authorities are committed to continue in their effort against money laundering and in
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). They have established the Financial
Intelligence Unit within the government with the mandate to oversee any criminal activities
within the financial sector. Legislation has been introduced to further support and strengthen
this work. The Financial Intelligence Unit has also strengthened its capacity to conduct
AML/CFT examinations.
The presence of FDIC-insured US banks in Palau also provides a stabilizing influence on the
financial system and helps mitigate risks.
Reform Agenda
The authorities have also initiated steps to reform government-owned utilities in order to
reduce subsidies and improve services and revenue. The IT system is on schedule to be
modernized as part of the reform agenda. The authorities are committed to continue with
their ongoing reform program, including the restructuring of the public and private sectors.
