IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Bosnia and
Herzegovina
On October 23, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to rebound to over 2 percent this
year as economic activity is picking up in Europe. Industrial activity and exports have been
gathering momentum and, together with the decline in fuel prices, boost incomes and
consumption. Deflation has been imported through the currency board arrangement.
The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina fell into recession in the aftermath of the global
crisis. After several starts and stops, the economy started to recover in 2013, with growth
reaching 2½ percent, but this progress was interrupted by the floods that hit the country in
May 2014. Nonetheless, the economy proved more resilient to the impact of this natural
disaster than initially expected and growth still reached over 1 percent in 2014.
Bosnia and Herzegovina still faces major challenges. Convergence to European Union (EU)
income levels has been slow for both cyclical and structural reasons. A lack of progress in
structural reforms—partly reflecting the country’s complex constitutional set up—has held
back private investment, limiting potential output and keeping unemployment high,
especially among the youth. The authorities recently adopted a comprehensive Reform
Agenda—prepared in cooperation with the EU and the international financial institutions—
aiming to accelerate reforms and to move forward on the path toward EU accession.
Domestic political risks weigh heavily on the outlook. The risk of policy slippages and
delays in implementation of the Reform Agenda is significant given the complex political set
up and the strong opposition to reforms from vested interests. On the external side, risks are
more balanced, as stagnation in Europe, possible financial market strains, or geopolitical
tensions could dampen growth, while a faster recovery in Europe or the resolution of trade
issues with the EU could spur exports.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the recent pickup in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
economic activity following last year’s devastating floods and an unfavorable external
environment. Directors commended the authorities for maintaining sound macroeconomic
policies, and noted that the widening of external and fiscal imbalances, as well as the impact
on the banking system, were much more limited than initially feared, despite the substantial
damage and hardship caused by the natural disaster. Directors noted, however, that the
economy still faces major challenges, and called on the authorities to accelerate critical
reforms in order to achieve more sustainable growth and reduce high unemployment.
They agreed that fiscal policy will need to strike a balance between resuming
consolidation—to place public debt on a firm downward path—and supporting the nascent
recovery. Improving revenue collection, enhancing the quality and efficiency of public
expenditure, and containing non-priority spending to create room for infrastructure
investment are important priorities.
They recommended that financial policies address remaining vulnerabilities in the
banking system, particularly among domestically-owned banks, while creating a stronger
financial sector safety net and enabling banks’ balance sheet repair. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to address the remaining shortcomings in the framework for
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.
They stressed that, more than anything, strong progress is needed to complete the still
largely unfinished structural reform agenda, including by further improving the business
environment and the functioning of the labor market, to attract investment, raise potential
output, and reduce high unemployment.
They welcomed the authorities’ recent adoption of a comprehensive Reform Agenda
aimed at accelerating private sector growth and job creation while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. They were encouraged by the country’s broad support for this
agenda, and noted that its implementation was off to a good start. Directors stressed,
however, that reforms will take time and that the authorities will need to overcome strong
opposition from vested interests. Moreover, the uncertain and fragile domestic political
situation poses considerable risks to its timely implementation. Against this backdrop,
Directors emphasized that strong and sustained implementation of reforms and sound
economic policies will help mobilize external support, achieve faster growth, and make
stronger progress toward EU accession. Developing adequate capacity to absorb external
support will also be crucial.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has made considerable progress in the last few years in
reducing internal and external imbalances. Moreover, after several starts and stops
since the global financial crisis the economic recovery is showing signs of taking a
firmer hold. Growth is expected to rebound to over 2 percent this year, up from just
over 1 percent last year when the country was hit by massive floods.



The country still faces major challenges, however. Convergence to European Union
(EU) income levels has been slow for both cyclical and structural reasons. Weak
activity in Europe has hurt activity in BiH and last year’s floods caused major damage.
A lack of progress in structural reforms—partly reflecting the country’s complex
constitutional set-up—has held back private investment, limiting potential output
and keeping unemployment high, especially among the youth.



Policies should focus on accelerating private sector growth and job creation, while
ensuring sustainability. A gradual recovery in Europe and low oil prices will aid
growth in BiH. With deflation imported via the currency board arrangement, fiscal
policy will need to strike a balance between supporting growth and returning public
debt to a downward path, although room for policy maneuver will also depend on
available financing. Financial policies will need to address banking sector
vulnerabilities and aim to resuscitate bank lending. Attracting investment will require
accelerating reforms to improve the business environment and labor market
outcomes.



The authorities recently adopted a comprehensive Reform Agenda—prepared in
cooperation with the EU and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs)—aiming to
accelerate reforms and to move forward on the path toward EU accession. The
authorities are also seeking to mobilize financial and technical assistance to assist
with the implementation of the Reform Agenda. Strong reform implementation,
combined with external support, would help accelerate income convergence and job
creation.



Significant domestic political risks continue to weigh on the outlook, as the fragile
and complex political situation poses risks to the timely implementation of policies
envisaged in the Agenda. Delays in reform implementation would also delay official
external financing and force a tighter fiscal stance. On the external side, risks are
more balanced, as stagnation in Europe, possible financial market strains, or geopolitical tensions could dampen growth, while a faster recovery in Europe would
support it.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: WEAK GROWTH AND
HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT
A. Context
1.
BiH has a complex constitutional set-up that has made it difficult to effect policy
changes and implement reforms. It has a central government—the Institutions of Bosnia and
Herzegovina—two regional entities with a high degree of autonomy—the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS)—and a small district, Brcko. Furthermore, the FBiH
is comprised of ten highly autonomous cantons.
2.
BiH has been lagging other countries in the region on the road toward EU integration,
although progress has been made recently. While the 2012 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) helped
support macroeconomic stability in a difficult external environment, progress in addressing
domestic structural weaknesses was limited. The adoption of a written commitment by the
authorities in January 2015 to conduct all reforms needed to prepare BiH for future EU membership
allowed the EU Foreign Affairs Council to let the Stabilization and Association Agreement enter into
force in June this year. The Council also urged the authorities to develop an agenda for economic
reforms, stressing that strong reform implementation would be necessary for a membership
application to be considered by the EU.
3.
The new governments that came to office following the October 2014 general
elections have pledged to accelerate economic reforms. Against the backdrop of popular
discontent with a high rate of unemployment, the new governments adopted a comprehensive
Reform Agenda in July this year, in close cooperation with the EU and the International Financial
Institutions (IFIs) (see below). Implementation of the Reform Agenda will face considerable
challenges, however, given a difficult domestic political environment and the need to overcome
strong opposition from vested interests.
4.
Data are adequate for surveillance purposes. The authorities are working, including with
Fund assistance, to address remaining shortcomings, notably in the coverage and quality of fiscal
and real sector data.

B. A Steady Reduction in External and Internal Imbalances since the Global
Crisis and Signs of an Economic Recovery
5.
BiH had experienced strong
economic growth prior to the global
financial crisis. Sizable inflows into the
banking system fueled a credit boom, while

sector employment and in public sector wages and social benefits. But while incomes rose, so did
domestic and external vulnerabilities. When the economy fell into recession in the aftermath of the
global crisis, the current account and budget deficits rose sharply, and with that public debt. Growth
was lackluster following the crisis, with several starts and stops, reflecting weak activity across
Europe, deleveraging by foreign-owned banks, and slow progress with domestic reforms.

External and internal imbalances have been gradually reduced in recent years, mainly
through fiscal consolidation, but also reflecting lower investment and higher savings. The
budget deficit was brought down to just below 2 percent of GDP in 2013 by containing current
expenditures and improving revenue collection. The economy started to recover in 2013, with
growth reaching 2.5 percent. This progress was interrupted by the natural disaster that hit BiH in
May 2014. However, the economy proved more resilient to the impact of the floods than initially
expected. Production and exports rebounded faster than anticipated, and despite the limited

After these difficult years, an economic recovery is showing signs of taking a firmer
hold. As economic activity is slowly picking up in Europe, growth in BiH is expected to rebound to
over 2 percent this year. Industrial activity and exports have been gathering momentum and,
together with the decline in fuel prices, boost incomes and consumption. Meanwhile, deflation has

Standard analyses do not suggest major issues with regard to external stability. In the
wake of the global crisis, the current account balance has moved closer to its sustainable path.

Other price indicators, such as average wages,
also do not point to competitiveness problems. Wages
in BiH are low in absolute levels and appear to be only
moderately higher than labor productivity. Average wage
levels are pushed up by high wages in the public sector;
private sector wages—at least recorded wages—appear to
be competitive. At the same time, labor productivity is
quite low by regional standards, amounting to just over 25
percent of average productivity in EU countries. Minimum
wages, however, are higher than elsewhere in the region.

Private investment—and notably foreign direct investment—is low compared to other
countries in the region, limiting potential output and private sector job creation. Low private
sector activity has translated also in a relatively low level of exports.

This lack of private investment reflects not only political risks, but a still largely
unfinished reform agenda, resulting in a poor business environment and labor market
rigidities. The complex governing structure with its multitude of regulations and a fragmented
economic space create major obstacles to businesses. Despite recent progress, BiH still substantially
lags its regional peers in ease of doing business indicators.
13.
The result is a high level of structural unemployment. With few private sector jobs and
relatively high public sector wages, many unemployed are either waiting for a public sector job or
are looking for opportunities abroad—in a 2013 survey 80 percent of young people indicated they
would leave the country if they could. In the meantime, remittances provide an important source of
income for many households, and may result in higher reservation wages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: ACCELERATING GROWTH
WHILE MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
14.
The authorities agreed with staff that an ambitious policy agenda is necessary to
accelerate growth and reduce unemployment, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The
Reform Agenda adopted in July sets out the governments’ plans for economic and social reforms for
the coming years, as well as measures to strengthen the rule of law, tackle corruption, and enhance
administrative capabilities of public institutions. More specifically, with regard to economic policies,
the authorities agreed that these need to focus on:


intensifying reforms to improve the business environment, attract investment, and raise the
economy’s growth potential;



resuming fiscal consolidation to place public debt on a steady downward path, while improving
the quality of government spending;



and safeguarding financial sector stability and reviving bank lending.

The international community has expressed strong support for the authorities’ Reform Agenda and
has pledged to help the authorities in their efforts, including by providing financial assistance,
depending on progress in implementation. Following the adopting of the Reform Agenda, the
authorities have been preparing detailed action plans and have started with its implementation.

A. Supporting a Vibrant Private Sector
Background
15.
Some progress has been made in the last few years to improve the business
environment, but much remains to be done. As noted above, structural reforms have been
progressing slowly and face resistance from vested interests. Both entities have been making
progress in making it easier to start and operate a business. In the RS, the one-stop shop for
business registration has been fully operational since late 2013, resulting in a surge in business
registration. Similarly, in the FBiH, amendments to the Law on Business Registration and a new Law
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

on Companies and on Inspections were adopted. It had proven difficult in both entities, however, to
achieve consensus between the social partners on new labor market legislation that would help
create more jobs. The privatization process has yet to be completed, notably in the FBiH, as
continued public ownership allows for a system of patronage and weak financial discipline.

Policy Advice
16.
to:

To attract investment and boost job creation in the formal economy, it will be critical



Improve the business environment by: (i) further reducing the administrative burden on
businesses, including by harmonizing regulations between the entities and reducing para-fiscal
fees; (ii) restarting privatization of state-owned companies, notably in the FBiH, by divesting
minority shares and the resolution of remaining state-owned enterprises either through the
restructuring and privatization of viable enterprises or the liquidation of non-viable ones;
(iii) improving the resolution framework for commercial and labor disputes, including by
adopting new entity bankruptcy legislation and enhancing the court system by establishing
commercial courts in the FBiH and improving their functioning in the RS to speed up the
processing of disputes; (iv) enhancing anti-corruption efforts, including by implementing the
anti-money laundering framework; and (v) finalizing the process of WTO accession and resolving
trade issues with the EU.



Enhance the functioning of the labor market by: (i) revitalizing the collective bargaining
process by setting a limit on the duration of collective agreements and requiring renegotiation
of existing ones; (ii) allowing wages to be better linked to performance; (iii) reducing
disincentives for hiring by increasing opportunities for part-time work and fixed-term contracts
and by limiting severance payments; and (iv) increasing labor inspections to reduce informal
employment and better protect workers’ rights. This will need to be accompanied by
strengthening the system of unemployment benefits and active labor market policies, including
by expanding training and education opportunities, and by broader education reform to reduce
skills mismatches.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities recognized that future growth must be based on attracting investment
and agreed with staff’s recommendations. The Reform Agenda includes a set of measures to
make it easier to start and operate a business, including by simplifying and harmonizing regulations,
as well as commitments to proceed with the restructuring, privatization, or liquidation of most
remaining state-owned enterprises and to adopt new labor market legislation that is more
conducive to job creation. In a major step forward and notwithstanding continued strong resistance
from the labor unions, the FBiH parliament adopted a new Labor Law in line with IMF and World
Bank recommendations by the end of July 2015. The RS authorities aim to adopt a new labor law in
the coming months.

Box 1. Implementation of Recommendations of the 2012 Article IV Consultation and
Performance under the 2012–14 SBA
The 2012 Article IV consultation coincided with the start of a new SBA aimed at countering the
effects of a weak external environment and addressing domestic structural weaknesses. The program
had as goals to: (i) improve national policy coordination; (ii) maintain fiscal discipline, and advance public
sector reforms to reduce the size of the government and improve the composition of expenditure;
(iii) safeguard financial sector stability in the context of the currency board; and (iv) intensify reforms to
improve the business and investment environment to support growth, investment and job creation.
During the program period, the authorities have been successful in reducing external and internal
imbalances. While the external environment proved more adverse than expected, the budget deficit was
steadily reduced, the current account deficit narrowed, and official foreign exchange reserves rose steadily.
An augmentation of the SBA in June 2014 helped address the urgent balance of payment needs created by
the floods.
While macro-economic policies were sound—and remained so in the run up to the October 2014
elections—progress in structural reform implementation was mixed and reform efforts stalled once
the election campaign got underway:



Progress was made in strengthening public financial management—with the adoption of a new budget
framework law in the FBiH, amendments to the Law on Financing of the Institutions of BiH, and a new
BiH procurement law—and in the area of taxation—with an increase in tobacco excises and a start with
the exchange of taxpayer information between the four tax agencies. In the FBiH, privileged pensions
for war veterans were reduced, although the number of beneficiaries was increased. New pension
legislation is under preparation. Little or no progress was made, however, in improving the
composition and quality of government spending.



Progress was also made in strengthening bank oversight and in safeguarding financial sector stability.
Financial sector contingency plans were adopted, including a BiH-wide plan focusing on systemic
events. Asset quality reviews of weaker banks were conducted or are underway. All banks conducted
bottom-up stress tests for the first time in addition to the regular top-down stress testing. New
banking laws are under preparation, while amendments had already been introduced regarding
treatment of confidential information to allow for enhanced cooperation with foreign supervisors.



Less progress was made in improving the business environment and labor market, although a one-stop
business registration process was introduced in the RS and the last of a series of legislative changes
was recently approved in the FBiH to achieve the same. Moreover, after long delays a new labor law
that is more conducive to job creation was recently adopted in the FBiH, while this is still pending in
the RS. No progress was made in restructuring or divesting remaining state-owned assets.

B. Fiscal Policies: Ensuring Sustainability, While Supporting Growth
Background
18.
The authorities’ gradual fiscal consolidation over the past several years brought the
increase in the public debt ratio to a halt—and would have supported a decline if not for the
floods. The overall budget deficit was reduced from its peak of 6 percent of GDP in 2009 to just
under 2 percent of GDP in 2013, mainly by strictly containing current spending. This downward
trend was interrupted by the floods in 2014. The reduction in the deficit was achieved despite a
worse economic environment: economic growth during 2012–14—both in nominal and real terms—
turned out to be much lower than anticipated at the start of the last Fund-supported arrangement
in 2012, due to lower growth in Europe, deflation, the floods, and weak bank lending. Consequently,
revenues also did not reach the levels projected three years ago, forcing much lower spending
levels.
19.
Despite the natural disaster and the elections, the overall fiscal stance in 2014 was
tighter than anticipated. The overall deficit is estimated to have reached 3 percent of GDP in 2014,
from an original pre-disaster target of 1.7 percent of GDP. However, this was much lower than the
4 percent of GDP deficit projected immediately following the disaster, owing to a faster than
expected recovery in revenues, slower reconstruction efforts, and restraint on non-flood related
expenditures. Public debt reached 45 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.
20.

A number of key fiscal structural weaknesses remain:



Deficiencies in tax policy and revenue administration. The overall level of tax and social
security contributions is one of the highest in the region, with indirect taxes and social security
contributions together providing more than 90 percent of revenues. Standard tax rates of both
income taxes and VAT are low and competitive in the region. Notably, the single VAT rate of
17 percent and its broad base ensure a high efficiency of VAT collection. Some progress has
been made in recent years in improving revenue administration, especially in the collection of
indirect tax revenues. Revenues from corporate and personal income taxation on the other hand
are very low, and not only because of low rates. Narrow tax bases, generous incentives, and low
compliance erode revenues.



A high tax burden on labor. The tax wedge—
comprising both personal income taxes and
social security contributions, but with most of
the burden coming from the latter—is higher in
the FBiH than in the RS, but it is relatively high
in both entities compared to elsewhere in the
region. The high burden on labor is a strong
disincentive for people to move from informal
to formal employment and for some, possibly,
even to enter the labor market. The tax base of

both personal income taxes and social security contributions is very narrow, with a substantial
share of workers’ compensation provided through untaxed benefits, in the form of allowances,
especially in the FBiH.




An outsized public sector with a high share of
current spending, but with a low quality of
spending. The public sector is among the largest
in the region, and has the highest share of
spending on wages and goods and services. And
while public financial management has
improved, outcome indicators of public spending
on health care and social assistance are among
the worst in the region, even though spending in
these areas is the highest.

Moreover, due to administrative problems and difficulties in reaching agreements between
the entities and the central government, the public sector has not managed to unlock all
the donor support for reconstruction. Faster absorption of donor assistance could have
provided a much-needed boost to the economy.

Policy Advice
21.
Looking ahead, with a tight monetary policy and deflation imported via the currency
board arrangement, a gradual fiscal consolidation would strike an appropriate balance
between ensuring medium-term sustainability and supporting the nascent recovery. A gradual
reduction of the budget deficit to between zero and one percent of GDP over the medium-term is a
suitable target consistent with reducing public debt to below 40 percent of GDP—an appropriate
level for an emerging economy with a currency board and limited access to international markets.
22.
The 2015 central government budgets that were adopted in late 2014 and early 2015
and which aimed to contain current spending were consistent with this goal. The overall
budget deficit was initially projected to decline to about 2½ percent of GDP this year, although this
depended on the availability of sufficient financing, progress in implementing foreign-financed
capital projects, and the ability to control spending by lower levels of government, extra-budgetary
funds, and state-owned companies. Given delays, however, in the preparation and implementation
of foreign-financed capital projects—including the ones to address the impact of last year’s floods—
the overall budget deficit is more likely to remain limited to just over 1½ percent of GDP this year.
23.
Continuing with a gradual pace of fiscal consolidation will require the authorities to
mobilize sufficient financing. External debt servicing obligations are projected to increase again in
the coming years and BiH has little or no access to international capital markets. The authorities
could raise additional domestic financing, as banks have ample liquidity, but banks may be reaching
exposure limits, while too much reliance on domestic financing could crowd out private sector
lending and hurt growth. A gradual fiscal adjustment will therefore depend on the authorities’ ability

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

to secure official external support. Without this, fiscal policy would have to be tightened
considerably faster than appropriate—and cuts would likely fall heaviest on public investment,
although spending on wages and benefits would be affected too—which would undermine the
economic recovery.
24.
In any event, comprehensive fiscal reforms are needed to make fiscal consolidation
sustainable, create room for investment in infrastructure, and improve the efficiency of public
finances:


Improving revenue collection. Progress has been made in recent years to improve revenue
collection, but more remains to be done to fight tax evasion and collect tax debts. Revenue
collection and administration will need to be strengthened by: (i) enhancing the cooperation
between the four tax authorities and strengthening the powers of the entity tax administrations
to improve compliance; (ii) moving more toward a risk-based approach for the selection of tax
audits and inspections; and (iii) increasing efforts to collect outstanding tax and social security
contribution debts. Meanwhile, the single-rate VAT tax that is applied to a broad base is highly
effective and will need to be preserved.



Lowering the tax burden on formal employment. The tax wedge could be reduced by
lowering social security contribution rates. This could be offset by broadening the tax base for
labor income by taxing all sources of work-related income, in particular allowances, and by
eliminating corporate income tax exemptions and incentives.



Reducing public spending, while improving its composition and quality. This includes:
(i) implementing public administration reform, including limiting new hiring and refraining from
general public sector wage increases as wages in the public sector appreciably exceed those in
the private sector; (ii) initiating health care reform; (iii) ensuring the sustainability of the pension
system by completing pension reforms, including by increasing the effective retirement age and
broadening the base for contributions; and (iv) improving the targeting of social assistance to
protect the most vulnerable, while containing the costs of benefits to war veterans, including by
completing audits of beneficiaries.



Strengthening controls over lower levels of government, extra-budgetary funds, and stateowned enterprises. Efforts are needed to fully account for and stop the increase in uncovered
liabilities by lower levels of government and loss-making state-owned enterprises. Further
efforts are needed to strengthen fiscal accountability frameworks and reporting in both entities,
including by adopting a new fiscal responsibility law in the RS and strengthening
implementation of the new law on budgets in the FBiH. Moreover, a comprehensive strategy is
needed to tackle the issue of unpaid social security contributions by state-owned enterprises.

Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities agreed that fiscal policies need to be aimed at resuming fiscal
consolidation, while making adequate room for capital spending. They are committed to strictly

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

contain current spending, notably the wage bill, and to adopt new civil service laws to increase
flexibility. The authorities are aiming to mobilize sufficient external financing to allow for a more
gradual pace of fiscal consolidation and they expect that strong implementation of the Reform
Agenda will help them in securing the necessary financing. They also noted the difficulties in
controlling lower levels of government, given the high degree of decentralization.
26.
The authorities are planning to lower the tax burden on labor and adopt new income
tax laws. New personal and corporate income tax laws are under preparation in the RS, with
assistance from the Fund, while in the FBiH a new corporate income tax law, also developed with
Fund assistance and substantially broadening the base by eliminating exemptions, has been
submitted to parliament. While there was general agreement on the need to broaden the tax base
and improve revenue administration, some expected only limited effect from enhanced cooperation
between the tax agencies and stressed the need to adhere to constitutional competencies. Instead,
they preferred raising the VAT rate to finance a reduction in social security contribution rates. Staff
concurred that a VAT rate increase—albeit a more modest one—could be considered but stressed
that this hike should only be a last resort measure if other measures proved insufficient.
27.
The authorities are seeking the assistance of the World Bank and the EU to improve
the effectiveness of government spending. Immediate efforts are to be focused on pension and
health care reform, reform of state-owned enterprises, as well as on public administration reform. In
the FBiH, new pension legislation, prepared with the assistance of the World Bank, is expected to be
submitted to parliament in the coming months.

The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) concluded in June 2015 found the
financial system at the aggregate level to be liquid, adequately capitalized, and resilient to
shocks. The financial system is dominated by a moderately concentrated banking sector which
compromises mostly foreign subsidiaries. A conservative regulatory framework and a traditional
banking model have supported high capital and liquidity buffers in the system. Banks have

Nevertheless, pockets of vulnerabilities exist among domestically-owned banks. Some
domestically-owned banks with governance and risk management shortcomings, high loan
concentration ratios, and higher levels of non-performing loans are struggling to meet capital
requirements or rely on government support. A number of detailed asset quality reviews (AQRs) of
banks that had been under enhanced supervision were conducted last year. Based on these, banking
supervisors required several banks to raise additional capital, much of which has been already
implemented. One small bank that failed to raise new capital was closed in late 2014 and insured
deposits were paid out quickly.
31.
Moreover, credit to the private sector is still stuck in low gear, as demand for new
loans is weak and banks continue to repair their balance sheets. A deterioration in banks’ asset
quality and profitability, together with an inadequate resolution and insolvency framework, have
resulted in a persistently high level of non-performing loans—14 percent of total loans at the end of
the first quarter of 2015, although these are largely provisioned for.
32.
Coordination among the various institutions involved in bank oversight has improved,
but there remain critical gaps in the financial sector safety net. The Standing Committee on
Financial Stability (SCFS) adopted an overarching contingency plan for BiH, focusing predominantly
on systemic events, including the role of the Fiscal Council, the fiscal coordination body between the
national and entity governments of BiH. The plan defines the principles of information exchange and
communication; the triggers for actions by all levels of government; and the tools and actions in the
event of severe financial sector difficulties. Significant deficiencies remain in the financial safety net,
especially with regard to resolution powers, institutional responsibility for resolution, and recovery
and resolution planning.

Policy advice
33.
Further efforts are needed to ensure financial sector stability and to help revive bank
lending. These include:


Taking strong and timely actions to deal with weaker banks. This will require developing a
more comprehensive strategy—backed by a thorough diagnostic assessment—including a
credible backstop to deal with any systemic cases. This includes: (i) completing pending AQRs
and requiring AQRs to be conducted also for banks that have been expanding rapidly in recent
years; (ii) setting clear deadlines for banks where AQRs revealed capital shortfalls to remedy
these; (iii) and closing any bank that continues to fail to meet capital requirements after the
deadline.



Finalizing new banking legislation, including elements to strengthen the financial sector
safety net. Both entities, supported by Fund staff, have made good progress in preparing new
banking laws that are consistent with EU directives and Basel requirements, but gaps remain,
and further assistance will be needed. These laws are expected to strengthen supervisors’
corrective and enforcement powers, introduce consolidated supervision, and improve crisis
management and resolution frameworks, including by designating resolution authorities.
Related legislation, such as the Deposit Insurance Agency law, and Banking Agency laws, will
need to be reviewed and amended accordingly, also to allow for the establishment of a single
resolution fund to deal with any failing systemic banks and for the Deposit Insurance Fund to
provide funding for bank resolution subject to the least cost principle.



Introducing legislative and regulatory changes to improve the framework for recovering
and resolving non-performing loans, including by facilitating out-of-court restructuring of
debts and the sale of non-performing loans by banks—including by clarifying the tax treatment
of loan sales and the establishment and supervision of private asset management companies.



Strengthening the liquidity management framework. Adding liquidity coverage ratios to the
liquidity regulations would help to improve banks’ liquidity risk management. Also, given the
current high level of liquidity in the system, reserve requirements for banks could be raised to
rebuild liquidity buffers, while they could be better tailored toward prudential purposes by
increasing the number of holding periods during which the bank under stress can breach the
reserve requirements and supplementing this with minimum holding thresholds and higher
penalty rates for a breach before more severe sanctions are applied.



Ensuring that remaining deficiencies in the legal and regulatory framework for combating
money laundering and the financing of terrorism are addressed. While progress has been
made in the last year, failure to complete this work by fully implementing the action plan agreed
with the Financial Action Task Force could result in serious obstacles to cross-border
transactions.

Box 2. Financial System Stability Assessment—Key Findings and Recommendations1
Systemic Solvency and Liquidity. Aggregate solvency and liquidity indicators of the banking system
appear broadly sound, but significant pockets of vulnerability exist within domestically-owned banks, some
of which are struggling to meet capital requirements, while some others are relying on public support.
Decisive and timely actions to deal with weak banks are critical for preserving financial stability, including by
developing a comprehensive strategy—backed by a credible diagnostic assessment—to either facilitate the
recovery of weak banks or to resolve them in a cost-effective manner, while maintaining financial stability
and protecting insured depositors.
Financial Safety Net. The financial safety net needs to be strengthened by establishing resolution
authorities with comprehensive powers, appropriate resolution tools, and temporary and limited emergency
liquidity support—within the currency board arrangement—for solvent but illiquid banks. While the deposit
insurance system is largely compliant with international standards, shortening the payout period would be
appropriate. Well-coordinated contingency planning—domestic and cross-border—would contribute to an
effective financial safety net. A macro-prudential framework should be established, underpinned by broader
and more focused cooperation among the relevant agencies.
Banking and Insurance Oversight. Banking and insurance oversight has improved, but complex
institutional arrangements for cooperation among the various oversight institutions and the lack of
adequate governance and risk management have contributed to the vulnerabilities. The administrative
powers of the agencies to sanction and fine supervisory board members and significant owners are
inadequate, while the supervisory board selection process and internal audit functions of state banks need
to be strengthened. The identification of ultimate beneficial owners of banks needs to be strengthened as
related-party lending and group exposures are obscure. The prudential framework for the insurance sector
should be updated to improve its risk sensitivity. Consumer protection and financial literacy in the insurance
industry are weak and should be improved.
Resolution of NPLs. A High system-wide NPL ratio is a consequence of the impact of the crisis, low growth
since then, and a history of lax lending policies. Bank governance problems, related-party loans and
inadequate corporate resolution and insolvency frameworks pose significant obstacles to addressing asset
quality problems. The legal framework governing creditor/debtor relationships is comprehensive, but neither
debt resolution nor bankruptcy liquidation work effectively. There is a need to streamline execution
procedures, introduce incentives to facilitate corporate debt restructurings and resolution, and adopt out-ofcourt restructuring guidelines. Hiring more commercial court judges and improving the regulation of the
insolvency profession is needed.
Financial Market Infrastructure. The payment system meets the international standard, but liquidity and
legal risks exist, arising from the high concentration of transaction values in the payment systems across a
few banks and lack of legal certainty on finality and netting arrangements. Progress has been made in
enhancing the AML/CFT framework, but further efforts are necessary to address remaining deficiencies. The
securities market legal and regulatory framework is sound and the infrastructure is well developed. But the
markets would benefit from introducing a ‘passporting’ framework, and from increased transparency and
information disclosures. Leasing operations could be enhanced by revising collateral requirements and
strengthening repossession of assets.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities welcomed the FSSA findings and recommendations, especially its
efforts to tailor the advice to the country’s specific institutional set-up, and shared staff’s
assessment of banks’ health. They acknowledged that not having a single body that has the
mandate for financial supervision and crisis preparedness poses considerable challenges, particularly
in case of systemic events. The authorities emphasized that it is the role of the SCFS to coordinate
financial sector oversight and supervision, although they recognized that its efficiency and
effectiveness could be strengthened further. The banking agencies are considering expanding the
number of banks to undergo AQRs and are determined to close banks that continue to fail
minimum capital requirements after deadlines given for recapitalization expire.
35.
Views of the SCFS members on how best to create an effective bank restructuring and
resolution framework diverged. Some considered a centralized restructuring and resolution
authority at the state level to be optimal, while others preferred to keep resolution powers fully at
the entity level. Staff’s suggestion to establish a single resolution fund for systemic banks under the
Deposit Insurance Agency, while maintaining the banking agencies as resolution authorities could
be a pragmatic solution, provided an appropriate governance structure for the resolution fund can
be agreed upon.
36.
The authorities agreed with the need to revive bank lending to support economic
growth. They expect greater impact from improving the court systems and new bankruptcy
legislation to address non-performing loans than from facilitating out-of-court restructuring. Banks,
on the other hand, saw greater merit in the latter. The authorities stressed they are committed to
address remaining shortcomings in the AML/CFT framework.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
37.
Looking ahead, with strong implementation of economic reforms as outlined in the
authorities’ Reform Agenda, growth could reach 4 percent over the medium term. Moreover, if
external official support can be mobilized, fiscal consolidation could be pursued more gradually,
allowing fiscal policy—in the absence of an independent monetary policy—to better support the
economic recovery. Reconstruction efforts could also substantially add to growth, if the authorities
would be able to speed up the absorption of assistance that donors have made available, by
accelerating the preparation and approval of projects. With sustained and strong growth, incomes
could be expected to gradually catch up to levels elsewhere in Europe. This active policy scenario
that reflects the authorities’ commitment to reforms and sound economic policies is shown in tables
1–5. This scenario shows a financing need that could be filled with support from the EU and the IFIs,
who have pledged support depending on strong implementation of the Reform Agenda.

38.
This outlook is subject to substantial risks, however. Notably, domestic political risks
weigh heavily on the outlook, as the risk of policy slippages and delays in implementation of the
Reform Agenda is significant given the complex political set-up and the strong opposition to
reforms from vested interests. On the external side, as highlighted in the attached Risk Assessment
Matrix, risks are more balanced, as stagnation in Europe, possible financial market strains, or geopolitical tensions could dampen growth, while a faster recovery in Europe or the resolution of trade
issues between BiH and the EU could spur exports.

39.
In an alternative scenario without
reforms and external financial support,
growth prospects are likely to be much
weaker than in the baseline. Fiscal policy, as
noted above, would have to be tightened faster,
hurting growth. Private investment would remain
low, as would private sector job creation and
export growth. Such a passive scenario of
muddling through would not need to lead to
economic instability, but would rather imply a
lower growth path. This passive scenario is shown in tables 6–10. Incomes, however, would continue
to fall behind relative to the rest of Europe, which could result in increased popular discontent and
further emigration.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The economy is showing welcome signs of recovery. Following last year’s devastating
floods, activity recovered more quickly than anticipated, testament to the resilience of the
population. The widening of external and fiscal imbalances, as well as the impact on the banking
system, remained much more limited than had been feared, despite the substantial damage and
hardship caused by the disaster.
41.
The authorities have implemented sound macro-economic policies in the last several
years. External and internal imbalances have been gradually reduced, mainly through fiscal
consolidation and in an economic environment that was much more adverse than had been
projected. The exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, but poor business
conditions and skills mismatches restrain external dynamism and growth. The overall budget deficit
has been substantially reduced, although the public sector remains large while the quality of public
spending is poor. The banking system has weathered the global financial crisis and subsequent
period of weak growth relatively well, but pockets of vulnerabilities exist and lending is stuck in low
gear.
42.
Much remains to be done if incomes are to catch up faster to the levels in more
advanced European countries and if the very high level of unemployment is to be reduced.
The authorities will need to implement an ambitious policy agenda to accelerate private sector
growth and reduce unemployment, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The authorities will
need to mobilize adequate external financing so that fiscal policy can strike a balance between
resuming consolidation, to place public debt on a firm downward path, and supporting the nascent
recovery. Financial policies will need to address remaining vulnerabilities in the banking system,
while creating a stronger financial sector safety net and enabling banks’ balance sheet repair. But
most of all, strong progress will need to be made to complete the still largely unfinished structural
reform agenda. Urgent action is needed to further improve the business environment and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

functioning of the labor market to attract investment, raise potential output, and create more private
sector jobs.
43.
The adoption by the authorities of an ambitious and comprehensive Reform Agenda
is a welcome and significant step, but what will matter is strong and sustained
implementation. While there is broad support for the Reform Agenda and its implementation is off
to a good start, reforms take time and the authorities will need to overcome strong opposition from
vested interests. The uncertain and fragile domestic political situation poses considerable risks to the
timely implementation of reform measures and continuation of sound macro-economic policies.
Delays in reform implementation could also delay the availability of external support. On the other
hand, strong implementation of reforms and sound economic policies would allow BiH to achieve
faster growth and to make stronger progress on the road toward EU accession.
44.
BiH has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on foreign currency
deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Staff does not recommend approval of these
restrictions.
45.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Prior to 2010, assets classified as loss, alongside the provisions made against them, were held off-balance sheet by banks in BiH.
This lowered the reported NPL ratios and coverage of nonperforming loans by provisions. Starting with the December 2010 data
in the RS, and the December 2011 data in the Federation, banks record on-balance sheet the "loss" loans and related accrued
interest and provisions, resulting in a structural break in the series.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Box 3. Bosnia and Herzegovina: External Public Debt
Most of BiH’s external debt is public debt.
Following the end of the wars in the region, the private
sector gradually accumulated external debt as BiH
integrated into the global economy. At the same time,
small government borrowing needs led to the decline
in public external debt. This picture changed after the
global financial crisis, as the private sector’s access to
international capital markets worsened, while
government finances worsened and the public sector
started to accumulate debt.

Table 1. Debt by Main Creditors
(in million KMs, end-2014)

BiH has borrowed mostly from official creditors. Unlike
other emerging economies, BiH has not accessed
international capital markets. Multilateral and bilateral official
creditors have provided substantial financial support for the
country. The largest creditors are the World Bank (22 percent
of public external debt), the European Investment Bank (18
percent) and the IMF (13 percent). As for the World Bank, BiH
graduated to IBRD only status in 2014. In addition, BiH
recently acquired credit ratings from Moody’s (B3) and
Standard and Poor’s (B).

The two entities (the FBiH and the RS) are the main borrowers, although they usually borrow with a
guarantee of the Institutions of BiH. A large part of the loans are on-lent by the entity governments to
local governments and public companies, such as the

Safeguards Assessment
An update of the safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)
was conducted in August 2014 in connection with the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
augmentation and extension approved on June 30, 2014. The last safeguards assessment for the
CBBH was completed in March 2013. The update found that the CBBH continues to maintain a
robust governance structure and that all key recommendations from the March 2013 assessment
have been implemented. External audit oversight has increased, and the legal function has been
strengthened. Additionally, while controls in reserve management, currency operations and
transactions with government were deemed adequate, the assessment noted that a
comprehensive risk management framework has yet to be established.
Exchange Rate Arrangements
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency of Bosnia
and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on August 11, 1997. On September 5,
2002, the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina approved an amendment to the CBBH law that
changes the peg of the KM from the Deutsch Mark to the Euro under a currency board
arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BiH) has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4 and therefore avails
itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. BiH no longer maintains restrictions
under the transitional provisions of Article XIV. It maintains restrictions on the transferability of
balances and interest accrued on frozen foreign-currency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction
under Article VIII. An Article VIII mission by LEG and MCM took place in October 2012 to address
pending Article VIII issues.
FSAP and ROSC Assessment
An FSAP mission took place in November 2014; and the Executive Board discussed the Financial
System Stability Assessment in June 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/164). The authorities
approved publishing the FSSA and all technical notes. A data ROSC mission was held in
November 2007 and the ROSC Data Module was published in February 2008 (IMF Country
Report No. 08/43).
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on October 05, 2012 (IMF Country Report
No. 12/282).
Resident Representative
The IMF has had a resident representative office in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996.
Mr. Francisco Parodi assumed his position as a resident representative in August 2015.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
The Bank and the Fund country teams in Bosnia and Herzegovina maintain close collaboration,
coordinate the two institutions’ activities and plans, and harmonize policy recommendations.
Key Areas of World Bank Involvement


The current World Bank program in Bosnia and Herzegovina was based on the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) adopted in 2011, and focusing on three pillars: (i) competitiveness,
(ii) social inclusion, and (iii) environmental sustainability. In support of the competitiveness
agenda, the World Bank provided two Development Policy Loans (DPLs) supporting
macroeconomic stability and business environment. Additionally, the Bank portfolio includes
investment lending in irrigation and land registration, and has provided access to finance for
small and medium enterprises via financial intermediaries. The International Financial
Corporation (IFC) also provides support through advisory services in the areas of regulatory
reform and regulatory simplification, as well as investment policy work. Under social
inclusion, the Bank program supports improvement in targeting social benefits, more
effective job-brokerage services, expanded access to primary health care, and improved
access to basic public services. To promote environmental sustainability, the Bank
supports projects to respond to past disasters and prepare for a growing risk of floods and
droughts, and to improve the energy efficiency of public buildings. The Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy also actively promotes the EU accession agenda and this represents a
cross-cutting theme of the strategy.



The current portfolio of Bank-supported operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 13
projects totaling $590.82 million. Areas of support include agriculture and irrigation services,
health and social protection, environment, local infrastructure and services, real estate
registration, and support for small and medium enterprises.

BiH is also a member of the IFC, which has invested about $385.1 million since starting
operations there in 1996. The IFC portfolio in BiH is currently $92.8 million and focuses on
improvements in the country’s investment climate, manufacturing, agribusiness,
infrastructure, and climate change. IFC is also focusing its efforts in BiH on supporting private
sector participation in infrastructure development in roads, health, and renewable energy.



The Bank is currently preparing its new Country Partnership Framework for the five-year
engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposed CPF structure focuses on:
(i) increasing public sector performance; (ii) creating conditions for accelerated private sector
growth; and (iii) building resilience to natural shocks, with Inclusion as the cross-cutting
theme.



The Bank’s planned activities in BiH covering structural reform areas will depend on the
outcome of the CPF discussions with governments in BiH. One of the first planned operations
under the new CPF is Public Finance Development Policy Loan (DPL) which is currently under
preparation. This operation will support the policy efforts of the government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to strengthen public finances, in particular, (1) improve the management and
transparency of public resources through interlinked reforms related to debt management,
public investment management, public arrears and financial sector; and (2) improve the
efficiency of government spending by tackling labor rigidities in public employment and
increasing the efficiency of health and social protection spending.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of September 2, 2015)

I. ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
accuracy, timeliness, and publication of economic statistics has improved, but weaknesses in
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payment statistics need to be
addressed.

Real Sector: BiH has made efforts to improve the real sector statistics. The country has
benefited from extensive technical support from the IMF and the European Union. With the
assistance of the IMF resident real sector statistics advisor, BiH started compiling and
publishing quarterly national accounts as of mid-2014. Additional efforts have been invested
into closing the gap between the production and expenditure-based GDP estimates and in the
improvement of coverage of GDP, mainly with an ongoing review of the calculations of the
non-observed economic activities (NOE). Outstanding issues are the need for further
improvements to the annual and quarterly compilation of GDP by expenditure at the country
level.
Price statistics: A consumer price index (CPI), based on internationally-recommended
practices, has been implemented. This CPI was released in 2007, and consistent series are
available monthly countrywide and for each entity, with the series starting in January 2005. The
CPI weights are derived from the household budget survey, conducted since 2004. Also,
producer price indices (PPI) are available for both Entities and countrywide. The Industrial
Production index at the country level has been made available in 2009 with historical time
series going back till 2006. Both the industrial production index and the producer price index
are compiled and disseminated at the national and entity level based on harmonized
methodology. The annual Labor Force Survey follows international methodological standards
and provides data for the country and the entities since 2006.
External Sector: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBBH. Stating from 2012,
BOP are completed in line with sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6) and is
of good quality. To improve the compilation of services the implementation of new surveys
will be required that follow BPM6. The compilation of remittances relies heavily on estimates.
Export and import data are produced from customs records, but on a special trade basis rather
than on a general trade basis. Trade data may also be subject to incomplete coverage and
under-invoicing.
Government Finance Statistics: The CBBH compiles government finance statistics (GFS) in
accordance with the definitions and concepts of the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001. While the institutional coverage of the GFS is broadly consistent with international
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

guidelines, its scope does not cover all economic stocks (balance sheet data) and flows. To
address this issue and with help of the IMF TA, the CBBH has been preparing the balance sheet
and debt data for general government. However, the data have not been published yet. In
addition, the GFS does not include full transactions related to projects directly financed by
international donors, and quarterly statistics exclude all transactions in financial assets and
liabilities due to incomplete quarterly source data. Transactions are recorded on a mixed
accrual/cash basis.1 External government debt data are published quarterly; however work
remains to be done on compiling and publishing public sector debt statistics. Authorities have
made an effort to improve the quality of the GFS prepared by ministries of finance. More work
is required to improve the quality of consolidated general government data.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on a
countrywide and Entity basis. As of 2011, the CBBH reports monetary data to the Fund in the
Standardized Report Forms developed by STA that embody the methodology of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBBH collects data using the standardized report forms. As
of 2002, interest rate statistics compiled and published by the CBBH produces harmonized
data on level of the average weighted lending and deposit nominal interest rates of
commercial banks in BiH, presented at the annual level. Finally, the CBBH extended the
coverage of its annual financial sector statistics to encompass approximately 98 financial
institutions (investment funds, insurance companies, microcredit institutions, leasing
companies, brokerage houses, and stock exchanges).
II. DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
BiH is subscriber to the Fund’s General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) since April 2013.

1

At the State level, some earmarked revenues are not recorded until the corresponding expenditure takes place.
In the Federation, expenditures are not entered into the Treasury payment system if there are no available funds
to pay them out or if obligations exceed the budgeted amounts.

Appendix Table 1. Bosnia and Herzegovina: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Tsvetan Manchev, Advisor to Executive Director
October 23, 2015

The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) very much appreciate the informative and
constructive dialogue with the Fund. They would like to express their gratitude to the IMF
team, headed by Mr. van Rooden, for its dedicated work and good advice in the recent years.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations
provided in the report and accompanying selected issues paper. These, together with the
substantial technical assistance by the Fund and other donors, have contributed to the
adoption by the authorities of a comprehensive Reform Agenda earlier this year.
Continuous discussions with the international community have helped the authorities to
steadily frame the adequate policy measures needed to boost the growth and resilience of the
economy, and safeguard the macro-financial stability and fiscal sustainability going forward.
The external and internal imbalances have been gradually reduced in the recent years, mainly
through fiscal consolidation and some progress in structural reforms. A firm budget deficit
reduction under the recent Fund-supported program was achieved despite a worsened
external economic environment, a complex domestic institutional setup and political
situation, and last year’s devastating floods. The economic recovery is under way, and
growth is expected to rebound to over 2 percent this year, and to reach 3 percent in 2016.
The authorities stand ready to use every window of opportunity and further progress with the
necessary reforms to unleash the economic potential of the country. They have been working
on a possible successor arrangement with the Fund. The new governments keep focusing on
structural reforms to support private sector development and job creation, while its near-term
plan includes two main pillars: (1) sustainable further fiscal consolidation and a more
efficient management of public finance resources; and (2) strengthening financial stability
through system-wide legal amendments and institutional enhancements in line with the
recent FSAP recommendations.
Structural reforms
The governments at every level that came to office following the general elections in October
2014 recognize the urgent need to step up the pace of economic reforms to accelerate
economic growth and create more jobs, and to improve the living standards of the people of
BiH. The Reform Agenda adopted in July this year sets out the main plans of the BiH
Council of Ministers and the governments of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS) for socio-economic reforms in the coming years.
Through the new Reform Agenda implementation, efforts to ensure fiscal and financial
sustainability will be augmented by measures to strengthen the rule of law and the fight
against corruption, and to invigorate administrative capabilities and increase the efficiency of
public institutions at all levels of government. The authorities are confident that steadfast
implementation of their Reform Agenda will also help them on the road toward accession to
the EU. However, the highly uncertain and volatile environment, both external and domestic,

2
poses challenges and makes it difficult to achieve the needed broad political and social
consensus for smooth and timely policy implementation.
Important steps have been made in the last two years under the Fund-supported program to
improve the business environment. In line with the WB recommendations a one-stop shop for
business registration was established in the RS to make it easier to start and operate a
business. Similarly, in the FBiH, the Law on Business Registration was amended, and a new
Law on Inspections and a Law on Companies were adopted. The authorities work to further
reduce the administrative burden on businesses, with a particular emphasis on harmonizing
regulations between the entities. They also aim to improve the commercial dispute resolution
framework, including by adopting new entity bankruptcy legislation developed with the
assistance of the WB, and to enhance the court system. Based on the achievements, the
authorities expect to complete the process of WTO accession in the coming year and to
resolve the remaining trade issues with the EU. With the assistance of the EBRD,
restructuring plans for the energy sector, public utility companies and railways are in the
process of preparation, focused on increased efficiency, costs savings, and tariff adjustment
to provide full cost recovery and sustainable commercial operations.
Unemployment reduction is the top priority of the BiH authorities. The country failed to
significantly benefit from employment gains during the boom years while it still registers
significant job losses in the aftermath of the global crisis. In this regard, the authorities
welcome the staff paper that devotes more attention to this main challenge for economic
policymaking and provides valuable policy recommendations on the labor market reforms.
The FBiH has already adopted a new Labor Code in line with the WB recommendations, and
the parliament of the RS will soon consider the new Labor Code. These new laws will be
supported by stepped-up labor inspections, active labor market policies, including by
expanding training and education opportunities, and reform in the system of unemployment
benefits.

Fiscal Policy
To make fiscal consolidation sustainable, the authorities will continue to implement fiscal
reforms, which aim to improve revenue collection, contain current non-priority spending to
create room for investment in infrastructure, and improve the efficiency of public finances.
They are committed to preserving the integrity of the system of indirect taxation and
broadening the base at the state level in order to ensure the continued high level of budget
revenues delivered by indirect taxes. In line with the staff advice, amendments at the entity
level will be made to the corporate and personal taxation to strengthen budgetary revenues.
The public administration reform, which is implemented with the EU assistance, remains
critical to contain current non-priority spending to create room for investment in
infrastructure, and improve the efficiency of public finances. It is supported by an attrition
rule in public administration hiring and stringent control over the public sector wage
increases. The authorities also strive to improve the targeting of social assistance to protect
the most vulnerable, and to strengthening controls over lower levels of government, extrabudgetary funds, and state-owned enterprises. The implementation of a more efficient

3
spending control is facilitated by the progressive expansion of the treasury systems to lower
levels of government.
Financial stability and sustainability
The authorities firmly believe that the Currency Board Arrangements (CBA) remains the
appropriate anchor for all its policies in the long run and until the potential EU accession and
eventual euro adoption. The CBA, however, needs to be continuously supported by the other
policies in line with the recent FSAP recommendations. Given that the model of financial
supervision set at the entities level in BiH is unique among the world supervisory practices,
the authorities have established a high-level Standing Committee for Financial Stability to
coordinate, and especially to better sequence and synchronize the financial sector oversight
and supervision. The authorities are committed to steadily increase the institutional capacity
of all supervisors and their enforcement power.
The recent FSSA concluded that the financial system at the aggregate level is liquid,
adequately capitalized and resilient to shocks, although some pockets of vulnerability exist.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy and financial system are still dealing with the
aftershocks of the global financial crisis and underlying vulnerabilities arising from sluggish
growth, tight macroeconomic conditions, slow credit growth, high NPLs and weakened
profitability of financial institutions. Against this background, the authorities are committed
to further developing systemic liquidity management in a conservative manner and strictly
observing the limitations of the legal framework underpinning the CBA. They work on
broadening the scope of the 2014 Contingency Plan. In the current juncture, one of the most
pressing issues for the authorities remains the creation of a credible, transparent and effective
bank restructuring and resolution mechanism. The authorities also envisage signing
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the remaining home country supervisors of the
systemically important banks, and extending the coverage of existing MoUs.
Finally, the authorities have made progress with addressing the AML/CFT issues through the
enactment of a new AML/CFT Law and amendments to the Criminal Code. To enhance
implementation of the existing AML/CFT action plan, the authorities envisage improvements
in coordination and cooperation among the various agencies at the state and entity levels.
