NORWAY
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Norway
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Adnan Mazarei
May 10, 2007
Executive Summary
Against a backdrop of strong growth and tightening capacity constraints, the
discussions focused on policy requirements for continued noninflationary growth,
longer-term fiscal sustainability, and key structural issues.
The authorities and staff agreed that further interest rate increases are warranted to
head off inflationary pressures. The financial sector appears to be in good health, but
risks have risen. The supervisor is closely monitoring the situation, although its scope
for action is limited by the possibility that foreign bank subsidiaries will, if pressed,
switch to branches, which would not be supervised by Norway.
Staff welcomed that the relevant fiscal deficit would, for the first time, be 4 percent of
Government Pension Fund (GPF) assets. It was agreed that the deficit should be held
below this benchmark until demand pressures ease. To manage increasing petroleum
revenues, staff recommended tax cuts rather than spending increases, (current policy is
to keep the revenue-GDP ratio at the 2004 level), and a medium-term fiscal framework,
although the authorities viewed the existing fiscal guidelines as fulfilling this role.
Staff welcomed the recent parliamentary agreement on pension reform, and the
intention to pursue complementary reforms. Staff argued that further reform should be
considered to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.
Norwegian labor markets perform well, but it was agreed that the challenge of the
growing sickness and disability schemes was a high priority. The mission argued for
continued aggressive enforcement of competition law, and that the strong governance
system for state-owed enterprises be maintained and further privatization considered.
Data are adequate for surveillance, and in some instances very strong by international
comparison. An improved labor force survey and an establishment survey would
enhance the analysis of labor market developments.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The economy is booming, while inflation has been moderate (Table 1, Figure 1).
Real GDP growth has been above potential (estimated at 2½–3 percent) for 3 years, and
was 4.6 percent in 2006.1 Activity is being driven by strong external demand, high world
prices for petroleum products (Norway was the world’s fifth largest oil exporter in 2006)
and other Norwegian exports, supportive monetary conditions, and a somewhat
expansionary fiscal stance. Despite rising pressure on capacity (Figure 2), core inflation
was about 1 percent in 2006, well below the 2.5 percent inflation target, but ticked up to
1.5 percent in March (Figure 3). Falling import prices and increased domestic competition
and productivity in some sectors have held prices down. Labor costs have also been
moderate, reflecting labor inflows from the new EU member countries, a substantial
cyclical increase in the participation rate, strong productivity growth, low inflation, and the
credible inflation targeting framework.
2.
However, demand pressures are building, especially in labor markets.
Employment is rising very rapidly, the unemployment rate has fallen to near-record lows,
and reports of labor shortages and wage drift are increasing. Labor markets could be very
tight when the two-year wage settlement will be up for renegotiation in early 2008 and,
although the main labor and employer organizations favor wage moderation, market
pressures will be strong. An important uncertainty is the role of large inflows of migrant
workers, notably from the new EU countries (Box 1). These flows are not well measured,
since residents of Nordic countries can work in Norway without permits and thus are not
recorded, and inflows from elsewhere are imperfectly captured.
3.
The external position is strong. The overall current account has a large surplus,
and the non-oil current account deficit has narrowed slightly, despite increased imports of
investment goods, because of improving terms of trade (Table 2, Figure 4). On a range of
indicators, the exchange rate seems broadly appropriate, and Norway does not intervene on
the exchange market. Export market shares in value terms have changed little and
exporters’ profits are strong, suggesting international competitiveness has been maintained.
The krone has been broadly stable in nominal effective terms and against the euro, although
it has appreciated somewhat against the dollar (Figure 5). In real terms it has appreciated
on a unit labor cost basis, but is not far from its long-term average on a consumer price
basis.

Box 1. Labor Inflows and Inflationary Pressure
The influx of immigrants in Norway is
widely believed to have moderated wage
growth, allowing for easier monetary
conditions than otherwise. A comparison
across industries in Norway of the
change in average basic salary and
measures of immigrant penetration lends
support to this view.

average wage growth from 2001–05.
Those with the lowest average wage
growth tend to have either the highest share of resident immigrants (Real Estate and Health)
or the highest growth rate (Construction and Transport and Communication). Particularly
notable is the moderate wage increase in construction, which has expanded rapidly during the
housing boom but also attracted the largest rise in immigrant workers.

Owing to lack of comparable data, these figures exclude nonresident immigrants who work
for six months or less, or commute across the border everyday. While the levels are smaller,
growth of this type of immigrant has reportedly exceeded those of others.

5

Purchasing power parity calculations suggest the krone is overvalued, reflecting some
Dutch disease effects, while staff cross-country estimates of fundamental exchange rates
(using the CGER methodology) suggest undervaluation, reflecting the mitigation of those
effects by the policy of investing petroleum revenue abroad.
4.
The well-developed macroeconomic policy framework has underpinned robust
noninflationary growth.2
•

Fiscal guidelines, adopted in 2001 and effective since the 2002 budget, hold the
central government structural non-oil deficit to 4 percent (equal to the assumed longrun real rate of return) of the assets of the Government Pension Fund-Global (GPF;
formerly the Petroleum Fund). While the 4-percent rule has never been met, the
guidelines have successfully restrained deficits, insulated the budget from oil-market
shocks, resulted in the bulk of petroleum revenues being saved, and restrained the
increase in real exchange rates that would have resulted had those revenues been
spent instead. 3

•

Monetary policy has since 2001 been governed by a target of 2½ percent consumer
price inflation and a flexible exchange rate. This framework has been strengthened by
fostering transparency (annual testimony by the Norges Bank (NB) governor to
parliament, annual external policy evaluation, and thrice-yearly policy reports),
improved governance (a revamped executive board), and a well articulated policy
framework (comprehensive press releases following interest-setting meetings and
explicit forecasts, including of interest rates).

•

The center-left coalition reaffirmed both policy regimes upon taking office in 2005,
and the recent record of implementing Fund advice has been good (Table 3).
5.
Against this favorable policy backdrop and bright outlook, the challenges
facing policymakers revolve around ensuring continued noninflationary growth and
long-term fiscal sustainability. The task for monetary policy is to allow inflation to rise
back to its target while avoiding overshooting and a subsequent sharp rise in the policy
interest rate. Indicators suggest the financial sector is sound, although it faces rising risks

associated with rapid loan expansion. Fiscal restraint can play a role in easing demand
pressure in the short and medium term. While petroleum revenue puts medium-term fiscal
and external sustainability beyond doubt, population aging poses a long-term threat to
fiscal sustainability.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. The Outlook
6.
The authorities and staff agreed that economic growth will remain strong,
though moderating somewhat (Table 1).4 Strong employment and wages should help to
sustain consumption, but rising interest rates are expected to slow house-price increases
and ease residential investment growth. Petroleum investment growth is expected to fall off
its 2006 peak. And with firms increasingly reporting hiring difficulties, lack of capacity
may constrain output growth, notwithstanding continued inflows of labor, both from the
Nordic region and the new EU member states. Inflation is projected by both staff and the
authorities to rise gradually to the 2½ percent target.
7.
This outlook, while balanced, faces a number of risks. Unexpected changes to oil
prices or world growth would affect incomes, investment, and exports. While rapid credit
growth may continue to fuel the economic expansion—total credit has doubled since end1999—it also poses risks to households, some of which have become overextended, and to
banks, if credit quality weakens (see Section C). On the supply side, capacity constraints
pose the risk that inflation may rise faster than projected, especially if improving labor
markets in eastern Europe restrain labor inflows to Norway.
B. Monetary Policy
8.
The authorities and staff agreed that further interest rate increases were
needed to head off inflationary pressures. Although underlying measures of inflation are
still below the inflation target, staff analysis suggests that core inflation may be
underestimating underlying inflationary pressures.5 NB recently stepped up the pace of
interest rate increases, and in its March 2007 Monetary Policy Report (formerly the
Inflation Report) raised slightly its interest rate forecast. The authorities noted that, in view
of low inflation, real rates had already risen substantially, while nominal rates would have

The April Consensus Forecast for real GDP growth is 3.7 percent in 2007 and 2.8 percent in 2008.

Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper uses a statistical technique to divide inflation into an “underlying” and
an “idiosyncratic” component for a selection of advanced economies. For Norway, core inflation (CPI-ATE)
has an idiosyncratic component implying that it will rise toward “underlying” inflation over time.

7

to rise further as inflation approached the target. The mission judged monetary conditions
to have tightened substantially, but to be still somewhat expansionary. Exchange rates were
not apparently misaligned; real interest rates calculated using expected (rather than actual)
inflation were still below NB’s estimated neutral band of 2½ to 3½ percent; and nominal
interest rates were below what Taylor rules would suggest (Figure 6).

The inflation targeting framework appears to have gained considerable
credibility. Surveys suggest that medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored at
2.5 percent (Figure 3), and the social partners seem well aware that excessive wage
increases would trigger monetary tightening. However, some interlocutors in the private
sector argued that policy should emphasize exchange rate stability more, which in some
circumstances could conflict with inflation targeting. NB has always been clear that it
considers exchange rate developments only insofar as they affect inflation, and the mission
emphasized that policy should strive to meet the inflation target even if this meant some
short-term appreciation of the krone. Staff argued for continued efforts to explain inflation
targeting, including the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
C. The Financial System
10.
The financial sector is thriving. Banks remain well capitalized and profitable, with
low nonperforming loans and loan losses (Tables 4–6 and Figure 7), and NB’s latest
Financial Stability Report suggests that banks have the capital to absorb large interest-rate
shocks, although some would need to shore up their capital. Recently, international ratings
of several banks, including the largest bank, have been upgraded. The bulk of the
recommendations of the 2005 FSAP, which found the financial system sound and well
supervised, have been implemented (Table 7).
11.
However, prolonged rapid credit growth, the steep rise in house prices, and
increasingly aggressive mortgage lending practices pose increasing risks. Measured
against income, household debt (including that of young and poorer households) has risen
sharply and stands at historically high levels. Much of the increase has been in mortgages,
which historically have had low default rates, but a rise in interest rates or an economic
slowdown would rapidly affect borrowers, since more than 90 percent of mortgages carry
floating interest rates. More recently, lending to nonfinancial enterprises has also picked up
sharply. Asset markets have also been booming. House prices have risen rapidly, with
NB’s December Financial Stability report suggesting they are some 10 percent above what
could be explained by fundamentals (although the report stresses the uncertainty of these
calculations), thus posing a risk of correction. Similarly, equity prices on the Oslo Stock
Exchange, which has been more volatile than other exchanges, have more than tripled since
the beginning of 2003, reflecting high oil prices and strong profits in the cyclical upswing.

12.
The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSAN) is closely monitoring credit
developments and has been urging more cautious mortgage lending practices. The
mission expressed particular concern that lenders seemed to be increasingly aggressive,
with the proportion of mortgages carrying floating-rates, interest-only payments, or very
high loan-to-value ratios (sometimes exceeding 100 percent) all rising. The authorities
concurred, but noted that Norway does not have a “sub-prime” market, loan losses are very
low, and some new instruments reflected catch-up to practices elsewhere. While
emphasizing sound lending, FSAN argued that its scope for raising capital requirements
was limited because foreign banks could easily change from subsidiaries (which are
supervised by FSAN) to branches (which are not), which would blunt the effect of such a
measure. The five Norwegian banks that have been given approval to use the internal
ratings based (IRB) approach under Basel II are, according to the EU Directives, not
allowed to reduce their capital to less than 95 percent, 90 percent, and 80 percent of that
required under Basel I in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively.6
D. Fiscal Policy
13.
The 2007 budget outturn will most probably achieve the 4-percent rule, but the
fiscal stance will nevertheless be somewhat expansionary. The budget implies a central
government non-oil structural deficit only marginally greater than 4 percent of the GPF, but
staff estimates that the general government non-oil structural budget deficit is set to rise by
about ½ percent of GDP in 2007 (Tables 8 and 9, Figure 8). Given the cyclical situation,
the mission argued that any budgetary overperformance in 2007 be used for deficit
reduction. Likewise, budgets for 2008 and beyond should aim for deficits well below
4 percent of the GPF until demand pressures ease. Such a policy is fully consistent with the
fiscal guidelines, which explicitly allow for countercyclical policy. Indeed, in 2003 the
deficit was allowed to exceed 4 percent of the GPF in the context of an economic

slowdown. The authorities agreed that countercyclical policy would be wise, but it was too
soon to assess windfalls this year or discuss the details of the 2008 budget.

The authorities and staff also
discussed how to deal with the mediumterm fiscal expansion implied by the
guidelines. With oil prices much higher
than in 2001, when the guidelines were
put in place, the 4-percent rule means the
structural deficit will rise by some
¾ percent of GDP each year.7
One possible response would be to shift to
a fiscal rule that is more restrictive than
that now in place, which could both limit
the rise in spending in the next few years
and provide more resources in the long
term to meet the costs of population
aging.8 However, given the success of the
current guidelines, neither the authorities
nor staff argued for such a change. Within
these guidelines, staff argued that tax cuts
would promote growth, especially given
the large size of government in Norway,
but the authorities have announced that
the ratio of revenue to GDP will be
maintained at its 2004 level. In the
absence of tax cuts, therefore, real
government spending (using the GDP
deflator) could rise by some 4 percent a
year. Accordingly, the mission reiterated
its advice to adopt a medium-term plan
that would help to guide policy and
reduce the risk of waste. The authorities
argued that a spending ceiling, which

central, state and local governments plus social security. Non-tax receipts consist

government, etc.
1/ Includes deferred tax payments on postal savings accounts in 2000, 2001 and
2002. In 2002 corporate pension funds were authorised to transfer back to the
government the basic part of their employees' pension scheme. This resulted in a
capital transfer to the government which reduced the general government financial
deficit by 0.1 percentage point of GDP in 2003 and 1.2 percentage point in 2004.
Further transfers are assumed for 2005 and 2006 worth 1.0 and 0.2 percentage
point of GDP respectively.

As a rule of thumb, a 10 percent increase in oil prices raises the annual fiscal impulse by 0.1 percentage point
of GDP.

some other countries have adopted, might conflict with the current fiscal guidelines and the
government’s revenue policy, and noted that the finance ministry already produces threeyear fiscal projections.

The key long-term fiscal issue is the rise in spending related to population
aging, and there was agreement that petroleum wealth will probably not cover these
costs. The 2007 budget projects pension spending will rise by about 10 percentage points
of GDP by 2060, reflecting a system that is both generous and still maturing.9 Staff
calculations suggest that, on current policies and projections, in 2060, income from the
GPF will cover only about 2 percentage points of this gap. Moreover, the fiscal guidelines
imply that, as a percent of GDP, spending from petroleum wealth will rise until the early
2020s but then gradually decline thereafter (Box 2). Thus, in the long term, in the absence
of pension reform, large cuts in nonpension spending (including any build-up during the
deficit expansion, as discussed above) or tax increases would be required.

9

See Chapter 2 of the selected issues paper. Aging could also cause additional spending on health and longterm care of 3.2 percent of GDP; see OECD, 2003, "Policies For An Ageing Society: Recent Measures And
Areas For Further Reform," Economics Department Working Paper No.369 (ECO/WKP(2003)23.

Box 2. Non-Oil Budget Deficit Path Under the 4-Percent Rule
In percent of mainland GDP, the 4-percent fiscal rule implies a hump-shaped non-oil budget
deficit. Under oil price and recovery assumptions of the 2007 budget, GPF assets are expected to
peak at 240 percent of mainland GDP in 2022 and gradually decline thereafter. Similarly, the non-oil
deficit allowed by the rule peaks at 9½ percent of mainland GDP in 2023 and declines toward zero
thereafter.

Source: IMF staff estimates. Until 2030, the baseline scenario is based on the 2007 budget projections of oil prices and revenues.
Thereafter, oil production is assumed to decline gradually. The upper/lower band corresponds to 20 percent higher/lower oil prices
and 50 basis points higher/lower yield on government assets.

By contrast, projected pension spending rises steadily, requiring substantial cuts in non-pension
primary spending or sharp increases in taxes under the 4-percent rule. In the absence of pension
reforms, and assuming an unchanged revenue-to-GDP ratio, nonpension primary spending would
have to be cut by more than 10 percentage points of GDP in the long run, but by about 3 percentage
points less after the effects of the recently agreed pension reform are taken into account.

Parliament agreed a package of reforms that promises significant long-term budgetary
savings, and staff urged its quick implementation (Box 3). A key advantage of the new
system is its actuarial neutrality, as the replacement rate will rise with later retirement. This
feature insulates pension spending from retirement decisions, and promises to expand labor
supply. However, the latter benefit will only be fully realized if the early retirement scheme
(AFP), run by the social partners but subsidized by the government, is reformed. The
authorities will invite the social partners to a dialogue on the revision of the AFP-scheme.
Also, disability pension benefits will have to be aligned with the overall system, especially as
regards indexation. A commission is to report on disability pensions in the first half of 2007.
The mission argued that the agreed package, while welcome, would probably not ensure
pension-system solvency (leaving a gap of more than 4 percent of GDP by 2060), and
therefore further reform should be considered.
Box 3. Pension Reform
In 2001, the government appointed an independent multi-party Pension Commission to
propose reforms. The commission issued its final report in January 2004, on the basis of
which the government submitted a white paper to parliament in December 2004. In May
2005, parliament reached agreement on the main principles for a pension reform.
Another white paper, issued in October 2006, retained the key principles of the 2005
parliamentary agreement. In mid-March, 2007, parliament agreed a reform package that
closely follows the 2006 white paper. The key features are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

benefits will be based on lifetime earnings, instead of the best 20 years, as now;
benefits will be adjusted for life expectancy;
individual benefits will be actuarially neutral, with the replacement rate
depending on retirement age: it will be 26 percentage points lower for retirement
at 62 (rather than 67), and 24 percentage points higher for retirement at 70;
benefits will be indexed to the simple average of wages and prices, rather than to
wages as now (a minimum pension will be indexed to wages);
pensioners can work without loss of pension; and
compared to the 2004 white paper proposals, low and medium-income
households will receive somewhat more generous pensions.

The authorities estimate this package, to be implemented by 2010, would reduce
pension outlays by about 3 percent of GDP by 2050, largely reflecting the lifeexpectancy adjustment and the change to indexation. Actuarial neutrality is designed to
encourage later retirement, which may raise general tax revenues, an effect not included
in the cost-saving estimate.
Separately, occupational pension schemes, which supplement the public pension
system, were made mandatory for enterprises, starting in 2006.

14

E. Structural Policy
17.
The Norwegian labor market performs very well by international standards
(Figure 9), but rising enrollment in disability and sickness programs pose a risk.
These programs already account for a substantial fraction of the working-age population
and are imposing a significant fiscal burden.10 The Inclusive Workplace Agreement
between the government and social partners, which has been in place since 2001 and was
recently extended until end-2009, has led to better practices in some enterprises, but has not
come close to meeting targets for lower sickness inflows. Administrative reform of the
sickness program in 2004, involving stricter medical examinations, led to declines in days
lost. At the end of 2005, however, sick leave began to increase. A commission, headed by
the Prime Minister, has suggested new financial and accelerated activation measures with
an aim to reduce sickness absence. The measures are to be implemented this year. The
authorities noted that the new Public Employment and Welfare Service, combining three
welfare agencies, will promote a more integrated and efficient approach. The mission
agreed that better case management would be useful, and endorsed OECD proposals: rigor
in assessing potential beneficiaries; more frequent use of partial disability; enhancing the
responsibility of employers and employees;11 intensified efforts for rehabilitation; and
reduction of generous replacement rates, especially for sickness (with a 100 percent
replacement rate), which is frequently the gateway to disability, but also for disability (the
replacement rate can be high for some groups).

10

See “Sickness, Disability and Work: Breaking the Barriers,” Volume 1, OECD, 2006 for a discussion of
these programs and reform proposals.

11

However, the government’s proposal to increase the share of employers’ cofinancing met stiff resistance
from both employers and employees.

There was agreement that governance of the large state-owned sector was
strong. Reforms to governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the past few years
emphasized arms-length management, market-driven objectives, and transparency in
meeting social objectives via explicit contracts. The authorities noted that they benchmark
SOE performance and have concluded that they perform well with respect to peers, and
that they have no plans for further privatization, arguing that public ownership is needed to
ensure long-term economic development and control over natural resources. The
authorities and the mission concurred that a competitive market environment would be an
important discipline on SOEs. The mission argued that, nevertheless, state ownership itself
could be distorting: to (actual and potential) competitors, SOEs might be perceived as
having the advantage of government deep pockets, dissuading expansion or entry; and
SOEs are not subject to the market discipline of takeover, which is becoming increasingly
important with the rise in the size and sophistication of capital markets. The mission
therefore suggested that privatization would be appropriate in some cases.
19.
Domestic competition is improving, and the Competition Authority (CA) has
become better established. Progress was visible especially in the financial and services
sectors, holding prices down and raising productivity. Some CA decisions were being
challenged in lower courts or overturned on appeal to the Ministry of Government

16

Administration and Reform (the legal appeals body), but the authorities, including at the
CA, did not view these instances as undermining the competition law or the CA itself.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
The Norwegian economy is entering its fourth consecutive year of above-trend
growth, while wage and price inflation have been remarkably subdued and the
exchange rate seems broadly in line with fundamentals. This enviable performance has
been underpinned by the two strong macroeconomic policy pillars of inflation targeting and
the fiscal guidelines. Several factors have boosted demand and eased supply constraints:
supportive monetary conditions following the 2002-03 slowdown; an expansionary fiscal
stance; high world prices for petroleum products and other Norwegian exports and much
weaker prices for imported goods; labor inflows, especially from the new EU member
countries; and increased competition and productivity in some domestic sectors.
21.
However, indicators point to mounting underlying inflationary pressures,
which seem set to intensify as the mainland economy is expected to grow strongly
again in 2007. Credit and house-prices have been rising rapidly for some time, and the
credit expansion has moved beyond households with a sharp pick-up in business-sector
borrowing. Capacity utilization is high. And, after a muted response early in the cycle,
labor markets tightened significantly in the past year, with near record employment growth,
a plunging unemployment rate, and increasing reports of labor shortages and, in some
industries, rising wage drift.
22.
Against this backdrop, Norges Bank’s (NB) decision to withdraw monetary
stimulus, beginning in mid-2005, as well as the recent pick-up in the pace of interest
rate increases, is welcome. Given prospective inflationary pressures, NB should continue
to raise interest rates, with the exact pace depending on economic developments. Monetary
tightening may be accompanied by some temporary upward pressure on the exchange rate,
a normal part of the monetary transmission mechanism.
23.
The inflation targeting framework, together with a flexible exchange rate, has
proven effective and appropriate for the Norwegian economy. A number of innovations
have strengthened policymaking and communication, putting Norway at the forefront of
inflation targeters. Nevertheless, to reinforce public understanding of inflation targeting,
the authorities should continue to clearly explain the framework and how it governs
specific policy decisions.
24.
The financial sector appears to be sound and well supervised. However, the
prolonged strong credit expansion, the steep rise in house prices, and aggressive mortgage
lending practices pose risks, especially as interest rates rise or in the event of an economic
slowdown. The Financial Supervisory Authority’s close monitoring of these developments

17

is welcome, and it should continue to ensure that banks remain well capitalized and
provisioned, and that their lending practices remain sound and their asset quality high.
25.
Fiscal policy remains prudent. It is particularly welcome that in 2007, for the first
time, the central government non-oil structural deficit is set to meet the target of 4 percent
of the assets of the Government Pension Fund-Global (GPF), in line with the fiscal
guidelines. As the guidelines explicitly recognize, fiscal policy has a role to play in
economic stabilization. Accordingly, the 2007 mid-term budget review should seize any
available opportunity to reduce the deficit, while the 2008 and subsequent budgets should
aim for a deficit materially below 4 percent of the GPF until excess demand dissipates.
Such policies would alleviate the burden on monetary policy and ease upward pressure on
the real exchange rate.
26.
The fiscal guidelines have helped to restrain spending, but imply substantial
deficit increases in the years ahead. The policy of saving petroleum revenues abroad has
blunted “Dutch disease” effects, but the deficit expansion under the guidelines warrants
careful management. Tax cuts would be welcome, because of their desirable supply-side
effects. Rapid increases in spending risk inefficient resource use, and will have to be
reversed beginning in the early 2020s as oil revenues wane. An explicit medium-term fiscal
framework would help to focus policy more on such medium-term considerations. In
Norway, many parts of such a framework are already in place, notably the fiscal guidelines
themselves and the finance ministry’s multi-year budget projections.
27.
The most important long-term fiscal challenge is posed by the effects of
population aging, expected to begin in the next decade. The recent broad-based
parliamentary agreement on pension reform is therefore welcome, as is the authorities’
intention to deal with a number of outstanding issues, notably the early retirement scheme.
Implementation of these reforms should take place without delay. However, the saving
from the agreed reform will probably be insufficient to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability and therefore further reform should be considered.
28.
The Norwegian labor market performs well, but the sickness and disability
programs pose risks. High employment and participation rates, low unemployment rates,
and the ability to absorb substantial numbers of immigrant workers testify to labor market
flexibility. However, reform of the sickness and disability schemes is a high priority. The
merger of welfare agencies is welcome, but further administrative reforms will be required,
and high replacement rates should be reconsidered in order to sharpen beneficiaries’
incentives to return to work.
29.
Product market performance is improving, but continuing efforts are needed
to ensure strong competition. The strong and appropriate system of governance of the
large publicly owned sector needs to be maintained. But to ensure a level playing field and

18

maximize the benefits of competitive markets, further privatization should also be
considered. Domestic competition has increased, and further gains on this front should be
pursued, notably through strong enforcement of competition and anti-cartel laws.
30.
Data are adequate for surveillance. Indeed, in some instances, including the GPF
and SOEs, transparency is very strong by international standards. The task of collecting
financial sector data was recently moved from NB to Statistics Norway (SN), which the
former viewed as increasing its focus on its core monetary policy mission. Assessment of
labor market conditions would be strengthened by expanding the sample size of the labor
force survey to allow publication of monthly estimates, and instituting an establishment
survey to provide timely data on employment and wage developments.
31.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 24-month cycle.

percent from March 2004 to mid-2005. Since then, it
raised the rate nine times. More recently, NB increased
its intervention rate four consecutive times.

Inflation targeting framework
Enhance transparency of policy making.

Policy transparency was improved by the governor's
appearance before parliament, continued outside
evaluation of policy by Norges Bank Watch, publishing
the monetary policy strategy document at the beginning
of the strategy period and providing a more detailed
discussion of policy decisions.

Continue to explain the framework to the public.

NB has continued explaining the framework to the public
and has taken a number of measures to increase the
transparency of policy making.
Fiscal policy

Adhere to the fiscal guidelines and reduce upward
deviation from the 4 percent rule. Introduce a multiyear
fiscal framework, with spending ceilings as an important
component.

The rule has never been met since its inception in 2002.
However, the upward deviation from the fiscal rule is
projected to be very small in 2007. The Finance Ministry
publishes its medium projections, but they are not
binding.

Improve the tax structure through building on the
recommendations of the tax commission, including a
reduction in labor tax, reducing tax arbitrage possibilities,
and raising tax rates on property.

Most of the recommendations of the tax commission has
been implemented.

Implement a package of pension reforms proposed by the
Pension Commission, and as agreed by the political
parties in 2005.

Parliament agreed the main principles for a pension
reform in May 2005 and a reform package in March 2007,
which followed closely recommendations of the Pension
Commission and the 2006 government white paper.

Financial system
Monitor credit developments closely. Implement the
recommendations of the 2005 FSAP.

The FSAN is closely monitoring credit developments and
has urged more restrictive lending for housing purposes.
The implementation of the FSAP recommendations have
so far been good, but some recommendations, such as
delegating more independence to the FSAN, are not
likely to be implemented.

Competition policy
Continue to foster competitive forces, including through
further deregulation and vigorous action by the
strengthened Competition Authority. Pursue privatization.

The incumbent government has put further privatization
on hold. In 2006, the state increased its share in the
energy sector, through the merger of Statoil and Norsk
Hydro. There have been cases in which the competition
authority has been overruled.

Welfare benefits and labor market policy
Tighten administrative controls and review the very high
replacement rates in both the sickness and disability
schemes. Decentralize wage bargains and reduce the tax
wedge.

The authorities tightened administrative controls in the
sickness program in 2004, but have not lowered the
replacement rates. The government’s proposal in 2006 to
increase the share of employers/social security in
cofinancing the sickness bill has met strong resistance
from both employers and employees. The tax wedge was
reduced by lowering marginal labor tax rates. A
commission, headed by the Prime Minister, has
suggested new financial and accelerated activation
measures to be implemented this year.

Table 7. Key FSAP Recommendations and Implementation
Implementation

Recommendations 1/
Shorter-term stability-related issues
Continue carefully monitoring the evolution of household debt
and the housing market; and examine whether banks have
concentrations of exposures to more vulnerable sub-groups of
household borrowers.

The FSAN and NB are closely monitoring credit and
housing market developments. The FSAN has urged
restrictive lending for housing purposes. It has continued
examining banks' exposures to more vulnerable sub-groups
of household borrowers and has published the results of its
studies.

Given the reduced risk weighting of mortgages under Basel II,
carefully consider whether additional requirements for banks
should be required under "Pillar 2."

The five Norwegian banks that have been given approval to
use the IRB approach under Basel II are, according to EU
directives, not allowed to reduce their capital to less than
95 percent, 90 percent, and 80 percent of that required
under Basel I in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Banks'
preparedness for ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process) was examined in 2006 and the first
evaluations of the ICAAP processes will take place during
2007.

Continue to carefully monitor the risk of spillovers, in extreme
events, resulting from the two-tier payments arrangements, and
examine the scope for increasing the use of collateral in
interbank market exposures.

The technical platform for clearing of retail transactions is to
be upgraded in 2008. At the same time, the rules for
transactions that have to be settled on a gross basis will be
changed. This will reduce risk. New rules for acceptance of
collateral have been implemented.

Further reduce market and liquidity risk in the securities
settlement and retail payments systems.

The securities settlement payment system is being
reformed. Retail payment clearing is to be upgraded (see
above). Delivery versus payment (DvP) at broker level will be
implemented through an integrated model with
simultaneous settlement of paper leg and money leg, also
in the event of a bank failing to settle.

Continue working with other Nordic authorities to refine the
framework for cross-border crisis management and coordination
of last resort lending; domestically, ensure appropriately
coordinated contingency plans in the unlikely event of a major
problem at the largest, partly state-owner bank, DNB-NOR.

The authorities have continued working with other Nordic
authorities and have achieved some progress in terms ofcross border crisis management. The Nordic countries are
planning a crisis simulation for fall 2007. Cross-border
issues are also being reviewed in an EU-context.

Formalize more regular high-level meetings between the
MoF, NB, and FSAN.

Domestically, the MoF has decided to have biannual
meetings focusing on the outlook for financial stability and
coordination of the relevant institutions' (MoF, NB, and
FSAN) work on contingency planning. The Contingency
Committee for Financial Infrastructure, chaired by NB,
promotes cooperation among financial sector participants.

Structural and longer-term issues
Re-examine key aspects of the deposit guarantee arrangements,
including whether and how to achieve greater international
comparability in coverage levels.

The issue is being reviewed in an EU context.

Examine whether the netting of medium-sized and smaller
interbank payments could be phased out.

The new retail payment settlement system (to be finalized
in Q2, 2007) is expected to solve this issue.

Review the continued desirability of state ownership in DNB-NOR. The authorities have held that the bank is run on a purely
In the interim, consider further entrenching appropriate commercial commercial basis, but the likelihood of privatization is very
small under the current government, which has put further
autonomy and accountability for the bank
privatization on hold.
Provide greater independence to FSAN.

The authorities explained that FSAN is an administrative
agency acting under the general responsibilities of the
Ministry of Finance, and that under general administrative
law the parties concerned may submit decisions made by
the FSAN for review by the ministry. Further, they pointed
out that a constitutional system where the minister is
responsible to the legislature (the Storting) for financial
supervision limits the possibility for excluding ministerial
oversight and decision making. The authorities also recalled
that there is no clear distinction between supervisory issues
and issues of a structural and political nature.

APPENDIX I: FUND RELATIONS
(As of February 28, 2007)
I.
Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2005 Article IV Consultation were
held in Oslo during March 7–15, 2005. The Staff Report was considered by the Executive
Board on June 3, 2005.
The 2007 Article IV discussions were held in Oslo during March 15-26, 2007. The mission,
comprised Mr. Ford (head), Ms. Bordon, and Messrs. Gagales and Rossi, while Mr. Jafarov
was involved in pre-mission preparation (all EUR). The mission met with the Ministry of
Finance, Norges Bank, senior officials of other ministries and Statistics Norway,
representatives of labor and business organizations, private sector analysts, and academics.
Mr. Bergundhaugen, from the Office of the Executive Director for Nordic-Baltic countries,
participated in discussions.
Norway has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of
Agreement. Norway subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, and its economic
statistics are satisfactory for surveillance purposes. Norway is a member of the European
Economic Area, which provides for free movement of goods, services, labor, and capital with
the European Union.
The authorities intend to publish this report.

Appendix II: Norway: Statistical Issues
Norway maintains high standards in the provision of economic data, which are adequate for
surveillance purposes. In some instances, including oil wealth, in particular, the GPF—
Global, and SOEs, transparency is very strong by international standards. For example,
The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and Statistics Norway regularly publish data on energy
resources and activity (http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/oed/Documents-andpublications/Reports.html?id=35236; http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/10/06/20/) while
Norges Bank, the manager of the GPF – Global, regularly publishes detailed (quarterly and
annual) reports on the portfolio and performance of the fund (http://www.norgesbank.no/nbim/pension_fund/). The Ministry of Trade and Industry regularly publishes state
ownership reports (http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/nhd/Selected-topics/ownership/StateOwnership.html?id=382852). The task of collecting financial sector data was recently moved
from NB to Statistics Norway (SN), which the former viewed as increasing its focus on its
core monetary policy mission.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
NORWAY
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Adnan Mazarei
May 30, 2007

1.
This staff supplement reports on the Norwegian mid-term budget, released on May
15, 2007. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal. The PIN is also attached.
2.
Revised 2006 fiscal estimates show that the central government non-oil structural
deficit was only very slightly larger than 4 percent of the assets of Government Pension
Fund-Global (GPF), by Nkr 0.5 billion. The difference with respect to the original budget,
which had indicated a somewhat larger overshooting of Nkr 7.3 billion (0.5 percent of
mainland GDP), reflects more buoyant revenue.
3.
This deficit is set to be 3.8 percent of GPF assets in 2007, which will leave it below
4 percent for the first time since the fiscal guidelines were put in effect in 2002. This
overperformance is in line with staff advice. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in GPF assets
will make room for significant fiscal expansion, underscoring the authorities’ and staff’s
concern regarding increases in fiscal deficits owing to rapidly rising GPF assets. In the
absence of tax cuts, real government spending is set to rise by 3¾ percent in 2007, and the
general government structural deficit, as estimated by staff, by ⅔ percent of GDP.
4.

The attached tables have been updated in light of the revision to the 2007 budget.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 7, 2007

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On June 4, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Norway.1
Background
The Norwegian economy is set to grow strongly in 2007 for the fourth consecutive year. This
economic performance is underpinned by strong monetary and fiscal policy frameworks.
External demand, both for petroleum products and other Norwegian exports, is strong, and
rapid credit growth, rising house prices, and tight labor markets are supporting domestic
demand. Unit labor cost increases and core inflation have been subdued, although rapidly rising
employment, an unemployment rate that has fallen to near record lows, and increasing reports
of labor shortages and wage drift indicate intensifying pressures.
Although underlying inflation has been below the inflation target of a 2.5 percent increase in
consumer prices, Norges Bank has been increasing interest rates since mid-2005 in response
to robust demand conditions. Initially, Norges Bank raised rates gradually, but more recently
has picked up the pace. As a result of these increases, monetary conditions have tightened
substantially.
Fiscal policy is governed by guidelines, including a rule that the central government non-oil
structural deficit should equal 4 percent of the assets in the Government Petroleum Fund-Global
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
(GPF), with temporary deviations for specific reasons. In 2006, for the first time the budget
outturn came very close to meeting this rule. For 2007, the relevant deficit is set to fall below
4 percent of the GPF, although since the GPF itself is growing rapidly the resulting overall fiscal
stance will be expansionary.
Parliament recently agreed to a significant package of pension reforms, which promises
significant long-term containment of pension costs. Key elements of the package includes
benefits based on lifetime earnings, adjustment for rising life expectancy, an actuarially neutral
benefit structure to reduce early-retirement incentives, and lower indexation of benefits.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Norwegian authorities for their strong rules-based
monetary and fiscal policy frameworks and prudent management of oil wealth, which have
promoted noninflationary growth and mitigated possible adverse effects of oil revenues.
Directors welcomed the robust economic expansion of the past three years, which has been
underpinned by strong markets for Norwegian exports, notably petroleum products, and
supportive monetary conditions. Wage and price pressures have been moderate, in part
reflecting favorable supply-side developments, including substantial labor inflows from new
EU member countries. Directors noted that the key challenges facing Norway will be to ensure
sustained noninflationary growth and medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors observed that short-term growth prospects remain promising but noted the increasing
indications of demand pressures, including a falling unemployment rate and reports of labor
shortages and wage drift. Against this backdrop, they commended the gradual increase in
policy interest rates during the past two years, and considered that further increases would be
appropriate in the period ahead. Several Directors suggested that the pace of interest rate
increases should remain gradual, so that the effects of such increases and other new
information on economic developments can be adequately assessed. Directors recognized that
further tightening could put upward pressure on the exchange rate, but viewed this as part of
the monetary transmission mechanism in an open economy.
Directors were of the view that inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate have served
Norway well. They welcomed innovations that have increased transparency and moved Norway
to the forefront among inflation targeting countries. Directors recommended that the authorities
continue to explain the policy framework to the public, in order to reinforce understanding and
further cement its credibility.
Directors considered that the fiscal guidelines have contributed to prudent fiscal policy, and
commended the authorities for bringing the central government non-oil structural deficit to close
to 4 percent of the assets of Government Pension Fund-Global (GPF) in 2006. They welcomed
the objective of reducing the deficit to below 4 percent in 2007, consistent with the fiscal
guidelines. Looking ahead, Directors emphasized the need for continued fiscal restraint—in
view of the cyclical economic boom, the prospect that deficits will expand significantly under the
fiscal guidelines in the years ahead, and the projected large costs of aging. Directors
encouraged the adoption of an explicit medium-term fiscal framework—building on the many

3
parts of such a framework that are already in place—to increase the effectiveness of fiscal
policy. Directors commended the authorities for the high level of transparency of the GPF, which
has enhanced public ownership and support for it while strengthening government
accountability.
Directors welcomed the recent parliamentary agreement on pension reform. They judged that
the package would contain long-run pension costs and encourage people to stay in work longer
through improved incentives. Directors urged that the reforms be implemented as quickly as
possible, along with complementary reforms to the early retirement and disability schemes.
They noted, however, that on current estimates these reforms will not be sufficient to ensure
long-term fiscal sustainability, and therefore welcomed the authorities’ consideration of further
measures.
Directors considered that the financial sector appears sound and is well supervised, and
welcomed the adoption of the bulk of the recommendations of the 2005 FSAP. Noting the risks
posed by the prolonged credit expansion, the rapid rise in house prices, and aggressive lending
practices, Directors urged the Financial Supervisory Authority to continue to ensure that banks
remain well capitalized and provisioned, follow prudent lending practices, and maintain high
asset quality.
Directors welcomed the impressive performance of the Norwegian labor market but recognized
that the rapid growth in enrollment in sickness and disability poses challenges. Directors
welcomed the recent reforms, including the merger of welfare agencies to improve case
management. They considered, however, that further measures, including a review of the high
replacement rates, would be required.
Directors welcomed the improving product market performance. To maximize the benefits of
competitive markets, they stressed the need to maintain a level playing field between the private
sector and the large state-owned sector through continued effective governance of the latter
and suggested that, where appropriate, consideration could be given to further privatization.
They also urged strong enforcement of competition and anti-cartel laws.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Norway
June 4, 2007
On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a thorough and well
written report on the Norwegian economy. My authorities broadly concur with staff’s
analysis.
Economic developments
Increased globalization in recent years has benefited the Norwegian economy strongly. The
terms of trade improvement is the strongest since World War I. Higher export prices, notably
on petroleum and metals, have increased national income and business profits, and
contributed significantly to the large fiscal surpluses. At the same time, lower import prices
have benefited consumers and prevented inflation from picking up despite strong domestic
demand growth and high capacity utilization. Labor immigration from the new EU countries
has increased production capacity in several industries, in particular in building and
construction, and dampened a pick up of wages.
Growth in the Norwegian economy has been strong for more than three years, with
mainland-GDP expanding around 4½ percent annually. Domestic demand has been fuelled
by private consumption, strong growth in petroleum investments and also an upswing in
investments in the mainland business sector. The strong growth is expected to continue in
2007. In the Revised National Budget for 2007 presented on May 15, growth in mainland
Norway (excluding petroleum and shipping) is forecasted at 3.7 percent in 2007.
The labor market has tightened significantly over the last couple of years. The unemployment
rate is at a 20 year low and employment growth is strong. The unemployment rate is
expected to decline from an average of 3.4 percent in 2006 to 2½ percent in 2007. Although
inflow of workers from other countries has helped to ease labor market pressures so far in
this upturn, demand for labor is still high and many companies face difficulties finding
qualified labor.
Monetary policy
The Norwegian authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy. The
authorities take note of the view that further interest rate increases are needed to head off
inflationary pressures. According to the latest assessments of Norges Bank’s Executive
Board, the key policy rate should be in the interval 4 – 5 percent in the period to the
publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on June 27, 2007. The Bank has emphasized
that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding its interest rate projections. In the Bank’s
analysis in the March Report, the overall outlook suggested that it would be appropriate to
raise the interest rate gradually to about 5 percent in the course of this year and to a
somewhat higher level in the period to the summer of 2008. The interest rate will be
increased gradually so that the effects of interest rate changes and other new information on
economic developments can be assessed.

2
Interest rate developments must be seen in the light of prospects for inflation, output and
employment. It normally takes some time for interest rates to have an impact on prices via
changes in expectations, exchange rates or capacity utilisation. The key policy rate has been
raised in response to the strong increase in capacity utilisation and the associated inflation
prospects. The interest rate has thus been increased well ahead of an actual rise in underlying
inflation. Different measures of short- and longer-term real interest rates indicate that real
interest rates have approached a more normal level. In the staff report, real interest rates are
estimated by combining short-term interest rates and a longer-term measure of inflation
expectations. Staff’s judgement that real interest rates are still expansionary appears to be
based on the combination of these different time horizons in the same calculation.
The report emphasizes that monetary policy should strive to meet the inflation target even if
this would mean some short-term appreciation of the krone. Norges Bank believes that under
an inflation targeting regime, it is important to be mindful of the effects of higher interest
rates on the krone exchange rate when inflation is low.
The authorities take note of staff’s assessment that the monetary policy framework has been
strengthened by increased transparency, improved governance and a well-articulated policy
framework. It is important that economic agents are able as far as possible to anticipate
monetary policy decisions. Norges Bank regularly publishes assessments of the outlook for
the key policy rate. The bank has emphasized that openness concerning its intended future
interest rate may help market participants understand the central bank’s response pattern so
that the reaction of market rates to new information about economic developments has a
stabilising effect. Staff’s advice to continue efforts to explain inflation targeting, including
the monetary policy transmission mechanism and how specific policy decisions are
governed, has also been noted.
Fiscal policy
As noted by staff the Norwegian fiscal framework aims at a gradual increase in the spending
of petroleum revenues to a sustainable level. Over time the structural non-oil deficit shall
correspond to the expected real return on the Government Pension Fund – Global (GPF),
estimated at 4 percent. Long-term budget challenges, due to future increases in pension costs
in the National Insurance Scheme and other age-related expenses, underline the need for a
prudent fiscal policy.
In light of the strong economic upturn and a tight labor market, the Government emphasizes
in the Revised National Budget the need for fiscal policy to underpin a continued balanced
development for the Norwegian economy. The Government proposes a revised Fiscal Budget
for 2007 with an estimated structural, non-oil deficit somewhat lower than in the approved
budget and NOK 3.5 billion (0.2 percentage points) below the expected 4 percent real return
on the fund. Newly released state accounts also show that the use of petroleum revenues was
on par with the 4 percent fiscal rule in 2006.

3
The proposed revised budget for 2007 implies a structural, non-oil budget deficit at
4.3 percent of mainland trend GDP, 0.6 percentage point higher than in 2006. This increase
must, however, be seen in light of a major downward revision of the 2006 deficit in the final
state accounts.
The Norwegian authorities agree with the assessment in the staff appraisal that 2008 and
subsequent budgets should aim for a deficit below 4 percent of GPF until excess demand
dissipates. The authorities take note of staff’s view about an explicit medium-term fiscal
framework as help to prevent a rapid increase in spending, and agree with staff that such a
framework to a large extent already is in place, notably the fiscal rule, the government’s
commitment to a stable tax level and the multi-year budget projections.
The authorities note that given the success of the current guidelines for fiscal policy, staff
does not argue for a change of fiscal guideline. Alternative fiscal rules, as explored in the
Selected Issues paper, all imply that already substantial central government savings increase
significantly for the next 50 years, to meet long-term fiscal challenges. The challenges may
alternatively be met by curbing future expenditure growth, as exemplified by the ongoing
pension reform, which incidentally is not included in the calculations in the paper on
alternative fiscal rules. The paper also exaggerates the challenges when stating that the GPF
will be exhausted in 5-6 decades.
Pension reform and benefit entitlements
Fundamentals in the Norwegian labor market are healthy with low unemployment and high
participation rates, especially among women and older workers. A key to sustainable public
finances in the long run is to keep labor supply high or preferably to increase it. This may be
challenging with an ageing population and an increasing inflow into sick leave, disability and
early retirement schemes.
Norwegian authorities share staff’s concern about the high proportion of the working
population on sick leave, disability and other health related benefits, and we agree that
measures should be taken to bring these numbers down. A white paper on work, welfare and
inclusion policies released last fall addresses these challenges and proposes a number of
measures to bring people back to work. Several measures to reduce sick leave were also
included in the 2007-budget and are now implemented.
As noted by staff, the Norwegian pension system is under revision, and there has been
significant progress on the reform during the last two years. The Parliament has reached an
agreement which settles the model for earning and drawing of old age pensions in the
National Insurance Scheme as a foundation for the overall pension system. However,
important elements of the reform are still to be decided on. These elements include a redesign
of occupational pensions in the public sector and adjustments of disability pensions and the
labor market based early retirement scheme (AFP). A Government-appointed commission

4
has just released a report with proposals for reform of the disability pension system. The
Government will soon invite the social partners to discuss the design of an adjusted early
retirement scheme, in time to be included in the wage negotiations in 2008. The next phase of
the reform will be challenging, but equally important, in establishing correct incentives for
elderly people considering retirement and closing early exit routes. Hence, it is now more
important to stress the need for completion of the ongoing pension reform than to
recommend embarking on new ones.
Financial stability
The authorities agree with staff that the financial system in Norway is sound and well
supervised. Over the last years Norwegian financial institutions have achieved very good
results. In 2006 no overall losses were recorded in banks and, as in 2005, the cost trend in
banks was favorable. Households’ debt has risen sharply the last seven years, driven by
strong growth in house prices, a favorable economic climate and low interest rates. Debt has
risen at a far higher rate than incomes, spurring a sharp increase in the debt burden.
Projections by Norges Bank show that by the end of 2009 the households’ debt may exceed
230 percent of disposable income. Even if there are some circumstances in the economic
development in Norway that may increase the risk, especially the households’ debt burden,
the outlook for financial stability is satisfactory.
Structural policy
Product markets have undergone considerable reforms through the 1990s and early 2000s.
The principal objective of these reforms has been to improve efficiency of markets while
securing service provision in all parts of the country. Competition has been enhanced by
strengthening the competition law and competition authorities, and reform of sector
regulation especially in network industries. Legal protection implies that decisions by the
Competition Authority can be challenged through appeal and in the courts. The Ministry of
Government Administration and Reform is the appeal body, but has the competence only to
overrule a decision on the same legal basis as the Competition Authority. However, in certain
cases of fundamental or great social importance, the full cabinet (King in Council) can
overrule the competition provisions. There has been only one such decision under the
Competition Act of 2004. Administrative fines can be challenged only in courts.
As noted by staff, state ownership is extensive. This is due primarily to the importance of the
petroleum and hydroelectric power sectors in the Norwegian economy. Other state-owned
companies have functions and obligations that could not be provided efficiently in
competitive markets (electricity transmission, administration of national forests, etc.). Policy
on state ownership was presented in a recent white paper. The Government aims at securing a
strong public and national ownership.
