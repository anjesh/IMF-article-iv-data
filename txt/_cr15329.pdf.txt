IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Sweden

On November 30, 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Sweden.
Sweden’s economy is performing well, with real GDP growth of 3.4 percent per year in the first
three quarters of 2015, up from 2.3 percent in 2014. Job creation was robust in the first three
quarters of 2015, helping bring the unemployment rate down to 7.2 percent in the third quarter.
Solid growth of about 3 percent is expected to continue into 2016.
Core inflation (HICP basis) rose to 1.4 percent per year on average in recent months, but remains
below the 2 percent target. Since early 2015 the Riksbank has implemented negative interest
rates, cutting the repo rate in three steps to -0.35 percent. It is also purchasing 135 billion
Swedish Kronor in government bonds in 2015, some 20 percent of the outstanding stock, and
further purchases are planned in the first half of 2016.
Migration inflows to Sweden have surged to over 1.5 percent of the population in 2015, with the
majority being asylum seekers, and these inflows could remain high. Historical experience is that
the employment rates of migrants rise toward the high level of Swedes, but this integration
process is lengthy. Unemployment rates among the foreign born, as with the low skilled, are
notably higher than the overall unemployment rate.
Housing price inflation has accelerated to 18 percent per year, partly reflecting urban population
growth outpacing new housing construction. Mortgage credit growth rose to 8 percent per year in
September, lifting household debt to a new high of 176 percent of disposable income, with about
22.5 percent of households with a mortgage having a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio over
500 percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Sweden’s solid economic growth, which reflects supportive
macroeconomic policies and strong domestic demand. Directors noted, however, that Sweden
faces major challenges including a sharp rise in migrant inflows, rapidly rising housing prices
and elevated household debt, and inflation that remains below target. Directors called for policies
to work together to address these intertwined challenges so as to contain medium-term risks to
growth.
Directors commended Sweden’s humanitarian migration policy and well-developed
introduction program for refugees. Yet unemployment rates for the low-skilled and
foreign-born are considerably higher than average. Directors therefore stressed the
importance of reforms to broaden job creation and facilitate integration. They suggested that
entry-level wages and employment protection should not be a barrier to hiring groups with
high unemployment, and recommended that the authorities better align training with
employer’s needs and improve the effectiveness of public job matching services.
Directors endorsed the stimulatory stance of monetary policy to address weak
inflation expectations and protect the effectiveness of the inflation target in promoting
macroeconomic stability. They supported the Riksbank’s readiness to do more, if needed,
until core inflation is durably close to target, but considered that the authorities should refrain
from foreign exchange intervention except as a last resort given Sweden’s strong external
position.
Directors agreed that the broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate. They considered
that additional migration-related expenses should be accommodated in the near term, noting
that investments in helping migrants integrate will reduce costs in the medium term and
support their contribution to growth. Such expenses should be funded over time as part of
achieving the medium-term fiscal target. Directors considered that balancing the central
government budget on average over the cycle would be sufficient to safeguard Sweden’s
fiscal buffers.
Directors highlighted the need for broad-based efforts to rebalance the housing
market to protect stability and help sustain growth. To increase housing supply they called
for reforms to enable greater competition in residential construction, together with a general
2

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

phasing out of rent controls, with vulnerable households protected by the housing allowance.
Directors also urged phasing out mortgage interest deductibility, raising the limit on capital
gains tax deferrals, and expanding subsidies for building affordable rental apartments in areas
with jobs to support a soft landing of housing prices, while also aiding labor mobility and
migrant integration.
Directors emphasized that the legal framework for macroprudential policies needs to
be strengthened to give the FSA access to a range of tools to address risks in a timely and
efficient way. They supported the planned adoption of a regulation on the amortization of
high loan-to-value mortgages. Directors recommended that Sweden also limit the share of
mortgages with high debt-to-income ratios to reduce vulnerabilities associated with further
housing price increases.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 13, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Sweden is expected to enjoy solid economic growth of about 3 percent y/y in 2015
and 2016, yet it faces intertwined challenges:


Large migration inflows with effects on the labor market and on the budget;



Rapid housing price increases associated with rising household indebtedness; and



Low inflation and weakened inflation expectations.

Macroeconomic policies should support a rise in inflation and contain upside risks
to unemployment. The firmly stimulatory stance of monetary policy is needed to avoid
prolonged low inflation that would prevent monetary policy from regaining space to
cushion shocks. Such a stance should continue until core inflation is durably close to
target. The broadly neutral fiscal stance appropriately avoids impeding these efforts to
raise inflation. Likely additional expenses related to migration should be accommodated
in the near term. Looking to the medium term, maintaining central government balance
on average over the cycle would be sufficient to safeguard Sweden’s fiscal buffers.
It is critical that policies work together to address housing market imbalances that
pose risks to stability and growth:


Housing supply should be enhanced through land sale and planning reforms, which
will also facilitate more competition in residential construction. Rent controls should
be eliminated on new rental apartments and phased out more broadly.



Mortgage interest deductibility should be phased out to moderate housing demand
over time and limits on capital gains tax deferrals raised to release pent up supply.



A debt-to-income limit should be adopted to contain rises in the already sizable
share of highly indebted households, which adds to macroeconomic vulnerabilities.

Historically high migration inflows reinforce the importance of labor market
reforms to broaden employment gains. Sweden has a well developed introduction
program for refugees although the process of integration into employment is lengthy.
Addressing high unemployment of lower skilled workers—by reducing high entry-level
wages and easing strict employment protection, together with more effective training
and job-matching services—would aid more rapid integration.

SOLID GROWTH YET INTERTWINED CHALLENGES
1.
Sweden’s economy is performing
well overall. GDP rose by 3 percent y/y in
2015 H1, picking up from 2.3 percent growth
in 2014. The sources of H1 growth were
balanced, with domestic demand up by
2.8 percent reflecting solid private
consumption and rising residential
investment, while services-led exports rose by
4 percent y/y. Continued robust job growth,
at 1.3 percent y/y in the first three quarters,
helped bring the unemployment rate down
to 7¼ percent in Q3, from around 8 percent
in recent years.

Yet Sweden faces a number of intertwined economic challenges:



Large migration inflows with effects on the labor market and on the budget;



Rapid housing price increases associated with rising household indebtedness; and



Low inflation and weakened inflation expectations.

3.
Migration inflows have risen sharply. At over 1½ percent of the population—with most
being asylum seekers—estimates for migrant inflows in 2015 greatly exceed historical experience.
Prospective inflows are highly uncertain, with current projections for 2016 at about 1¼ percent of
the population, and inflows could remain high in later years. Government spending on refugees
(introduction program and transfers to municipalities) is budgeted to rise from 0.3 percent of GDP in
2014 to about 0.7 percent by 2017, but supplementary spending of ¼ percent of GDP was recently
proposed for 2015 and larger additions are expected in 2016 and thereafter. Sweden’s framework
for integrating refugees into the labor market is well developed (Box 1), but the process is often
lengthy. This challenge overlaps with the issue of high unemployment of the low skilled.

Box 1. Migration Flows and the Integration Framework for Asylum Seekers
Migration to Sweden has led to an increasingly diverse population. Net immigration to Sweden dates back
to the 1930s and gross inflows have been rising over the years, reaching 1.3 percent of the population in 2014,
up from ¾ percent in the early 2000s. Over that period, the share of foreign-born persons has risen from 11¾
to 16½ percent of the population. Swedish migration policy has a strong humanitarian dimension, with peaks
in migration inflows coinciding with wars and unrest elsewhere. Relative to its population, Sweden receives
more asylum seekers than any other EU country.

The composition of migrants to Sweden is changing. The share of those seeking asylum (and family
reunification) is rising; in 2014, asylum seekers comprised about two-thirds of total migrant inflows, up from
about one-third in 2010. The majority of asylum seekers in recent years come from Eritrea, Somalia,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Kosovo, Albania, and Serbia, with Syria the largest source since 2012. In 2015,
unaccompanied minors—primarily from Afghanistan—are more than 20 percent of total asylum seekers, up
from about 8 percent over recent years.
Sweden has a well-developed framework for integrating refugees—the introduction program. Eligibility
is restricted to asylum seekers who have received a residence permit as refugees, quota refugees, or other
persons in need of protection, aged 20–64 years (or 18–19 years without parents living in Sweden) and their
relatives. An introduction interview by the Public Employment Service (PES) assesses their experience,
education, and ambitions in order to develop an “introduction plan” which can last up to 24 months. The plan
has three main activities that should occupy participants full-time: (i) Swedish language training;
(ii) employment preparation, such as the validation of education and professional experience; and (iii) social
studies to provide a basic knowledge of Swedish society. Participation in the program is voluntary, but an
introduction benefit is conditional on participation. Participants who find work are able to continue to claim
the introduction benefit alongside their wages for six months, after which the benefit is reduced in proportion
to the time spent working. The PES can assist refugees with an introduction plan in finding accommodation at
a location where it considers the chances of obtaining work or education are good.
Nonetheless, rising asylum seeker inflows are stretching administrative capacity and leading to policy
adjustments. Recent reports are for average daily inflows over 1,500 persons with the number of asylum
seekers reaching about 160,000 in 2015 on updated estimates, up from 83,300 in the earlier official forecast.
The average processing time for residency permits has doubled from an average of 108 days in 2012 to 220
days during Q1–Q3 2015. The authorities have announced that they would issue temporary residence permits
for limited period, allowing for a later review of residency—with exceptions including unaccompanied minors
and families with children who would continue to receive permanent residence permits. More recently border
controls were established—migrants seeking asylum can enter Sweden only if they register on entry.

The housing market shows imbalances, with double-digit price gains as the urban
population outpaces construction, pushing up household debt from already high levels.
Dwelling price rises accelerated to 16 percent y/y in September, led by apartment price increases
exceeding 20 percent in Stockholm and Gothenburg. Housing supply is constrained by construction
impediments and rent controls while demand is bolstered by population growth and urbanization,
rising income and financial savings, and historically low interest rates. Households need to borrow
more at higher house prices, with mortgage credit growth of 8 percent y/y in September lifting
household debt to 176 percent of disposable income (195 percent including housing associations).

Inflation has been below the 2 percent target for some years, dragging on
expectations and potentially impacting wage negotiations. Core inflation (HICP excluding
energy and unprocessed food) averaged 1.2 percent y/y in the first ten months of 2015, up from
only ½ percent in 2013–14. Declining resource utilization during 2011 to mid-2013 was a key driver
of low inflation, exacerbated by external factors including commodity price falls, low euro area
inflation, and past krona appreciation. Low inflation fed into inflation expectations, with 2-year
expectations hitting their lowest level since 2000 in January, at 1.2 percent. Wage indicators have
also slowed and employers have questioned using the inflation target as a basis for the coming
negotiations on two-thirds of collective bargaining agreements, normally in force for three years.

Signaling its commitment to the inflation target, the Riksbank introduced negative
rates and a QE program in February 2015. After reaching 0 in October 2014, the repo rate was cut
in three steps in 2015 to -0.35 percent in July. Purchases of government bonds total SEK 135 billion

These challenges are arising in a difficult political context. The minority government in
power since October 2014 failed to pass its first budget proposal. New elections were avoided by
reaching the “December agreement” with opposition parties excluding an anti-immigration party
and one other party. However, this agreement recently collapsed when a small party decided to exit.
At this stage it appears that the government’s budget for 2016 will be passed but political
uncertainties have risen.

Solid growth appears likely in the near term with inflation rising over the medium
term. Growth in domestic demand is expected to be supported by easy monetary conditions,
reinforced by additional migration-related government spending. Exports are also strengthening,
especially of services, aided by a pickup in external demand. Overall, growth of about 3 percent y/y
is projected in 2015 and 2016, easing to 2½ percent in the medium term. A range of indicators show
declining slack in the economy, with solid growth expected to broadly close the output gap in 2016.
A positive gap in later years is reflected in core HICP inflation rising to about 2 percent in 2017.

However, house prices could continue rising from already high levels. Sweden’s house
price-to-income ratio is 32 percent over its 20-year average, which is high relative to other OECD
countries. Yet estimated models of house prices find that much of this deviation is accounted for by
rising net financial wealth, migration, and low interest rates (Box 2), with housing prices estimated to
be about 5½ percent above their long-term equilibrium, or 12 percent assuming real interest rates
at more normal levels. Despite these signs of varying degrees of overvaluation, house price gains
could well continue to exceed income growth given the rise in urban population relative to housing
completions—the net share of households expecting house prices to rise is at record highs and low
mortgage interest rates (averaging 1.6 percent recently) make larger mortgages more affordable.

Box 2. Housing Valuation and Policy Impacts
Broad trends in Swedish housing prices are
largely accounted for by fundamental
factors and the value of housing is a key
determinant of household debt. A
forthcoming IMF staff working paper (Turk,
2015) finds the main drivers of real housing
prices are disposable income, financial assets
net of debt, real mortgage rates after tax
deductions, and net migration. In parallel,
household debt is driven by the value of the
housing stock as well as real after-tax
mortgage rates.

Real housing prices and household debt are
estimated to be moderately above
equilibrium. Estimation of a three-equation model (for housing prices, household debt, and residential
investment) suggests that housing prices and household debt are above their long run equilibrium level
by about 5½ and 6¼ percent respectively. Yet, real mortgage interest rates are some 1½ percentage
points below their average since 2000 and could potentially rise in the medium term. Under this scenario,
the combined effect of the valuation gap and interest rate reversal is a decrease in housing prices and
household debt by 12 and 11 percent respectively. The analysis also finds that past house price gains fuel
borrowing that in turn bolsters house prices, with a potentially disruptive eventual return to equilibrium.

Such a rise in vulnerabilities would exacerbate downside risks to Sweden’s outlook in
the medium term from a range of potential shocks (see also the Risk Assessment Matrix):


External activity risks. Weakness in euro area or emerging market activity, potentially
associated with commodity price falls, would weigh on Swedish exports and growth. Krona
appreciation, perhaps due to expanded QE in the euro area, would reinforce this impact.
Domestic vulnerabilities could amplify the impact of such shocks, especially if continued low
inflation left monetary policy with little space.

is unclear, increasing inflation uncertainties.

12.
Authorities’ views. The Swedish authorities shared broadly similar macroeconomic
projections. They also had rising concerns around the high rate of housing price increases but had
varying views about the scale of the associated macroeconomic vulnerabilities, with the Riksbank most
concerned on this front. The authorities also saw a similar range of external and domestic risks.

POLICIES NEED TO WORK TOGETHER
13.
Economic policies should support a rise in inflation and limit the upside risks to
unemployment while protecting macrofinancial stability over the medium term. A firmly
stimulatory monetary stance is appropriate to avoid prolonged low inflation that would prevent
monetary policy from regaining space to cushion shocks. Addressing house price and household
debt vulnerabilities in a durable manner requires structural reforms and fiscal measures to rebalance
housing supply and demand. Yet the benefits of such reforms would come over time. Hence, well
targeted prudential measures are also needed, calibrated to protect household financial resilience
while avoiding significant drag on domestic demand that would counteract monetary stimulus.
Sweden’s fiscal position provides room for a broadly neutral stance in the near term and allows
potential migration costs to be met over the medium term, while undertaking reforms to help
address the housing and unemployment challenges.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
14.
The Riksbank’s shift to unconventional measures from February has generated a firmly
stimulatory monetary stance. The negative repo rate is about 3 percentage points below its
historical average in real terms. Lending and deposit rates for households and firms have declined
broadly in line with the repo rate, but have remained positive aside from deposits of large
corporations.2 Swedish QE has further lowered the yield curve, with negative yields on government
bonds out to about 5 years, and yields on banks’ covered bonds have moved down roughly in
parallel. The “shadow rate” illustrates the lower repo rate consistent with the impact of QE on the
yield curve. As of October, the krona has depreciated by 4 percent in nominal effective terms from
its 2014 average, further contributing to easy monetary conditions.

This stimulatory stance is appropriate as the urgency of returning inflation to the
2 percent target has increased. As noted, inflation expectations fell significantly in the three
months to January 2015, with 2-year ahead inflation expectations down to only 1.2 percent.
Allowing low inflation to persist would pose increasing risk to the credibility of the inflation target,
damaging its effectiveness in promoting macroeconomic stability including through steady
functioning of the wage formation process. This consideration has become particularly important as
a collective bargaining round beginning at end 2015 will set floors on nominal wage increases,
usually in force for a three year period. Hence, even as concerns around housing price and
household debt vulnerabilities rose, it was appropriate for monetary policy to not “lean against the
wind”. Although monetary stimulus adds to pressures on housing prices and household debt, low
interest rates are estimated to account for a small part of the rises in recent years, whereas allowing
low inflation to persist could also undermine stability, including by likely requiring a more extended
period of low interest rates.

The net interest margin of major banks in the first nine months of 2015 was higher than the same period last year,

recent extension of QE into 2016 was appropriate to maintain the current expansionary stance.
17.
The Riksbank should remain ready to do more. Although recent inflation out-turns are
positive, some downsides to the inflation outlook remain. Appropriately, the Riksbank is prepared to
make monetary policy more expansionary if needed, where it has a number of options. The repo
rate can be cut further, as indicated by Danish and Swiss policy rates at -0.75 percent, although the
impact on lending rates may weaken as banks are reluctant to charge depositors. Even as it
extended government bond purchases, the Riksbank indicated that it can purchase more securities;
making covered bonds eligible for purchases would greatly expand the pool of assets, though there
may be signaling issues given concerns about appearing to fuel housing prices. The option to
launch a lending program via the banks for companies also remains. Foreign exchange intervention
should be a last resort after other instruments are exhausted considering Sweden’s strong external
position and the undervaluation of the krona (Box 3).
18.

Box 3. External Assessment

methodology suggests that in 2015 the
krona is substantially undervalued. Since the
beginning of 2015, the Riksbank shifted to
negative rates and a QE program to combat
low inflation. This led to an 8 percent
depreciation of the real effective exchange rate
(REER) as of August 2015 compared with the
average for 2014—which has partly reversed
with recent appreciation. As a result, the REER
gap has widened from 2014, when the krona
was assessed to be moderately undervalued.

1/ CA and REER gaps: Minus indicates undervaluation. The 2015 year
average REER is calculated using actual REER through August 2015,
and holding the August 2015 REER fixed through December 2015.

A number of factors are important when evaluating Sweden’s external position:
 The krona is freely floating and there are no policy distortions impacting the current account.
 Demographic and institutional factors tend to influence the current account in Sweden but can be
difficult to capture fully in a cross-country approach such as the EBA. Sweden’s high saving rate,
which is not unusual for an aging society, is reinforced by pension and welfare reforms since the
mid-1990s including a shift to a defined contributions pension scheme and a decline in transfers.
 Other structural factors shaping Sweden’s current account are not reflected in the EBA-estimated
gap. Sweden operates as a regional financial center for the Nordic region (with banking assets over
400 percent of GDP, of which about 170 percent of GDP in assets are outside Sweden) and the
country plays a significant role in merchanting trade. Both characteristics have been shown to lead
to persistently larger current account balances, with merchanting trade in particular having
accounted for a substantial share current account dynamics in the past decade.
 Statistical issues raise some doubts about the current account position. The Swedish net IIP is near
balance at -0.3 percent of GDP in 2014, with gross external liabilities at 294 percent of GDP. But the
increase over time in the net IIP is generally smaller than the cumulative current account balances,
although this is in part explained by negative valuation effects.
Taking these factors into consideration, staff assesses the krona to be undervalued by about
10 percent, as a significant part of the Swedish current account surplus is structural. Staff
assesses Sweden’s adjusted current account norm to be around 2½–6½ percent of GDP, implying a
current account gap in the range of 0 to 5 percent of GDP in 2015. As a result, the REER gap is assessed
to be in the lower end of the -11 to -1 percent range in 2015, considering the EBA REER analysis.
This undervaluation is expected to be temporary, with the krona likely to appreciate once the
monetary easing cycle ends. Staff assesses that the monetary policy stance is consistent with
Sweden’s inflation targeting framework, and expects monetary conditions to begin to normalize once
core inflation is close to the target. The timing for the krona appreciating toward its fundamental value
is uncertain, but it could happen as early as 2016 under the Riksbank’s forecasts. Reflecting, in part, the
temporary nature of the krona weakness, staff projects only a modest rise in the current account in
2015 followed by a slow decline over the medium term.
The current level of foreign currency reserve holdings appears broadly appropriate. Reserves
stood at US$50.5 billion in September 2015, equivalent to about 40 percent of Swedish banks’ short
term foreign currency liabilities. In view of the high dependence of Swedish banks on wholesale
funding in foreign currency, and the disruptions in such funding that have occurred at times of
international financial distress, maintaining adequate foreign currency liquidity buffers is prudent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

B. Fiscal Policy
20.
The Budget Bill for 2016 targets a deficit just under 1 percent of GDP. New initiatives in
the budget of 0.6 percent of GDP include spending on housing construction subsidies, welfare,
education, and migrant integration. These new initiatives are funded by reduced tax deductibility for
dwelling repairs and improvements, higher energy taxes, and a gradual tapering of the amount of
the earned income tax credit as income rises. Rises in sickness leave benefits and migration-related
spending are about ¼ percent of GDP in 2016 and capital gains revenues are projected to decline
from high levels in 2015. Nonetheless, consolidation in other areas means the budget targets a
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2016, the same level as projected for 2015.
21.
The fiscal stance is appropriate and additional expenses related to migration should be
accommodated in the near term. The structural balance in 2016 is projected to be little changed
from 2015, at about -0.7 percent of GDP. This broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate given the
need to avoid impeding monetary policy efforts to raise inflation. A rise in expenses owing to
migration inflows exceeding budget assumptions—perhaps around ½ percent of GDP in 2016—
should be accommodated in the near term and funded over time as part of achieving medium-term
fiscal targets. Investments in helping migrants gain jobs will reduce costs in the medium term and
maximize their contributions to growth in the long run. Discretionary fiscal stimulus is not warranted
given solid growth prospects, but full operation of the automatic stabilizers should be allowed.
22.
Maintaining balance over the cycle is sufficient to safeguard Sweden’s fiscal buffers,
entailing a need to raise the fiscal balance over the medium term. The long standing fiscal
target of a 1 percent of GDP surplus over the cycle has enabled a reduction in public debt to a
relatively modest level, at 44 percent in 2015. The government has proposed to lower the target to
balance over the cycle, which would allow growth to erode the debt ratio over time. This fiscal target
should be reviewed periodically to keep it consistent with a prudent level of public debt or net
worth. Its coverage could be narrowed to exclude the defined contribution pension system so that
the central government balance need not be adjusted to offset variations in the pension balance.
23.
Fiscal policy should support a rebalancing of the housing market. Sweden’s tax system
strongly favors debt-financed home ownership, benefitting higher income households
disproportionally. Raising property tax would be preferred, but given the political difficulties a
package of other measures should be adopted in a broadly fiscally neutral manner:


14

Phasing out mortgage interest deductibility would ease demand gradually.
Deductibility from income tax liabilities of 30 percent of interest costs (21 percent above SEK
100,000) currently costs about ½ percent of GDP. A number of European counties have
eliminated tax deductibility in recent years or are in the process of phasing it out. This is an
ideal time to start phasing out deductibility in Sweden given low interest rates and the
robust housing market. A gradual reduction, such as by 5 percentage points annually, would
have little drag on growth, as the estimated impact on house prices is modest, at about
4 percent over eight years, while debt declines about 5½ percent over 11 years (Box 2).



Adjusting capital gains taxes would enhance effective supply. Households have
accumulated significant gains on their primary residences that discourage turnover as their
housing needs change. Raising the threshold for deferring capital gains taxes on primary
dwellings would facilitate more efficient use of existing dwellings.



Supporting construction of affordable rental property in locations with jobs. The 2016
budget allocates 0.1 percent of GDP annually to subsidizing such construction, where this
additional supply is expected to have small price impacts (Box 2). Indeed, this support likely
needs to be expanded and combined with reducing housing supply impediments (section E).

24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that a broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate
and noted their intention to accommodate additional migration-related costs in the near term. The
budget for 2016 sets out a gradual rise in the fiscal balance in the medium term and they welcomed
the support for targeting balance over the cycle. The Government has so far not favored reducing
mortgage interest deductibility, partly to avoid risks of a “hard landing” in the housing market.

C. Prudential Policy
25.
Swedish banks appear healthy, but
risk weights on some assets should be
reviewed. Capital adequacy and profitability
ratios are solid and funding structures close to
Basel III requirements, although Swedish banks
have a relatively high share of debt securities
due in less than 1 year. However, strong
regulatory capital ratios benefit from declining
risk weights as internal ratings based models
are partly driven by low default rates in recent
years. It is therefore welcome that the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA) is reviewing risk
weights on corporate loans.

Macroprudential policies have been strengthened in recent years, but macroeconomic
vulnerabilities can increase as house prices rise. In 2010 the FSA established a Loan-to-Value
(LTV) ceiling of 85 percent, with new mortgages having an average LTV of 70 percent in 2014. But

households can take on more debt relative to
income as house prices rise, even if prices rise
above sustainable levels. There is a framework in
place to contain risks of mortgage default.3 Yet
macroeconomic vulnerabilities increase with the
share of households with high debt to income (DTI)
ratios, as their disposable income is more sensitive
to interest rate fluctuations. Moreover, if house
prices decline, such households would face a larger
fall in their net wealth relative to income and a
higher risk of debt overhangs relative to their assets.

27.
A Debt-to-Income (DTI) limit would safeguard financial resilience while containing the
drag on growth, but it cannot substitute for housing market reforms. Rather than rationing
credit that is still growing at a single digit pace, such limits would aim to avoid a further rise in the
share of high DTI loans, which is already sizable.4 The DTI limits set for the UK (450 percent) and
Ireland (350 percent) allow a portion of new mortgages (15 and 20 percent respectively) to exceed
these thresholds.5 Following a similar approach in Sweden would allow the limit to be calibrated
such that few households would face an additional constraint on the amount of their borrowing at
the outset.6 To the extent that house price gains continue to outpace income, the limit would affect
more borrowers over time, protecting their resilience in part by reducing their LTV ratio. Such effects
would be focused on the main centers, especially Stockholm, where house prices are highest.
28.
The much delayed amortization requirements should also be implemented.
Discussions in recent years around mortgage amortization appear to have contributed to a change
in culture, with 68 percent of new mortgage loans being amortized in 2014, up from 42 percent in
2011. The FSA proposed a regulation in November 2014—for minimum amortization of 2 percent of
the original loan when LTV is over 70 percent and 1 percent when LTV is over 50 percent—but this
was later withdrawn after a court questioned the FSA’s mandate. In September the authorities
proposed legislation authorizing the FSA to adopt an amortization requirement for consultation,
with the specific FSA regulation subject to government approval, completing these steps by around
mid-2016. As most mortgages with a higher LTV are already amortizing, the impact on demand is
expected to be small, and effects on debt will be gradual as only new mortgages would be covered.
3

Banks stress test each mortgage borrower and are being conservative by using interest rates of 7-8 percent despite
mortgage rates below 2 percent. FSA stress tests (The Swedish Mortgage Market 2015) find households to be
resilient to a range of shocks. During the banking crisis in the early 1990s the rise in mortgage arrears was small,
where the Swedish Enforcement Authority contributes to the robustness of household debt service.

4

A recent paper finds 38.7 percent of mortgages have DTI over 400 percent of disposable income and 22.4 percent
have DTI over 500 percent. These ratios are not directly comparable to those for the U.K. and Ireland, which are
based on gross income.

5

A limit covering all mortgage originators in Sweden would help limit leakages. The comprehensive coverage of the
private credit bureau could enable all household debt to be covered, containing substitution into unsecured debts.
6

One of the banks indicated that it was applying its own DTI limit of about 500 percent on new mortgages.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

It is nonetheless important to cement recent progress on amortization by putting the regulation in
place. The adequacy of debt amortization should be kept under review.
29.
It is essential that the framework for macroprudential policies be strengthened to
enable timely action with suitable checks and balances. The FSA was assigned responsibility for
macroprudential policy in 2013. But, as became evident in the case of amortization requirements, its
legal mandate for financial stability and consumer protection does not ensure it can take certain
measures principally aimed at protecting macroeconomic stability. The resulting stop and go
process of adopting amortization requirements has generated market uncertainties. Especially in the
current circumstances, there is an urgent need to strengthen the FSA’s legal mandate to deploy a
range of macroprudential tools to address risks in a timely and efficient way.7 If targeted
macroprudential tools are delayed, banks’ capital buffers may need to be further increased.
30.
Regional cooperation on financial stability issues, especially for large cross-border
banks, should be enhanced. Nordea, a major bank in the region, plans to change to a branch
structure. With Nordea’s assets outside Sweden amounting to over 100 percent of the country’s
GDP, it will be essential to establish robust cross-border cooperation and information sharing
between the Swedish, regional, and European authorities, with respect to supervision, depositor
protection, and resolution arrangements.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are monitoring housing market and household debt
developments situation closely. At this juncture, they favor assessing the impact of amortization
requirements before taking further steps given uncertainty around the impacts of macroprudential
measures. A DTI limit is among a number of tools that could be considered. The FSA noted that they
presently have several macroprudential tools at their disposal which can be used if the financial
stability is threatened or for consumer protection purposes. Also the legal mandate for the FSA to
implement an amortization requirement is being strengthened. There is an ongoing discussion on the
need to further strengthen the FSA legal mandate to implement macroprudential tools. The Riksbank
believes that further measures and tools are urgently needed and that housing market reforms are
key. The authorities are monitoring Nordea’s plans to change to a branch structure carefully and they
agreed on the importance of continuing the well-functioning close supervisory and resolution
cooperation both within the region and Europe.

D. Labor Market Policy
32.
The Swedish labor market has become increasingly polarized and the rise in migration
inflows could initially raise unemployment. Sweden has enjoyed a rise in the labor force
participation in recent years, in part reflecting rising female participation (Box 4), and also higher
participation among young, older, and foreign born workers. However, job creation since 2007 has
been largely focused on higher skilled workers, leaving those with low skills with an unemployment
rate of 19 percent. Although employment of the foreign-born has risen substantially, their
7

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SWEDEN

unemployment rate is also high, at 16 percent. These gaps relative to total unemployment of 7¼
percent are relatively wide in Sweden, in part reflecting high entry-level wages (75–80 percent of
average wages) and strict employment protection for regular contracts.8 Historically, the
employment rates of migrants have risen toward the high level of Swedes, but the integration
process is lengthy, taking about 10 years to reach an employment rate of 60 percent. Hence the
large migration inflows could result in a significant rise in unemployment unless the pace of
integration can be improved (see Chapter I of the selected issues paper).
33.
Job creation should be facilitated by reforms that better adapt the labor market to the
evolving composition of the labor force. The social partners should ensure that entry-level wages
are not a barrier for groups with high unemployment to enter the labor market. Options include
enhancing wage flexibility at the firm level or special wage scales for those needing on-the-job
training. Social supports and tax credits would cushion disposable incomes. Strict employment
protection for regular contracts results in high implicit minimum educational and skill requirements
that form non-wage barriers to regular contracts which may have greater impacts on foreign-born
workers. Employment protection law should be reviewed to ensure that such exit costs do not deter
firms from hiring new entrants with sufficient skills. Providing training more aligned with employer
needs would better enable vulnerable groups to gain jobs and early active labor market support
should be targeted to cases of high long-term unemployment risk. The effectiveness of public job
matching services needs improvement, including by expanding contacts with employers, especially
as combining wage subsidies with better matching would enhance their employment benefits.
34.
Faster integration of refugees into the labor market would maximize their
contributions to the Swedish economy. As discussed in Box 1, Sweden has a well-developed
introduction program for refugees. The authorities are seeking improvements, such as the “fast
tracks” initiative for migrants with skills in occupations where there is a shortage, and they are
changing the reception system to designate municipalities to receive refugees based mostly on job
opportunities. Further efforts to expedite the residency permit, educational assessment, and skill
validation processes, are needed in view of rising numbers. Expanding employment programs for
youth that combine work and training, such as the vocational introduction employment program, to
also cover newly arrived refugees could help them gain their first job quickly and build needed skills.
35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the importance of enhancing training and job
matching. However, they noted that the relatively low take up of some wage subsidies raises doubts as
to whether wage floors are the only barriers to hinder the employment of vulnerable groups. They
noted that the impact of employment protection was mitigated by temporary contracts with low
protection. Social partners had differing views. Labor unions stressed the importance of protecting
minimum wages—at least 75 percent of average wages—as a key pillar of Sweden’s social model and
considered that use of employment subsidies should be expanded, including to higher skill jobs.
Employers noted the relatively small share of low skill jobs available in Sweden, pointing to the need to
ease wage compression both within and across sectors, to help the low skilled and migrants gain jobs.

Gender equity in participation rates and hours worked could lift Sweden’s potential output by
6 percent. Based on a simple analysis in a forthcoming paper, the room for output gains from gender
equity is smaller in Sweden than in most countries given the already high female employment rate. Yet,
shifting from part-time to full-time work could still raise potential output notably over time.
Female representation in managerial roles falls short despite relatively high participation in
corporate boards. Female representation in management (27 percent) is below the EU-27 average
(33 percent), despite a higher share of women on supervisory boards (26 versus 16 percent for the
EU-27).1 Moreover, segregation by gender across sectors and occupations is more pronounced in
Sweden than in other countries (European Commission, 2013).

E. Housing Policy
36.
Housing supply is falling behind needs owing to impediments to competition and rent
controls. Rising residential property prices in part reflect ongoing urbanization and migration trends
(Box 2) together with a limited supply response in urban centers (see Chapter II of the selected
issues paper). Despite rising profitability in the construction sector, the construction response is
inadequate, with low competition in the sector partly reflecting municipal land acquisition and
planning systems that are complex and time consuming, favoring larger companies and those with
local knowledge. Moreover, rent controls reduce the supply of rental apartments by driving
conversion into tenant ownership and deterring new construction. Controls also have “lock in”
effects where rents are low, hindering the efficient utilization of the remaining rental supply. With
long waiting lists for rental homes, many young households have to buy rather than rent.

37.
Reforms to enhance housing supply are needed, to both contain stability risks and
support employment. Building affordable rental housing in or near the main centers where job
prospects are best is the highest priority to promote labor mobility and support migrant integration.
As noted in Box 2, enhancing housing supply has gradual impacts on prices as—even at higher
levels—new construction remains modest relative to the dwelling stock. Key steps would include:


Enhancing land acquisition and planning procedures. These procedures are a municipal
responsibility, but the central government could incentivize municipalities to make these
processes more transparent, standardized, and timely. This would facilitate activity by a wider
range of construction companies. Municipalities could grant “use it or lose it” permits and the
central government could charge taxes on undeveloped land to ensure the companies
undertake projects in a timely manner.



Phasing out rent controls. Newly constructed rental apartments are exempt from controls for a
period, but uncertainties should be removed by permanently exempting all new construction.
Existing controls—which have the most impact in Stockholm—should be phased out, with
vulnerable households protected through the housing allowance.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

38.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are concerned about rising house prices and the budget
provides subsidies specifically targeted at boosting construction of smaller and affordable rental
apartments. They noted that municipalities were legally responsible for key aspects of housing supply,
such that the central government needed their cooperation to address these issues. The criticism of the
rent setting system and the consequences of how it has been implemented are long standing but it is
politically difficult to address this issue given strong support for the present system and as market rents
are associated with high rents and lack of security of tenure for tenants.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Growth is set to remain strong in the near term, but policies need to work together to
combat significant risks to growth and unemployment over the medium term. Stimulatory
macroeconomic policies have bolstered growth to about 3 percent, yet inflation remains below the
target. Unemployment rates for the low-skilled and foreign-born are considerably higher than
average and high migration inflows imply upward pressure on unemployment and have upfront
fiscal costs. Housing prices are rising rapidly from elevated levels, resulting in households taking on
higher debt and making the economy more vulnerable to shocks.
40.
Monetary policy should remain firmly stimulatory until core inflation is durably close
to target. The room for monetary policy to take into account financial stability considerations has
fallen as prolonged low inflation led to a sharp decline in inflation expectations, threatening to
undermine the role of the inflation target in promoting macroeconomic stability. Monetary policy
has shifted to a firmly stimulatory stance, which should be maintained until core inflation is durably
close to target, with the Riksbank appropriately ready to do more if needed. But, in view of Sweden’s
strong external position, intervention in the foreign exchange market should be a last resort.
41.
The broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate and migration expenses should be
accommodated in the near term, but fiscal policy must help the housing market rebalance.
Mortgage interest deductibility should be phased out, which can be done over time with little risk of
a hard landing in the housing market. Housing supply should be enhanced through further subsidies
for construction of affordable rental apartments in areas where job prospects are good and also by
increasing the limit for deferrals of capital gain taxes. Such a package would support sustained
growth while cooling housing prices gradually, and can be implemented in a fiscally neutral manner.
Moving over the medium term to maintaining a balanced central government budget over the cycle
would be sufficient to safeguard Sweden’s fiscal buffers.
42.
It is critical to remove structural impediments to housing supply to protect stability
and help sustain growth. Inadequate supply is a key contributor to rapidly rising housing prices.
Improved transparency and timeliness in municipal land acquisition and planning procedures are
needed to increase competition in residential construction. Rent controls should be eliminated for
newly constructed apartments and phased out more broadly, with vulnerable households protected
by the housing allowance. Expanding the availability of rental dwellings would also support growth
and help contain unemployment by facilitating labor mobility and migrant integration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SWEDEN

43.
The legal framework for macroprudential policies needs to be strengthened to enable
timely action and a DTI limit should be adopted. The long process of adopting amortization
regulations should be completed to cement the changes in amortization culture. But the FSA’s legal
mandate clearly needs to be strengthened to give it access to a range of macroprudential tools to
address risks in a timely and efficient way. Although such measures cannot substitute for housing
supply reforms, they can usefully moderate vulnerabilities from potential further rapid house price
increases. A limit on DTI would help avoid a rise in the already sizable share of high DTI mortgages.
Following recent international practice, a small portion of loans could exceed the threshold adopted,
which should be calibrated to affect few borrowers at the outset to contain the drag on growth.
44.
Migration inflows reinforce the importance of reforms to broaden job creation and
facilitate integration thereby ensuring Sweden gains the full benefits for long-term growth.
Sweden’s humanitarian migration policy has allowed a significant rise in migrant inflows in 2015 and
inflows appear likely to remain relatively high for some years. Improvements being made in the
well-developed introduction program for refugees are welcome and further efforts to expedite these
processes are needed. The social partners should ensure that entry-level wages are not a barrier for
groups with high unemployment to gain jobs. Strict employment protection for regular contracts
should be reviewed to ensure that exit costs do not deter firms from hiring new entrants with
sufficient skills. Training should be better aligned with employer needs and the effectiveness of
public job matching services improved. Expanding certain youth employment and training programs
to newly arrived refugees would help them gain their first job and build skills.
45.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation with Sweden on the
standard 12–month cycle.

1/ The calculations follow rules under Basel II, including transition rules as reported by the Riksbank. Without transition rules, the capital ratios would
currently be higher due to lower risk-weighted assets (the result of banks’ implementation of the IRB approach).

3/ From 2010 onward, exposures to credit institutions are included.
4/ Non consolidated bases, and parent banks only. Monetary financial institutions include banks and housing credit institutions.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

indexes following the latest international standards. In addition, data on labor force, employment, and
unemployment are disseminated and reported regularly for IFS.
Government Finance Statistics: Government finance statistics have been published based on ESA

2010 methodology since September 2014.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics are

based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Sweden has published Financial Soundness Indictors based on the Financial
Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide (2006) since 2012.
External Sector Statistics: Sweden publishes external sector statistics based on the sixth edition of

the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) methodology since
December 2014. Sweden participates in the coordinated direct investment survey (CDIS) and in the

Statement by Mr. Thomas Ostros, Alternate Executive Director for Sweden and
Mr. Paavo Miettinen, Advisor to the Executive Director
November 30, 2015
The Swedish authorities would like to thank the mission team for the report, as well as for the
open and constructive policy discussions during the Article IV consultation with Sweden. The
authorities broadly agree with the conclusions and recommendations of the staff report.
Recent macroeconomic development and outlook
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the current economic development and
challenges. The Swedish economy is performing well. Solid private consumption and rising
residential investment contribute to above average growth. In addition, a pick-up in serviceled exports will help push up annual GDP growth to around 3 percent. Employment has kept
a steady growth rate over 1 percent for some time, while the unemployment rate just recently
started to decline and reached 7¼ percent in Q3. Inflation has been low for some time but has
started to rise following the previous depreciation of the krona and supported by a highly
expansionary monetary stance.
That being said, Sweden faces major challenges, foremost in light of the current sharp rise in
migration inflows. Population growth is now projected to reach 1¼ percent in 2015 and to
remain high in the coming years. In the short term, introduction programs and transfers to
municipalities will mean a boost to public spending. Moreover, challenges in integrating
immigrants overlap with current high unemployment of low-skilled workers.
The drastic uptick in the number of asylum seekers in Sweden during 2015 poses great
challenges for government authorities, regional actors, and local municipalities. Among the
most pressing challenges are reception and timely registration of asylum seekers, housing,
immediate medical needs, and providing for the very high number of unaccompanied minors.
Potentially the entire public sectors could be affected. Conditions are becoming more
challenging on a daily basis, and hence frequent reassessments have to be made.
Financial stability and macroprudential policy
The authorities share the IMF’s concern over rapid housing price increases associated with
rising household indebtedness. Measures such as a loan-to-value limit and a risk-weight floor
for mortgages have already been introduced. Moreover, work is currently ongoing to
introduce an amortization requirement. Further, the authorities believe that the IMF’s
recommendation to consider a debt-to-income limit is one among a number of tools that
could be considered. It is also important to implement reforms which increase the supply of
housing.
If there is a continued increase of house prices and household debt the need increases for
other policy actions aimed at reducing risks related to this. The introduction of other
macroprudential tools, or further tightening of macroprudential tools already in place, can be
effective means to address imbalances in the residential mortgage market. There is an

ongoing discussion on the need to further strengthen the FSA’s legal mandate to deploy a
range of macroprudential tools to address risks in a timely and efficient way. The Riksbank
believes that implementation of further tools are urgently needed.
During recent years the Swedish banks have improved their resilience to credit- and liquidity
risks, but additional measures could be warranted. The FSA considers the Swedish banks to
be resilient towards credit losses. As noted in the report, work is currently being undertaken
by the FSA to review risk weights on corporate loans in order to strengthen the robustness of
risk-based capital requirements. The Riksbank believes that capital buffers should be further
increased.
In view of Nordea’s plans of changing to a branch structure, regional and European
cooperation will need to continue to be enhanced in terms of resolution arrangements.
Monetary policy
The Swedish economy has coped relatively well during recent years, in particular compared
to other European countries, and the favorable macroeconomic developments are in part
linked to the way that monetary policy has been conducted. Inflation has, however, been low
for some time, and the Riksbank shares staff’s view on the importance of returning inflation
to target. Inflation has started to rise, supported by the highly expansionary monetary policy
and the weaker exchange rate. The krona is expected to slowly strengthen in the coming
years, and thus the positive contribution of the exchange rate to inflation is expected to
diminish. Nevertheless, the upturn in inflation is expected to continue, as the monetary stance
contributes towards more favorable real economic conditions. There is, however,
considerable uncertainty regarding global developments and the future development of the
exchange rate.
Over the past year, the Executive Board of the Riksbank has clearly communicated its
determination to return inflation to target. The expansionary measures undertaken so far – the
negative repo rate and purchases of government bonds – have had an effect on households’
and companies’ financial conditions and on the exchange rate. In addition, in the most recent
monetary policy meeting in October, a decision was made to extend the government bond
purchase program through mid-2016 and defer an initial increase of the repo rate until the
first half of 2017. There is still a high level of preparedness to quickly make monetary policy
even more expansionary if inflation prospects deteriorate, underlining the Riksbank’s aim to
return inflation to target and protect the credibility of the inflation target.
The highly expansionary monetary policy is necessary to ensure that inflation continues to
rise, but a prolonged period of low interest rates also poses risks. The Riksbank is
continuously monitoring the effects of the low interest rates on the vulnerability of the
financial system, especially since the repo rate entered negative territory. The assessment is
that the negative interest rates have, so far, not impaired the functionality of the financial
system. However, there are risks related to increased risk-taking on the financial markets and
potential overvaluation of assets. The Riksbank has emphasized the high indebtedness of
Swedish households as a particular risk. However, monetary policy has no room to address

this risk.
The effects of the recent migration inflows on the Swedish economy remain yet to be seen,
and inflation may be affected both in the short and the longer term. The Riksbank has
communicated limited tolerance for low inflation, but a higher willingness to allow inflation
to temporarily exceed its forecast without necessarily tightening monetary policy. In 2016,
the next large-scale round of collective bargaining will take place. Ensuring that long-term
inflation expectations remain anchored around the inflation target, and thereby a steady
functioning of the wage formation process, continues to be the primary concern for monetary
policy ahead.
Fiscal policy
The Ministry of Finance agrees with staff’s fiscal assessment that a broadly neutral fiscal
stance is appropriate in the near term. Net lending remains below the target level and
therefore the public finances need to be strengthened. However, resource utilization has been
low for a long time and the outlook for continued recovery is uncertain. Fiscal policy
therefore needs to support economic recovery and contribute to pushing down unemployment
rates. The reforms proposed in the Budget Bill for 2016 should be fully funded. This position
of fiscal policy will help strengthen net lending, while safeguarding the ongoing recovery.
The Government has presented to the parliament a draft addendum to the budget because of
the refugee situation. In the addendum to the budget, the Government proposes a temporary
support to local governments and civil society. The proposals will be financed by an increase
in government borrowing. The vast number of refugees involves unforeseen, and in the short
term, more or less inevitable expenditures. Increased government borrowing is a common
way to manage unforeseen costs during the current budget year.
Government offices are currently reviewing how different spending increases that may occur
over the coming years could be financed. Depending on how the public finances and
migration flows evolve, spending increases may be financed through decreased expenditures
on other items in future budgets, measures to curb cost increases, borrowing, or a
combination of these measures.
Structural issues
Labor market policy
As for the Swedish labor market, it should be noted that it is strong in an international
comparison. Swedish labor force participation and employment rates are the highest in the
EU. At the same time, unemployment is high. The objective of the Government’s
employment policy is to reduce unemployment so that it is the lowest in the EU by 2020.
Accordingly, in the Budget Bill for 2016, the Government is investing in better job matching
and skills development through measures to promote an active labor market policy for people
who are long-term unemployed or have impairments that entail reduced working capacity.

The Government is also significantly increasing the compensation paid to municipalities for
their reception of refugees, and undertaking more effective measures to introduce newly
arrived immigrants to the labor market.
Staff assesses that a rise in migration inflows could initially raise unemployment. However,
in the very short run, immigration is expected to have a positive effect on public expenditures
as consumption related to schooling and housing etc. will rise. This will stimulate labor
demand in the short run. In addition, it will take time before newly arrived immigrants get
access to the labor market and become part of the labor supply. Taken together, immigration
is therefore likely to result in a downward pressure on unemployment in the near future. Over
time, however, unemployment could be expected to rise as newly arrived immigrants enter
the labor force. Effective integration policies are key to speed up the process.
Staff recommends that the employment protection law should be reviewed to ensure that exit
costs do not deter firms from hiring new entrants with sufficient skills. Temporary contracts
can be an effective stepping stone into the labor market for groups whose productivity is
uncertain. Moreover, there are a number of subsidies available for groups facing low demand
in the labor market. This being said, it is important that employees do not get stuck in fixed
term employment for longer periods of time. Open ended contracts should be the main rule.
The Swedish government is currently working on a bill, intended to further reduce the
possibility of using repeated fixed-term contracts and improve the situation of workers who
risk becoming stuck in fixed-term employment for an extended period.
Taxation
The design of the tax system is one of many factors that can influence levels of household
debt. Any potential measures in this area must however be seen in a long term perspective
and must be handled with great care, due to the potential negative effects on growth that a
change in measures such as tax deductibility on mortgage interest payments may have. With
current economic growth being highly sensitive to changes in private consumption, it is
essential that new regulation is implemented carefully in order to keep house prices from
falling rapidly.
Regarding the deferral of capital gains tax when selling a house, it should be noted that one
of the principles for the Swedish tax system is to tax as close to the time of the taxable
income as possible. A more generous threshold for deferring capital gains tax would go in the
other direction.
Housing supply
In general, the observations and recommendations by staff are in line with the analysis and
policy objectives pursued by the Swedish government, i.e. housing supply must increase,
competition be strengthened, and the planning and appeal processes streamlined. It should be
noted that changes within these areas take time and they will consequently be subject to
reforms for an extended period of time.

In the Budget Bill for 2016, the Government has proposed measures to increase investment
in the housing sector, for example investment aid to rental housing and student housing. The
Government has also proposed simplification of rules designed to streamline the planning
and construction process as well as improved noise regulations. Furthermore, means will be
allocated to municipalities in order to provide incentives to contribute to increased housing
construction. Two commissions of inquiry are reviewing the competition in the construction
sector as well as investigating how tenants' position could be strengthened so that the lease
will be considered attractive and secure housing in the future.
As to the rent-setting process, it was, in conjunction with the re-regulation of the Municipal
Housing Companies, subject to reform taking effect from January 1, 2011. Changes have also
been made in the special rules applying to new rental housing extending the time period
during which an exemption from the ordinary rent setting rules from 10 to 15 years as late as
from February 1, 2013. There is strong support for the present rent setting system which
provides a framework for ensuring “fair rents” and thereby ensures security of tenure for
tenants while market rents are perceived as associated with high rents and lack of security of
tenure for tenants.
As to public infrastructure investments as an available policy measure, the Government
agrees with staff that such measures should be implemented. Accordingly, the Government
recently presented a program that contains substantial long-term investments in housing,
public transport, and railways. Moreover, a special committee has been set up to enable rapid
construction of high speed railways between major cities and related infrastructure.
