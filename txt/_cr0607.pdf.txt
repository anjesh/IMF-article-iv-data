March 8, 2005
•

Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Panama City during November 8–23 and
December 14–15. The team met with the Minister of Economy and Finance, the General
Manager of the National Bank of Panama, other senior officials, and representatives of
banks and the business sector.

•

Team. W. Lewis (Head), M. Dehesa, P. Druck, A. Faria, and E. Verreydt (all WHD)
participated in the first mission, which was accompanied by A. Macia (OED).
J. Fajgenbaum and W. Lewis participated in the December visit.

•

Previous consultation. At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation on
March 22, 2004, Directors stressed the need to maintain a sound fiscal policy through
compliance with the country’s fiscal responsibility law, and to proceed with social
security reform. They considered that structural reforms in the fiscal area were needed,
including tax policy, tax administration, and the civil service.

•

Effectiveness of past surveillance. While generally agreeing with the Fund’s policy
advice during the last Article IV consultation, the previous authorities faced difficulties in
pursuing continued fiscal consolidation and structural reform in 2003–04. As a result, the
fiscal deficit in 2003 and 2004 exceeded the level required for compliance with the fiscal
law. While Directors emphasized the need for fiscal reforms, the pace of reform slowed
during the election period. Since then, the new administration has begun to implement a
medium-term fiscal adjustment plan, consistent with Fund advice, and is now preparing a
reform of the social security agency.

•

Fund relations. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
(Appendix I). Panama’s outstanding use of Fund credit at end-2004 was 11 percent of
quota. Panama participates in the GDDS, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Data
Standards Bulletin Board.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Growth. An economic recovery has been underway since late 2003, with real GDP
growing at 6 percent in 2004, but it is expected to slow down to 3½ percent in 2005.
Inflation remains low.

•

Fiscal performance. The fiscal deficit (excluding the Panama Canal Authority
(PCA)) reached 5 percent of GDP in 2004. The administration that assumed office in
September 2004 embarked on a medium-term strategy to reduce the deficit.

•

Financial sector. The banking system experienced a substantial recovery in 2003–04,
and the financial system remains essentially sound, with favorable performance
indicators and a strong regulatory framework.

•

Medium-term outlook. The medium-term outlook is encouraging, assuming
implementation of the authorities’ fiscal program, which should put the public debt
ratio on a steadily declining path. A downside risk would emerge if the administration
is unable to sustain the fiscal adjustment effort that is now underway.

•

Panama Canal expansion. An expansion of the Panama Canal at an estimated cost of
over 30 percent of GDP could, if approved in a national referendum, have a farreaching impact on the economy’s growth prospects.

Policy discussions
•

Policy objectives. The government’s strategic objectives are to restore fiscal
discipline to achieve debt sustainability and provide a basis for sustained growth and
jobs creation, poverty reduction, and the development of human capital. The
authorities’ program gives priority to good governance with transparency and
accountability in government.

•

Fiscal program. A fiscal reform adopted in February 2005 is part of a plan to lower
the deficit (excluding the PCA) to about 1 percent of GDP by 2007. It provides for the
phased introduction of tax reform, the containment of current expenditure, and a
repeal of tax incentives. The budget for 2005 appropriately targets a reduction in the
fiscal deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP.

•

Pension reform. The authorities are preparing a reform of the public pension system,
which may entail some combination of changes in the benefit system, eligibility
requirements, and financing of the pension system.

•

Medium-term strategy. The authorities’ growth strategy centers on enhancing the
competitiveness of the export-oriented service sector, and includes human capital
development and adequate infrastructure.

•

Trade policy. The prospective free trade agreement with the United States signals
Panama’s commitment to further integration with the regional and global economy.

I. BACKGROUND AND PROSPECTS FOR 2005
A. Overview
1.
Panama is an open, fully dollarized economy whose mainstay is a large and
diversified service sector (Figures 1 and 2). The service sector accounts for about threequarters of total value-added and is growing in importance. Services are diversified, including in
particular the operations of the government-owned (since 2000) Panama Canal, the Colon Free
Zone, a large banking system integrated with international financial markets, and tourism. The
fastest growing services are transport, communications, tourism, and wholesale trade. Two thirds
of exports, which amount to 30 percent of GDP, are services.
2.
Over the last decade, Panama experienced moderate growth on average, ranging
between 0.6 percent (2001) and 7.3 percent (1998). In the last five years, the sources of growth
shifted from domestic demand to the external sector with the weakening of investment and
imports and continued moderate growth of exports. Unemployment, however, remained above
11.5 percent throughout the period. The fiscal accounts deteriorated on average over the last
decade as a result of decreasing revenues and increasing expenditures relative to GDP. Financial
deepening during the period was reflected in an
increase in the ratio of private credit to GDP of

Panama’s social indicators compare
favorably with the average for Latin
America, but rural areas lag behind. The
poverty rate is 37 percent on average
(67 percent in rural areas, where 54 percent of
the population live in extreme poverty), with a
particularly high concentration of poverty
among indigenous people (98 percent).1
Malnutrition among children averages only
6 percent in urban areas, but rises to 15 percent
in nonindigenous rural areas and 49 percent in
indigenous rural areas. Urban-rural differences
in infant mortality rates, access to drinking
water, and other social indicators also are large.

the economic field include fiscal discipline, fighting corruption, poverty reduction through job
creation, continued trade integration, and a commitment to good governance and transparency in
the public sector.
C. Recent Economic Developments
5.
A strong economic recovery has been underway since late 2003. Real GDP rose
5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 6½ percent in the first three quarters of 2004, year on
year. Despite a growth in jobs, the unemployment rate is likely to have remained above
11 percent of the labor force in 2004, indicating high structural unemployment (see Figure 1).

6.
The nonfinancial public
sector deficit (excluding the
Panama Canal Authority)
increased slightly in 2004 to an
estimated 5 percent of GDP.
Nontax revenue of the central
government declined,4 while public investment fell from the relatively high level of 2003, when
the pace of implementation of large projects was stepped up near the end of the previous
administration. Although the net revenue effect of a tax reform implemented at the end of 2002
was modestly positive, the buoyancy of the tax system remains weak (Figure 3 and Tables 2–3).
A growing surplus of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) improved the fiscal balance utilized by

Under the 2002 tax law, construction authorized before end-2003 and completed before end-2004 is exempted
from property tax for 20 years. The new government extended this exemption by one year. Subsequently, a shorter
tax-exempt period would apply.

CPI inflation in Panama is consistently lower than U.S. inflation.

Dividends fell in 2004, owing to a change in policy regarding their timing. During 2000–03, the BNP paid
dividends to the Treasury that exceeded realized profits by a total of 0.5 percent of annual GDP. The new authorities
discontinued this policy in 2004, and the payment of BNP’s dividend was shifted to 2005.

-7the previous administration to measure compliance with the fiscal responsibility law
(nonfinancial public sector deficit including the PCA), but the deficit remained well above the
limit of 2 percent of GDP, which was established in that law (Section III.A).
7.
Starting in September 2004, the new administration took a number of steps to
improve fiscal transparency and contain the deficit. It introduced revenue and expenditure
measures, yielding an estimated 0.2 percentage point of annual GDP, and reviewed aspects of
fiscal accounting methods in light of concerns that the reported deficit could be understating the
fiscal imbalance.5 Also, the authorities suspended the fiscal responsibility law (FRL) until end2005 because they did not regard compliance with the deficit limit of 2 percent of GDP to be
feasible.
8.
Domestic financing of the public sector deficit in 2004 led to a decline in net
international reserves of US$380 million (Table 4).6 Credit to the central government from the
state-owned National Bank of Panama (BNP) amounted to about 2.5 percent of GDP 2004, while
the social security fund (CSS) withdrew some of its deposits at the BNP, mainly to cover an
operating deficit. The resulting contraction of the BNP’s foreign assets has reduced its liquidity
and weakened the BNP’s ability to provide a cushion in the event of a shock to the financial
system.
9.
The banking system experienced a sustained recovery in 2003–04, following the
turbulence in financial markets in South America during 2002. Domestic deposits rose by
8 percent in 2004 as the economic expansion gathered strength. Nonresident deposits in the
domestic banking system stabilized in 2003 and resumed growth during 2004 (Figure 4). Rapid
growth of credit to commerce and mortgages led to an 11 percent increase in domestic credit to
the private sector in 2004.
10.
The financial system remains generally sound. Nonperforming loan ratios have
trended downward since end-2002, both for domestic and foreign banks, to 2 percent on average
at end-September 2004. At the same time, capital adequacy ratios were 19 percent on average,
and liquidity in the private banks remained ample (Table 5). Domestic deposit rates declined,
converging to LIBOR (Figure 5). A slower decline in lending rates led to wider interest rate
margins, in particular in local banks.
11.
Bond markets have begun to respond favorably to the new administration’s
emphasis on fiscal discipline and transparency. Market concern over growing fiscal
imbalances in 2004 had been reflected in adverse movements in spread differentials relative to
other emerging markets; in recent months, however, there has been some improvement in these
differentials (Figure 6). Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s sovereign ratings for Panama are one
and two steps below investment grade, respectively. In mid-February S&P improved Panama’s
outlook from negative to stable.

The cash-based deficit did not reflect an apparent increase in payables in 2003–04; and certain nontax revenue was
over-reported.

-8-

12.
Panama’s trade policy remained focused on concluding free trade agreements,
where some progress was made in 2003–04. The strategy of attracting foreign investors with a
regional focus led to a free trade agreement with Taiwan Province of China in 2003, and
negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United States began in April 2004. Within the
Central America region, an agreement has been concluded with El Salvador, and negotiations
with Costa Rica and Nicaragua are underway.
D. Outlook for 2005
13.
The staff projects a slowdown in real GDP growth from 6 percent in 2004 to
3½ percent in 2005. Activity in the construction sector is expected to decelerate,7 but still
remain at a high level, induced by the extension of the tax incentives.8 The contribution to
growth from the external sector, while positive, is likely to diminish, as the external environment
is expected to be less favorable than in 2004 for merchandise exports, while service exports
continue a moderate expansion. The external current account deficit is projected to decrease to
1½ percent of GDP in 2005 (Table 6). Inflation is expected to remain low.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The authorities seek to promote the country’s economic and social development
through four strategic, and closely interrelated, objectives. They regard one of them—fiscal
discipline and transparency—to be an essential precondition to sustained progress with the
others: poverty reduction, economic growth for the creation of jobs, and the development of
human capital. The authorities’ program reflects their view that a prosperous economy and
cohesive society require sustainable growth, good governance, and policies that extend economic
opportunity and social services to impoverished rural areas.
15.
The authorities explained that growth-oriented policies would aim at increased
productivity and competitiveness in the export-oriented sectors, drawing upon the
potential benefits of Panama’s integration with the global and regional economy. An
expansion of the Panama Canal could add to this potential. The authorities recognized that no
growth strategy can have a lasting success unless the public finances and public debt are placed
on a sustainable path through a reduction of the budget deficit and social security reform.
Against this background, the Article IV discussions focused on the economic policies needed to
support the objectives of fiscal consolidation and sustainability, growth, and competitiveness.
A. Fiscal Policy
16.
The authorities’ fiscal policy objectives are to lower the public debt burden; restore
viability to the public pension system; enhance transparency and accountability in the
public sector; and, over the medium term, address unmet needs for public investment. The
authorities intend to put the fiscal deficit on a firmly declining path, starting in 2005 with a
7

Real value-added in the construction sector has risen by over 55 percent since 2001.

8

See footnote 1.

-91½ percentage-point of GDP reduction in the nonfinancial public sector deficit (excluding the
PCA), to 3.6 percent of GDP. The deficit would decrease further, to about 1 percent of GDP
by 2007. The staff agreed that these deficit targets were appropriate, in view of the importance
for Panama’s dollarized economy of fiscal policies that support good public debt dynamics.
17.
To achieve these targets, the authorities have begun to implement an ambitious and
comprehensive fiscal strategy, including the following elements:
•

The annual budget underpins most of the planned reduction in the deficit in 2005 (see
Table 2). It restricts public investment to the completion of ongoing projects for the most
part, and limits low-priority current spending.

•

A multi-faceted fiscal reform was adopted in early February 2005, which encompasses a
containment of current expenditure, tax reform, the repeal of fiscal incentives for certain
sectors,9 and measures aimed at greater accountability in the public sector (Box 1).

•

A proposal for social security reform is being readied for public discussion and
presentation to the National Assembly.

•

The fiscal responsibility law will be revised in the course of 2005.

Staff agreed that the fiscal targets for 2005 and the medium term, supported by an appropriate
sequencing of fiscal reforms, represented a strong adjustment effort that should put the public
finances on a path toward sustainability. The measures already adopted should be adequate to
achieve, and likely exceed, the fiscal target for 2005, and their phased impact together with plans
for social security reform should contribute to further fiscal consolidation in the following years.
Once the fiscal impact of these reforms is known, the authorities will be able to assess whether
additional measures are needed to meet their medium-term fiscal targets.
18.
Several measures seek to control current expenditure. Public sector employment is to
be reduced to the end-1999 levels by the beginning of 2008, in part through attrition;10 the
growth of primary current expenditure is limited, starting in 2006, to the growth of current
revenue in the preceding year; administrative expenses are curtailed; and outlays for professional
services are curbed. The rationalization of current expenditure would support deficit reduction
and, over the medium term, a shift in the composition of outlays toward roads infrastructure and
expanded facilities in the health and education sectors. The staff agreed with the emphasis given
to curbs on current expenditure, in particular the phased reduction of public sector employment
in response to its excessive growth in recent years.

9

In particular, construction, manufacturing, and forestry. Future fiscal incentives are to be explicitly limited in
duration.

10

Taking account of exceptions for health, education, and security services, employment would decline from about
180,000 to a range of 165–170 thousand by end-2007. Government agencies must submit their plans by mid-2005
for achieving the targeted reduction.

- 10 -

19.
The tax reform included in the fiscal package appropriately aims to improve the
equity, efficiency, yield, and buoyancy of the tax system. It will close loopholes in corporate
income taxation, introduce an alternative minimum income tax for individuals and corporations,
introduce a tax on casino payouts, include representation expenses in taxable income, increase
penalties for fraud, and simplify the tax system by eliminating a number of low-yielding taxes.
Fiscal incentives were eliminated in some cases where the tax breaks were poorly targeted (e.g.,
in the industrial sector). Part of the reform will take immediate effect; the full-year revenue
effect is estimated at 1 percent of GDP. Staff agreed that the equity considerations leading to the
closing of tax loopholes and the removal of ineffective tax incentives could help gain public
acceptance of the tax reform.
20.
The authorities are planning to reduce unpaid bills in 2005. As a first step, payables
to suppliers that are more than 90 days old would be eliminated, and then the maximum duration
of payables would be lowered to 60 days.11 Staff agreed that the reduction of arrears was
important, and noted that the fiscal reforms could provide room to make even faster progress
than currently planned in settling unpaid bills.12 Also, to improve transparency, an explicit
definition of arrears should be adopted, with interest accruing on arrears to suppliers.
21.
The authorities recognize the need for greater fiscal transparency. Upon assuming
office, the administration concluded that a lack of clarity in the fiscal accounts13 and inadequate
reporting on fiscal performance hindered fiscal transparency and accountability. They have
requested a fiscal ROSC, which would help identify changes that may be required to bring
practices in line with the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency, especially with regard
to open budget processes and availability of information.
22.
The authorities plan to revise the fiscal responsibility law (FRL) in the course
of 2005. In reviewing the FRL, while embarking on medium-term fiscal consolidation, they will
consider a combination of numerical and procedural rules, since sole reliance on numerical rules
has not worked well. The staff agreed, noting that revised rules should be well-defined,
consistent, enforceable, and supported by sound policies; and transparent procedures are needed
for monitoring compliance (see Box 2).
23.
The authorities are preparing a reform of the social security sector with a view to
restoring its financial viability. They have taken steps to reduce the high administrative costs
and improve the management of the pension reserve fund, and they are aiming for a reform that
would address a fundamental imbalance between pension contributions and pension benefits.
Without reform, the pension reserve fund may be depleted by 2010–12. The pension reform
11

Government payables over 90 days amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP as of late November 2004; the 2005 budget
assumes a reduction in payables of about 0.8 percentage point of GDP.

12

The authorities’ budget did not take into account the tax reform that was subsequently presented to the National
Assembly (Box 2).

13

Sizeable government payables are not captured in the cash-based deficit. Also, the new administration believes
that revenue was overstated by the inclusion of capital gains from Brady bond buybacks and a part of the BNP’s
transfers to the government corresponded to future profits.

- 11 could entail some combination of changes in the benefit system, eligibility requirements, and
financing of the pension system. The details of the reform have not been finalized, but the
authorities are focusing their analysis on parametric reforms that might be phased in over time,
such as changes in the retirement age and the rate at which benefits accrue. Staff agreed on the
need for a comprehensive pension reform, with implementation phased over a number of years,
both to eliminate current operating deficits and to align pension fund incomes with future
pension obligations. The authorities also are concerned that the finances of the maternal and
health care program of social security are no longer financially viable, and they may be
evaluating reform alternatives in this area as well.
24.
The authorities have decided to exclude the PCA from the public sector accounts for
policy purposes, including for the future revision of fiscal rules. They noted that the PCA—
widely regarded as efficiently run—is an autonomous state enterprise under the Constitution, and
its surpluses are unavailable to meet fiscal needs. The authorities and staff agreed to present both
the authorities’ definition of the fiscal balance (excluding the Canal Authority) and the more
comprehensive measure including the PCA as part of the public sector.14 The authorities stressed
that it was important to demonstrate that the PCA is commercially run and to preserve its
managerial independence, thus ensuring that it remains fully protected from pressures to engage
in quasi-fiscal activities. Staff noted that the treatment of the PCA’s operations in the public
sector accounts depends in part on whether the Authority is commercially run. The PCA appears
not to meet all criteria for being considered commercially run, in most cases because the criteria
assume that the private sector holds some equity in the public enterprise, but also because it is
exempt from corporate income tax.
25.
The prospective expansion of the Panama Canal is expected to become a central
feature of the government’s program. The expansion project, if approved in a national
referendum, could provide a major boost to service exports by the middle of the next decade.
The authorities view the separation of the PCA from the fiscal accounts as an essential element
of their strategy to promote the markets’ perception of the PCA’s commercial soundness and
secure an investment grade credit rating for the PCA.
26.
Debt management is directed toward balancing cost and risk in determining the mix
of external and domestic sources of deficit financing. Following the retirement of
US$400 million in Brady bonds in the first quarter of 2004, only US$370 million remains, for
which buybacks are not planned in the near term. The authorities also are restructuring maturities
to achieve a smoother path of maturing debt. Staff encouraged the authorities to further develop
the domestic public debt market, gradually increasing the share of domestic financing through
competitive auctions of government securities. The US$350 million line of credit from the BNP
to the government, initially drawn as a short-term liquidity loan in mid-2004, will be repaid over
11 years. The mission recommended a more rapid repayment to allow for a faster replenishment
of the BNP’s foreign assets.

14

In any event, the broader measure would be used for national accounts purposes.

B. Financial Sector Policies
27.
The authorities’ strategy for maintaining a sound banking system is to emphasize
crisis prevention, transparency, and market discipline. The authorities maintain close
supervision of the banking system, with an emphasis on the early detection and prompt
correction of bank problems.15 This prudential approach is of particular importance in view of
the authorities’ decision not to establish a lender of last resort for the dollarized financial system,
or to arrange a contingent line of credit abroad for the BNP, owing to concerns over moral
hazard. Also, banks maintain relatively high levels of liquidity. Staff agreed that a strong
supervisory framework and ample liquidity cushions have helped limit the vulnerability to
deposit runs, but noted that prudential practices cannot fully eliminate the risks of systemic bank
problems.16
28.
The authorities also have strengthened the coordination with other supervisory
authorities in the region in 2003–04 for effective cross-border supervision. They are
participating in a financial sector review in Central America that is being undertaken by MFD,
which focuses on regional consolidated supervision and other issues.17 Also, the authorities have
requested that MFD follow up the Module 2 OFC assessment undertaken in 2001; a mission is
scheduled for the second quarter of 2005. The Superintendency of Banks is preparing for the
adoption of the Basel II principles of bank supervision. Staff agreed with the emphasis that the
Superintendency has placed on enhancing regional cooperation, since the expansion of regional
banking accentuates the need for effective cross-border supervision.
29.
The authorities are preparing a strategic plan for the National Bank of Panama. It is
expected to entail improvements in governance, adherence to sound commercial banking
practices, and a gradual reduction in outstanding credit to government. Also, the BNP’s strategy
should provide adequate protection from pressures to extend credit to government other than
short-term liquidity loans. The authorities also recognize the need to improve governance and
promote prudent commercial banking practices in the state-owned Savings Bank. The staff
agreed that strategic plans needed to be formulated for both the BNP and the Savings Bank, and
suggested that an evaluation of state banks—with a view to future reforms—should extend also
to the two development banks, the National Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural Development
Bank.
C. Policies for Competitiveness and Growth
30.
Panama’s external competitiveness appears to be broadly satisfactory, based on a
number of standard indicators. The real effective exchange rate remained lower in 2004 than
15

Onshore and offshore banks are subject to essentially the same prudential requirements.

16

At end-September 2004, the liquid assets-to-deposits ratio was 27 percent (42 percent, if marketable securities are
included).
17

The regional project also will examine the links between financial and nonfinancial companies within a group,
common accounting rules, and the supervision of financial institutions with cross-border operations on a large scale.

- 13 in the preceding several years, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar in 2002–03
(Figure 7); the volume of merchandise exports accelerated in 2002–04, although its growth did
not keep pace with that of export markets in 2004 (Figure 2); Panama has expanded its market
share for certain service exports in recent years, notably tourism and port services; and the
external current account deficit is projected to fall below 2 percent of GDP in 2005.
31.
From a broader perspective, however, Panama’s competitiveness falls short of what
is needed for the export sector to play the leading role that is envisaged in the government’s
medium-term growth strategy. Panama ranked 58th out of 104 countries in the latest World
Economic Forum competitiveness report, owing to a perception of weak public institutions, and
exports of goods and services have grown only slightly faster than GDP over the five years
to 2004 (annual average growth rates of 3½ percent and 3¼ percent, respectively).
32.
Trade policy, which is an integral part of the government’s competitiveness
strategy, is centered on the prospective free trade agreement with the United States. The
agreement would offer greater permanence than the Caribbean Basin Initiative for merchandise
exports, boost market access for the Panamanian export-oriented service sector, encourage
foreign investors with a regional focus to establish operations in Panama, and enhance the legal
framework that could attract U.S. investors to Panama. Future trade agreements may be sought
with other countries, including Singapore and additional Central American countries.
33.
The government’s medium-term growth strategy centers on enhancing the
competitiveness of the export-oriented service sector, where Panama’s comparative
advantage is concentrated. A key objective is to develop Panama further as a regional hub for
transportation, trade, banking, and communication services.18 Elements of this strategy are
education reform with emphasis on better meeting the training needs of the workforce; ensuring
adequate economic infrastructure; and lowering the cost of doing business by streamlining
bureaucratic requirements for businesses. The government is also developing a special economic
zone (Howard), with simple administrative procedures and flexible labor rules. The authorities
noted that, although there is little support for a general labor reform, greater flexibility in the
terms of employment was introduced successfully for this and other special economic zones in
mid-2004.19 The staff recommended that such rules for labor flexibility be generalized to other
regions.
34.
The authorities have launched a fight against corruption and are developing
institutional reforms that could foster growth. The authorities aim to improve the rule of law
and improve the business climate through their anti-corruption strategy. Emphasizing “zero
tolerance” and setting good examples among public sector leaders, the authorities have repealed
a decree that impeded implementation of the Law on Transparency; established a national
council for transparency and anti-corruption; and undertaken audits of government contractors

fluctuations, conflict resolution, and the introduction of productivity clauses.

- 14 and public sector institutions. Staff welcomed the emphasis on good governance and noted that
efforts to improve efficiency in government (streamlining bureaucratic requirements,
establishing more transparent procurement practices, simplifying procedures for exports, etc.)
could yield benefits both for the fight against corruption and fiscal adjustment efforts.
D. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
35.
Staff has prepared an active scenario through 2009 that is broadly based on the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal policies and objectives. It assumes full implementation of the
February 2005 fiscal reforms, social security reform, and the conclusion of a free trade
agreement with the United States. It also assumes the adoption of any additional fiscal measures
that may be needed to achieve the authorities’ medium-term deficit target of 1 percent of GDP
by 2007. Under this scenario, growth in the medium term would benefit from the boost to
confidence associated with a markedly improved fiscal position, growth-oriented structural
reforms, and enhanced transparency and governance. With the primary balance stabilizing at
3½ percent of GDP, public debt would decline steadily to 53 percent of GDP by 2009, and
38 percent by 2014 (Figure 8 and Appendix V, Tables 1 and 2).

36.
A low-case scenario illustrates the possible consequences of a relaxation of policies
that would erode the fiscal stance over time. It is assumed that the fiscal reforms begun during
the first several months of the administration are not sustained, with incomplete implementation
of the early-2005 fiscal reforms, and no pension reform or other new structural reforms. Public

- 15 debt would rise to 70 percent of GDP by 2009, from a projected 64 percent in 2005.20 With a
deteriorating fiscal position, growth would slow down to 2½ percent, owing to an erosion of
confidence and a decline in investment activity. Nevertheless, inflation is projected to remain
low, given Panama’s full dollarization.
37.
An expansion of the Panama Canal is being studied, which could have a farreaching impact on the economy’s growth prospects. Feasibility studies encompassing
assessments of risk may be completed in the first half of 2005 and the project, if approved, might
begin in 2007 and be completed around 2014.21 An assessment of the project’s macroeconomic
impact, including on the labor market and inflation, will depend on how the magnitude and
phasing of the investment, which could total some 30–35 percent of GDP. The authorities’
strategy is that the PCA obtain an investment-grade credit rating and secure the needed financing
without government guarantees, possibly through a revenue bond. The PCA’s potential for selffinancing through retained earnings would be boosted by a proposed increase in Canal tolls on
container ships, prospectively in three stages starting May 2005 (Box 3). The implications of the
canal’s expansion for the contingent fiscal liability of the government would need to be assessed
in light of the project’s financing plans.
38.

The staff’s projections are subject to risks.

•

Under either scenario, the volatility and uncertainty regarding oil prices add to the risk
that Panama’s export markets and world trade could grow more slowly than anticipated,
causing exports to fall short of projections. Also, higher than projected oil prices for a
sustained period would adversely affect growth through the impact of lower disposable
incomes on domestic demand.

•

Unexpected instability of the U.S. dollar or abruptly higher global interest rates, through
their effect on world trade and output, could put Panama’s exports of goods and services
on a lower path than assumed in the two scenarios. Such higher international interest
rates would be reflected directly in higher domestic interest rates, hence would have a
dampening effect on other sectors as well, such as construction.

•

The active scenario is subject to downside risks as well as an upside potential. The main
downside risk arises if the administration is unable to build consensus for the needed
reform of the pension system. On the upside, output growth could move onto an even
higher path if a strong fiscal adjustment effort were to give a greater boost to confidence
and private sector investment than assumed in the scenario.

•

A deteriorating fiscal stance could erode confidence further than envisaged under the
passive scenario, with a substantial adverse effect on private investment and economic

- 16 growth that could gain momentum over time. The negative consequences for credit
ratings, private investment, and fiscal borrowing costs would tend to be mutually
reinforcing; and the prospects for expansion of the Canal could be put at risk, despite the
constitutional provision for the Canal Authority’s autonomy.
E. Other Issues
39.
The timeliness and coverage of economic statistics is generally adequate for
monitoring purposes, but some weaknesses remain. The authorities have expressed interest in
a data module ROSC to help them identify data shortcomings and recommend improvements in
macroeconomic statistics, especially with respect to national income accounts, fiscal statistics,
and labor market data.
40.
As part of their emphasis on transparency, the authorities plan to consent to publication
of the staff papers for the 2004 Article IV consultation.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Panama’s economy has experienced a strong recovery since late 2003. Growth is
likely to slow down in 2005 but still provide for a further decline in unemployment.
42.
The new administration’s emphasis on fiscal discipline, transparency, and good
governance are commendable, as these are critical for re-establishing the basis for high
sustained growth. In particular, the authorities recognize the central importance of strong fiscal
policies in a dollarized economy. The main fiscal policy challenges are to strengthen government
finances in 2005 and beyond, reform the public pension system so as to restore its long-term
viability, and settle arrears to domestic suppliers. A distinct opportunity to address these
challenges is provided by an election outcome that signaled a mandate for change and by a
vibrant economy facing a favorable external environment.
43.
The administration’s fiscal policies for 2005–07 are comprehensive and should help
put the public finances on a sustainable path, based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
targets. The targeted fiscal deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP for 2005 (excluding the PCA surplus)
represents a strong adjustment effort, balancing the need for moving toward fiscal sustainability
and avoiding an excessive negative fiscal impulse. The authorities’ fiscal targets and policies,
which by and large follow through on the staff’s and Board’s recommendations, have been
designed by the authorities to ensure that they reflect the government’s objectives, and to
provide a solid basis for the government ownership that is needed to ensure successful
implementation. The fiscal reform thus includes both tax reform and expenditure measures that
reflect equity considerations.
44.
The fiscal reform provides for additional revenues on top of a prudent budget,
offering an opportunity to exceed the authorities’ goals for 2005, while reducing the large
overhang of arrears to domestic suppliers. In this regard, the authorities appropriately intend
to eliminate payables over 90 days when feasible, which will help reinforce the government’s
fiscal transparency initiatives. In view of uncertainty concerning the impact that the fiscal
measures will have in 2006–07, strict implementation and close monitoring of these policies will

- 17 be essential to achieve the authorities’ objectives and reduce the debt burden towards
sustainability.
45.
The emphasis in the authorities’ fiscal program on expenditure restraint is
appropriate. It reflects the need to reduce overstaffing and improve the efficiency of other
current expenditure, as well as the need to attain greater efficiency of public investment through
better project evaluation. The development of a medium-term expenditure framework would be
essential to help introduce multi-year planning for infrastructure. These efforts are expected to
increase the efficiency of public expenditure and thus allow significant reduction of current
expenditure, while also making room for high-priority public investment.
46.
The proposed tax reform is welcome. The reform focuses on improving the equity of
the tax system by establishing an alternative minimum income tax, including representation
expenses in taxable income, closing loopholes in corporate income taxation, and curbing poorly
targeted fiscal incentives. Some of these measures should improve the buoyancy of the tax
system, and the elimination of low-yielding taxes and the stiffer penalties should enhance its
efficiency.
47.
The authorities should be commended for recognizing the need for social security
reform to restore long-term equilibrium to the public pension system. The pension system is
too generous relative to contribution rates, resulting in a large and growing volume of unfunded
pension obligations. While the needed comprehensive reform, with multiple parametric reforms,
would likely be implemented over a period of years, improvements in portfolio management and
the elimination of overstaffing of the social security system need to be adopted without delay.
Furthermore, the need for reform also extends to the health and maternal care program so as to
ensure adequate funding and provision of medical services.
48.
The fiscal responsibility law did not function properly, and its suspension provides
an opportunity to reformulate fiscal rules for greater effectiveness. International experience
suggests that the revision should place greater emphasis on procedural rules in conjunction with
numeric rules. Revised rules need to be well-defined, transparent, enforceable, consistent, and
supported by sound policies.
49.
The authorities’ decision to assess fiscal transparency practices through a fiscal
ROSC is welcome. The ROSC will highlight areas of current good practice and indicate areas
for improvement, including procedures for budget monitoring and reporting. In this context, the
presentation of fiscal accounts both excluding and including the accounts of the Panama Canal
Authority is appropriate. The authorities would enhance transparency by explaining to the public
the government’s view on both balances, one for fiscal analysis and one for national accounts
purposes. Transparency and governance would be further improved with a clear definition of
domestic arrears, and the accrual of interest on arrears to suppliers.
50.
As part of the government’s strategy for good governance, there is potential to make
use of the PCA as an institutional anchor. This public enterprise is becoming a model for
efforts to build strong institutions, both in government and in other public enterprises. A
prospective expansion of the canal, placing the PCA in a position to seek funds in the private
capital markets, would give greater clarity about the markets’ perception of the PCA’s

- 18 commercial soundness, hence its ability to maintain managerial independence and resist
pressures to engage in quasi-fiscal activities.
51.
The financial system is essentially sound. The expansion of regional banking heightens
the need for effective supervision, which the Superintendency of Banks is further improving
through coordinated efforts across countries in the region. Governance needs to be strengthened
in the BNP and the Savings Bank, and the business plans for these banks need to be based on
sound commercial banking practices and mechanisms to ensure that BNP credit to the
government remains short-term in nature.
52.
The authorities have rightly given priority to identifying and implementing policies
for fostering greater competitiveness and productivity of the private sector. Education
reform to meet the need for a well-trained workforce should play a significant role. The
authorities’ strong emphasis on good governance and their policy of “zero tolerance” for
corruption could reduce costs and improve competitiveness. Greater labor market flexibility also
would be beneficial, but there is little support for a general labor reform. In view of the benefits
of flexible employment practices being realized in the special economic zones, the authorities
may want to consider extending them selectively to other sectors; doing so in the export-oriented
service sector would enhance competitiveness.
53.
The prospective free trade agreement with the United States signals Panama’s
commitment to further integration with the regional and global economy. It can help attract
foreign investors with a regional strategy who seek Panama’s service infrastructure, provide
greater assurance of a stable legal framework for foreign investors, and encourage resources to
move to the more productive sectors of the Panamanian economy.
54.
There is scope for significant improvement in the quality, timeliness and coverage of
economic data. The authorities’ interest in a data ROSC is welcome, as the ROSC provides an
appropriate mechanism for assessing the strengths and taking steps to address identified
weaknesses in official economic statistics.
55.
A further area of collaboration between the staff and the authorities is in the financial
sector, for which a follow-up to the OFC Module 2 assessment is planned. The fiscal and data
module ROSCs will provide opportunities to identify future technical assistance, and the staff
stands ready to assist also in other areas that are supportive of the authorities’ economic policy
program.
56.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Panama take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. The 2005 Fiscal Reform
The fiscal reform package adopted in early February 2005 aims at reaching a sustainable fiscal position
through a reduction in the fiscal deficit, to 1 percent of GDP in 2007 or an adjustment of about
4 percentage points of GDP in three years. This adjustment would be achieved through cuts in current
outlays, especially the wage bill, while raising spending efficiency, and through increased revenues from
tax policy changes that target improved buoyancy and enhanced equity.
Main expenditure measures
•
Reduction in the replacement rate of vacancies in the civil service, by 30 percent in 2005 and
additionally 20 percent in 2006 and 10 percent in 2007. Vacancies for certain categories falling
under special regulations (leyes especiales) would not be reduced.
•

By January 2008, staff in every public institution should not exceed the personnel as of endDecember 1999. Exceptions are made for health, education and security services. The number
of contractual workers also would be limited.

•

Starting January 2006, the percentage increase in current primary expenditure should not exceed
the percentage increase in current revenue of the preceding year.

•

The use of cell phones, automobiles, and consultants would be controlled. Air travel costs
would be contained.

Main tax policy measures 1/
•
The corporate income tax rate is maintained at 30 percent in 2005 (against a scheduled lowering
to 29 percent under the 2002 tax law).
•
The maximum income tax rate for individuals is reduced from 30 percent to 27 percent.
•
Effective 2006, introduction of a minimum tax on income, amounting to 6 percent of gross
income for individuals earning at least $60,000 annually. Individuals earning solely wages are
exempt from this tax.
•
Effective 2006, limits on deductions for businesses result in a minimum income tax of
1.4 percent of sales. Loss-making businesses can appeal to the Tax Directorate for exemption
from these limits on deductions.
•
Sales of services to businesses in the Colon Free Zone are liable to income tax.
•
Increase in the annual business registration fee (Tasa Unica) from US$250 to US$300.
•
Amounts in excess of $300 won in casinos are subject to a Selective Consumption Tax of
5 percent.
•
Inclusion of representation expenses in taxable income.
•
Narrowing of the definition of tax exempt income of foreign origin.
•
Reduced property transfer tax schedule combined with an incentive to update assessed values.
•
Exemption of VAT (ITBMS) for fast-food businesses; increase in ITBMS rate on tobacco to
15 percent.
Other measures
•
Increase in fees paid by businesses in the Colon Free Zone, by an additional US$30 million
in 2005.
•
Cancellation of the 2004 Industrial Development and Incentive Act (Ley 11 de 2004).
•
Elimination of reforestation tax incentives starting in 2005.
•
Tax incentives to nontraditional exports (CATs) would be eliminated by end-2005.
•
Continued tax incentives for home improvement.
•
Heavier sanctions for noncompliance with tax laws.
•
Businesses will have to adopt international accounting and auditing standards.

Box 2. Panama: Experience with the Fiscal Responsibility Law 1/
Under the fiscal responsibility law (FRL) of May 2002, public sector net debt was targeted to
decline relative to GDP to 50 percent by 2017 (from approximately 58 percent in 2002). A
transitory regime set annual limits to the growth of debt, and the fiscal deficit was not to
exceed 2 percent of GDP in any given year.
The FRL was ineffective in preventing fiscal slippage and, on taking office in September 2004,
the new government decided to review the FRL and suspended it until end-2005.
The disappointing performance of the FRL has shown the need for improvements in several
respects:
Definitions. The FRL did not specify whether the 2 percent ceiling applied to the cash deficit
or to a deficit defined on an accrual basis. The authorities presented a deficit measure for 2003
that represented a partial adaptation of cash-based data to an accrual basis. Nevertheless the
fiscal deficit, including the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), was above the limit, both on a cash
basis (3.8 percent of GDP) and, according to available estimates, on an accrual basis (close to
3 percent of GDP).
Coverage. The FRL was not explicit about the coverage of the public sector. The deficit
ceiling was interpreted as including PCA’s large surpluses, thus lowering the monitored fiscal
deficit. The new authorities decided to exclude the PCA from the fiscal accounts for policy
monitoring purposes and from future fiscal rules.
Institutional procedures. International experience indicates that simple and transparent
numerical rules can be an effective instrument of communication of a government’s policy
objectives if accompanied by adequate institutional procedures.
Fiscal data. It will be important to improve the financial information management system
(SIAFPA) and adopt the 2001 GFS methodology for accrual-based fiscal accounting.

APPENDIX II

PANAMA—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The IDB program objectives are to promote environmentally sustainable growth and reduce poverty
and inequality. IDB projects aim to improve efficiency in social expenditure, invest in human
capital and improve access to basic services in priority areas. Given the link between growth and
poverty reduction, the IDB program supports reforms devoted to increasing competitiveness and job
creation while promoting governance and accountability. The loan portfolio focuses on
competitiveness and growth (39 percent of the portfolio) as well as social sector development (38.9
percent of the portfolio). In addition, the IDB supports the modernization of the state and capacity
building for negotiations and regional integration.
The 2005 program includes three project loans amounting to US$70 million. Their objectives are:
•

Cleaning up Panama City and the surrounding bay. This has three stages to sequentially
modernize the system to collect and channel sewage and build a plant for water treatment.

•

Capacity building to negotiate and implement free trade agreements.

•

Support of hydrological works in the Panama Canal.

APPENDIX III

Panama—Relations with the World Bank

The last Country Assistance Strategy for Panama covered FY1999–2001. This CAS was discussed
by the Board in October 1998, and was based largely on the findings of an extensive Poverty
Assessment. The CAS lending program reflected strong performance under the previous CAS and
endorsed a lending level of US$314 million. The Moscoso administration revised priorities and
relied on other financing sources, leaving a good portion of the CAS unimplemented.
The current portfolio consists of four IBRD projects under implementation totaling
US$98 million, of which about US$65 million are undisbursed. The bulk of resources available
(94 percent) support two investment operations—a Land Administration Project and a Basic
Education Project. The remaining operations finance two projects in the areas of health and public
policy reforms. Portfolio performance deteriorated under the Moscoso Government due to political
interference and growing counterpart fund shortages. The new government is seeking to realign
project priorities to its development agenda and fiscal constraints.
In terms of future program, the Bank is currently contemplating, in consultation with the new
Government, an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) to include a small, well-targeted program of Bank
activities through FY06 that could include a Public Expenditure Review and a Poverty Assessment.
Based on the Government’s interests, these activities would aim to renew the Bank’s knowledge of
and dialogue with Panama. Although future lending is not settled, given the renewed governmental
interest the Bank is tentatively willing to finalize preparation of two operations requested by the
previous Government. These two new operations are a Second Rural Poverty and Natural Resources
Project (US $38 million) and a Canal Watershed Management Project (US $11 million). However,
it was agreed that any future Bank lending to Panama should be demand-driven.

APPENDIX IV

PANAMA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic statistics are generally adequate for monitoring purposes, but there is a need for
more timely reporting. There is a need to improve coordination between the Comptroller
General’s Office, which is responsible for official economic statistics, and other government
entities, including the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Panama has participated in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2000 and its metadata
are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
1.

Real sector

The authorities completed a revision of the national accounts in 2004, based on the 1993
SNA, with a change in the base year from 1982 to 1996. The revised data are available for the
period 1996−2003. In the second half of 2004 the authorities introduced a new CPI, based on
weights of the 1997/98 household survey. This index has national coverage whereas the
previous one was limited to Panama City. The authorities also introduced two additional
regional indices, one for Panama and San Miguelito and the other for the remaining urban
areas. Time lags for the release of consumer price data are long; the latest CPI data are for
June 2004.
Technical assistance: The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean is supporting the development of a supply-use table.
2.

Government finances

a.
Current status: Data on central government finances, public enterprises, and
agencies are compiled only on a cash basis. Monthly and quarterly data for the operations of
the budgetary central government are currently available through September 2004.
b.
Pending issues: Monitoring of public sector financial developments would be
facilitated if data were provided on an accrual basis and were more timely, if the consistency
of information on intrapublic sector transfers were improved, and if the coverage of the
investment program were made complete. The authorities decided in September 2004 to
exclude the operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) from the definition of
the nonfinancial public sector used for fiscal policy purposes but agreed to also present a
more comprehensive measure including the PCA as part of the public sector. However, for
its inclusion in the comprehensive fiscal accounts, there is a need to ensure a consistent and
timely flow of PCA statistics on a calendar year basis. In addition to broadening the
integrated financial administration system’s (SIAFPA) scope of coverage, there is a need to
address the issue of unrecorded expenditures, which have resulted in persistent and
significant discrepancies in the measurement of fiscal performance from above and below the
line. In this regard, the authorities have received technical assistance from STA directed
toward the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001).

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

c.
Technical assistance: A STA mission in February 2004 undertook a comprehensive
review of the coverage and methodology currently in use in the fiscal accounts. The mission
made several recommendations, and prepared a tentative timetable for a migration to the
GFSM 2001.
3.

Monetary accounts

Provision of monthly data by the monetary authorities has been regular and reasonably
current. Monthly data on the operations of the private commercial and savings banks are
prepared by the Superintendency of Banks and reported to STA with a lag of one to two
months. The state-owned development banks, the Agricultural Development Bank, and the
Mortgage Bank are not regulated by the Superintendency of Banks and no data on these
banks are reported to the Fund. There is a lack of consistent data prepared on the financial
positions of the National Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank.
4.

Balance of payments

Despite substantial progress in compilation procedures, data are subject to sizeable revisions
each quarter. Revised estimates of merchandise imports, transportation services and foreign
direct investment data often result in substantial revisions of the current and financial
accounts of the balance of payments. These revisions may reflect improvements in coverage,
but they also suggest that there is room for improvement in quality control procedures. There
is a need to improve the quality of the Colon Free Zone statistics. The authorities are
currently working on a full reconciliation between data of the banking sector and balance of
payments capital flows consistent with the compilation method introduced by the
Superintendency of Banks in 2002. Data are not yet available on nonfinancial private sector
debt or on transactions involving financial derivatives. International Investment Position data
for 1995−2003 have been compiled. The most recent data on balance of payments statistics
pertain to September 2004.

APPENDIX V

PANAMA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Under an active scenario broadly consistent with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
targets, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be on a firmly declining path. Under this scenario,
implementation of the February 2005 fiscal reform, followed by a reform of social security and
other supportive fiscal measures that may be needed in the outer years to achieve the
authorities’ fiscal targets, would result in a primary surplus of about 3½ percent of GDP
by 2008–09. Structural reforms would enhance investor confidence and help boost real GDP
growth to 4 percent a year, and public debt would decline to 53 percent of GDP by 2009
(Table 4). If the scenario were extended to a longer period, with the primary surplus maintained
at 3½ percent of GDP, the debt ratio would decline to 38 percent by 2014.
Under a low-case scenario that assumes fiscal slippage from the authorities’ fiscal
program, public sector debt would be on an unsustainable path, rising steadily relative to
GDP starting in 2007. The staff’s “low-case” scenario assumes no pension reform nor the
implementation of the government’s competitiveness strategy, and it assumes that an easing of
the fiscal stance offsets the positive fiscal impact of the authorities’ fiscal measures in 2006–08.
The primary surplus, projected at about 1.2 percent of GDP in 2006 (excluding the Panama
Canal Authority), would start declining in 2007. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to
70 percent by 2009, from 64 percent in 2005, entailing large gross financing needs, growing
interest payments, and a sustained rise in public debt relative to fiscal revenue.
Potential temporary shocks under the active scenario would be manageable, delaying by two or
three years the downturn in the debt ratio (Tables 4 and 6). The most important vulnerability,
however, arises from the possibility of sustained fiscal slippage, as presented in the low-case
scenario; adding growth or interest rate shocks to this scenario would accelerate the rise in
public debt ratios (Tables 5 and 7).
In a fully dollarized economy, the sustainability of debt is a fiscal issue and not a potential
balance of payments problem. However, external debt would be vulnerable to a simultaneous
shock from several key parameters, the more so in the low-case scenario in which the
authorities only partially implement their fiscal program (Tables 6 and 7).

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 23, 2005
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
issued on March 9, 2005. The information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Real GDP grew 6.2 percent in 2004, according to preliminary data, slightly above the
staff estimate presented in the staff report (6 percent).
2.
Consumer price inflation during 2004 was 1.5 percent, compared with the staff
estimate of 2 percent.
3.
The unemployment rate for 2004 (based on household survey data for August) was
11.8 percent, down from 13.5 percent in 2002.
4.
The deficit of the nonfinancial public sector in 2004 was in line with the staff report
estimate (5 percent of GDP, excluding the Panama Canal Authority). Expenditure on a cash
basis was about 0.4 percentage point of GDP higher than estimated, reflecting substantial
progress in reducing the outstanding stock of payables near the end of 2004. Revenue
exceeded the staff’s estimate also by 0.4 percentage point of GDP, owing to increased
transfers from the Canal Authority to the central government of canal fees and dividends.
The nonfinancial public sector deficit, including the Canal Authority, was 4 percent of GDP.
5.
Staff is reviewing the coherence of preliminary data on the 2004 balance of payments,
which suggests that the current account may have substantially exceeded the level estimated
in the staff report. In particular, according to the preliminary data, the Colon Free Zone,
which provides transshipment services, registered a large drop in net exports in 2004, despite
a rapid growth of income.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Panama
On March 23, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Panama.1
Background
For the second consecutive year, real GDP growth was strong. In 2004, real GDP grew about
6 percent led by a boom in construction (stimulated by temporary tax incentives) and by
export-oriented services (in particular the Colon Free Zone and ports). Unemployment
declined modestly in 2004, despite high real GDP growth. Though 2004 was a year of high oil
prices, inflation remains low as has been traditional in Panama.
The nonfinancial public sector deficit (excluding the Panama Canal Authority) increased
slightly, to 5 percent of GDP in 2004 from 4.7 percent in 2003. The new administration took
revenue and expenditure measures starting in September 2004 to contain the deficit. Aspects
of fiscal accounting methods were also reviewed to improve fiscal transparency.
The banking system experienced a second year of recovery, after the financial markets turmoil
in financial markets in South America during 2002. Domestic deposits rose by 9 percent and
nonresident deposits remained stable in 2004. Domestic credit to the private sector grew
Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country’s authorities.

-29 percent in 2004 because of rapid growth of credit in commerce and mortgages fuelled by the
economic expansion.
The financial system remains sound. Nonperforming loans ratios averaged 2 percent and
capital adequacy ratios were 19 percent at end-September 2004. Liquidity remains ample
despite pressures on the liquidity of the National Bank of Panama resulting from increased
credit to the government and a reduction in deposits from the social security fund.
Panama remains focused on concluding free trade agreements. After reaching agreements
with Taiwan and El Salvador, Panama is now pursuing negotiations with the United States,
Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. Negotiations with the United States are at an advanced stage.
In 2005, GDP growth is likely to slow down. Construction sector activity will decelerate, though
the level of activity will remain high because tax incentives were extended until end-2005.
The ontribution to growth from the external sector, though positive, is likely to be smaller than
in 2004 as a result of a less favorable, though still positive, external environment.
The administration is committed to reducing the nonfinancial public sector deficit in 2005.
Inflation is expected to remain low.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Panama’s strong economic growth performance, which has
helped lower unemployment in a setting of continued low inflation. Noting the progress made
in reducing extreme poverty, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with the
development of a well-targeted program for rural poverty reduction and the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals. Directors commended the authorities’ emphasis on fiscal
discipline and transparency in their economic program, and concurred that fiscal deficit
reduction and the related improvement in public debt dynamics are key for sustaining
economic growth and lowering poverty. They noted that, in moving forward, the main
challenges are to strengthen government finances and to restore the long-term viability of the
public pension system, while fostering medium-term growth prospects by enhancing the
competitiveness of the private sector.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to strengthening the fiscal position, as
reflected in the budget for 2005 and in the recently adopted fiscal reform. They supported
envisaged reductions in current expenditure and the recently adopted reforms to the tax
system, which could underpin a stronger-than-targeted fiscal performance in 2005. In this
regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to make use of stronger-than-budgeted revenues
to further reduce unpaid bills to domestic suppliers.
Directors welcomed the emphasis of the fiscal reform on equity considerations, and the focus
of the tax reform on increasing the buoyancy of tax collections and enhancing its efficiency.
They concurred that the focus of the authorities’ fiscal program on expenditure restraint
appropriately targets overstaffing and improved efficiency in other spending areas, including
public investment.

-3-

Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to launch an information campaign on the reform
of social security. They noted that, given the fundamental imbalance between pension
contributions and benefits, substantial efforts will be necessary to restore long-term equilibrium
to the public pension system. Directors agreed with the importance of the authorities’ actions
to improve portfolio management and eliminate inefficiencies of the social security system.
Directors, observing that the fiscal responsibility law had not functioned well, recommended
that revisions incorporate procedural as well as numeric rules, and emphasized that the
revised rules be well-defined, transparent, and supported by sound policies. In this context,
Directors agreed that the presentation of fiscal accounts both excluding and including the
accounts of the Panama Canal Authority is appropriate, and they welcomed the authorities’
decision to assess fiscal transparency practices through a fiscal ROSC.
Directors commended the soundness of Panama’s financial system. They observed that the
expansion of regional banking heightens the need for effective supervision, and supported the
efforts of the Superintendency of Banks to enhance coordination across countries in the
region. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen governance in the National Bank of
Panama and the Savings Bank. The business plans for these banks should be based on
sound commercial banking practices and include mechanisms to ensure that the National
Bank’s credit to the government remains short-term in nature.
Directors noted the importance of strengthening the competitiveness of the export-oriented
service sector for Panama’s medium-term outlook. They welcomed Panama’s commitment to
further integration with the regional and global economy and observed that the prospective
free trade agreement with the United States could help attract foreign direct investment by
providing greater assurance of a stable legal framework, and stimulate resources to move to
the more productive sectors of the Panamanian economy. Directors supported the authorities’
strategy for fostering greater competitiveness and productivity by strengthening the business
climate, streamlining business procedures, and enhancing the quality of human capital through
sustained investment in education. They encouraged the authorities to enhance labor market
flexibility by extending flexible employment practices from the special economic zones to other
sectors.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on good governance and supported their efforts
to fight corruption. They encouraged the authorities to adopt an integrated approach to
addressing governance problems, including in the civil service and in government
procurement. Directors noted that the Panama Canal Authority could potentially provide an
anchor for institution building, and noted that a prospective expansion of the canal, if approved
in a referendum and well-managed, could yield important benefits for the Panamanian
economy. In view of the project’s prospectively large financing costs, Directors supported the
authorities’ aim of minimizing fiscal risks, in particular by ensuring that the Canal Authority is
run on a commercial basis.

-4Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality, timeliness and coverage of
economic data. They welcomed the authorities’ interest in a data ROSC, which would assess
strengths and identify weaknesses in economic statistics, and supported the authorities’
intention to request a follow-up to the Offshore Financial Center assessment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF’s efforts to promote transparency of the IMF’s
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Murilo Portugal, Executive Director for Panama
and Alfredo N. Maciá, Advisor to Executive Director
March 23, 2005
1.
Our Panamanian authorities are grateful to the staff for the open policy dialogue with
the Fund and for the support to their efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability by
strengthening fiscal prudence, moving forward with crucial reforms, and enhancing the
investment environment.
2.
Economic growth rebounded at over 6 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2004, a
trend that has been largely maintained throughout the year, with real GDP growth reaching
6.2 percent by end-year, compared to 4.1 percent in 2003. This robust economic performance
has been broad based resulting from strong construction activity, agricultural exports,
tourism and entertainment, the Panama Canal operations, and the Free Zone. Inflation
remained subdued despite pressures of higher transport and oil costs, with end-of-year
inflation projected at 1.5 percent compared to 1.7 percent at end-2003. According to the 2004
Household Survey, the unemployment rate decreased to 11.8 percent at end-2004, compared
to 13.1 percent at end-2003. Prospects for 2005 are favorable, with GDP growth expected to
remain well above the last decade’s average.
3.
Panama’s external competitiveness is favorable. The real effective exchange rate has
declined with the depreciation of the US dollar; the country has increased its export volumes
and expanded its market share in a number of services. While the external current account
deficit at end-2004 reached 8 percent of GDP compared to a 4 percent deficit at end-2003, it
was almost totally covered by foreign direct investments that reached 7.3 percent of GDP.
Exports grew at a faster rate than imports, and the revenues of the Panama Canal Authority
(ACP) increased 15.8 percent in FY2004, breaking the one billion dollar level.
Fiscal Policy
4.
As it took office on September 1, 2004, the new administration encountered a
deteriorated fiscal stance, with the non-financial public sector deficit reaching 5.0 percent of
GDP at end-2004. The authorities adopted immediate action to start reversing the fiscal
situation, including the non-renewal of personnel contracts, and an immediate expenditure
restraint of US$225.8 million. They also developed a plan to gradually reduce unpaid arrears
with suppliers.
5.
The 2005 budget envisages a fiscal deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP, with stiff controls
on current public expenditures. The authorities expressed their commitment to protect outlays
for key social sectors and to improve the targeting of subsidies for electricity, water, cooking
gas, and preferential interest rates for low-income housing. On investments, the authorities
will provide for the continuation of priority infrastructure projects related to water
distribution, electricity, and irrigation. The authorities are also going to propose new norms
to be included into the Fiscal Responsibility Law to enhance fiscal transparency, provide for
clear enforcement of fiscal policy, and promote healthier public finances. The staff

-2considered the authorities’ fiscal policies and targets appropriate and in line with the Fund’s
recommendations.
6.
The public debt level increased to US$9.98 billion at end-December 2004. The
authorities have already started to take structural measures to tackle the deteriorated fiscal
stance and growing public debt. As mentioned below, a fiscal reform yielding a 1 percent of
GDP has been approved, and a social security reform package is under discussion, in addition
to the tighter government expenditure controls that have been put in place.
Financial Sector
7.
Panama’s banking system has remained strong with assets at US$33.2 billion, a 4.5
percent increase compared to 2003, ample liquidity, and high capital levels. The liquid assets
to deposit ratio was 42 percent last September. The capital adequacy ratio stood at 18.6
percent, compared to a regulatory required CAR of 8 percent. The return on capital for the
banking system was 16.2 percent and the return on assets, at 2.3 percent, was slightly higher
than in 2003. Non-performing loans declined to 1.8 percent from 2.7 percent in 2003.
Domestic credit has grown steadily, with both foreign private banks and public banks
accounting for most of the growth.
8.
The SoB has enhanced its consolidated and cross-border supervision of the banking
system and is taking steps to move forward on the main issues regarding the Basel II risk
requirements so that they are in place by 2008. Banking system surveys are now in progress
to evaluate future capital requirements, risk supervision, and the legal framework for
adopting the Basel II rules. An MFD mission is to travel to Panama shortly to complete a
Model 2 OFC review. The mission will look into the AML/FT, the insurance sector
legislation, and the domestic stock market framework vis-à-vis international standards.
Structural Reforms
9.
The Torrijos administration announced on January 12, 2005 an overall fiscal reform
package. By February 2, the legislature approved Law no. 6 (explained in Box 1), an
equitable fiscal law that calls for fiscal discipline by the government and increased revenues
to be paid by the private sector. Public payroll is to be scaled down by early 2008 to a range
of about 165-170 thousand from the existing over 180 thousand taking into account
exceptions in health, education and security services. The fiscal law also imposes ceilings on
current expenditures, professional service contracts and, amongst other measures, reduces by
60 percent the number of vacancies within the next three years. The new law increases
operating fees, eliminates the industrial incentive law of 2004, and the exports incentives
certificates (CAT’s), which will expire at end-2005. It also limits tax breaks on donations,
while taxing a share of Panamanians’ foreign income. It widens the income tax base
including in it representation expenses, and envisages an anticipated withholding tax of 10
percent. Implementation of the representation expenses measure took place last February; the
Free Zone new operating fees will take effect in June of 2005; and other tax measures in
January 2006. The revenues to GDP ratio are expected to increase to 15.4 percent from the

-3present 14.6 percent level. Strong fiscal discipline and the prospect of a social security (SS)
reform may bring the investment grade up on Panama’s sovereign rating.
10.
Consultations aimed at a social security reform started in mid-2001 under the UNDP
sponsorship and were previously discussed during the 2003 Article IV consultation. Our
authorities are cognizant of the urgency to push forward an overall reform despite the
political cost. The reforms may entail changes in contributions, retirement age, services
coverage, and in the replacement payments, amongst other issues, in order to ensure the longterm fiscal sustainability of the system. In mid-February, an information campaign about the
precarious fiscal situation of the SS system was launched to increase awareness of the
population. The reform package, which retains full ownership by the authorities, will reach
the legislature as soon as the consultation process is concluded with the civil society and
stakeholders.
11.
Other important structural reforms aimed at improving Panama’s competitive
strategy, which already are in their initial stages, include judicial reform, deregulation,
governmental restructuring, attracting foreign investments, and promoting exports.
12.
Free trade agreements are at the top of the 2005 agenda. Panama is presently
negotiating trade agreements with Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Singapore, and the United
States. In addition, Panama wants access to other markets and has interest in joining the G-3
Group integrated by Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. Furthermore, the country has joined
Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Nicaragua on efforts to curb the
EU proposed “tariff only” for banana imports to be in effect in January 2006. EU has
proposed a US$300 dollar tariff per ton --from the present US$75 per ton-- when the 2.6
million-ton quota system expires. Panama exports 80 percent of its production to the EU and
has to compete with the duty-free banana from the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific group
(ACP).
13.
The negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States (US), which started
in April 2004 and has gone through eight rounds of talks, will broaden the attraction of US
investments into Panama and strengthen the country’s growth potential in the medium term.
The areas remaining for a ninth and conclusive round of negotiations are agricultural
products, access to the Panama Canal procurements, and textiles among others, while most
non-agricultural issues have now been settled.
Investment Activity
14.
The reverted areas of the Panama Canal keep on attracting large foreign and local
investments. The second bridge over the Panama Canal accounting for a US$200 million
public investment effort is now in the final conclusion of its access routes. In addition, ACP
implemented an investment and maintenance program of nearly US$170 million in 2004.
Private investments surged at over US$300 million primarily in the maritime sector, tourism,
commercial services and infrastructure. On port facilities, the Panama Ports Company (PPCHutchison Wampoa) concluded in 2004 a port expansion at a cost of over US$200 million

-4that will allow it to service Panamax ships. In addition, the Evergreen and Manzanillo
International Terminal (MIT) has upgraded its ports facilities.
15.
Other investments outside the Panama Canal reverted areas include a new shopping
mall and hotel in Panama City costing US$100 million that are now in service, and the
expansion of Tocumen international airport, which began at end-2004. The hydroelectric
plant Bayano increased its capacity by 20 percent after a US$40 million investment. In
addition, La Fortuna hydroelectric is starting a US$ $225 million expansion program to
increase its capacity to 150 megawatts. At end-2004, total electricity production stood at
slightly over 5,000 megawatts, with 58 percent produced by hydroelectric plants.
16.
In addition to these investments, several mega investment projects are also being
considered, which will substantially increase the growth potential of the economy. The most
important of these projects is the construction of new sets of locks in the Panama Canal, an
approximate investment of over US$4.5 billion. In 2004, the Canal serviced 14,035 shipcrossings, a 6.7 percent increase compared to 2003, with a large portion accounted for by
super ships, including Panamax ships. At the present rate of growth in cargo and shipcrossings, the capacity of the canal may be reached by 2012. A referendum is expected to
take place late this year to authorize the expansion of the canal, which has an estimated
construction time of eight years. Today, the main users of the canal are the U.S., China,
Japan, Taiwan, and Chile. The expansion of the Canal will broaden Panama’s participation in
the regional and global trade through the use of its waterway.
17.
In November 2004, President Torrijos signed with President Uribe a Memorandum of
Understanding to pursue the construction of a gas pipeline and build an electricity interconnection between Panama and Colombia. Venezuela is also pursuing an agreement with
Panama to interconnect a gas pipeline to the Colombia-Panama project given market
demands from China and the U.S. West Coast. The gas pipeline project has an estimated cost
of US$200 million and could be in operation in 24 months. The Colombian electricity 300
megawatts interconnection has two alternate routes of 571 km and 514 km costing US$169

21.
The challenges of the new administration center around needed reforms to enhance
the country’s economic growth potential, improve government finances, and strengthen
transparency and accountability. There is a strong commitment by the authorities for the
zero-tolerance policy on the fight against corruption. An Anti-Corruption Council was
established, and audits of specific government institutions are underway to investigate
corruption allegations. These are clear steps taken by the Torrijos administration to support
its anti-corruption policy. In addition, the new administration has sent the UN Convention
Against Corruption to the Legislature for approval. Our authorities are aware of the need to
further enhance the private sector environment and pursue policies to strengthen foreign
investments. The President has announced the reactivation of the “Compete Panama”
program, in partnership with the IDB, to reduce the red tape to the establishment of new
businesses, thereby enhancing business creation, investments, and employment generation.
Our authorities would like to state their strong determination to improving social conditions
for the poor and the most vulnerable groups, supported by the strong political mandate of the
May 2004 elections.
