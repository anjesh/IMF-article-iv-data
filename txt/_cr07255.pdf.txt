REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Scott Brown
July 10, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Overheating is Estonia’s main near-term challenge. Surging domestic demand
has widened the external current account deficit and pushed the economy against capacity
constraints. Wage increases have begun to erode competitiveness and kept inflation above the
Maastricht threshold for euro adoption. There are signs of an incipient slowdown but a
resurgence of demand and an eventual hard landing, with growth stagnating, cannot be ruled
out. A strong fiscal stance is therefore needed to subdue wage and income expectations,
improve the odds of a soft landing, and reassure markets about the continued commitment to
euro adoption. It would also position the budget for future age-related costs. Other concerns are
banking sector risk stemming from years of rapid credit growth and a less benign external
environment in the face of increased regional uncertainties.
Authorities’ views and policies: The authorities are concerned about overheating and have
responded by moving from a fiscal framework based on balanced budgets to one based on
small surpluses. They have also reaffirmed their commitment to euro adoption and taken steps
to increase the odds of meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion by 2010, the earliest they
consider feasible. On the financial sector, the authorities emphasize that market discipline has
started to slow the pace of credit growth. They view the existing prudential requirements as
adequate and are focusing their efforts on strengthening cross-border cooperation in bank
supervision and crisis management. The authorities view external competitiveness as broadly
adequate and remain strongly committed to the currency board arrangement (CBA), in place
since 1992.
Staff views: A more assertive fiscal stance is needed. For 2007 this means saving any revenue
overperformance and resisting spending pressures. For the next four years it means going
beyond the modest surplus floors in the fiscal strategy. The strategy on euro adoption is
appropriate. The authorities’ initiatives to raise public awareness of macroeconomic risks
appear to have borne fruit and should be continued. In the meantime, while banks’ risk buffers
seem reasonably wide, their adequacy should be reviewed regularly by active use of stress
testing and sustained monitoring of credit standards, internal controls, and risk assessment
procedures. Cross-border cooperation in bank supervision is indispensable; the recent
initiatives in this area are welcome. The CBA is robust. While some indicators point to real
exchange rate overvaluation, exports remain competitive. Nevertheless, rising cost pressures
underscore the need for labor and product market flexibility to ease external adjustment and
sustain growth.

and regional political tensions in AprilMay have added to the uncertainties. And
the safe haven of euro adoption now looks several years away. The consultation largely
focused on the authorities’ policy options under the current, more demanding, circumstances.
Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Estonia has had an excellent working relationship with the IMF since becoming a member in
May 1992. The authorities’ policy decisions have generally been consistent with Board
recommendations in the Article IV context. Policy implementation has been characterized by a
high degree of ownership, which has proven to be key to Estonia’s economic success. In recent
years, Estonia’s budgets have been less contractionary than advised by the Fund, though in
practice fiscal outcomes have turned out to be better than budgeted.

II. BACKGROUND
2.
Demand surged in 2006 but there are signs of an incipient slowdown. Rising
incomes, the favorable investment climate, and low-interest financing fueled an investment
and consumption boom which raised real domestic demand by 15 percent in 2006—more
than twice the 2005 increase. Real GDP growth rose to 11.4 percent, well above staff’s
estimate of potential growth; the external current account deficit widened to nearly
15 percent of GDP; and resources shifted from traded to non-traded sectors (Figure 1). But
demand now appears to be moderating: domestic demand growth decelerated in the last
quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, owing mainly to slowing investment. And
housing prices, which took off at the end of 2005, have now stabilized relative to family

Inflation has accelerated into the 5–6 percent range, well above the Maastricht
threshold for euro adoption (currently about 3 percent). A rising contribution of
nontradables prices is evidence that overheating pressures are being added to the underlying
convergence-related price dynamic. The increasing role of core inflation suggests that it will
be difficult to meet the Maastricht criterion within the next few years.

overtook productivity growth in mid-2005, pushing up
real unit labor costs (ULC) and thus reducing the share of profits in value added. The
national income accounts-based measure of real ULC, which displayed a more benign trend
through mid-2006, has now also started to rise.

5.
More generally, indicators of external competitiveness are mixed (Box 2).
Increasing penetration of world markets since 2000 (notwithstanding a modest retreat in
2006) and continued strong profitability are “bottom line” evidence that exports remain
competitive. On the other hand, indices calculated by staff using approaches akin to the
CGER’s as well as other approaches suggest a real exchange rate overvaluation in the order
of 10 percent—the mid-point of a wide range. However, as recognized in a recent Board
paper, econometric estimates such as these are subject to uncertainties which “may be
particularly severe for countries undergoing rapid structural change and for those for which
sample length is relatively short”—both of which apply in Estonia.1
6.
Estonia’s regional integration has meant that the capital account has become a
two-way street. Gross FDI inflows—largely reinvested profits—continued to rise relative to
GDP, but net FDI fell as residents invested abroad and now covers less than a quarter of the
current account deficit (Figure 3). The decline in net FDI flows was offset by increased bank
financing, intermediated by local affiliates of Nordic banks. Gross external debt, nearly all
private, was 96 percent of GDP at end-2006 while net debt was 27 percent of GDP.

Box 2. Estonia: Competitiveness
Strong export growth has boosted Estonia’s market share by 40 percent since 2000, even after
some reversal in 2006. Constant market shares analysis confirms the importance of Estoniaspecific factors behind this strong export growth. In contrast, indices calculated by staff, including
measures related to the CGER macro balances and external sustainability approaches, show real
exchange rate overvaluation in 2006 (see next page of this box). This is consistent with the
observation that the share of labor compensation in GDP seems greater than warranted by labor
productivity. However, the indices referred to above presume that parameters are stable—an
assumption that may not be warranted in a fast-converging economy undergoing substantial
structural changes.

of the new credit was to non-financial
corporations; the rest was to households and
of this four-fifths was mortgages. Threequarters of bank lending was eurodenominated. Domestic deposits fund
roughly half of bank lending but resources
from Nordic parent banks are gaining
importance. Intense competition for market
share has driven bank lending rates very low;
indeed real lending rates were negative until
recently (Figure 1).

Banking sector indicators are
strong. Banks are well capitalized, although liquidity ratios have declined in recent years.
Profitability is high compared with banks in the EU. Non-performing loans (NPLs) more
than 90 days overdue are negligible although there has been some increase in arrears in the 160 day range, and NPLs are lagging indicators in a period of rapid credit growth. Ultimately,
since Estonian banks are affiliates of larger institutions that manage risk on a consolidated
basis, their soundness depends on parent institutions’ readiness to supply liquidity or capital
if necessary. Parent banks’ incentive to stand behind their Estonian affiliates is likely
strengthened by the affiliates’ good track records and by the parents’ interest in protecting
their brand names in an integrated regional market. The cyber-attacks on Estonian internet
servers earlier this year temporarily disrupted access to major banks’ websites, but did not
compromise the integrity of the financial system.

Estonia’s track record of sound macroeconomic and prudential policies helped it
brush off contagion effects of exchange rate pressures in Latvia earlier this year. While
macroeconomic developments show similarities among the Baltic countries—booming
domestic demand, rising inflation, widening external current account deficits, and
burgeoning credit—Estonia is distinguished by its stronger fiscal position and its more
dynamic and diversified economy (Figure 4). Eesti Pank’s timely response in 2005-06 to
early signs of overheating (increasing public awareness of risks, raising the risk weight on
mortgages and reserve requirements on deposits) also helped to maintain confidence. Credit
ratings agencies—most recently S&P—have maintained Estonia’s investment grade and
“stable” outlook, citing the competitive economy, the CBA, favorable prospects for euro
adoption, and the tough fiscal policy stance. Money market spreads did increase slightly in
April but remain relatively small. In the equity market, the global correction in FebruaryMarch 2007 reversed the previous six months’ gains in the Tallinn index, which has since,
however, regained some of the lost ground.

Estonia’s long-standing commitment to fiscal prudence—budget surpluses are
the norm and government debt is negligible—was reinforced in 2006 by a large fiscal
surplus. This solid performance was partly driven by a strong increase in non-tax revenue
which more than offset the impact of a long-planned cut in the income tax rate. The revenue
increase was partly a one-off: the authorities’ achievement was to resist spending it.

III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES
11.
Discussions focused on increasing the likelihood of a soft landing and containing
risks in the now less-forgiving economic environment. The mission also discussed the
challenges of population aging and sustaining productivity growth.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
12.
Forward-looking indicators suggest that the recent moderation of demand may
continue. While consumption still has momentum, driven by large private sector bonuses
and public sector wage increases and by the prospect of income tax cuts and pension
increases, it is likely to lose steam. The housing market has already cooled—apartments for
sale are sitting longer on the market—and appears unlikely to reignite soon as prices are
already unaffordable for many households and euro area interest rates are rising. The flow of

credit has slowed and the major banks
affirmed that they are tightening lending
conditions across the board. More broadly,
market sentiment has shifted in apparent
recognition that the pace of income growth
is not sustainable in the face of capacity
constraints.
13.
Against this background, the
mission and the authorities had both
prepared baseline scenarios in which
demand slows in 2007, and the economy
returns to a medium-term convergence
path consistent with external stability. In
staff’s projection, GDP growth declines to

about 9 percent in 2007—still above potential—as supply constraints bind. Consumption and
investment growth slow in the face of capacity constraints, declining profitability, and a
rising debt burden, although domestic demand is still strong enough to drive inflation up to
5½ percent and edge the current account deficit above 15 percent of GDP for the year. In the
outer years, income growth declines further as profitability is squeezed, leading to slower
wage growth. The demand slowdown drives GDP growth toward its potential rate and
reduces the current account deficit. External debt sustainability analysis suggests that under
the baseline scenario, a current account adjustment of some 6 percentage points of GDP
would stabilize the debt ratio and the net external asset position by the end of the projection
period (Table 3 and Figure 5). An adjustment of this magnitude should not cause major
economic strain so long as the flexibility and growth of the economy are sustained.

The authorities and staff agreed that this soft landing was not a sure thing. The
main risk is that the slowing of demand may not be sustained. A prolonged boom would fuel
inflation, boost production costs—particularly wages—and erode competitiveness. At the
same time household debt and real estate exposures would rise, amplifying balance-sheet
vulnerabilities. The pricing-in of risk premia would then cause a rise in interest rates and
possibly a real estate market correction. Weakened competitiveness would slow growth,
producing second-round effects on investment and possibly a credit crunch as banks
retrenched in response to deteriorating balance sheets. A period of stagnation and possible
financial sector strains could ensue if the wage and price adjustments needed to restore
competitiveness were slow to materialize. The authorities’ alternative scenario was similar
though slightly less severe.

B. Fiscal Policy
15.
With the macroeconomic outlook uncertain, the authorities agreed that the fiscal
stance should be kept tight to help steer the economy toward a soft landing. For 2007,
the government had for the first time presented parliament with a surplus budget, setting an
important precedent and sending a helpful signal of fiscal restraint. But staff pointed out that
this budget contained a substantial increase in current expenditure (12 percent in real terms),
including large public sector wage increases. Moreover, the projected surplus, while larger
than budgeted, was significantly smaller than last year’s outcome, implying an undesirable
fiscal stimulus. Given that it would be difficult at this late date to produce the negative fiscal

impulse suggested by a widening output gap, staff advised the authorities not to introduce
new expenditures in the supplementary budget but instead to save any revenue
overperformance. The authorities responded that the public sector wage increases were
needed to attract and retain high-quality staff and emphasized that real increases would not
exceed productivity gains in the private sector. Regarding the supplementary budget, the
government planned not to allow for increased spending. However, the government decided
to increase public pensions in mid-2007 in line with expected strong social tax revenues.
16.
The authorities agreed with staff that fiscal surpluses should be sustained in the
2008–11 budget strategy, but differed on the magnitude. Staff made a case for surpluses
of 2–3 percent of GDP on average. First, with output projected to be above capacity through
2010, a strong fiscal program was needed to contain demand pressures both directly and by
dampening household expectations. Second, substantial surpluses would signal continued
fiscal responsibility, reinforcing the investment climate and supporting the CBA. And third,
they would help position the budget for the costs associated with population aging.2 The
authorities considered it politically unfeasible to target such large surpluses, but announced a
target of at least 1½ percent of GDP. This was subsequently reduced to ½ percent—
characterized as a floor—in the medium-term strategy document approved by the cabinet at
end-May.

Age-related expenditures and policy options are discussed in an accompanying Selected Issues paper.

18
17.
Staff raised concerns about the medium-term budgetary implications of changes
in taxation and pension entitlements currently under consideration. The government has
announced that income tax rates will be cut by a further 2 percentage points and the income
tax threshold will be raised by 50 percent by 2011, and it has broached plans to raise (first
pillar) public pension benefits significantly over the next four years. Also, a revamp of the
corporate income tax, required by 2009 to conform with the EU’s parent-subsidiary directive,
is likely to be revenue-reducing. Staff argued that care should be taken to ensure that the
medium-term budget targets are not compromised. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline, noting that offsetting measures will be
implemented if necessary to respect their surplus targets.
18.
The authorities outlined their progress in strengthening the medium-term
budgetary framework (MTBF). They have aligned it with the political cycle (2008–11),
pinned down the surplus target, and plan to use it as a basis for the annual budget process
starting with the 2008 budget. Staff advised them to plan expenditure on the basis of
conservative growth assumptions and to adhere to the implied expenditure ceilings
irrespective of revenue developments. Staff also suggested that the MTBF include an
economic classification of expenditure priorities to enhance transparency. The authorities
have requested a fiscal transparency ROSC, which is likely to take place this fall.
C. Euro Adoption
19.
With euro adoption several years away, the mission stressed the need to signal
continued commitment to this goal. Estonia meets all but one of the Maastricht criteria by
comfortable margins; the sole obstacle is inflation, which, on current projections, would not
fall below the Maastricht threshold before 2010 (Box 3). While the authorities do not possess
effective macroeconomic instruments to reduce inflation, they recognized the importance of
sending a clear signal of commitment to euro adoption. They thus decided to advance
planned increases in several excise taxes to early 2008, ensuring that the impact on inflation
will have faded by the time inflation comes within reach of the Maastricht criterion. This
strong signal was supported by statements reaffirming that euro entry was a government
priority and identifying 2011 as a possible date.
D. Financial Sector Risks
20.
The authorities viewed currency risk as negligible in Estonia given their
unwavering commitment to the CBA. They recognized that the wide external imbalance,
the delay in euro adoption, and earlier exchange rate pressures in Latvia had given rise to a
market perception of increased risk, but they did not share that perception. If market
pressures were to develop, the automatic adjustment mechanism of a CBA would come into
play via a contraction of kroon liquidity and possibly large market-driven interest rate
increases. The CBA was further anchored by the prospective exit to the euro and the
structure of the financial system in Estonia—practically no government debt, rudimentary

19
Box 3. Estonia: Inflation Projections
Staff’s projections, assuming current policies, have Estonia not meeting the Maastricht inflation
criterion before 2010. Demand pressures will continue to push up core inflation in 2007 and
excise tax increases will provide a further boost in 2008; inflation should start to come down in
2009 as the impact of these factors subsides.

1/ The dotted lines define one-standard-deviation confidence bands
around this series' projection, w here the standard deviation w as
calculated from actual data for the period January 2000-December
2006.

The projections are made using a disaggregated approach that takes into account the
macroeconomic environment. Core inflation (67 percent of the HICP basket) reflects domestic
demand pressures. Administered prices (18 percent) evolve in line with announced government
plans. Non-administered energy prices (6 percent) and unprocessed food prices (9 percent) are
in line with the WEO petroleum and food price projections.

asset markets, and a banking sector composed of affiliates of larger Nordic banks. The
mission agreed that these conditions made disruptive exchange rate movements highly
unlikely.
21.
Instead, the authorities were concerned about balance-sheet risks accumulated
over several years of rapid credit growth. They noted that the brisk competition for market
share and the relative immaturity of the market—which has not seen a downturn since the
bank privatizations earlier this decade—may have led to insufficient attention to borrowers’
debt servicing capacity in the event of a housing market correction or a recession. While
Eesti Pank did not have effective instruments to slow credit growth, it had required larger
buffers by increasing reserve requirements and the risk weight on mortgages.

20
22.
The recent slowdown in credit growth suggested that market discipline had now
taken hold. Eesti Pank’s campaign to increase the awareness of risk through public
statements and policy signals, combined with increased financial market concern about
Baltic risks, had contributed to a shift in behavior: parent banks—subject to market
discipline by ratings agencies and shareholders—had called for tighter credit conditions and
a scale-back of lending targets by as much as fifty percent. Against this background, the
authorities considered that risk buffers were likely still sufficient.
23.
The mission acknowledged that risk buffers were large but noted that their
adequacy should be tested against a more demanding standard than used so far; the
authorities were unconvinced. While banks do perform stress tests under instructions from
their parent banks or the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA), the mission advised the
authorities to press for scenarios embedding more severe and more varied shocks, tailored to
Estonian conditions. Staff also urged the authorities to perform a systemic stress test based
on a large but plausible macroeconomic shock, including possibly a large increase in the
interest rate, and to use the outcome to review capital requirements. The authorities noted
that Basel II rules, to take effect in 2008, would require banks to carry out more systematic
programs of stress testing; moreover, in the run-up to Basel II, the FSA was currently
assessing the risk models prepared by the largest subsidiaries of Nordic banks. They agreed
that a systemic stress test could be informative but pointed out that since local banks are
affiliates of larger institutions which manage risk centrally, assessments based on the
relatively small Estonian part of the overall portfolio were of doubtful usefulness. Moreover,
intrusive regulatory interventions could lead to offshore activity or to the conversion of
subsidiaries to branches. The mission recognized that increased integration complicated both
supervision and regulation but noted that a clear assessment of Estonia-specific risks would
allow the authorities to press—if necessary—for a joint intervention with the home country
supervisor.
24.
The FSA emphasized that it was already focusing its efforts on strengthening
cross-border coordination in bank supervision. Informal contacts with partner supervisors
were frequent and helpful. In addition, the FSA and the Swedish Financial Inspectorate (FI)
exchanged information routinely and held regular formal meetings. More recently, the FSA
had begun having direct meetings with the head offices of Swedish financial institutions with
large affiliates in Estonia. The FSA and FI were also preparing a joint letter of intent
establishing procedures under which each would participate in the other’s onsite inspections.
The authorities were looking forward to an FSAP update in early 2008 as an opportunity for
further review.3
25.
The authorities also underscored the need for a multilateral approach in
developing crisis management procedures. They stressed that the first line of defense in
the event of a bank run would be the banks’ own resources, including from parent
institutions. While Eesti Pank could furnish some additional liquidity and the Deposit

21
Guarantee Fund could provide coverage comparable to that in Sweden and Finland, the
authorities emphasized that under some circumstances complementary support by home
country institutions would be needed. In late 2006, the authorities had signed two MOUs
which defined procedures to be followed in the event of a crisis: an international MOU
involving Swedish and Baltic central banks and a domestic agreement among Eesti Pank, the
FSA, and the Ministry of Finance.4 While the MOUs provided a framework for a rapid
response, they did not precommit either side to specific measures or address burden sharing.
The authorities were also participating in domestic and cross-country multi-party crisis
simulation exercises.
26.
The mission reiterated the case for removing distortionary tax incentives
favoring housing investment. The authorities agreed that the mortgage interest deduction
could be cut further and eventually eliminated but said that no proposals were presently
under consideration. On the capital gains tax, they pointed out that the exemption of owneroccupied housing was common practice internationally; in Estonia recent improvements in
tax administration had raised compliance rates for the tax on non-exempt housing.
E. Competitiveness and Productivity
27.
The authorities saw no problems with the current level of competitiveness. The
main indicators they rely on—export performance and the profitability of the export sector—
were healthy in 2006 and they expected them to remain so as wage growth moderated. Staff
pointed to real exchange rate indices suggesting some erosion of competitiveness in 2006–07
(Box 2). The authorities agreed that excessive wage increases could erode competitiveness
but they noted that it was normal for the real exchange rate to appreciate during a boom; this
should unwind when the economy slows down. This dynamic was amplified in Estonia by
the widespread use of bonuses, which typically constitute 20 percent of total salary and are
partly linked to indices that move with the business cycle—sales, profits, or turnover. The
high wage growth in the first quarter of 2007 was thus in part the result of bonuses based on
the exceptional performance of firms last year. Symmetrically, bonuses provided room for
some automatic wage moderation in downturns.

28.
Staff and the authorities agreed that labor market flexibility is key to sustaining
productivity growth and easing external adjustment. While the mobility of labor across
jobs in Estonia is high by European standards, some indicators (notably, the World Bank’s
Doing Business index) have highlighted rigidities that could pose problems in a downturn.
The government has initiated a review of the 1992 Employment Contracts Act with a view to
simplifying hiring and firing procedures and reassessing the framework for severance
payments and unemployment insurance. Proposals are also underway to ease the labor
shortage by doubling the quota for long-term non-EU workers to 1 percent of the population
and, more importantly, streamlining the application procedure for work permits. To
encourage immigration of skilled workers, the authorities intend to introduce a floor for the
salaries of foreign workers.
29.
The mission emphasized the importance of promoting sustained productivity
growth over the medium term. The mission presented research showing that total factor
productivity growth, particularly in trade and business services, has been the main driving
force behind Estonia’s remarkable growth performance to date.5 The basis of this
performance—liberal economic institutions, conservative macroeconomic policies and
increasing integration with EU markets—remains in place; the challenge is to continue to
move toward (and eventually shift) the technology frontier. The authorities indicated that
Estonia is moving up the value-added ladder—labor-intensive industries such as textiles are
losing their comparative advantage and moving overseas as entrepreneurs shift toward
knowledge-based and R&D-intensive activities. Staff noted that its own work supported the
same conclusion.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
After more than ten years of exceptional growth and stability, the resilience of
the economy is being tested by burgeoning demand and increased regional uncertainty.
Rapid transformation inevitably entails risks but the strong policies and flexible institutions
that have underpinned Estonia’s enviable economic performance to date should mitigate
them. There are signs of an incipient market-driven adjustment, but this is still fragile. Thus,
assertive policies—within the authorities’ limited room for maneuver—are needed to
improve the odds of a soft landing, and continued supervisory vigilance is needed to contain
financial sector risks.
31.
For the immediate future, a tight fiscal stance is needed to curtail demand and
signal a renewed commitment to a conservative fiscal posture. Since the 2007 budget
implies a surplus well short of the remarkable 2006 outcome, the authorities need to send a
clear signal of their determination to keep the fiscal position tight, reassuring financial
markets and dampening unrealistic expectations on the part of consumers and borrowers. At

5

data.

23
the present stage, that signal can best be sent by placing a moratorium on new spending
under the supplementary budget in spite of a large projected revenue overperformance.
32.
Equally important is a more ambitious medium-term fiscal framework. Estonia’s
past commitment to budget balance or surplus served it well, but a more ambitious and
transparent framework is now needed to lock down expectations, buttress the CBA, and
position the budget for future age-related expenditures. The 2008–11 budget strategy,
approved after the mission’s departure, is a welcome departure insofar as it establishes the
principle of surpluses rather than balance. But the surplus floors cited in the strategy fall well
short of what is needed: if adhered to, they would deliver a procyclical impulse and increase
rather than reduce the size of government relative to GDP. And the practice of specifying
floors rather than targets muddies the signal of the government’s intentions (particularly
since budgets have overperformed by large margins in recent years) and undermines fiscal
policy transparency. A review the 2008 budget target later in the year in light of economic
growth and evolving risks will be the opportunity to prepare a budget that is appropriately
tight. The mid-2008 revision of the MTBF for the outer years should be used to prepare a
strategy that sends clearer signals of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal program.
33.
Although the banking system appears strong, financial sector risks call for
sustained supervisory vigilance. While the authorities’ commitment to the CBA is credible,
a collapse in real estate prices, a sharp hike in interest rates, or a protracted economic
slowdown could lead to financial stress. The authorities’ campaign to raise public awareness
of macroeconomic risks appears to have borne fruit and should be kept up. In the meantime,
though the risk buffers seem wide, the authorities should regularly review their adequacy
through more active use of stress testing as well as sustained close supervision of credit
standards, internal controls, and risk assessment procedures. In particular, the FSA could
increase the frequency and comprehensiveness of stress tests, as well as the severity of the
shocks used.
34.
Bank supervision and risk management have been complicated by Estonia’s
close integration with the Nordic countries and the openness of its capital account.
Thus, recent steps to institutionalize cooperation with the Swedish financial supervisor are
welcome and cooperation will need to become still closer when the region moves to Basel II
in 2008. The authorities’ review of the risk models developed by the larger banks in the runup to Basel II is a welcome opportunity to ensure that those models and the associated stress
tests are well adapted to the Estonian situation. Based on this assessment, there may be a case
for reviewing the adequacy of risk buffers, in consultation with the home supervisor.
35.
Euro adoption should remain a key objective. Adopting the euro will lock in the
benefits of the CBA while eliminating the residual balance-sheet risks associated with a
separate currency. In view of the robustness of the CBA and the policy framework, markets
have accepted a three- to four-year postponement but a longer or open-ended delay would
not be welcome. The authorities have few instruments to accelerate the process but they need
to reassure markets and minimize the costs of delay. The recent decision to change the timing
of planned excise tax increases in order to maximize the chances of euro entry by 2011 was

24
both an effective step to reach that goal and a clear signal of the authorities’ commitment to
it.
36.
With some indicators pointing to real exchange rate overvaluation, and given the
CBA and prospective euro adoption, labor and product market flexibility are essential.
In a rapidly converging economy such as Estonia’s, competitiveness must be assessed in a
dynamic context and from a medium-term perspective. In this regard, market flexibility will
facilitate a shift of resources from non-traded to traded sectors, easing the external
adjustment, and a shift toward the higher value-added sectors, improving the foundation for
continued growth. The existing vibrant business environment must be maintained by keeping
red tape and other operating costs to a minimum. While the labor market has shown
remarkable flexibility in the upswing, the ongoing review of the Employment Contracts Act
is a good opportunity to weed out outmoded labor market rules and procedures whilst
preserving an appropriate balance between flexibility and social objectives. In the face of
current labor market tightness and a secular decline in the labor supply, relaxing temporary
immigration restrictions across the skill spectrum could help keep business costs down and
relieve growth bottlenecks.
37.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Estonia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Projections
2010 2011 2012

1/ Derived as [r - g - p(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; p= change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-p(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp) times previous period debt stock. p increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (US dollar terms, in percent)

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Estonia became a member of the World Bank on June 23, 1992. The World Bank’s
early involvement in Estonia included work on public expenditure issues (1994), local
government financing (1995), and the impact of the transition process on living standards
(1996). In June 1997, the Bank completed a Public Expenditure Review Update.
2.
In June 1999, the World Bank completed a Country Economic Memorandum entitled
“Estonia: Implementing the EU Accession Agenda.” In February 2000, the World Bank
initiated work on a Regional Development Program for the northeastern-most county of
Estonia, Ida Virumaa. The work included the development of an action program designed to:
(a) strengthen regional institutions providing labor and education services, as well as other
social services; (b) support the development of small and medium enterprises; and
(c) mitigate past environmental damages, contributing to sustainable development. The work
was completed in June 2000.
3.
The Board of Executive Directors approved the first World Bank lending operation in
Estonia, a Rehabilitation Loan for US$30 million, in October 1992. In May 1994, loans to
support district heating rehabilitation (US$38.4 million) and highway maintenance
(US$12 million) were approved. A US$10 million Financial Institutions Development Loan
(FIDL) was approved in October 1994, a health project (US$18 million) in January 1995,
followed in April 1995 by an environment loan (US$2 million), and an agricultural loan
(US$16 million) in March 1996. All the above-mentioned projects have already been
completed and closed. In March 2000, the Board approved a Transport Sector Project
(US$25 million), focusing primarily on road improvements. The project closing date is
December 31, 2005.
4.
The Bank’s local office in Tallinn was closed in June 2001. In late 2003 Estonia
opted to cancel the undisbursed World Bank loan balances, and the Bank’s last active project
(Transport Sector Project) was closed in December 2005. On September 17, 2006, Estonia
changed from World Bank borrower status to donor status.

ANNEX III. ESTONIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes, although
fiscal data on general government operations are not always timely. A data ROSC mission
visited Tallinn during May 10–18, 2001 and found that the quality of macroeconomic
statistics was generally good. It noted that international standards and guidelines were
generally followed. However, the quality of fiscal and monetary data was affected by
incomplete coverage.
Estonia is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The Bank of
Estonia (BoE) and the Statistical Office of Estonia (SE) periodically update on their websites
a wide variety of data on the key variables for the monetary, fiscal, real, and external sectors.
As a member of the European Union and a candidate to join the European Monetary Union,
Estonia has markedly upgraded its statistics to comply with European Central Bank standards
and regulations.
A. Monetary Statistics
2.
Monetary data are collected with a frequency of 10 days and are available to Fund
staff upon request. The data are published by the BoE on its website. The BoE balance-sheet
data (base money and net international reserves) are reported monthly, and are available on
the eighth day of the following month. Broad money and its components are available
monthly from the BoE on the thirteenth banking day from the beginning of the month.
Interest rate updates on domestic and foreign currency transactions are provided monthly on
the seventeenth banking day of the month.
B. Financial Statistics
3.
Financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis. (Data for
individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis.) Data on commercial bank reserves,
NFAs, and net open foreign exchange positions are available on the eleventh banking day of
the month. Commercial bank off-balance sheet data, leverage ratios, liquidity ratios, and
short term external debt are available on the eighteenth banking day of the month. Average
capital adequacy ratios are available on the thirteenth banking day of the month. Data on
non-performing loans are available on the seventeenth banking day of the month.
C. Financial Soundness Indicators
4.
Estonia participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators for 2005
have been posted on the IMF website.
D. Balance of Payments
5.
All balance of payments data are compiled by the BoE. Daily exchange rate data are
available with a one working day lag. Monthly import/export data are available with a two

6
month lag. Quarterly balance of payments and public and private external debt data are
available with a quarterly lag.
E. Government Finance
6.
All fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Historical data are
also available on SE’s website. SDDS data for central government operations have not been
disseminated since December 2002.
•

Monthly central government operations data are available with a lag of up to 25 days
after the end of the month. The government began reporting monthly data on a
consolidated government basis in January 1999 on its Estonian-language web site.
Quarterly data on foreign loans and guarantees by the central government are
published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The MoF is using one of its two allowed
SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central government operations
data, but it plans to begin disseminating these data in the near future.

•

Comprehensive annual data on central and local government operations (case basis)
are reported in the GFS Yearbook 2005. The government balance sheet only reports
liabilities, both domestic and foreign. Only annual data are reported in the
International Finance Statistics up to and including 2001. Cumulative annual general
government operation data for 2002–05 are available on Estonia's National Summary
Data Page (NSDP).
F. National Accounts

•

Data on GDP (quarterly, by semester, and annually) are published by SE with a lag of
three months after the end of the quarter. Flash estimates of aggregate GDP are
available two months after the end of the accounting period. Monthly CPI inflation
data are available seven days after the end of the accounting period. Monthly PPI and
export price index data are available four weeks after the end of the accounting
period. Monthly indicators of output, i.e., retail trade, industrial output, industrial
sales, are reported approximately six weeks to two months after the end of the
accounting period. Nominal monthly wage data and quarterly nominal and real wage
data are published with a two-month lag.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Estonia
On July 23, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia.1
Background
Estonia’s commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies and regional integration has resulted
in the fastest convergence among new European Union member states and an impressive rise
in living standards. After more than a decade of remarkable growth, the economy is now
overheating and facing increased regional uncertainties.
Rising incomes, the favorable investment climate, and low-interest financing have fueled an
investment and consumption boom that has generated double-digit real GDP growth, widened
the external current account deficit, and driven inflation into the 5–6 percent range, well above
the Maastricht threshold for euro adoption. Domestic growth and employment opportunities in
the EU have tightened the labor market—the unemployment rate has fallen sharply in the past
two years to a post-transition low of less than 6 percent—and increased labor costs. Real wage
increases have overtaken productivity growth in the past year, pushing up real unit labor costs
and threatening external competitiveness.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The external environment has turned less benign as pressures on the Latvian currency earlier
this year put a spotlight on financial vulnerabilities in the region. To date, Estonia’s track record
of sound macroeconomic and prudential policies has helped it brush off contagion effects of
these developments. But the intensified scrutiny from market observers has increased the cost
of policy slippage.
There are some signs of an incipient moderation of demand growth. The housing market has
cooled—prices are already unaffordable for many households and interest rates are rising. The
flow of credit has slowed—the major banks have reassessed risks and tightened lending
conditions. And, more broadly, market sentiment has shifted in apparent recognition that the
recent pace of income growth is not sustainable.
Estonia’s long-standing commitment to fiscal prudence—a track record of surpluses and the
near-elimination of government debt—was underscored in 2006 by a large fiscal surplus and an
associated negative fiscal impulse. Looking ahead, the government is committed to keeping
fiscal policy tight and is targeting budget surpluses of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2007 and 0.5
percent of GDP in 2008–11.
The banking sector is strong: banks are well capitalized, profitability is high, and non-performing
loans are negligible. Given that all major Estonian banks are affiliates of much larger foreign
institutions, the financial supervisor and central bank are strengthening cross-border
cooperation in supervising banks and developing crisis management procedures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Estonia's impressive convergence toward EU living standards,
underpinned by prudent macroeconomic management, far-reaching structural reforms, and
strong regional integration. They noted that this solid foundation should also help Estonia
address the near-term challenges of steering the economy toward a soft landing and sustaining
credibility in the face of regional financial uncertainties.
Directors concurred that tight fiscal policy is needed to address macroeconomic overheating
and the attendant risks. They commended the authorities for the strong fiscal outcome in 2006
but saw some need for further strengthening of the 2007 fiscal position given the continued
overheating. Directors in particular recommended limiting any procyclical impulse by at least
refraining from new spending in the 2007 supplementary budget.
Looking forward, Directors underscored the importance of a tight fiscal policy to contain
household optimism and prepare for the costs of an aging population. They welcomed the intent
to target budget surpluses instead of balanced budgets but noted that the signal sent by the
budget strategy would be clearer if the specified floors were more ambitious given the
significantly larger surpluses achieved in recent years. The authorities were also encouraged to
implement, for the state-funded pillar of the pension system, a pension indexation rule that limits
ad hoc increases in benefits while ensuring adequate living standards for pensioners relative to
those of workers.

3
Directors noted that the banking sector appears strong and buffers in the financial system seem
sufficient. Nonetheless, they cautioned that the rapid growth of credit in the past few years calls
for continued vigilance in financial supervision, including a more systematic use of stress tests.
Directors encouraged the authorities to extend and strengthen cross-border supervision as the
region moves to Basel II in 2008. They emphasized that close cooperation with the Nordic
authorities is essential, given Estonia's mostly Nordic-owned banking sector. Directors
welcomed the existing good cooperation with the other Nordic and Baltic financial supervisors
and the recent steps to deepen that relationship.
Directors agreed that euro adoption at the earliest possible date should remain a key objective
given that, despite the robust currency board arrangement, currency risk will not be eliminated
altogether until the euro is adopted. They thus welcomed the new government's reaffirmation of
Estonia's commitment to euro adoption.
Noting some signs of weakening competitiveness, Directors emphasized that labor and product
market flexibility are essential for macroeconomic stability under the currency board
arrangement and, in time, euro area membership. In this regard, they welcomed the efforts to
review and update the labor code, and encouraged the authorities to preserve Estonia's
business-friendly environment by keeping administrative and operating costs low.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Republic of Estonia
and Timo Kosenko, Advisor to Executive Director
July 23, 2007

Our Estonian authorities would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Rozwadowski and
his team for the very constructive and open discussions and the set of high-quality papers.
The authorities broadly agree with staff's assessment and value highly the recommendations
put forward. In the following, we briefly describe the general macroeconomic situation and
focus on the key policy challenges ahead.
General Macroeconomic Situation and Outlook
Estonia has enjoyed high GDP growth over the last years, supported by a strong currencyboard arrangement, prudent macroeconomic policies and high competitiveness. Deepening
economic and financial ties with the EU have fostered rapid real convergence. However, the
authorities agree with staff that the economy is currently running over its potential, owing to
buoyant investments and private consumption.
Domestic demand has been reinforced by a very optimistic outlook in the corporate sector
and positive expectations of households, bolstered by low unemployment levels. Due to high
demand and increases in food prices, inflation has remained at a relatively high level,
reaching 5.8 percent in June, compared to the same period last year. Export growth was
somewhat lower than expected in the first quarter, mainly because of a decline in transitrelated trade flows. However, the direct economic impact of decline in transit is limited, and
likely of temporary nature. As very high investment continued to be financed partly by
foreign savings and profitability of foreign owned companies was strong, the current account
deficit reached 17.9 percent of GDP in the first quarter. At the same time, export growth in
the manufacturing sector has been robust, reaching 14.7 percent during the first five months
of 2007 showing that competitiveness remains solid.
Over the medium term, growth is set to moderate as demand pressures ease. Tighter lending
conditions and higher interest rates have curbed the credit expansion, and the housing market
has already started to cool. Selling periods have lengthened, while price increases have
slowed and even reversed. Mortgage lending has also clearly decelerated from the beginning
of the year. Slowing demand for labor in the construction sector should help to ease the labor
market pressures. According to preliminary estimates, the GDP growth slowed to 9.8 percent
in the first quarter of 2007. Growth is expected to level off to around 8.5 to 9 percent in 2007
and close to medium-term potential thereafter, broadly in line with staff's projection. The
external balance will also gradually strengthen, as the economy steers towards a more stable
growth path.

2

Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain fully committed to strong macroeconomic policies. Underlying
Estonia's policy framework is the currency board arrangement, which is supported by firm
fiscal policies. The authorities agree with staff that against the background of overheating
pressures it is important to maintain a tight fiscal stance. Estonia has continued to accumulate
budget surpluses already since 2002, relying on conservative forecasts and setting aside the
additional revenues. This has helped to build up sizeable reserves and made the government
sector a net creditor, given the very low level of public debt. In its Spring forecast, the
Ministry of Finance projected the 2007 fiscal surplus to reach 1.9 percent of GDP; that
projection is now expected to be exceeded by a comfortable margin. The authorities agree
with staff's advice on avoiding additional fiscal stimulus to the economy and attach high
priority to saving any revenue over performance.
The income-tax reform, aimed at shifting the tax system from labor taxation towards
consumption and environmental taxation, remains high among the priorities of the
government. The income tax rate is scheduled to decrease gradually to 18 percent by 2011.
At the same time, rises in excise taxes, some of which are required to harmonize these with
the EU levels, are expected to bring additional revenue and, together with expenditure
restraint, will ensure that the income tax reform will not result in additional fiscal stimulus.
Looking ahead, the authorities have recently adopted a medium-term budget framework
which sets clear priorities and budget targets for the government until the year 2011. The
budget strategy is focused on maintaining strong fiscal policies that facilitate smooth
economic adjustment and help to meet the fiscal costs related to population aging. To this
end, the strategy aims for a continuous budget surplus over the next four years and also
establishes targets for expenditure growth, which are set to decline to 6 percent by 2011.
Medium-Term Challenges and Competitiveness
The Estonian authorities agree with staff that, over the medium and long term, productivity
advances together with labor and product market flexibility will be essential to maintain
competitiveness. As a large share of very high domestic investments is inevitably financed
by foreign savings, sustaining the productivity of investments is essential also to ensure a
smooth adjustment of Estonia's external position. The real exchange rate has been in line
with economic developments, where some appreciation is to be expected during a boom, and
does not signal loss off competitiveness.
Against the background of rapid economic expansion and favorable conditions in Estonia's
main export markets the enterprises have maintained their competitiveness and increased

3
profits, despite high wage growth. However, resource and labor constraints have emerged in
some sectors. Although the labor productivity growth has historically been broadly in line
with wage growth, the authorities agree that recent productivity and real wage developments
call for close monitoring. The employment level has shown a healthy increase over the last
years, but is expected to level off as the pool of potential workers is limited. Opening of the
EU labor market has contributed to a decline in unemployment to very low levels, but also to
wage pressures, including in the public sector. In the future, integration with the EU market
may increase labor supply, as Estonia's labor market is fully open to workers from the EU,
including the new member states.
The authorities have adopted an action plan for economic growth and employment, which
identifies measures to increase competitiveness and enhance the flexibility of the labor
market. Planned changes to the Employment Contracts Act will streamline the procedures
and make firing of workers less onerous for companies, helping to reduce costs and put
enterprises in a better position to cope with a potentially less favorable economic
environment. The authorities will also start a more comprehensive overhaul of labor
legislation, effectively covering all aspects of labor regulation.
Euro Adoption and Inflation
Joining the euro area as soon as possible continues to be a key goal of the Estonian economic
policy. The authorities firmly believe that joining the euro area would deepen economic
integration, further real convergence and enhance long-term economic stability. The
economic policies, relying on flexible markets and conservative fiscal policy are conducive
to joining the monetary union. Prudent policies are well established by successfully running a
currency board for over 15 years.
Estonia fulfills all the Maastricht criteria, except the inflation criterion. Higher energy and
food prices have kept inflation above the reference value, especially as the weight of these
components is higher in Estonia's CPI basket than in the EU. More recently, cyclical factors
have also been at play and housing related costs have increased. These developments have
rendered meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion unlikely before 2010, as the inflation is
expected to peak in 2008. However, inflation has been broadly in line with rapid economic
growth and continued price level convergence, and is expected to slow along with
moderation in economic growth. Nevertheless, the authorities remain vigilant, and monitor
closely the market reactions related to postponement of the euro adoption.
In line with staff's advice, the authorities have timed the administrative price increases and
measures to harmonize excise duties with EU levels in a manner that limits their inflationary
impact on outlying years, when the inflation rate is expected to decline within reach of the
criterion. The excise tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco will be increased next year, as well

4
as excises on alcohol and motor fuel. In addition an excise on electricity will be introduced in
2008.
Financial Sector
The Estonian banking and financial system is fully integrated with the Nordic financial
groups. Tight integration of regional financial markets has had an extremely positive impact
on intermediation of savings between the economies in the region and, thus, on overall
economic development. While full integration of Estonian banks into the risk and liquidity
management framework of large financial groups has improved the resilience of the financial
system, it has also provided readily available financing. Together with a general boost of
confidence after the EU accession this has brought along a high demand for credit. Although
the financial assets and savings of households have increased rapidly along with rising
incomes, credit growth has been even faster. Against this backdrop, the macroeconomic
policy response of the authorities is focused on creating large fiscal and capital cushions, as
well as deepening supervisory cooperation to ensure that an eventual turn of the cycle would
result in a smooth adjustment.
Overall the financial standing of the banking sector remains strong. Rising interest rates have
enabled banks to boost margins, as well as profits. Estonia's regulatory environment has been
tightened in accordance with the pace of credit expansion. The minimum capital adequacy
ratio in Estonia is above the EU level at 10 percent, whereas reserve requirement is
15 percent and the risk weight for mortgage loans stands at 100 percent. These precautionary
measures provide an additional buffer for banks to cope with a changing economic
environment. More recently, banks have also taken a more guarded view to market
development, and become increasingly conservative in their lending policies. Tighter
policies, coupled with rising interest rates have slowed the loan growth. Yearly growth of
private sector domestic debt had declined to 46 percent by May, compared to 52 percent at
the beginning of the year. The liquidity of banks has been stable, credit quality has remained
good and nonperforming loans are very low.
However, the authorities are closely monitoring the developments, including through close
cooperation with other supervisors in the region, and conducting rigorous stress testing to
identify potential vulnerabilities early. The authorities agree on the importance of conducting
systemic stress tests. During the last year, crisis management capabilities and cooperation
with home supervisors have been markedly strengthened by shaping procedures for crisis
management with other supervisors and participating in cross-country crisis simulation
exercises.
