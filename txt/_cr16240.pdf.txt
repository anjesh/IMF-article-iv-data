IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Vietnam
On June 17, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2016
Article IV consultation1 with Vietnam.
Vietnam’s economy has experienced solid growth with low inflation, reflecting policy attention
to maintaining macroeconomic stability. Economic performance was robust through most of
2015, driven by rapid export growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), and strong domestic
demand. Manufacturing and exports moderated near year-end—reflecting slowing external
demand—and agriculture production fell sharply in the beginning of 2016, owing to a severe
drought and arable land salinization. Inflation declined below one percent in 2015 before ticking
upward in early 2016 due to higher food and administered prices. The current account narrowed
sharply from rising imports, and gross international reserves declined in the second half of 2015
before recovering in early 2016.
Fiscal policy has been loose in recent years. The deficit was 5.9 percent of GDP last year.
Revenues rose strongly, reflecting tax and non-tax collection, while expenditure was higher than
planned, owing to carry-forward spending by local governments, and higher capital, social and
interest spending. Public debt has risen sharply. Monetary policy was accommodative over most
of last year amid falling inflation, and credit growth was robust. Liquidity conditions were
tightened around year-end as global financial volatility increased, and the exchange-rate regime
was made more flexible. A number of important reform steps have been taken, but nonperforming loan (NPL) resolution, bank recapitalization, and state-owned enterprise reforms
have been sluggish.
For 2016, growth is projected to moderate to around 6 percent, reflecting the adverse agriculture
shock, lower external demand and spillovers of tighter global financial conditions. Headline
inflation is projected to rise modestly. Reserves are expected to increase to around 2 months of
imports, and public debt to reach around 62 percent of GDP. While the near-term outlook is
broadly positive, there are downside risks, including from high and rising public debt, slow NPL

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

resolution progress, prolonged drought, tighter or more volatile global financial conditions, and
weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies. Upside opportunities exist, including
rapid implementation of recently signed trade agreements, which would usher in productivity
gains, fuel exports and incentivize reforms.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended Vietnam’s
recent good macroeconomic performance and the significant progress made in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. Directors were encouraged by the broadly favorable economic
outlook, but noted that external and domestic risks exist, mainly from the rising public debt,
rapid credit growth, and slow banking sector reforms. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to prudent policies and reforms, and emphasized that determined steps are needed
to build on the current achievements and boost the economy’s growth potential.
Directors underscored that growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is key to reversing the rise in
public debt and creating space for critical social and development expenditures. They urged the
authorities to begin taking measures this year to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
by 2020. Directors stressed the importance of structural revenue-enhancing measures, including
rationalizing exemptions and incentives, broadening the tax base, and further strengthening
revenue administration. They also encouraged the authorities to take steps to reform the civil
service to rationalize the public wage bill, improve spending efficiency, and use equitization
receipts to finance the deficit.
Directors supported the current monetary policy stance and welcomed the shift to a more flexible
exchange rate regime, while encouraging the authorities to remain vigilant should price pressures
emerge. They called on the authorities to continue to build international reserves, further
strengthen the monetary policy framework, and undertake institutional and operational reforms
to support a gradual shift toward using inflation as the nominal anchor.
Noting that the recent rise in credit growth could pose risks to financial stability, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ proposals to tighten macroprudential policy and recommended further
tightening if needed. They stressed the need for further efforts on banking sector reforms,
including measures to resolve nonperforming loans, recapitalize banks by existing shareholders,
enhance governance, risk management, and supervision, and adopt international financial
reporting standards.
Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify the pace of structural reforms to boost
productivity and the economy’s long-term growth potential. They welcomed progress made on

the legal framework for state-owned enterprise reforms and urged continued efforts in this area,
including greater transparency and a level-playing field with the private sector. Directors also
recommended improvements in education to strengthen human capital and address skills
mismatches, complemented by a conducive business climate.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Vietnam will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 1, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth has been robust with low inflation. Sustaining this good performance
and addressing key risks will require a second generation of policy upgrades. A new
government took office in 2016 with a commitment to reforms that, if implemented,
would place Vietnam in a sound position to achieve its ambitious development goals.
Outlook and risks. Growth is projected to moderate this year to around 6 percent with
underlying inflation contained and the current account broadly in balance. Key downside
risks include the external environment, high public debt now estimated above
60 percent of GDP, and unresolved banking sector nonperforming loans (NPLs).
Implementation of new trade agreements is an upside medium-term opportunity.
Fiscal policy. With persistently high deficits, public debt has risen sharply and the risk of
debt distress has climbed. A growth-friendly consolidation is needed, beginning this year,
to ensure debt sustainability and provide space for critical spending and state-owned
bank recapitalization. The focus should be on structural revenue-enhancing measures,
rationalizing the public wage bill, and raising the efficiency of capital spending.
Monetary and exchange rate policy. Monetary policy can remain on hold absent
underlying inflation pressures. The successful adoption of a more flexible exchange rate
regime is commendable. Gradually shifting toward using inflation as the nominal anchor,
while allowing exchange rate flexibility to buffer shocks, would enhance stability.
Banking sector reform. Some welcome reforms have been taken, but the approach of
allowing banks to recapitalize mainly via retained earnings will take many years and
raises macrofinancial risks. Faster NPL resolution is needed, along with recapitalization of
banks by existing shareholders, including the budget for state-owned banks. Proposals
to tighten macroprudential policy are welcome given overly fast credit growth.
Structural and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms. Accelerated SOE and structural
reforms are needed to boost productivity. Key elements include more comprehensive
SOE equitization with improved transparency and governance, the creation of a level
playing field with the private sector, and education reforms to address skills mismatches.

CONTEXT
1.
Vietnam’s economy has experienced solid growth with low inflation, reflecting policy
attention to maintaining macroeconomic stability. Excellent progress has been made in
achieving Millennium Development Goals and Vietnam’s openness to trade and foreign direct
investment (FDI) has been an engine for growth of increasingly sophisticated exports to diversified
markets. Entrenching these achievements and strengthening resilience in an uncertain and
potentially volatile global environment will, however, require important policy upgrades to tackle
legacy risks and emerging challenges. Public debt is high, external debt has increased, and rapid
credit expansion poses a risk to financial stability while adequate bank recapitalization to deal with
impaired assets has yet to materialize. Structural reforms, including for state-owned enterprises, are
needed to strengthen the spillover of productivity gains in the foreign-invested sector to the
domestic economy.
2.
The January 2016 Party Congress has been accompanied by a renewed reform drive. A
new government was formed in April, three months ahead of the traditional schedule, reflecting the
authorities’ desire to begin implementing their economic policy reform agenda without delay. In
addition to reaffirming the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability, emphasis has been
placed on increasing use of market-based mechanisms for economic reforms. This reenergized push
provides an excellent opportunity to tackle key issues in a second generation of reforms that would
place Vietnam in a position to take full advantage of its potential and recent trade agreements to
become one of Asia’s most successful and dynamic economies.1
3.
Policies have been broadly in line with past Fund advice, although implementation in
some key areas has lagged. A more flexible mechanism for setting the daily central exchange rate
was introduced, monetary policy is increasingly focusing on inflation stability as a key objective, and
the authorities are interested in moving toward using inflation as a nominal anchor. Banking sector
reforms have been undertaken, including phasing out explicit loan classification forbearance and
strengthening supervision. Macroprudential oversight has been strengthened. However, resolution
of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and recapitalization has not progressed in earnest. The legal
framework for state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms has been developed but implementation is
lagging. Sustained fiscal consolidation has not materialized.

Economic growth was robust last year, but it slowed entering 2016. Real GDP rose by
6¾ percent (y/y) in 2015, underpinned by supportive macrofinancial policy settings. Both
investment and consumption contributed to strong domestic demand. After holding up well

through the first half of last year export growth began to moderate in the second half, reflecting
lower commodity prices and slowing external demand. Import growth, mainly machinery and
intermediate goods, was strong in the first three quarters, reflecting a tooling-up of capacity related
to recent trade agreements, but it also slowed toward year-end, especially inputs for export
processing. Real GDP growth slowed to 5½ percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2016. Agriculture
production fell sharply owing to a severe drought and arable land salinization, and industrial
production moderated in line with soft trade.

5.
Inflation has fallen significantly. Headline inflation fell to below 1 percent (y/y) before
ticking upward in early 2016 due to higher food and administered healthcare prices. Core inflation
excluding administered price adjustments has fallen to around 1¾ percent (y/y). Lower fuel and
import prices, absence of wage pressures, and a small output gap were the main drivers. Real estate
prices have increased slightly, but remain below their previous peak, partly owing to a substantial
increase in supply, particularly residential apartments, hotels, and retail space.
6.
Credit growth picked up to 19¼ percent (y/y) in early 2016, reflecting demand, an easing
of macroprudential policy via lower risk weights on lending to the real estate and securities sectors,
and higher credit growth targets for the banking sector announced by the State Bank of Vietnam
(SBV) (18–20 percent (y/y) for 2016). State-owned banks expanded credit at a significantly faster rate
than private banks and most of the increase was to the real estate, financial, and personal sectors
including mortgages, raising concerns over the productivity of new credit.

Heightened global financial volatility spilled over into domestic markets in the second
half of 2015, but conditions have improved recently. In response to short-term and portfolio
capital outflows and downward pressure on the exchange rate, the SBV made the exchange rate
regime more flexible (see text box) and intervened in support of the dong. International reserves
declined by an estimated US$9 billion from their 2015 peak to around US$28.3 billion (below
2 months of imports), low by most metrics. In the first months of this year, capital flows reversed
with portfolio and direct investment inflows, and international reserves increased to US$29 billion in
February. Government bond yields are slightly lower at the short end and up about 25 basis points
at the long end compared to a year ago, while EMBIG and CDS spreads have widened around
25 basis points. Equity markets were relatively volatile, but broadly unchanged from a year ago.

prompting the authorities subsequently to
introduce a more flexible mechanism for setting the daily central exchange rate based on: (i) the
previous day’s dong/USD exchange rate; (ii) exchange rates of countries that have substantial trade
and financial links with Vietnam; and (iii) domestic macroeconomic conditions. The +/-3 percent
trading band was retained. By end-2015, the dong had depreciated by about 5 percent against the
dollar, but was about 3½ percent appreciated in real effective terms. In the first months of this year,
the central rate has appreciated slightly and the interbank exchange rate has appreciated well off
the bottom of the trading band.

A dual, segmented external current account position continues. The surplus narrowed
sharply with rising imports last year and the domestic sector continued to run a trade deficit.
However, FDI strengthened, exports of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) continued to perform well,
and the FIE sector’s trade surplus remained. While no clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment
exists, the external position should be strengthened through higher reserves and structural and SOE
reforms to improve domestic-sector competitiveness that facilitate productivity spillovers from the
FIE sector (Boxes 1 and 2).

The near-term outlook is broadly positive, but challenges exist. Growth is projected to
moderate this year to around 6 percent. The softening reflects the drought that has adversely
impacted agriculture, lower external demand, and spillovers of tighter global financial conditions.
Headline inflation is projected to rise due to higher food and administered prices, although the
underlying rate should remain moderate absent broad-based demand pressures. The current
account balance is projected to decline slightly in the near term as exports and imports soften. It
would improve thereafter as the export sector responds to increased productive capacity and free
trade agreements. FDI inflows are projected to remain strong while short-term capital outflows
moderate. Over the medium term, growth is projected to settle around its potential rate of
6¼ percent. A bolder policy package of structural, fiscal, and banking reforms would raise
productivity, mitigate risks, and facilitate sustained higher long-run growth.
10.
Widening imbalances pose increasing risks to the outlook that, if not addressed, could
potentially interact to create macrofinancial spillbacks.


On the domestic side, the drought’s impact on agriculture could be deeper and more sustained.
Inadequate fiscal consolidation would further increase public debt and debt distress risk, reduce
space for bank and SOE reform costs, and pressure interest rates, which could worsen corporate
performance and banks’ credit quality, creating spillbacks for sovereign risk. Rising private
external debt increases the costs of—and potentially constrains incentives to allow—further
exchange rate flexibility. Banking-sector risks remain owing to slow progress in recapitalization
and NPL resolution. Sustained rapid credit growth—particularly to sectors that do not raise the
economy’s growth potential—could fuel future NPLs and increase banking sector risks. Distress
in the banking sector could exacerbate public debt distress risk, undermine growth, and cause
an abrupt exchange-rate shock.



External shocks could trigger domestic risks. Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions or
a sustained surge in the U.S. dollar could re-ignite capital outflows and pressure on the
exchange rate, and raise domestic interest rates. International reserves, which are already low,
could decline further absent exchange-rate flexibility. Slower global growth or a sharp slowdown
in China could undermine exports. Persistently lower oil prices would benefit the external
balance, but raise the fiscal deficit absent structural revenue-raising measures.

Some upside risks exist. Faster rebalancing in China would benefit finished-goods exports—
where Vietnam has already made inroads—and Vietnam is expected to remain among the main
beneficiaries of China’s rebalancing.2 Making use of the new more flexible exchange-rate regime
while focusing monetary policy increasingly on inflation stability would provide a shock absorber
against external shocks, safeguard macroeconomic stability, and permit an increase in reserves.
Rapid implementation of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other bilateral trade
agreements are an upside opportunity that would usher in productivity gains, fuel exports, and
incentivize reforms.

The authorities broadly concurred with the near-term outlook and risks, and see
opportunities to intensify the pace of reforms. They highlighted the progress made on bank and
SOE reforms and stressed their commitment to accelerate implementation as part of their socioeconomic plan aimed at growth averaging 6½–7 percent during the next five years. They agreed on
downside risks from the drought and potential global and regional volatility, but noted that for the
latter, increased exchange-rate flexibility would limit the impact on Vietnam. The slowdown of
imports, combined with strong FDI inflows and declining capital outflows has helped replenish
international reserves significantly since February. The authorities agreed with the need to reverse
the trend of public debt to preserve macroeconomic stability.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: CEMENTING STABILITY AND
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
Healthy growth and low inflation provide a supportive environment for a second generation of
reforms. A growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is a high priority while in the near term monetary policy
can be put on hold. Allowing increased use of the new more flexible exchange-rate regime highlights
the need to modernize the monetary policy framework. Efforts to recapitalize banks should be pursued
and previous macroprudential policy easing unwound, while other elements of banking, SOE, and
structural reforms to boost domestic-sector productivity are accelerated.

A. Fiscal Policy: Restoring the Anchor
12.
Fiscal policy has been loose in recent years. Deficits have averaged 6½ percent of GDP
since 2012. Revenue as a share of GDP dropped in this period, reflecting corporate income tax rate
and tariff reductions, tax exemptions and incentives, and declining oil revenues. Current
expenditures including interest payments increased, while capital expenditure has been constrained.
13.
Preliminary estimates show the 2015 deficit moderated to 5.9 percent of GDP. The
deficit outcome was close to the budget plan, but the composition was markedly different.
Revenues rose very strongly, exceeding the budget plan by 2 percent of GDP and reversing the
downward trend in the revenue-to-GDP ratio. The overperformance mainly reflected better tax
administration, and higher environmental taxes, local government revenue, land user rights sales,
and SOE dividends. These more than offset falling oil revenues. Expenditure was higher than
planned, reflecting carry-forward spending of 2014 local government revenue, and higher capital
and social expenditures. Interest expense also rose.
14.
A deficit of 6½ percent of GDP is projected for 2016, the same as the budget plan but
with higher revenue and expenditure. Gains made in tax and nontax revenue are projected to be
largely sustained in the near term, more than offsetting the impact of a 2 percentage point (to
20 percent) cut in the corporate income tax rate. Carry-forward spending of last year’s local
government revenue overperformance will occur again. This is estimated to add about 1½ percent
of GDP to expenditures compared with the authorities’ budget.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

15.
Public debt has risen sharply, and the risk of debt distress has climbed. The ratio of
public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP is projected to increase to 62 percent in 2016, up
over 16 percentage points in the past five years, reflecting persistently high budget deficits and
lower-than-projected nominal GDP due to low inflation. Under staff’s baseline projection, which
incorporates a modest consolidation to a deficit around 5 percent of GDP in the medium term, PPG
debt would rise toward 70 percent of GDP, elevating the risk of debt distress (Appendix 1 debt
sustainability analysis).
16.
The authorities’ draft medium-term budget plan indicates a deficit around 3 percent
of GDP by 2020. Such a consolidation would be appropriate, but there are substantial challenges to
achieving it. Structural revenue-enhancing policies have yet to be approved, and over the medium
term tax exemptions and trade tariff reductions due to trade agreements will undermine buoyancy,
and nontax revenues could ease due to declining SOE dividends as equitization (i.e., privatization)
advances. The authorities hope to restrain social spending by increasing fees for public healthcare
and education to incentivize greater use of private services, but higher fees would also raise social
insurance costs. Civil service reform, which could yield substantial savings, is not yet planned. In the
absence of revenue enhancements or current savings, the burden of adjustment could fall on large
cuts to capital spending, which would undermine growth.

Fiscal consolidation should begin this year with growth-friendly measures and include
funds for bank recapitalization. Deficit reduction of ¾ of a percentage point of GDP per year,
together with accelerated structural and bank reforms that could gradually boost real GDP growth
to its historical average—and the authorities’ medium-term objective—of 7 percent, would place the
debt ratio on a downward path and mitigate debt distress risk. Using public money to recapitalize
state-owned banks up front—estimated at 2½ percent of GDP (see below)—would result in a
manageable near-term debt increase, reduce uncertainty, and provide insurance against potentially
larger public sector liabilities that could arise if banks were to face heightened distress with
weakened capital positions.

implemented subsequently include
broadening the tax base by introducing a property, interest income, and capital gains tax and
including pensions under personal income tax. Together, these would raise the revenue-to-GDP
ratio back to its long-run average. Using equitization proceeds to finance the deficit would further
restrain debt and enhance National Assembly oversight of these funds.
19.
Room exists to rationalize the public
wage bill and enhance the efficiency of public
spending. Expenditure on public employment is
significantly higher than in other countries in the
region. A comprehensive civil service reform is
needed. Spending on education is commendably
higher than in comparable countries in the region
and yields good results in primary and secondary
education, although there is room to improve
vocational and tertiary education (Box 3).

countries and yields good results. Plans to increase the role of the private sector in education and
healthcare should proceed carefully to ensure quality and protect access for the poor. Improvements
in public capital spending efficiency are needed to narrow the infrastructure gap, with stronger
control and coordination at the provincial level.
20.
The authorities agreed with the need to reduce the fiscal deficit and arrest the rise in
public debt. They emphasized their intention to reduce the deficit to 4 percent on average over the
2016-2020 period, falling to around 3 percent by 2020, and to maintain debt below the legal limit of
65 percent of GDP. They noted staff’s medium-term consolidation scenario and advice to broaden
the revenue base, and were working on tax policies to raise revenue, expected to be implemented in
the next few years. Introduction of a property tax had been studied and the reintroduction of the
capital gains tax and unification of the VAT rate at 10 percent were being considered. The
authorities also noted their success to date in reducing tax evasion. Increases in tax rates were not
planned in the near term. On the expenditure side, the authorities recognized the need to reduce
the public wage bill, and they noted plans to increase participation by non-state actors in education
and healthcare to reduce costs to the budget. They also highlighted the need to make capital
expenditure more efficient, while increasing use of PPPs for infrastructure development. The Ministry
of Finance emphasized that bank recapitalization costs should not result in public debt exceeding
the legal limit.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Modernizing for a Rising Economy
21.
Monetary policy was accommodative
over most of last year against the backdrop
of falling inflation. Short-term interbank
interest rates fluctuated below the SBV’s repo
rate with abundant liquidity, and banks rapidly
expanded lending to meet the SBV’s credit
growth target. Liquidity conditions were
tightened around year end when currency
pressures arose.

Staff recommended keeping monetary
policy on hold as the impact of recent shocks feed through the economy. Although headline
inflation has risen, this reflects the adverse supply shock to agriculture and administered price
changes. Underlying inflation is benign and growth is slowing. If underlying inflation were to pick up
due to second-round effects, a tightening would be appropriate. If not, and inflation stalls while
growth weakens further, some easing could be considered. With external demand slowing, such an
easing could also come about in part through exchange-rate depreciation.
23.
Monetary operations should aim to stabilize the overnight interbank interest rate
close to the policy repo rate. Improved liquidity management and forecasting would strengthen
policy effectiveness. Establishing an interest-rate corridor, with an overnight standing credit facility

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

as the ceiling, a deposit facility as the floor, and the overnight interbank rate guided to the center of
the band through liquidity operations, would also enhance effectiveness. Shifts in the corridor would
then clearly signal changes in the policy stance.
24.
The 2016 credit growth target should not be binding. If met, it would increase the credit
intensity of growth and the credit-to-GDP ratio to levels signaling heightened risk and that have
been associated with previous periods of macroeconomic instability and elevated inflation in
Vietnam. Allowing credit growth to decline to below 15 percent in response to monetary and
macroprudential policies would reduce the expansion of the credit-to-GDP ratio below risky levels.
Over time, use of administrative measures, including credit growth targets and interest rate ceilings,
should be phased out as monetary operations are strengthened. This would make policy settings
more coherent, and complement efforts to reform the framework and improve the transmission
mechanism.

1/ The red line represents a year-on-year increase in the credit/GDP

associated with financial crisis empirically (GFSR, September 2011).

25.
The adoption of a more flexible exchange-rate regime is commendable and could
enhance monetary-policy independence. Use of the new regime should be made to buffer
external shocks. Recent foreign exchange intervention to build reserves opportunistically is
appropriate. Achieving at least the lower bound of the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric—
approximately three months of prospective goods and services imports—would strengthen buffers
that could be used to smooth periods of substantial volatility.
26.
Gradually shifting the monetary-policy framework toward using inflation as the
nominal anchor would facilitate greater macroeconomic stability (Box 4). Placing less weight on
exchange-rate stabilization would discourage one-way bets. In this context, broader operational,
communications and institutional reforms are needed (Box 5). Near term priorities include reforms
to strengthen the interest rate instrument and communications with enhanced focus on inflation
stability.
27.
The authorities emphasized that the SBV conducts monetary policy with inflation
control as the primary objective while supporting other objectives from time to time. This had
helped maintain macroeconomic stability. They also stressed that the change in exchange-rate
policy was a success and contributed to the recent appreciation of the dong by eliminating one-

13

VIETNAM

sided expectations. The SBV noted that it would conduct research on enhancing the monetary policy
framework and would seek technical assistance from the Fund as needed. In the near term, the
authorities indicated they would maintain current policy settings, given that higher headline inflation
reflects non-monetary factors. They are monitoring credit growth closely, and while higher targets
are supportive of growth, credit is being channeled through policy directives to productive sectors
based on individual banks’ health, and is thus consistent with continued low inflation and
macroeconomic stability.

C. Macroprudential and Banking Policy: Strengthening Macrofinancial
Stability
28.
The macroprudential framework is being developed. The SBV has proposed establishing
a Financial Stability Council, chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister, to coordinate financial stability
policies. A new Monetary and Financial Stability Department was formed within the SBV to assess
systemic risk, and an annual financial stability report has been prepared though not yet published.
To mitigate potential systemic risks, the SBV has proposed macroprudential tightening measures
including increasing the risk weight for real estate loans (reversing the previous easing) and
reducing prudential ratios governing asset/liability maturity mismatches. At the same time, it
proposed raising the loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio limit for state-owned banks (from 80 to 90 percent),
a policy easing.
29.
A number of welcome bank reform steps have been taken. These include phasing out
explicit loan classification forbearance on new loans; restricting dividend payments at weak
performing banks; strengthening on-site supervision and moving towards risk-based supervision;
tightening regulations on related-party lending; plans to increase the capital of the Vietnam Asset
Management Corporation (VAMC) and allow it to buy and sell NPLs at market rather than book
value; and the takeover of three weak banks by the SBV while writing down existing shareholders.
30.
Progress has been made in various FSAP recommendations. The SBV is implementing a
pilot experiment to identify 10 systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and undertake stress tests on
them, and work is underway to enhance their management and supervision. Basel II is being piloted
for 10 banks, including most D-SIBs, an early warning system is under construction, and bank data
collection and reporting is being strengthened. Less progress has been made in other areas,
including crisis management and bank resolution frameworks. As well, accounting standards are not
in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

The legacy of impaired loans poses ongoing challenges:


Banking-sector profitability remains weak reflecting a high level of impaired loans.
Banks’ return on assets (ROA) is 0.5 percent and return on equity (ROE) is 6¼ percent, significantly
lower than the averages of emerging and developing countries (about 2 and 15½ percent,
respectively). While the reported capital adequacy ratio is 12¾ percent, above the regulatory
minimum of nine percent, and the reported NPL ratio has declined to 2.6 percent, measured more
broadly to include NPLs sold to VAMC and loans previously restructured yields an impaired loan
ratio of about 12½ percent of total loans. This level of impaired loans is at the lower end of
estimates based on simple relationships between ROA, ROE, and NPLs for emerging and developing
countries.


The VAMC’s current operations lack resolution incentives. Banks provision against NPLs
sold to the VAMC over a 5–10 year period; they continue to manage the NPL after selling to the
VAMC; and they repurchase the NPL back from the VAMC at the end of the provisioning period. This
reduces incentives to resolve impaired loans quickly, and raises reported but not actual capital. The
VAMC is making little progress in restructuring or selling NPLs reflecting legal constraints on
collateral sale and restructuring, insufficient capacity, and inability to recognize losses. In contrast,
the Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC) purchases outright impaired assets with a haircut,
permanently removing them from banks’ balance sheets.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

VIETNAM


Efforts to attract foreign capital are complicated by limits on foreign ownership, limited
use of international accounting standards and thus transparency, and weakness in banks’
governance.
32.
The current strategy of allowing banks to recapitalize mainly via retained earnings will
take many years and is risky. While financial stability has improved recently with macroeconomic
stability and supportive liquidity conditions, banking-sector credit risk and potential stress from
rising sovereign indebtedness have increased (Box 6). As well, corporate sector performance has
deteriorated, particularly among SOEs, with potential for adverse impact on banks (Box 7). Higher
domestic interest rates—related to U.S. Federal Reserve tightening or adverse global macrofinancial
shocks—could exacerbate and mutually reinforce sovereign-banking-corporate risks.
33.
Staff recommended broadening reforms. Key elements include: accelerated NPL loss
recognition and resolution; recapitalization by existing shareholders, including budget resources for
state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs); stronger governance, operational and risk management,
and adoption of IFRS reporting; enhanced supervision of SOCBs and equitization to recover initial
budgetary recapitalization costs; and orderly resolution of unviable institutions. These efforts should
be supported by bank diagnostic assessments and legal reforms: (i) to improve the debt
enforcement and collection framework to facilitate collateral sales; and (ii) a specialized resolution
regime for financial institutions, including a framework for purchase and assumption transactions.
Based on official data, staff estimates recapitalization costs for public banks at around 2½ percent of
GDP. Although estimates for private banks suggest no immediate recapitalization needs in
aggregate, some banks have moved NPLs off-balance-sheet by establishing their own asset
management companies and capital needs for individual banks likely exist.
34.
The VAMC should accelerate resolution and sale of NPLs in its portfolio. To fulfill this
function and maximize recovery values through enhanced coordination and securitization, the
VAMC should be strengthened, permitted to recognize losses, and pass them along to participating
banks. Measures include more resources, development of valuation and securitization
methodologies, and legal protection for officials involved in the valuation of loans and collateral for
sale at market prices. Quantitative performance targets for NPL resolution should be established,
and agent bank oversight and incentives

The proposals to tighten
macroprudential policy are welcome, as
they focus on mitigating financial
stability risks, and implementation this
year is recommended. The proposed
increase in the LTD ratio for state-owned
banks would raise it above the average in

VIETNAM

middle-income countries. Given the lack of liquidity pressures, the increase should be forgone and
the LTD limit unified at 80 percent system-wide. More broadly, macroprudential measures should
focus on systemic risk and not be used for demand management. If rapid credit growth were to
continue despite the proposed measures, broader-based macroprudential tightening to mitigate the
build-up of credit risk would be warranted. To increase macroprudential policy effectiveness, a clear
communications strategy should be established, and consideration be given to publishing the
financial stability report.
36.
Building on progress made in strengthening the AML/CFT framework, the authorities
are encouraged to strengthen its implementation. Under the leadership of the national AML/CFT
committee, Vietnam addressed a number of the technical gaps highlighted in the 2009 APG mutual
evaluation report and 2010 FATF assessment. Going forward, the key challenge remains the effective
implementation of the framework commensurate with Vietnam’s ML/FT risks.
37.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s assessment and recommendations. In
particular, they agreed with the need to resolve impaired loans in banks and at the VAMC, and
recognized that legal constraints to resolve NPLs would need to be removed. They noted that if
favorable growth conditions continued the policy of restricting dividend payments at weak
performing banks would help build capital over the medium-term, though this would take years. The
authorities emphasized that using budget resources to recapitalize state-owned banks would be
difficult and current market conditions made attracting new private capital challenging, but they
agreed that that public recapitalization costs might be recovered through a strong and well
sequenced equitization program. They noted that their macroprudential framework would be
finalized soon, systemic risk supervision would be strengthened to ensure financial stability, and the
impact of the LTD ratio increase would be monitored carefully. To strengthen AML/CFT, a national
risk assessment was under preparation.

D. Structural Reforms: Adding Ingredients for High Sustained Inclusive
Growth
38.
Vietnam’s growth performance in recent years has been admirable, but it lagged that
of East Asia’s most successful high-growth countries when they were at a similar level of
development (Figures 1 and 2). As well, Vietnam’s working-age population share in the overall
population has started to decline, and in the longer term this demographic shift could become a
drag on growth. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth has declined by about 1½ percentage points
since the mid-2000s. Reversing the decline would be essential to achieve a higher, sustainable, and
inclusive growth plane.3 The potential for productivity gains from reallocation of labor is still large,

3

TFP gains should be achievable with structural reforms. See “Structural Reforms and Macroeconomic Performance;
Initial Considerations for the Fund”, IMF 2015.

with almost half the workforce in agriculture and three quarters employed at the household level,
both with very low productivity.
39.
Boosting productivity in domestic manufacturing, and in SOEs which absorb a
significant amount of capital, is critical. Output per worker in domestic manufacturing, which
includes SOEs, stands at little more than a fifth of that in foreign-invested enterprises. Integration
between the foreign-invested sector and domestic suppliers should be deepened to achieve
productivity spillovers and to internalize more production value.
40.
The state’s presence in the economy remains large and overall SOE reform has been
slow. Progress has been made on the legal framework for SOE reform including disclosure and
transparency requirements, strengthened supervisory capacity, divestment of non-core assets, and
defining a limited scope of state-ownership in the economy. However, the state maintains full
ownership of more than 700 SOEs, and they continue to enjoy preferential access to production
factors including capital and land. The simultaneous control and regulation of major SOEs by line
ministries and local governments creates conflicts of interest and is an obstacle to stronger
management.
41.
Reform of the SOE sector should be accelerated. Key elements include: faster and more
comprehensive equitization while ensuring due process; transparency of equitization proceeds and
their use; enforcement of disclosure and reporting requirements; governance reforms to address
conflicts of interests between regulation and SOE management along with strengthened
accountability; continued divestment from non-core areas; restructuring and eventual exit of
unprofitable SOEs; and the creation of a level playing field with the private sector by curtailing SOEs’
preferential access to credit and other resources. In addition, property rights and the enforcement of
competition policy need to be strengthened to encourage domestic private firms to scale up and
join the formal sector.4
42.
Improvements to the business environment are essential to nurture domestic private
business. Vietnam ranks 90th in the World Bank’s doing business report and scores low in indices of
governance quality. Further moves up the value chain are needed, supported by higher and more
targeted spending on research and development which is low compared to other countries in the
region controlling for the level of development. More efficient public investment to strengthen
infrastructure is also needed.
43.
Investment in human capital is paying off, but more could be done. Vocational training
should be expanded and secondary school attendance increased to address skills mismatches, and
health coverage further extended. Inequality in income and opportunities and gender gaps should
be addressed through targeted initiatives in education, nutrition and sanitation, and by extending
pensions in a financially sustainable manner. A strengthening of environmental policies is needed

for the sustainability of long-run growth in light of environmental challenges, including climate
change (Boxes 8 and 9).
44.
The authorities recognized the importance of accelerating SOE and structural reforms
for growth. They emphasized progress on the legal framework for SOE reform and improvements in
the business environment. They were planning faster reforms of the SOE sector in the 2016–20
period, including greater transparency and disclosure, accelerated equitization, and improved interagency coordination. State involvement in the economy would be limited to strategic sectors
defined in recent legislation. A list of SOEs that will remain in state ownership was under
preparation, and a roadmap to halve their number by 2020 was being developed.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Vietnam has achieved a commendable degree of macroeconomic stability and the
near-term outlook is broadly positive. Growth is projected to moderate somewhat this year due
to a severe drought and softer external demand, but is projected to remain around 6 percent with
underlying inflation contained and the current account broadly in balance. Strong FDI inflows are
expected to continue, in part reflecting optimism surrounding recent new trade agreements,
allowing for some rebuilding of reserves.
46.
Notwithstanding recent good performance, legacy risks and widening imbalances
create important challenges. Delayed fiscal consolidation has increased debt distress risk. The
banking sector requires more capital, impaired loans measured broadly are high particularly in the
context of rapid credit growth, and new NPLs could arise if this rapid growth were sustained. Tighter
or more volatile global financial conditions could re-ignite capital account pressures and erode
already low international reserves absent use of the new more flexible exchange-rate mechanism.
Weaker external demand could undermine export-oriented manufacturing, a key engine of growth.
47.
A second generation of reforms is needed to mitigate risks and raise the economy’s
growth potential. Medium-term growth will be challenged by low productivity in the domestic
economy, and demographic headwinds will emerge in the longer run. Against this backdrop, the
new government’s commitment to reforms is encouraging. Accelerating and broadening fiscal,
monetary, banking and structural reforms would place Vietnam in a sound position to achieve the
authorities’ medium-term growth target of 6½–7 percent.
48.
A growth-friendly fiscal consolidation is a high priority. Based on the authorities’ 2016
budget plan, which indicates no consolidation, public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to
increase to 62 percent of GDP. If fiscal consolidation over the medium term is modest, as in staff’s
baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would breach the authorities’ legal limit of 65 percent in
the coming years, and approach 70 percent in the medium term, raising the risk of debt distress.
49.
Fiscal consolidation should begin this year. The focus should be on structural revenueenhancing measures to make space for protecting social and infrastructure outlays and
recapitalizing state-owned banks. Reducing exemptions and incentives, raising fuel and environment
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

VIETNAM

taxes, unifying the VAT at 10 percent, introducing property, capital gains, and interest income taxes,
including pensions under personal income tax, and further strengthening revenue administration
would raise the revenue ratio back to its long-run average. Comprehensive civil service reform
would reduce the large public wage bill, and the efficiency of spending should be strengthened.
Directing all SOE equitization proceeds to deficit financing would enhance transparency and assist in
debt reduction. Over the medium term, reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, along with
structural and bank reforms to achieve sustained robust growth, would reduce debt distress risk.
50.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate and the adoption of a more flexible
exchange rate regime is commendable. With underlying inflation low and growth slowing,
monetary policy should remain on hold. The new more flexible exchange-rate regime should be
used to help buffer external shocks, and the accumulation of international reserves through
opportunistic intervention is appropriate. A gradual shift of the monetary policy framework toward
using inflation as the nominal anchor would support greater macroeconomic stability. A
comprehensive package of operational, communications and institutional reforms would support
this transition.
51.
Macroprudential policy tightening is appropriate given rapid credit growth. The 2016
credit growth targets are excessive. Allowing credit growth to moderate to below 15 percent would
reduce financial stability risks from future NPLs. In this context, the proposed tightening of risk
weights for real estate loans and prudential ratios for asset/liability mismatches is welcome, while
the proposed increase in the LTD ratio for state-owned banks should be forgone and LTD ratios
harmonized at 80 percent system-wide. If rapid credit were to continue despite these measures,
consideration would be warranted to broader-based macroprudential tightening to mitigate
potential future deterioration in banks’ asset quality.
52.
Some progress has been made in banking sector reform, but the overall approach of
slow provisioning and recapitalization through retained earnings is risky. Banking sector
profitability is low reflecting a high level of impaired assets. The VAMC is currently a warehouse for
NPLs with little scope to resolve, restructure, or sell them. Additional new capital is needed. In the
absence of broader reforms, the system will be susceptible to shocks for many years, raising risks
and potential public sector costs.
53.
Bolder efforts to restructure NPLs and recapitalize banks are necessary. Faster NPL
resolution is needed. At the same time, recapitalization by existing shareholders, including from the
budget for state-owned banks, stronger governance and risk management, adoption of IFRS, and
subsequent equitization of state-owned banks to offset initial budgetary recapitalization costs
would markedly enhance system soundness. These efforts should be flanked by further
improvements in supervision and bank diagnostic assessments, and legal reforms to improve the
frameworks for debt enforcement and collection, and bank resolution. The VAMC should be
permitted to recognize losses, in order to sell NPLs at market prices, and pass them along to banks.
It will also require more capital and staffing, development of valuation and securitization methods,
and better incentives and legal protection. Licenses to trade NPLs need to be made available to
banks and investors to create a market for NPLs.

54.
Accelerated SOE and structural reforms are needed to achieve a higher growth path.
Progress has been made on the legal framework for SOE reform, but implementation has been slow.
SOE reform oversight is fragmented, their presence in the economy remains large and stifles private
sector growth. Faster reforms should center on accelerated and more comprehensive equitization,
greater transparency and disclosure, strengthened governance, and the creation of a level playing
field with the private sector. Equitization proceeds and their use should be made transparent.
Structural reform priorities include a better business climate, more efficient infrastructure upgrading,
and further strengthening of human capital through better vocational and tertiary education.
55.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Vietnam: Trade Developments, TPP, and FTAs
Structural reforms are necessary to continue export success and ensure spillovers from the FDI sector
to the domestic economy.
Vietnam is among the world’s most open economies, with trade amounting to about 160 percent
of GDP. It has increased world export and import market shares roughly fivefold in the last
15 years. Export growth has been particularly strong in labor-intensive manufacturing of
apparel/footwear and, more recently, electronics. Vietnam has captured a larger market share of
global exports of major low-end manufacturing goods than any other country in recent years,
while China’s market share in this category has declined. Gains in final electronics export market
share have been similarly impressive, with only China achieving larger gains. As a result, Vietnam’s
export product mix has shifted from commodities to manufacturing. Geographically, exports are
diversified with the U.S., the EU, and other non-East-Asian countries accounting for about
20 percent each, while China and Japan account for just under 10 percent each.
Vietnam’s manufacturing export growth is largely driven by FDI with major inflows from Korea,
Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China. FDI inflows accelerated in the run-up to
Vietnam’s WTO accession in January 2007 from an annual average of US$2.5 billion from 2000–05
to an annual average of US$8.4 billion from 2008–14. The FDI sector’s share in Vietnam’s total
exports has reached 70 percent. Through multinational investments, Vietnam is embedded in
global and Asian supply chains. Analysis of gross and value added data shows that multinationals
tend to use Vietnam for final assembly with comparatively high foreign value added content.1
Accordingly, imports of intermediate and investment goods have been rising fast in recent years,
with China supplying ⅓ of imports.
Trade agreements and competitive wages have been key ingredients for Vietnam’s export success.
Import tariffs have been gradually reduced, while most quantity restrictions have been removed.
Vietnam has entered into a number of bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements.

Box 1. Vietnam: Trade Developments, TPP, and FTAs (concluded)
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is of particular importance. It has the potential to increase the
efficiency of domestic markets (services, SOEs, procurement), promote institutional convergence
and technology transfers, and lower the cost of capital. Partly because of its lower starting point,
Vietnam could be one of the biggest gainers, with estimates suggesting GDP could rise by a
cumulative 8 percent, and exports by 30 percent, by 2030 (TPP countries now account for
39 percent of Vietnam’s exports). TPP will provide opportunities to penetrate major markets
further and support FDI inflows if investors locate to Vietnam to access TPP markets. By
eliminating or reducing tariff lines on industrial and agricultural products, TPP could boost major
products in which Vietnam already enjoys advantages. Textile, apparel and footwear industries are
considered possible winners due to their well-established position in the global supply chain.
TPP’s strict regulations such as the “yarn forward” rules of origin2 could result in on-shoring of
textile and other input manufacturing, reducing the sector’s heavy dependence on imports from
China and improving the trade position. Seafood and agriculture exports could also benefit. On
the other hand, the livestock and dairy industries could face difficulties due to lower cost
competitiveness and a phasing out of import duties.
Increasing productivity is one of the many challenges that Vietnam must respond to when
implementing TPP. While foreign-invested enterprises perform well, Vietnam’s domestic sector
lacks competitiveness, as reflected in a sizable domestic-sector trade deficit. In particular, SOE
reform will be a priority challenge for Vietnam, as TPP requires SOEs to operate on market
principles, with a level playing field for regulations, subsidies, and investments, and improved
transparency. TPP does, however, allow Vietnam to provide a one-time capital injection to SOEs
for restructuring. Another challenge will be protection of labor rights in areas where Vietnam has
not ratified ILO conventions. Finally, the elimination of tariff lines will have an adverse fiscal
impact. Vietnam’s average tariff is around 9½ percent, and trade revenues currently amount to
2½ percent of GDP. About 65 percent of Vietnam’s import tariff lines (for TPP members) will be
eliminated upon commencement, 85 percent four years later and 98 percent after a decade. For
trading partners’ tariff lines on Vietnam’s exports, 80 to 95 percent will be eliminated on
commencement, focused on agriculture, fisheries, textile and apparel products, footwear, wooden
furniture, electrical, electronics, and rubber.

The rules require Vietnam to use a TPP member-produced yarn in textiles in order to receive duty-free access to
TPP member markets. As of now, Vietnam depends heavily on China—not a TPP member—for yarn and textile
materials.

Box 2. Vietnam: External Assessment
No clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment exists, but international reserves are below desirable levels.
The real effective rate has appreciated strongly since 2011, when
the external current account balance swung into surplus on the
back of growing trade surpluses by foreign-invested enterprises
(FIEs), and a narrowing domestic sector trade deficit. Since early2015, the dong has appreciated in real effective terms by around
4 percent as the U.S. dollar has strengthened. This occurred
despite three 1-percent step devaluations and the move toward
a more flexible regime.
The external balance assessment (EBA), undertaken using the
EBA-Lite tool, provides no clear evidence of misalignment. The
EBA-Lite current account analysis indicates a current account
norm of -6.2 percent of GDP, suggesting that the real exchange
rate is undervalued by around 11½ percent. The equilibrium real
exchange rate (REER) approach, on the other hand, points to
substantial overvaluation of about 23 percent. However, the two
models show a very weak fit with Vietnam’s current account and
REER respectively, due to the fact that they do not account for
the segmented nature of the trade sector. A staff-estimated
model—that demonstrates a stronger fit with the current
account, particularly recent years’ data—leads to a current
account norm of 0.3 percent of GDP, suggesting a small
undervaluation of around 0.3 percent.

Capital and financial flows have been dominated by foreign
direct investment (FDI) inflows and short-term capital outflows.
FDI continued rising in 2015, mainly to the export-orientated
manufacturing sector. Short-term capital outflows surged
beginning in mid-2015, significantly reducing the financial
account, but reversed in early 2016. Finally, external borrowing
has slowly increased reflecting slightly higher private and
publicly-guaranteed debt.

Regional Comparison of Reserve Indicators, 2015

Vietnam’s international reserves increased in the period up to
mid-2015, but declined quite sharply thereafter due to
intervention. They were around 2 months of imports of goods
and services at end-2015, well under the nine months average of
regional emerging market countries. According to the IMF
reserve adequacy metric they are below the minimum level
desirable for a fixed exchange rate regime, but would be
considered in the adequate range if greater use was made of the
new more flexible exchange-rate regime.

Box 3. Vietnam: Public Spending Efficiency
Public spending on health has been efficient, while room exists to improve the efficiency of education and
capital spending.
Vietnam’s spending on education is high by regional standards and health spending is in line with
the regional average, but its stock of public capital is relatively low. Public spending in 2015 on
education was 4.5 percent of GDP and on health 1.7 percent of GDP. This compares to regional averages
over 2007–11 of 3.0 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP, respectively. In the area of capital spending,
Vietnam lags, with public capital stock per capita at US$2,472 (in PPP terms), much lower than the
regional average of US$6,504.
Spending outcomes vary by different spending categories. Using health life expectancy at birth
(HALE) as an indicator, Vietnam ranks high versus regional peers (see chart).1 Results of a 2010 survey on
education attainment suggest that the average years of total schooling in Vietnam have increased, to
above regional low-income countries, and just below more advanced regional peers. Infrastructure
quality is slightly ahead of regional LICs, but below EMs in the region.

Expenditure efficiency is measured using a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Under SFA, a
production function is estimated with individual public spending items as major explanatory variables
and outcomes related to each spending item as dependent variables. The estimation provides a
composite error term, which includes both an idiosyncratic error (due to random variation) and a onesided disturbance error term. The latter measures the inefficiency of spending, and the efficiency score is
thus calculated as the actual outcome divided by the estimated outcome.2

(PPP) over 2000-2011, real public spending on education per capita (PPP) over 2000-09, and real public capital stock per capita in 2011
are used as input variables. All regressions are controlled with starting values of outcomes in the sample period.

Vietnam ranks high in health spending efficiency versus most countries. This is likely related to the
government’s efforts to expand health coverage in the last two decades. However, there is scope to
improve. Around 60 percent of Vietnam’s population is covered under social health insurance. Efforts are
needed to expand coverage for the remaining population, most of whom work in the informal sector, and
to improve overall financial protection by containing out-of-pocket spending.3
Efficiency scores show that public education spending has room to improve, although there are
caveats to the results. Average years of schooling have increased, although not by as much as could
have been expected given the high levels of spending. Improved vocational and practical skills are
needed to reduce skills mismatches. At the same time, 2012 PISA results show the system is producing
good fundamental skills.4 More advanced skills, including critical thinking and problem solving, are also
needed.5 As the population ages and the demographic dividend subsides, Vietnam’s workforce will need
such skills to improve labor productivity and shift from lower to higher value added activities.
Improvements in public capital spending efficiency are needed to help narrow the infrastructure
gap. Efficiency scores in public capital spending are below the average of low-income economies, using
both quality of transport infrastructure and quality of electricity supply service to evaluate spending
outcomes. Closer integration between strategic planning and capital budgeting, while strengthening
institutions related to project implementation, would improve investment efficiency. The new public
investment and enterprise laws enacted in 2014 could be a good start.

Box 4. Vietnam: A Macro-Model Approach to Forecasting and Monetary Policy Analysis
Shifting to inflation as the nominal anchor for monetary policy while allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility would increase macroeconomic stability.
A stochastic general equilibrium model is estimated for
Vietnam to analyze different monetary and exchange
rate policies through a consistent framework that
formally models and clarifies transmission
mechanisms, measures policy stances and allows
forecasting given policy actions.1 The model consists of
four structural equations for Vietnam—an aggregate
demand equation, a Phillips curve, a monetary policy
rule and an exchange rate parity relation—and a block
of external economies. The model is estimated using
Bayesian techniques on quarterly Vietnamese data
over 2000–14.

relatively large, and stresses the importance of an active monetary policy that “stays ahead of the
curve” to maintain inflation stability.
An optimal monetary policy rule that jointly minimizes the
variability of output, inflation, and the exchange rate is also
determined. The optimal rule places a greater weight on the
output gap in the reaction function than does the baseline
rule. In model simulations, the optimal monetary policy
function delivers greater macroeconomic stability—reduced
inflation and output variability—compared to the model
using the baseline reaction function, while allowing a small
increase in exchange rate variability. Under the optimal rule,
monetary policy is more active, and it uses the output gap
as an intermediate target to achieve a greater degree of
inflation stability than has been achieved in Vietnam’s recent past, while allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility to absorb shocks.

Box 5. Vietnam: Inflation as a Nominal Anchor for Monetary Policy
As Vietnam allows greater exchange rate flexibility, preparations for gradually shifting to inflation as monetary
policy’s nominal anchor will require upgrading operational, communications and institutional frameworks.
Maintaining low and stable inflation is key to entrench macroeconomic stability and achieve sustained
improvements in the livelihood of Vietnam’s population. A framework that pursues multiple objectives—real
growth, inflation, the exchange rate, credit growth—is opaque, complicates policy formulation, reduces
policy effectiveness, and has the potential to confuse markets, investors and consumers, particularly when
these targets come under conflicting pressure. Vietnam’s recent move toward more exchange-rate flexibility
is a step in the right direction, and broader reforms are now needed.
Measures to strengthen monetary policy operations: Establish an interest rate corridor as an operational
instrument (300 b.p. width), with the rate at the collateralized overnight credit facility as the ceiling and that
of the overnight deposit facility as the floor.






Shift the corridor to signal changes in the stance of monetary policy. Give policy decisions enough time
to work as they affect prices with a lag. Adjustments should be forward looking.
Rely upon open market operations complemented with standing facilities to implement liquidity
management. Strengthen liquidity forecasting to help reduce volatility in the interbank market.
Phase out the use of administrative measures (interest rate ceilings and credit targets) to manage
liquidity, since they fuel uncertainty in the market and constrain the transmission of changes in policy
interest rates to economic activity and inflation.
Adopt the overnight interbank rate as the operational target for monetary policy. The rate should be
guided to the center of the interest rate corridor using fine-tuning liquidity management operations.

Measures to strengthen communications:

Design a communications strategy and unit. Build credibility by communicating well to help align
market expectations around the SBV’s primary objective of maintaining low and stable inflation as a
means to achieve macroeconomic stability.

Explain the rationale behind the SBV’s framework for monetary policy. Clearly communicate the roles of
inflation, exchange rate, liquidity management, the interest rate corridor, and broadly what market
participants expect of the SBV’s policy reaction function.

Make the policies of SBV and its decisions more predictable for market participants to help reduce
macroeconomic volatility and align variables faster around the SBV’s target.
Measures to improve economic analysis, forecasting, and policy formulation:

Improve data quality and management, including of quarterly GDP expenditure; surveys of confidence,
inflation expectations, and capacity utilization.

Strengthen current economic analysis and short-term forecasting, including use of the FPAS model.
Develop a suite of analytical tools and capacity to strengthen medium-term modeling and forecasting.
Measures to strengthen the institutional framework:

Propose a suitable inflation target over a long-term horizon to be agreed upon with the government
and set low inflation as the primary policy objective in the SBV law. If the law cannot be changed, a
signed agreement between the SBV and the Government should be undertaken to establish inflation
stability as the SBV’s primary objective.

Over time, designate to the SBV sole responsible for policy implementation. Separate the role of
Governor and that of cabinet member and use an appointment term independent from the political
calendar.

Provide for the SBV’s financial autonomy, accountability and transparency, but require the SBV to
disclose information and be transparent with respect to its policy decisions as well as with the
management of its budget.

Box 6. Vietnam: Financial Stability Assessment
High credit risks stemming from weak corporates, undercapitalized banks and rapidly rising public debt should be
addressed to safeguard financial stability.
The Financial Stability Assessment provides a framework to monitor, aggregate and put into historical context
data that has been found to describe macro-financial risks.1 Four broad risks (macroeconomic, inward
spillovers, credit, and market and funding liquidity) and two conditions (monetary and financial conditions, and
risk appetite) are analyzed. Indicator values are ranked relative to their own past values from 0 to 10 for every
quarter, with 0 representing the lowest first percentile of risk and 10 representing the 99th percentile of risk. A
ranking of 5 broadly corresponds to the long-term average. The assessment for Vietnam is customized,
including by using policy choice variables rather than averages in standardizing some indicators to avoid
distortions from historical outliers, and omitting some variables that have no bearing on Vietnam.
The assessment captures past risks and conditions well. Vietnam experienced two major episodes of
macroeconomic and financial instability in recent years, in 2008 and 2011. The 2008 episode was preceded by
very easy monetary/financial conditions and high-risk appetite and resulted in high domestic macroeconomic,
credit, and banking risks. The 2011 episode followed domestic stimulus that led to a rapid credit expansion
against a backdrop of already depleted policy buffers and a weak external environment. In subsequent years,
the authorities’ efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability, including through tighter monetary and financial
conditions, led to a normalization of a number of risks.
At end-2014, macroeconomic, inward
spillover, and market/liquidity risks had fallen

Box 7. Vietnam: Corporate Debt and Implications for Bank Asset Quality
Corporate performance in Vietnam has deteriorated in recent years, particularly in SOEs, with
potential for higher NPL ratios in the banking sector.1
Corporations’ profitability has declined and leverage has increased. This combination has
significantly reduced corporations' debt service capacity and is reflected in an increasing share of
firms whose debt is at risk (DAR), i.e., with an interest coverage ratio (ICR) below one.2 DAR began
increasing in 2011, when profitability declined, with the sharpest increases taking place in stateowned enterprises (SOEs) (see figures).

Corporations’ ability to service debt would deteriorate even further if earnings growth were
to weaken, funding costs to surge, or with currency depreciation.3 Stress tests suggest that a
200 bps increase in funding costs—possibly driven by higher interest rates in mature markets
and/or a widening of emerging market spreads—would have a significant negative effect on ICR,
resulting in an increase in the share of debt-at-risk of the entire corporate sector to 25 percent
from 15 percent. If corporate earnings were to decline by 10 percent—possible if growth in key
trading partners were to weaken—the share of debt-at-risk would increase to 19 percent. A
weakening of the Vietnamese dong by 10 percent would raise the share of debt-at-risk to
22 percent.

Corporates include only nonfinancial firms.

ICR is calculated as earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by total interest expense. An ICR of less than one means a
firm is unable to service its debt without adjustment, such as reducing operating costs, drawing down cash reserves, or
borrowing more.

Box 7. Vietnam: Corporate Debt and Implications for Bank Asset Quality (Concluded)
The banking system is exposed to potential losses from weak corporate performance. This
exposure is estimated as follows.4 First, firm-level ICRs are mapped into probabilities of default
(PDs) over the two years following the base year, using historical default rates of companies with
similar ICR levels compiled by Moody’s. Second, the aggregate PD of corporate debt owed to
banks in the sample is calculated using the average PDs weighted by the share of each firm’s debt
in total corporate debt. The aggregate loss rate is obtained by multiplying the aggregate PD by a
65 percent loss given default (LGD) ratio, to reflect uncertainties about collateral valuations.5 The
results suggest that NPLs for the corporate debt contained in the sample would rise to around
13 percent. This would increase those banks’ NPL ratio by around 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points. If
the sample results were indicative of all corporate debt owed to banks, the system-wide NPL ratio
would rise by between 5 and 7 percentage points from the current official rate of just under
3 percent.6 Provisioning against such additional NPLs would weaken the system-wide capital
adequacy ratio by 3¼ and 4½ percentage points, respectively.

Rapid growth has occurred without a significant increase in inequality. Inequality in incomes
and opportunities was spurred by changing patterns of employment away from agriculture, and
from low-skill to higher-skill jobs. The Gini coefficient rose from 36 in 1992 to 43 in 2010 (0 =
perfect equality), but it eased thereafter, to 39 in 2012, comparable to that of other middleincome countries in the region.

Box 8. Vietnam: Social and Environmental Issues (Concluded)
Ethnic minority inequality is a persistent challenge. Although Vietnam’s ethnic minority groups
make up less than 15 percent of the population, they accounted for almost one half of the poor in
2010 (latest data), with a poverty rate at around 67 percent. Geographically, ethnic poverty is
concentrated in the north-west and mid-highland regions of Vietnam.
Basic education outcomes are strong. Vietnam ranked well above most developed countries in
science, mathematics and reading in the latest OECD Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA) survey of 15-year olds. This is explained in part by long-term plans and
dedicated budgets for education. Education spending amounts to around 4.5 percent of GDP
(22 percent of current expenditure). However, Vietnam faces challenges similar to many middleincome economies. Although primary education enrollment is high, secondary and tertiary
education enrollment lags, particularly in rural areas.
Youth unemployment is three times the overall rate. Despite strong basic education, the
official unemployment rate for youths has risen to around 7¼ percent, compared to 2½ percent
overall. In part this reflects skills mismatches and unmet needs for vocational and practical skills.
To cope, many companies choose to train systematically most of their new employees, adding
costs compared to experienced candidates. Notwithstanding, an abundance of labor and
relatively low productivity has kept wages competitive relative to neighboring countries—less
than half those in China in manufacturing.
According to the Germanwatch climate risk index, Vietnam was the 7th (of 181) most
affected country by climatic disasters between 1994 and 2013. The index quantifies the
impact of extreme weather events during the last two decades, both in terms of fatalities as well
as economic losses, relative each country’s income. Its population density, location and
geography—a long coast line and large river deltas—combined with the significant role of
agriculture in the economy exposes the country to significant climate risks. Global warming and
increased extreme weather events could have major negative impacts on rice and livestock
production, possibly lowering the level of output by two to four percent by 2050 (ADB estimate).
The transport, energy and water sectors could also be adversely affected by storm damage to
infrastructure while higher temperatures and droughts would increase demand for energy and
water.

Vietnam performs generally better than similarly developed countries on gender equality.
According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, it surpasses peers in
measures of economic opportunity, while scores in education and health are similar to that of
other lower middle-income countries. In general, Vietnam’s scores have not improved significantly
in the last decade, while many countries at the same stage of development have successfully
established more gender equality. As a result, Vietnam has lost ground from earlier progress and
slipped in the Gender Gap rankings (83rd in 2015).
Vietnamese women tend to have better access to economic opportunities compared to
women in peer countries, but achievements in this sector remain mediocre. A positive
development has been the sharp improvement of the female-to–male income ratio from
70 percent in 2007 to 83 percent in 2015. This represents the 19th-highest ratio, out of the
145 sample countries. However, according to a survey conducted in 2015, the perception of wage
equality for similar jobs was only 60 percent.1 In addition, the share of women in the labor force
has recently decreased slightly, although it remains high at 92 percent. As a result of these factors,
Vietnam’s score in economic opportunity has dropped in 2015 compared to 2007.
The education gap has narrowed but is still not closed. Female primary enrollment and literacy
rates are high and on a par with male rates. However, disparities are still visible in primary
education completion and secondary-and-above enrolment rates. For instance, only 40 percent of
PhD graduates are female. To address this issue, the Ministry of Education and Training is
implementing a comprehensive renovation of the education system with the goal to ensure
gender equality in curriculum and textbooks.

Box 9. Vietnam: Gender Equality (Concluded)
The women’s health and survival indicator, although very close to equality, has recently
fallen. In part, this is explained by a declining sex ratio at birth (0.9 female/male ratio in 2015). The
two-child policy (although loosely enforced), in a context of male-favoring traditions, has possibly
favored an attitude of “son preference”. Additionally, adolescent fertility is rising, with around
40 births per 1,000 women aged between 15 and 19 in 2014 (against 30 in 2007), and women are
vulnerable to domestic violence.2, 3
Women political empowerment has been subdued in the last decade and Vietnam slipped
well below peers’ level. The share of women in parliament has stagnated since 2007, while other
countries were generally able to improve gender equality in politics. In 2007, Vietnam’s share of
women occupying ministerial positions was similar to the sample average, at 13 percent. In 2015,
there were 9 percent of Vietnamese female ministers, while the sample average had reached
25 percent.
The authorities have made significant efforts in promoting gender equality through policy
measures, but implementation and enforcement remains a challenge. In addition to gender
equality guarantees in the Constitution, milestone laws include the Law of Gender Equality (2006)
and the Law on Prevention and Control of Domestic Violence (2007). President Sang publicly
stated Vietnam’s commitment to narrowing the gender gap across all sectors, while improving
access of women—especially those in disadvantaged areas—to health care, education and
employment. The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality (NSGE) was approved for the
period 2011–20 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socioeconomic development of the country. However, laws have been difficult to enforce and
institutions face challenges in awareness raising, reporting, gender analysis, collection of sexdisaggregated data and monitoring.

Appendix I. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Vietnam’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt has risen by 16 percentage points of GDP in
the last five years, mainly in domestic currency, to 58¼ percent of GDP in 2015. It is projected to
reach around 67½ percent in 2021 while gross financing needs are forecast to remain around
10 percent of GDP over the medium term. Debt sustainability risks have climbed and Vietnam’s
debt is particularly vulnerable to primary balance slippage. Realization of contingent liabilities
from bank restructuring could increase debt by 2½ percent of GDP, raising sustainability risk even
further absent policy adjustment. These factors stress the need for fiscal consolidation to reverse the
upward trend of debt accumulation. External debt is expected to increase in the short run and
stabilize at moderate levels.
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is
used to assess Vietnam’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt
structure. The framework uses a risk-based approach and expands upon the basic DSA to
include: (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions and the projected fiscal
adjustment; (ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt profile; (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a
stochastic debt projection taking into account past macro-fiscal volatility; and (v) a
standardized summary of risks in a heat map. This DSA also examines the implications of
implementation risks by considering a no-adjustment scenario.
Coverage. The DSA is performed on the public and publicly guaranteed debt and external
debt. In addition to the central government, the analysis covers State Owned Enterprises
(SOEs) and Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs), limited to the debt guaranteed by the
government. Local government debt is included in the public debt.
Macro-fiscal assumptions. Using the baseline scenario, growth slows from 6.7 percent in
2015 to a projected 6.1 percent in 2016, and stabilizes at 6.2 percent thereafter. In the baseline,
staff projects a primary fiscal deficit of 4.4 percent in 2016. The deficit is assumed to decline
marginally over the medium-term.
Choice of framework. Vietnam’s relatively high public debt and its upward trend—rising
toward the 70 percent of GDP DSA threshold for emerging market economies—call for using
the more detailed version (higher scrutiny) of the new DSA framework. This analysis gives a
more in-depth assessment of specific risks to debt sustainability.
Realism of baseline assumptions.
 The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2006–14 is fairly small, at
-0.6 percent, showing no evidence of systematic projection bias that could undermine the
assessment.
 The median forecast error for the primary balance of -1.3 percent suggests that projections
have been slightly optimistic, but they remain within the interquartile range (25–75).
 GDP deflator outcomes have historically been higher than projected.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

VIETNAM

Cross-country experience suggests that the baseline fiscal adjustment is feasible. The threeyear adjustment in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projected period is
1.5 percent and is assumed to be achieved mainly through expenditure reduction.
Public debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, Public and Publicly Guaranteed (PPG)
debt is projected to increase in the short run and stabilize at around 67½ percent of GDP by
2021 breaching the government ceiling of 65 percent of GDP in 2018. Most of Vietnam’s debt
has medium to long-term maturity and the share of foreign currency-dominated debt is
projected to decrease from 47¾ percent of total debt in 2015 to 44 percent in 2021.
The constant primary balance scenario shows that, if the deficit were to remain at the 2016
level, PPG debt would not stabilize in the medium term and reach about 74¼ percent of GDP
by 2021. On the other hand, the historical scenario— in which real GDP growth, the primary
balance and real interest rates are set at their historical average—leads to a decrease in PPG
debt, to 62 percent of GDP in 2021. Macro-fiscal stress tests suggest that Vietnam is vulnerable
to primary balance shocks. Under a scenario of a primary balance worsening in 2017–18 (by
1¼ percentage points of GDP), PPG debt would surpass the 70 percent threshold in 2021
(70½ percent of GDP). A real interest rate shock would also push PPG debt over the threshold
while the impacts of the other macro-fiscal shocks are more limited.
Probability distributions from a dynamic simulation of debt sustainability under an array of
macroeconomic shocks show a 25 percent chance that PPG debt could reach about 80 percent
of GDP under a worst-case scenario, while a combination of positive shocks would help reduce
the debt-to-GDP ratio under 55 percent with a 25 percent probability.
Heat map. The heat map shows moderate risk of debt distress. However, the gross-financingneeds-to-GDP ratio remains below the 15 percent threshold under all shocks. Finally, the
assessment highlights possible risks in the Vietnam debt profile, notably in terms of market
perception, external financing and foreign currency debt.
External debt sustainability. Vietnam’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase in
the short run but remain at a moderate level. The main reasons for the increase are the
deterioration of the current account balance and the rise of private external borrowing.
External debt is estimated at about 43 percent of GDP in 2015 with gross external financing
about 7 percent of GDP.
Under the baseline, external debt would stabilize at 46½ percent of GDP as gross external
financing needs stabilize, in line with the projected improvement of the current account and
increased FDI inflows from recently signed trade agreements (including TPP). However,
Vietnam’s external debt is vulnerable to real depreciation and current-account shocks. Growth
and interest rate shocks have only limited impact on the external debt dynamics.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees, defined as SOEs.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement
The exchange rate arrangement is classified as defacto stabilized. The de jure arrangement is
managed floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) is gradually increasing exchange-rate flexibility.
In August 2015 it widened the VND/USD trading band to +/-3 percent from +/-1 percent while
devaluing the central parity by one percent. In January 2016 it announced the VND/USD rate would
be adjusted daily rate based on: (i) the previous day’s weighted average dong/USD exchange rate;
(ii) a weighted average of movements in dong exchange rates vis-à-vis seven other important
trading partners’ currencies; and (iii) domestic macroeconomic conditions.

RELATIONS AND COLLABORATION WITH THE WORLD
BANK GROUP1
(As of April 25, 2016)
Partnership in Vietnam's Development Strategy
The current World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Vietnam was presented to the Board
of Directors in December 2011 and adjusted through the Performance and Learning Review in
March 2015. The CPS is aligned with Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011–
15 and sets out the World Bank’s planned support for Vietnam between FY12 and mid-FY17. The
CPS program supports investments and policies organized into a strategic framework of three pillars
and three cross-cutting themes. The pillars are: (i) strengthening Vietnam's competitiveness in the
regional and global economy, (ii) increasing the sustainability of its development, and
(iii) broadening access to opportunity. Key cross-cutting themes are: (i) strengthening governance;
(ii) supporting gender equity; and (iii) improving resilience in the face of external economic shocks,
natural hazards, and the impact of climate change. 1
An underlying theme in the CPS is the importance of building on the country's strong track record
of growth and poverty reduction to partner with Vietnam in its effort to achieve success as a middleincome country (MIC). The CPS program supports reforms for Vietnam’s multiple transitions,
notably, from an agrarian economy toward one that is more urban and industrialized; from a focus
on quantity toward a greater focus on quality of production and service provision; and from a factor
driven to an efficiency driven economy.
World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group uses a broad range of instruments including development policy financing,
program for results (PforR) and investment project financing, and advisory services and analytics; the
IFC’s equity, loan, and technical assistance (TA) participations and the Mekong Private Sector
Development Facility (MPDF); and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) activities. The
World Bank Group cooperates with various development partners partnerships and takes and an
active role in ODA coordination.
Scale of the World Bank Group program: The WB Program is large, with a significant new IDA
Allocation amounting to US$3.6 billion under IDA17. The program has grown and diversified over
the past several years. As of April 20, 2016, the portfolio consisted of 45 IDA/IBRD operations and
seven stand-alone Global Environment Facility (GEF), Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), and large Recipient
Executed Trust Funds (RETF) projects, with the total net commitments of US$9.0 billion. Vietnam
became an IDA/IBRD blend country in FY10. So far, IBRD resources of US$2.9 billion have been used

to finance two DPO series, an expressway, a transmission and distribution project, and a hydropower project. International Finance Corporation (IFC) commitments totaled US$1.97 billion over the
three-year period of FY14–FY16, including mobilization through its asset management business and
commercial banks.
Lending program: The World Bank has a diverse lending program supporting infrastructure, rural
development, human resources, and improvement in economic and financial sector management.
Support to infrastructure includes energy generation, transmission and distribution; rural and
national road development and inland waterways; water supply and wastewater treatment, irrigation
systems rehabilitation, and natural resources management. The program also supports development
of health systems to ensure increased access to quality health services and education quality
improvements. The lending instrument is also diverse, with the bulk provided through investment
finance and selected development policy finance operations. Key elements of economic
management support include a multi-year development policy loan linked to reforms on economic
management and competitiveness, tax system reform, and development and modernization of
public financial management and financial systems. Since the first Program for Results operation for
Vietnam was approved in support of Vietnam’s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program in FY13,
the number of PforRs have grown and two more PforR operations are currently under preparation.

Knowledge program: The World Bank supports the government’s efforts to strengthen institutional
capacity through its extensive program of analytical and advisory services. Especially in the context
of Vietnam’s transition to upper middle income status the partnership with the Bank is evolving and
generating knowledge and sharing global experiences is becoming even more important. In 2014
the Government of Vietnam invited the World Bank to jointly prepare the Vietnam 2035 report
which aims to identify policy reforms to achieve Vietnam’s long term development aspiration of
sustaining rapid growth and social inclusion. While reflecting Vietnam’s remarkable development
trajectory, the report identifies emerging structural constraints to the existing mostly factor driven
growth model, including stagnating labor productivity growth and rising investment inefficiency.
The report lays out an ambitious reform agenda structured around three pillars: (i) balancing
economic prosperity with environmental sustainability, (ii) promoting equity and social inclusion and
(iii) bolstering the state’s capacity and accountability. Other recent reports include a study of low
carbon development prospects and a public expenditure review, which examines major fiscal trends
of the last decade. In addition, work is underway on Vietnam Development Report on Transforming
Vietnamese Agriculture and on a Systematic Country Diagnostic which will lay the analytical
foundation for identifying the Bank’s priorities during the upcoming preparation of the new Country
Partnership Framework (2016-21). In addition, the World Bank continues to provide technical
assistance in areas such as governance, social protection, renewable energy, climate change
adaptation, financial sector reform, public financial management and debt management.

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Vietnam
Specific Areas: Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004, the two institutions have closely
collaborated on monitoring the macroeconomic situation and routinely exchanging views on
macroeconomic and fiscal management as well as key structural reforms, such as SOE and banking
sector reforms. The two institutions consult during Article IV consultations in order to share
information and help coordinate on key policy messages. The IMF has provided macroeconomic
assessment letters in support of Economic Management and Competitiveness development policy
operations. Building on joint IMF and World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
which was completed during 2012–13, joint work has continued in supporting central bank
operations, with the IMF providing TA on monetary policy and operations, and both the World Bank
and IMF providing support on banking supervision. In the areas of fiscal management, the World
Bank and the IMF are coordinating the policy dialogue on fiscal consolidation and debt
sustainability, including on policy options to enhance resource mobilization and improve the
efficiency of public spending. Finally, the IMF and the World Bank also collaborate in the
development and timely dissemination of reliable economic and financial statistics. The IMF focuses
on improving balance of payments, national accounts, price, and government finance statistics,
while the World Bank provides assistance on issues related to the production of high-quality
household and enterprise surveys and facilitate the implementation of National Gender Indicators
System.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of April 30, 2016)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working in partnership with the Government of
Vietnam—a 1966 founding member of ADB—since the resumption of operations in 1993. ADB’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2012–2015 is fully aligned with the Socio-Economic
Development Plan (SEDP), 2011–2015, and supports issues arising from Vietnam’s recent transition
to a middle-income country. The CPS focuses ADB assistance to Vietnam through three pillars of
inclusive growth, enhancing economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. To maximize
ADB’s development impacts, ADB prioritizes six sectors: (i) agriculture and natural resources;
(ii) education; (iii) energy; (iv) finance; (v) transport; and (vi) water supply, and other municipal
infrastructure and services. Public sector management is crosscutting and mainstreamed in terms of
sector operations through reform and policy-oriented support.
ADB is supporting the implementation of structural reforms that increase competitiveness and assist
Vietnam in transitioning to become an upper middle-income country. This includes lending
assistance and policy dialogue on financial sector and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform issues.
To increase the efficiency of public expenditure and improve the quality of infrastructure and public
services ADB is also working with government to strengthen fiscal and budgetary management.
Vietnam is one of the largest concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) recipients, with projected
ADF allocation of US$733.6 million for 2015–2016. Ordinary capital resources (OCR) are also actively
being used for projects with higher rates of return, such as infrastructure, which had an allocation of
US$326 million in 2016 (Table 1).
From October 1993 until December 31, 2015, ADB has provided 157 sovereign loans totaling
US$14.4 billion, 296 technical assistance grant projects amounting to US$276.61 million and 35
grant projects totaling US$318 million to Vietnam (Tables 2–4). As a catalyst for private investments,
ADB also provides direct financial assistance to nonsovereign public sector and private sector
projects in the form of direct loans, equity investments, guarantees, B loans, and trade finance. Since
its inception to end-2015, ADB has approved a total of US$280 million in non-sovereign financing
for Vietnam, all of which was for seven private sector projects. ADB’s Trade Finance Program (TFP)
fills market gaps in trade finance by providing guarantees and loans through over 200 partner banks
in support of trade. The TFP has supported US$16 billion in trade involving almost 6,500 small and
medium-sized enterprises. In Vietnam, the TFP works with twelve banks and has supported over
US$4.7 billion in trade between 3,200 transactions by almost 2,000 small- and medium-sized
enterprises. In addition to filling market gaps, the TFP’s objective is to mobilize private sector
capital/ involvement in developing Asia. In Vietnam, over 69 percent of the US$3.6 billion in trade
supported through the TFP was co-financed by the private sector. Vietnam also receives substantial
support under the Greater Mekong Sub-region initiatives, involving Cambodia, China, Lao P.D.R.,
Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. As part of its regular operations, ADB coordinates closely with

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

Vietnam’s development partners to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of its lending
and nonlending programs. ADB also works closely with civil society organizations and the private
sector in Vietnam to mobilize financial resources and expertise from other partners. ADB is an active
member of the the Six Banks Initiative—comprising ADB, Agence Française de Développement
(AFD), KfW, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Export Import Bank of Korea, and the World
Bank. Co-financing operations enable ADB’s financing partners, governments or their agencies,
multilateral financing institutions, and commercial organizations, to participate in the financing of
ADB projects. The additional funds are provided in the form of official loans and grants, and
commercial financing, such as B loans, risk transfer arrangements, parallel loans, and co-financing
for transactions under ADB’s TFP. As of December 31, 2015, cumulative direct value-added official
co-financing for Vietnam amounted to US$4.63 billion for 56 investment projects and
US$102.9 million for 83 co-financing technical assistance projects. The ADB and IMF staffs
coordinate through ad hoc information exchange information on policy matters.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 4, 2016)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: financial sector, national accounts, government finance, and external sector
statistics.
National accounts: The General Statistics Office (GSO) provides quarterly (cumulative) and annual
data on GDP by type of economic activity and by expenditure (both in current and constant prices),
and monthly and annual data on external trade, industrial output, retail sales, and prices. The GSO
recently rebased the national accounts to 2010 as the base year from 1994. While the national
accounts methodologies are broadly consistent with the SNA93, the data collection practices and
coordination between data collection agencies could be strengthened. The latest National Accounts
technical assistance mission made the following recommendations: (i) adoption of labor input
methods to improve the coverage of the nonobserved economy, (ii) estimation of capital stock,
consumption of fixed capital and change in inventories, (iii) allocation of financial intermediation
services indirectly measured (FISIM), (iv) expansion of production and asset boundaries according to
1993/2008 SNA, (v) use of the supply-use framework to ensure consistency between production and
expenditure GDP data, and (vi) the use of double deflation methods for constant price estimates.
Prices statistics: The CPI methodology is largely in line with international standards. However, there
is only a notional inclusion of owner-occupied and rental housing. Also, there is a need to adopt a
geometric mean of price relatives at the lower level of aggregation, instead of the upward biased
arithmetic mean. Trade price indices are also compiled, but not used in the national accounts. The
GSO has developed a work program with assistance of Fund TA to improve the accuracy of the
consumer, producer and trade price indices, and is working toward the development of construction
and services price indices.
Government finance statistics: Government operations data reflect the consolidated operations of
the state budget, which cover all four levels of government (central, provincial, district, and
commune). However, data exclude quasi fiscal activities of the central bank (and state-owned
enterprises (SOEs)), and extra-budgetary funds, among which are the Social Security Fund,
Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund, Export Support Fund, local
development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for repayment of on-lent funds), for which data are not
compiled/disseminated on a regular basis. Compilation is on a cash basis for final annual data, but
varies for provisional data depending on their source. As a result, government financing data, in
particular domestic bank financing, cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

VIETNAM

accounts. The World Bank and the IMF have recommended improving the coverage of fiscal data
and aligning definitions with the GFSM 2001. The authorities expect to provide GFSM 2001
consistent data from 2018.
Monetary statistics: The IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) has encouraged the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) to develop a reporting scheme for a comprehensive break-down of banks’ credit to
the economy by borrowing sectors and subsectors. In addition, STA has recommended that: (a) a list
of SOEs that have been privatized and, therefore, should be classified as private enterprises should
be distributed to banks in order to guide their data reporting on enterprises; (b) funds for onlending should be reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified liabilities” to “other deposits.”
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics rely on limited source data, resulting in
gaps in several areas of the external accounts (current, capital, and financial). The authorities are
working on implementing balance of payment reporting following BPM6 edition as well as
improving data quality on foreign direct investment, international investment position and external
debt, supported by IMF’s STA TA. STA technical assistance missions have made the following
observations and recommendations: (i) the available resources are not sufficient to ensure effective
implementation of an International Transaction Reporting System; (ii) further improvements are still
needed in the treatment of goods for processing in line with BPM6, improvement of remittances
estimates, and further study on unrecorded trade in gold; (iii) to establish a uniform concept of
direct investment (DI) in the national legislation and develop a reliable data source on DI stocks (at
present DI data are based on regulatory approvals) given that it is an important component of the
International Investment Position; (iv) address significant errors and omissions in the balance of
payments, which could be related to underestimation of DI flows and estimates of changes in
household holdings of foreign exchange in cash; (v) international reserves transactions need to be
distinguished from valuation changes; (vi) dissemination of external sector statistics, in line with
internationally accepted practices.
Financial sector statistics: The availability of data on the financial sector is very limited, and the
quality of data requires substantial improvement, even on key financial soundness indicators.

Data Standards and Quality
Vietnam is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since September 2003. In
conjunction with the authorities, staff from STA have developed a roadmap for Vietnam’s eventual
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
No data ROSC are available.

Reporting to STA
Currently, no government finance statistics (GFS) are reported for publication in the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GSY) or International Financial Statistics (IFS). Annual GFS
data through 2004, excluding extra-budgetary funds and social security funds, based on the 1986
GFS format, have been reported for publication in the GFSY. No sub-annual fiscal data have been
reported for publication in IFS since 2001.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Vietnam
June 10, 2016
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/16/124) was circulated to the Executive Board on June 3, 2016. This information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The State Bank of Vietnam announced a tightening of macroprudential policy. The
risk weight for real estate loans will be increased at the beginning of 2017 and the prudential
ratio governing maturity mismatches for lending will be tightened in two steps at the
beginning of 2017 and 2018. The loan-to-deposit ratio limit for state-owned banks remains
unchanged.
3.
Monetary conditions have eased. The overnight interbank interest rate has declined
well below the policy repo rate of 5 percent. Credit growth increased further in March to
19.9 percent (y/y). The exchange rate has remained relatively stable with small variations in
the daily central rate.
4.
Headline inflation increased to 2.3 percent (y/y) in May, reflecting higher food,
energy, and administered health care prices. Core inflation edged up very slightly to
1.9 percent (y/y).
5.
The trade balance registered a surplus of US$5.7 billion in the first five months of the
year, reflecting a weakening of imports amid a leveling-off of export growth. Foreign direct
investment inflows remain robust. International reserves increased to US$33.9 billion in
April.

Statement by Mr. Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director
and Ms. Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director on Vietnam
June 17, 2016

1.
Our authorities appreciate the continued engagement with the Fund and thank the
mission team for the constructive and candid policy discussions during Vietnam’s Article IV
mission. The discussions centered on policies conducive for the next phase of reforms to
achieve Vietnam’s full growth potential.
2.
The authorities welcome staff’s recognition of Vietnam’s significant economic
progress and reiterated their commitment to sound macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms. Macroeconomic policy has focused on preserving macroeconomic stability, whilst
achieving strong economic growth that would improve the standard of living of the Vietnamese
population. As acknowledged in the report, Vietnam has experienced solid growth with low
inflation in recent years and has made excellent progress in achieving the Millennium
Development Goals, such as poverty eradication, universal primary education and gender
equality.
3.
Despite the encouraging developments, the authorities are mindful of the need to
address domestic and external risks and emerging challenges, including legacy risks and
widening imbalances. The authorities are therefore fully committed to continue pursuing fiscal
prudence, sound monetary management and financial stability, while intensifying structural
reforms to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain strong growth. The authorities
broadly concur with staff assessment and agree with many of the recommendations put forward
in the report.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
4.
Prudent macroeconomic management has been key to Vietnam’s macroeconomic
stability and strong economic performance over the years. Despite significant uncertainties and
headwinds, Vietnam is able to maintain overall economic stability and sound fundamentals.
Economic growth was robust last year with real GDP growth of 6.7 percent, supported by
sound macrofinancial policy settings and strong domestic demand. In the first quarter of this
year, growth moderated to 5.5 percent, due to severe drought and land salinization as well as a
slowdown in industrial production following slower global trade. However, the authorities
remain cautiously optimistic of achieving the growth target of 6.7 percent in 2016. The new
government is committed to accelerate reforms as part of the medium-term socio-economic
plan and believes its strong policy efforts would improve productivity and business sentiment.
This, together with reform outcomes that have started to materialize, will help achieve the 2016
growth target.
5.
Although the near-term outlook is broadly positive, there remain challenges from both
external and domestic fronts. Downside risks on the domestic front include deeper impact of
drought and land salinization on agricultural production, inadequate fiscal consolidation and

2
prolonged non-performing loan (NPL) resolution. These domestic risks could be exacerbated
by external shocks, including more volatile global financial conditions that could lead to capital
outflows and higher domestic interest rates; weak global growth prospects and changes in the
structure of global trade which could undermine exports; and persistently lower oil prices.
6.
Global developments are being closely monitored and policies are formulated to reap
the benefits from future opportunities and counter unexpected shocks. Vietnam has made
significant progress in promoting finished-goods exports, which continue to benefit from
China’s rebalancing. The new flexible exchange-rate regime has been effective in acting as a
shock absorber against external shocks, safeguarding macroeconomic stability and allowing
an increase in international reserves. The authorities also see merit in accelerating the
implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other regional and bilateral trade
agreements as they would help to improve domestic productivity, support export market
expansion and facilitate structural reforms.
Fiscal Policy
7.
Fiscal consolidation is a critical element in the authorities’ effort to improve the
resilience of the economy. This is especially in view of the declining trend of revenue as a
share of GDP and the increasing public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt. The Ministry of
Finance is developing a Medium-term Budget and Finance Plan (MBFP) for 2016-2020 for
submission to the government and subsequently, to the National Assembly for approval in
October 2016. The Plan will provide details on measures to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit
to an average of 4 percent of GDP for the period and to 3 percent of GDP by the year 2020. At
the same time, the aim is to keep the PPG debt below 65 percent of GDP.
8.
The authorities note staff’s medium-term growth-friendly consolidation scenario and
would take careful consideration of staff’s recommendations. The authorities recognize that in
the absence of effective revenue enhancing measures, the burden of fiscal adjustment will be
borne mainly by capital expenditures, which could undermine future growth. They concur with
staff’s analysis of the challenges in achieving the targets of reducing deficit and PPG debt,
including reduction of tariffs and tax exemption owing to trade agreements and lower non-tax
revenue from dividend because of SOEs equitization.
9.
In recent years, fiscal policy has been expansionary, focusing on cushioning the impact
of moderate global growth, enhancing competitiveness, attracting investment, and removing
obstacles for businesses. To support economic activity, Vietnam has implemented some tax
exemptions, deferral and reduction in some taxes and fees, and some other revenue measures.
While these measures may seem to directly reduce revenue, the authorities consider such
negative effects on revenue to be negligible, as these measures have helped stabilize the
economy by smoothening consumption, attracting new investments, supporting businesses,
and thus creating conditions to raise revenue in the medium term.
10.
Despite unfavorable external conditions, the revenue from domestic activities has been
increasing, averaging 13.1 percent of GDP during 2006 - 2010, and 14.1 percent during 2011
- 2015. In addition, the revenue structure has shifted positively, with rising share of domestic

3
revenue to total revenue, from 52.3 percent during 2001 - 2005 to 68 percent during 2011 2015. In 2015, this share was 74 percent and is expected to be higher than 80 percent during
2016 - 2020.
11.
The authorities concur with staff on the need to arrest the rise in PPG debt. While staff
estimates PPG debt to increase to 62 percent of GDP in 2016 and to 70 percent in the medium
term, the authorities have a more optimistic view. They emphasize their commitment to
maintain PPG debt below the legal limit of 65 percent of GDP and view that the risk of debt
distress as being under control. The MBFP for 2016-2020 contains necessary measures to
ensure the PPG debt ratio remains below 65 percent of GDP.
12.
The authorities broadly concur with staff’s recommendation on policies to enhance
revenue and improve efficiency of expenditure. The authorities are currently formulating
policies to raise revenue and are optimistic that these revenue enhancement measures will be
implemented starting next year, thus contributing to narrowing the fiscal deficit. These include
simplification of tax procedures and amendments to corporate income tax incentives to bring
it in line with international practice. The plan is also to broaden the personal income tax base,
adjust the tax rates as well as reduce the number of goods and services exempt from VAT and
the number of goods and services subject to the 5 percent taxable group, with the ultimate aim
of eliminating this group and applying a common VAT rate. They also plan to increase excise
tax coverage, and adjust environmental protection tax rates, while the introduction of property
tax is under study. On the expenditure side, the focus is to lower the current expenditure by
reducing the public sector wage bill, promoting financial autonomy in public sector and
increasing participation of non-state agents in delivering public services, especially in
education and healthcare. In addition, efforts are underway to rationalize public investment
expenditure and improve the efficiency of public investment projects. The authorities are
planning to request Fund’s technical assistance on tax policy with a focus on revenue
strengthening measures.
13.
While the authorities see the merit in enhancing financial capability of state-owned
commercial banks and resolution of NPLs, the inclusion of bank recapitalization funds in the
fiscal consolidation process is difficult and need to be thoroughly considered. The authorities
note staff’s recommendation to use budget resources upfront for banking sector recapitalization
needs and the potential benefits of doing so. Nevertheless, the estimated amount of 2½ percent
of GDP for banks’ recapitalization needs to be carefully calibrated and a roadmap for bank
recapitalization will need to be established and approved by the authorities before
implementation. The total cost should be within the capacity of the budget and consistent with
the plan to lower the fiscal deficit and keep PPG debt below 65 percent.
Monetary Policy and Foreign Exchange Management
14.
The State Bank of Vietnam’s (SBV) monetary policy stance in 2016 is to support the
government’s objective of maintaining macroeconomic stability, achieving economic growth
target, keeping inflation rate below 5 percent and ensuring the resilience of the banking system.
The SBV will continue to coordinate monetary policy closely with fiscal policy and other
macroeconomic policies. The SBV will stand ready to tighten monetary policy should

4
inflationary pressures arise. On the other hand, if growth is slowing further and underlying
inflation stalls, the SBV may consider monetary policy easing. On staff’s recommendation to
establish an interest-rate corridor as a channel for policy transmission, the SBV is undertaking
further research on this and would implement it as conditions warrant.
15.
The SBV views the 2016 credit growth rate target of 18 - 20 percent as appropriate,
given the growth projection of 6.7 percent in 2016, and is consistent with the target of keeping
inflation below 5 percent. However, this credit growth target may be adjusted in line with
actual developments and that achieving this target will not be at the expense of credit quality
as the authorities remain committed to ensuring that NPLs remain below 3 percent of total
loans. Recently, the SBV issued an instruction to banks to prioritize credit for the productive
sectors, such as manufacturing, agriculture and export. Credit to real estate and other
potentially risky sectors is being closely monitored. That said, Vietnam’s high creditto-GDP
ratio reflects its bank-based economy, with businesses depending mostly on bank lending given
the relatively underdeveloped capital markets. The authorities view that the use of these
administrative measures are still necessary under the current conditions in order to maintain
control over excessive credit growth.
16.
The authorities are encouraged by staff’s acknowledgement of their efforts to adopt a
more flexible exchange rate regime and agree with staff’s recommendation to allow for more
flexibility, in response to heightened global financial volatility. Being a highly open economy,
greater exchange rate flexibility provides a necessary buffer for Vietnam to withstand external
shocks. Following the adoption of a more flexible exchange rate regime, in the first few months
of 2016, speculative activity moderated sharply contributing to ample foreign currency supply
and hence, a stabilization of the exchange rate and rebuilding of international reserves.
17.
In the authorities’ view, shifting the monetary policy framework toward using inflation
as the nominal anchor is appropriate but requires thorough preparation and is conditional on
initial settings. This includes consideration of financial market development and strength of
monetary operation and liquidity forecasting capability of the SBV. The current monetary
policy framework already aims at controlling inflation as a primary objective, which in turn,
contributes to maintaining macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. The SBV
continues to review and assess potential enhancements to its monetary policy framework and
will take staff’s recommendation into consideration with a view to enhance monetary policy
efficiency and will seek Fund’s technical assistance if necessary.
Macroprudential and Banking Policy
18.
Progress has been made in developing the macroprudential framework and a number
of steps on banking sector reform have been taken. With proposed macroprudential tightening
measures, tightening of regulations on lending and dividend payments at weak banks, and
strengthening supervision, the authorities anticipate that they will be able to mitigate potential
systematic risks. Recently, the SBV issued a circular regulating prudential ratios for the
operations of credit institutions and foreign bank branches. Accordingly, the risk index of
receivable lending for real estate will be raised from 150 percent to 200 percent, effective
January 2017. The new circular also specifies a roadmap to reduce the maximum ratio of short-

5
term funds used for medium and long term loans from 60 percent currently to 50 percent in
January 2017 and to 40 percent in January 2018.
19.
The issue of high level of impaired loans still lingers, which poses the challenge of
weak profitability of banking sector. In response, the Vietnam Asset Management Corporation
(VAMC) has been established. The authorities have a plan to increase the capital of the VAMC.
In March 2016, the authorities have amended the Decree on establishment, organization and
operation of the VAMC, which provided legal basis to buy and sell NPLs at market value. The
detailed plan of this operation was elaborated in Decision No. 618 of the SBV in April 2016,
which would improve resolution incentives for VAMC’s operation.
20.
The authorities welcome staff’s recommendation to tighten macroprudential policies,
but stress the importance of appropriate timing and necessary conditions. While the authorities
share staff’s view on key elements, including accelerated NPLs loss recognition and resolution
in banks and at the VAMC, they are of the view that using budget resources to recapitalize
state-owned commercial banks and enhancing equitization of these banks require careful
consideration. To further strengthen financial stability, the authorities are finalizing a
macroprudential framework and improving systemic risk supervision.
Structural Reforms
21.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s policy recommendations to intensify the pace
of structural reforms. The new government is committed to implementing its policy agenda
without delay and reaffirmed the increasing use of market-based mechanism for economic
reform. As such, a number of reform measures are underway to facilitate structural adjustment
and improve the business environment. In May 2016, the government issued a Resolution on
Supporting and Developing Enterprises by 2020 to develop and improve economic institutions
and create a business investment environment conducive to business growth as a driving force
of the economy. The Resolution outlines administrative reforms and specific tasks of each
ministry and government agency, aimed at creating a favorable environment to support startups and innovative enterprises, ensuring the right to do business, equal right to access resources
and business opportunities of enterprises, reduction in business costs, and protection of the
legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.
22.
The authorities recognize the importance of boosting productivity and longer-term
growth potential. To that end, structural reform is necessary to strengthen the spillover of
productivity gains in the foreign-invested sector to the domestic economy, which can be
achieved by improving the integration between foreign-invested sector and domestic suppliers.
In particular, strengthening domestic-sector competitiveness would facilitate such productivity
spillovers from foreign-invested sector.
23.
SOE reform will be accelerated in the 2016-20 period, including greater transparency
and disclosure, accelerated equitization, and improved inter-agency coordination. Good
progress has been made in developing the legal framework for SOE reform, including
strengthened supervisory capacity. SOEs are subject to regulations on supervision and State
capital management, besides being subject to the Enterprises Law like all other enterprises. As

6
regard to SOE equitization proceeds and their use, the authorities see the mechanism as
transparent as the Ministry of Finance is required to report regularly to the government and are
subject to established regulatory framework.
24.
The effects of an aging population could negatively impact growth via its implications
on productivity and fiscal burden. As the share of Vietnam’s working-age population to the
overall population has already started to decline, the authorities concur with staff’s analysis
and will work on policy measures to increase labor mobility appropriately and undertake
further measures to enhance productivity.
Conclusion
25.
The authorities will continue to pursue sound macroeconomic policies which have
supported economic growth and stability. The Vietnamese economy’s strong fundamentals,
together with commitment to prudent policies, will provide solid foundation to meet future
challenges, with the country’s long-term potential and competitiveness to be further enhanced
by the steadfast implementation of structural reforms. The degree of these reforms and their
implementation will be appropriately paced to achieve the desired outcomes while minimizing
unintended consequences.
26.
Finally, the authorities appreciate the ongoing Fund advice and technical assistance,
and look forward to continued support by the Fund in their reform endeavors.
