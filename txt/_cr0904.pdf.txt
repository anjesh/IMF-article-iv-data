•

A mission (Mr. Powell (Head), Mr. Erasmus, Mr. Gottschalk and Ms. Dlamini-Kunene (all AFR),
Mr. Kitili (SPR), Mr. Price (FIN), and Mr. Tharkur (Resident Representative)) visited Monrovia
October 20-31 to conduct discussions for the 2008 Article IV consultation, the first review of the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, and policies for the second year of the
program.

•

The mission met with Minister of Finance Ngafuan, Central Bank of Liberia Governor Jones, other
senior government officials, and representatives of the legislature, business community, commercial
banks, civil society, and the international community. The mission briefed President Johnson-Sirleaf
on its main findings.

•

Liberia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float with no predetermined path; however the de facto
regime is consistent with a conventional peg. Liberia’s exchange system is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions—the authorities have not indicated
immediate plans to accept the obligations of Article VIII.

•

The Executive Board approved three-year PRGF and Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements on
March 14, 2008 in the amount of SDR 581.8 million (450 percent of quota). SDR 550.03 was
disbursed at approval in order to facilitate the clearance of long-standing arrears to the Fund. The
EFF arrangement lapsed following disbursement of the full amount under the arrangement in March
2008. Upon completion of the first review, a disbursement of SDR 7.0 million (5.4 percent of quota)
will become available.

•

Liberia reached the decision point for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative on
March 18, 2008. The Executive Board approved interim assistance in the amount of
SDR 15.03 million to ensure that Liberia’s debt service payments to the Fund do not exceed about
SDR 0.44 million annually, close to the level of payments established under the staff-monitored
program.

The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on April 26, 2006. The staff report is available

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The postwar economic recovery continued in 2008, but Liberia was significantly affected
by the increase in world food and fuel prices in the first half of the year. Year-on-year
inflation peaked at almost 27 percent in August, and the trade deficit doubled in the first three
quarters of the year compared with the same period in 2007.

•

Prospects for 2009 are favorable, with solid growth and falling inflation projected.
Nonetheless, the global slowdown is likely to affect foreign direct investment, exports and
remittance flows.

•

The authorities have formulated a comprehensive food security strategy designed to
mitigate the impact of domestic rice price increases, ensure domestic supply and access to
food for vulnerable households through safety nets, and promote domestic production. Given
limited public resources, they should continue to focus on securing donor support to finance
the strategy.

•

Revenue projections in the 2008/09 (July-June) budget are subject to downside risks,
particularly related to one-off nontax revenue sources. The authorities need to put in place an
effective cash flow management system as soon as possible and in the meantime identify
potential expenditure reductions in case revenue falls short.

•

Staff considers the Liberian dollar to be in line with fundamentals. However, a marked
appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the last quarter of 2008 is likely to slow growth through its
impact on Liberia’s main exports. Staff and authorities agreed that the main factors affecting
Liberia’s international competitiveness are inadequate infrastructure and a poor institutional
environment for private sector development.

•

Liberia is highly dollarized. U.S. dollars account for an estimated 90 percent of the money
supply. Policy initiatives to strengthen the demand for Liberian dollars should be marketbased and focus particularly on building policy credibility and on financial market
development.

•

Performance on the PRGF-supported program through June was satisfactory, and the
program remains on track. Staff support the authorities’ request for a waiver for the endJune structural performance criterion relating to the merger of the Bureau of the Budget into
the Ministry of Finance; legislation to this effect was passed only in September.
Macroeconomic policies for the second year of the program are aimed at continuing to firm up
public finance management (PFM), monetary and financial sector policies, and governance
and to improve data availability and quality. The authorities are firmly committed to reform,
but there are considerable risks relating to capacity constraints and the need for the
cooperation of the opposition-led legislature. Continued donor support will be important to
achieving program objectives.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Liberia is a post-conflict country with unsustainable debt. In March 2008, after a
major fund-raising effort, its long standing arrears to the IMF were cleared, voting rights
were restored, and large Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) arrangements were approved. At the same time Liberia reached the decision
point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Liberia is receiving
substantial interim assistance from the IMF to keep cash debt service payments to
manageable levels until the completion point, currently projected for 2010.
2.
Liberia has made significant progress with its economic reforms since the 2006
Article IV consultation. A number of 2006 Article IV recommendations, addressed as part
of the 2006-2007 Staff-Monitored Program, have been implemented (Box 1), and the threeyear Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which the PRGF is now supporting, lays out
a strategy to sustain higher economic growth by maintaining macroeconomic stability,
encouraging private sector investment and improving infrastructure, governance and security.
Box 1. 2006 Article IV Recommendations
Advice

Status

Establish an effective and transparent budgeting
process.

Public Finance Management has improved and a
comprehensive PFM law has been submitted to
the legislature.

Ensure allotments are consistent with available
resources to prevent new payment arrears.

No domestic arrears have accumulated
since 2006, except temporary wage arrears due to
late legislative approval of the budget.

Continue efforts to strengthen public revenues.

Government revenues increased by nearly
150 percent between FY2005/06-2007/08.

Eliminate the central bank budget deficit.

The Central Bank of Liberia has been balancing
its budget since 2007.

Strengthen domestic banks.

All banks have been recapitalized, and by yearend will exceed the minimum 10 percent capital
adequacy ratio.

Develop national anticorruption strategy.

The strategy was adopted in 2007, and an
anticorruption commission has been established.

Complete contracts and concessions review.

Review was completed in December 2006.

Develop a strategy to address domestic arrears.

A strategy was adopted in January 2007.

3.
The international community is supporting the Liberian government’s efforts to
reform the economy. A June 2008 partners conference, which focused on infrastructure,
confirmed that donor support for Liberia is still high at US$85-$100 per capita. However,
little support is provided through the budget. The challenge therefore is to align donor
activities with the PRSP and to continue reinforcing public finance management (PFM) to
attract more budget support. The government maintains regular dialogue with donors through
the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee and the Governance and Economic
Management Assistance Program.

Performance on the

program through June was

remains on track. All of the
quantitative benchmarks and
performance criteria (PCs)
through June were achieved
(MEFP, Table 1), as were all of the structural performance benchmarks and PCs (MEFP,
Table 2), albeit some with a delay. Because legislation to approve the merger of the Bureau
of the Budget into the Ministry of Finance (an end-June PC) was not approved until
September, the authorities are requesting a waiver.

III. SURVEILLANCE ISSUES
8.
Policy discussions addressed the following challenges to meeting the authorities’
macroeconomic objectives: (i) coping with higher commodity prices and recent global

9
financial market turmoil; (ii) maintaining external stability; and (iii) challenges posed by
Liberia’s dual currency regime.
A. Policy Response to Global Economic Developments
9.
Higher food and fuel prices had a major impact on Liberia in 2008. In
discussions the staff welcomed the development of a comprehensive food security policy
(Box 2). They agreed with the authorities’ decision to temporarily suspend the rice import
duty given the importance of rice in household consumption and the prevalence of poverty. In
view of limited public resources, including the government’s commitment to a zero
borrowing policy, staff welcomed the strong support from the international community to
finance the key elements of the strategy, particularly on providing support to the most
vulnerable people. Because world rice prices are projected to remain high in 2009, staff and
the authorities agreed that the import duties on rice should remain suspended, and that the
authorities should continue to seek donor assistance to finance the other elements of their
strategy.
10.
Medium-term economic prospects are favorable (text table). Real growth is
projected to rise to about 13 percent in 2009 with the expected resumption of logging and
iron mining operations, inflation is projected to decline to single digits and the current
account deficit is likely to narrow as key import prices, especially for oil decline. Reserves
coverage, in terms of months of goods and services imports, is projected to remain stable at
the current low level over the medium term. 1 Staff and the authorities agreed, however, that
there are downside risks to the growth forecast since a sharper-than-projected slowdown in
global growth or a decline in world commodity prices could reduce demand for Liberia’s key
exports, or delay investment activity in these sectors, more than projected. While Liberia’s
financial sector is not well integrated with international financial markets, staff emphasized
the importance of closely supervising banks, which on average hold about one-fifth of their
total assets with overseas banks. Should a portion of these assets become impaired or subject
to write-down, it could cause liquidity or solvency problems for Liberian banks. A slowdown in remittances or donor inflows could also negatively impact economic prospects and
the exchange rate.

1

The program does not target a more ambitious accumulation of foreign reserves since almost all donor support
is provided outside the government budget, and the only supply of foreign exchange to the CBL is through the
monthly purchase of Liberian dollars by the government for the payment of civil service salaries and wages.

10
Box 2. Liberia: Government Response to Commodity Price Increases
Increases in international commodity prices have contributed to a significant acceleration in inflation in
Liberia, where increases have largely been allowed to pass through to the domestic economy. Liberia has
been particularly affected by increases in the price of rice, which accounts for 50 percent of the daily
caloric intake of households; an estimated 66 percent of annual needs is imported.
Higher food and fuel prices contributed to a widening of the trade deficit between 2007 and 2008 by
2
about 18 percent of GDP.
Responding to these developments is particularly challenging in Liberia because:
• about 64 percent of the population lives below the poverty line;
• the government has no access to new borrowing;
• international reserves are equal to less than one month’s imports; and
• the scope for active monetary policy is limited since it is anchored on exchange rate stability.
Against this background, the government developed a comprehensive food security strategy to:
• mitigate the impact of domestic rice price increases and ensure domestic supply: (i) it
temporarily suspended import duties on rice (at a cost of US$8.4 million in lost revenues,
0.9 percent of GDP), agricultural and road building equipment, and agricultural materials and
supplies; and (ii) it is exploring with other governments long-term supply agreements for rice.
• ensure access to food for vulnerable households through safety nets. Although targeting
vulnerable groups is challenging, the government is instituting: (i) school feeding programs in
urban areas; (ii) supplementary feeding programs for women and children; and (iii) food-forwork and cash-for-work programs.
• promote domestic production through: (i) expanding smallholder production by distributing
seeds, fertilizer, and farm tools; (ii) expanding agricultural land and crop diversification; (iii)
increasing marketable surpluses through postharvest interventions; and (iv) encouraging largescale commercial rice farming.
After adopting its food security strategy, the government in June 2008 announced additional measures: it
• eliminated withholding tax on annual incomes of US$840 and less (although this was consistent
with the tax reform strategy);
• subsidized further gasoline price increases that affect the Monrovia Transit Authority (MTA);
• directed government ministries and agencies to review fee structures; and
• provided additional buses to the MTA to add routes.
Substantial support for this strategy has come from the World Food Program (US$25 million), World
Bank (US$10 million), Germany (US$20 million) and Libya (US$30 million). Liberia will also receive
funding from a UN special fund, and part of a proposed AfDB budget support operation of
US$18.5 million will be used to offset the impact of higher food and fuel prices on the budget.

Ratios to GDP should be interpreted with caution because GDP is likely to be underestimated.

B. Maintaining External Stability
11.
Available information does not provide evidence that Liberia’s exchange rate is
either under- or overvalued (Box 3). Liberia’s economy is undergoing significant structural
change after 14 years of civil war, and a lack of historical data further complicates
quantitative analysis of the appropriateness of the exchange rate level. Moreover, Liberia is
also highly dollarized (see Box 4), implying that exchange rate policy only has a limited role
in bringing about required adjustment to balance of payments imbalances. However, Liberia’s
real effective exchange rate (REER) does not appear to be out of line with fundamentals.
Following a sharp depreciation in 2000-03, in both Liberian dollar and U.S. dollar terms, the
REER has remained relatively stable following the end of the civil war in 2003. Also,
Liberia’s terms of trade, on balance, continued to improve up to 2008, while export growth
recovered strongly.
12.
Large current account deficits since the end of the civil war in 2003 mainly
reflect an expansion in imports to assist postwar recovery and reconstruction. While
import demand is likely to remain high in the medium term because of continued imports
related to reconstruction and foreign direct investment (FDI), it is expected to be offset by
accelerating export growth, particularly as production of iron ore and timber resumes. The
current account deficit, including grants, is therefore projected to decline substantially over
the medium term, supported also by a sharp projected decline in scheduled debt service
following the HIPC completion point. The modest spike in the REER in recent months
reflects the rise in domestic inflation and the strengthening U.S. dollar. Staff and the
authorities agreed that the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, if sustained, could undermine
Liberia’s external competitiveness, emphasizing the importance of addressing other factors
that impact competitiveness.
13.
Liberia’s external debt is currently unsustainable, but is projected to improve.
The latest low-income country debt sustainability analysis for Liberia indicates that Liberia is
in debt distress, but that debt dynamics are projected to be manageable following full delivery

Liberia has the potential to significantly improve its competitiveness, but it must
overcome significant structural bottlenecks. In particular, it lacks the infrastructure it
needs to exploit its comparative advantage in natural-resource-based export industries. The
recent Diagnostic Trade Integration Study confirmed that in order to promote competitive
value-added activities in export resource-based products, Liberia will need to also improve its
investment climate by investing in physical infrastructure, particularly in usable roads and
well functioning ports to facilitate the transport of export goods such as timber, iron ore and
cocoa.
15.
The institutional environment for private sector development also needs
improving. While the World Bank Doing Business report for 2009 reports an improvement
in the cost of doing business in 2008, Liberia still ranked only 157th out of 181 countries
surveyed. Also, although there has been steady progress in improving governance since 2003,
much remains to be done to improve Liberia’s ranking on this indicator.

C. Policy Options in a Dual Currency Regime
16.
Liberia operates a dual currency regime, and the authorities have expressed a
desire to encourage greater use of the Liberian dollar. In discussions, the staff noted that
Liberia has a very long history of using the U.S. dollar as legal tender and that it is one of the
world’s most dollarized economies (Box 4). Staff also noted that economic performance
since the end of the civil conflict in 2003 has been strong: real growth has accelerated, FDI
has resumed, and inflation, except for the recent spike on account of world commodity price
increases, has been held in the low double digits. The authorities agreed that policies to
strengthen the demand for the Liberian dollar should be market-based, and in particular
should be based on enhancing the credibility of economic policy and developing the financial
market.
17.
Since building policy credibility may take time, staff noted some measures that
could be implemented in the interim to strengthen the demand for the Liberian dollar.
These include: (i) improving the quality and increasing the denomination of Liberian dollar
notes; (ii) increasing the use of the Liberian dollar as the unit of account; (iii) using Liberian
dollars more in government transactions; (iv) encouraging agents to hold local-currencydenominated assets, e.g. by allowing interest rates on deposits in local and foreign currency to
be market-determined; (v) encouraging the use of the Liberian dollar for payments, e.g., by
requiring additional provisioning or capital for U.S. dollar loans to the nontradable sector;
(vi) strengthening prudential regulations to ensure that foreign exchange risk is properly
managed; and (vii) developing a modern payments system. Staff noted that a higher level of
foreign reserves could also help to strengthen the demand for the Liberian dollar by boosting
confidence in the currency. Staff warned, however, against trying to force the timetable for
dedollarization, which could have destabilizing effects, discouraging dedollarization in the
longer run.
IV. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
18.
Macroeconomic policies for the second year of the program are aimed at making
further progress in strengthening PFM, monetary and financial sector policies, and
governance, and in improving data availability and quality. Economic prospects in 2009
are generally favorable, although a further significant decline in global growth could
adversely affect Liberia’s growth prospects.

15
Box 4. Cross-country experience with dedollarization
Liberia has been heavily dollarized since its founding as a country in 1847, although Liberian
dollars (mostly coins) have circulated alongside the U.S. dollar. In the recent past, Charles Taylor
issued Liberian dollar notes at par with the U.S. dollar during the 1989-97 civil war, and “Liberty”
dollars were issued in areas controlled by ECOWAS in 1991 to invalidate notes looted from the
central bank, effectively creating two currency zones. In 1997, the Central Bank of Liberia issued a
new series of banknotes, after which the exchange rate was devalued to L$43/US$1. The U.S. dollar
has remained official legal tender in Liberia.

Liberia is one of the most dollarized
economies in the world. According to
one measure, a country is considered
highly dollarized if the ratio of foreign
currency deposits to broad money
exceeds 30 percent; in Liberia this
ratio was 62 percent in 2007. Staff
estimates show that if foreign currency
in circulation is taken into
consideration, U.S. dollars account on
average for about 90 percent of the
effective money supply.

A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The 2008/09 budget again projects a strong increase in revenues (Table 3). 4 The
budget targets total spending of US$270.2 million, to be financed from revenues of US$248.9
million (an increase of 24½ percent over the 2007/08 budget outturn), and a budget deficit of
1.7 percent of GDP to be financed by a drawdown in government cash balances at the Central
Bank of Liberia (CBL). Around US$28.5 million of the projected revenues is related to
payments from mining concessions yet to be finalized; however, on the upside, direct budget
support of about US$19 million to be provided by the World Bank and African Development
Bank was not included in the 2008/09 budget. The authorities remain committed to operating
a cash-based balanced budget—they will not borrow to finance a deficit or manage liquidity.
The authorities have started putting an improved cash flow management framework in place,
but it will likely take some time for it to become fully effective. In the meantime, staff and
the authorities agreed on the need to identify expenditures that could be reduced if revenue
shortfalls materialize.
20.
The authorities have drafted a comprehensive set of amendments to the Liberian
Revenue Code designed to eliminate discretion in granting tax incentives (MEFP, ¶26).
Passage of these amendments is expected in early 2009. The next priority is drafting tax
administrative regulations, for which the authorities have requested Fund technical
assistance. On the revenue administration side, the authorities are in the process of launching
ambitious projects for automating tax and customs administration operations.
21.
To provide a strong legal foundation for PFM, the authorities have submitted a
comprehensive PFM law to the legislature, with passage expected in early 2009. They
have requested Fund technical assistance for drafting implementing regulations; the World
Bank will help prepare manuals. Adoption of the regulations is a performance criterion under
the program for 2009 (see MEFP Table 4). The authorities have also launched a
comprehensive effort to computerize PFM. A computerized accounting system is being
deployed to help automate bank reconciliation and implement a double-entry accounting
standard in time for the next fiscal year (adoption of accounting standards, together with the
expanded chart of accounts, is a program benchmark). Finally, the review of the Public
Procurement and Concessions Act has been finalized and will be submitted to the legislature
in 2009. In the meantime the authorities have commenced preparation of implementing
regulations to provide guidance to ministries and agencies on the correct procurement
procedures (a program benchmark).

4

The budget consists of a “core” budget and a “contingent” budget; the latter targets spending of US$27.9
million, to be financed from revenues the authorities consider to be particularly uncertain (mostly related to
additional payments from mining concessions and additional transfers from state-owned enterprises). These
expenditures will only be authorized if these more uncertain revenues are collected and if the revenues targeted
in the “core” budget are collected.

17
22.
The authorities have finalized validation of outstanding domestic debt and
accepted claims totaling US$300.5 million (MEFP, ¶23). About US$268 million of valid
claims are held by the CBL, while valid claims amounting to approximately US$51 million to
private suppliers have been discounted in accordance with the government’s domestic debt
strategy to US$11 million; the remaining claims consist of restructured bank loans and wage
arrears. 5 6 The 2006 domestic debt strategy envisioned setting up a trust fund to help service
this debt, but the authorities are now reconsidering this approach because a large number of
claims were rejected, which reduced the funding need, and in light of a low probability of
donor support for such a trust fund. Staff advised that the authorities should quickly decide
on how they plan to provide the financing required for repaying these debts because they are
sizable.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
23.
Agreement was reached on the monetary program for 2009. Monetary policy aims
to limit inflation by keeping the exchange rate relatively stable. 7 To this end, the CBL uses
foreign exchange auctions to manage Liberian dollar liquidity. In the current environment,
there is the possibility of increased volatility of flows of U.S. dollars into and out of Liberia,
which could put pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate. Staff and the authorities agreed
that the authorities should not attempt to hold the exchange rate at a specific level, or to
defend it against downward pressure from such exogenous shocks, because foreign reserves
are still low.
24.
Staff and the authorities also agreed that efforts should continue to strengthen
the current monetary policy framework. In this context, it was agreed that the CBL will:
(i) relaunch efforts to publicize the current policy framework; (ii) analyze the foreign
exchange market to assess developments in the most important sources of supply of and
demand for U.S. dollars in order to enhance the efficiency of the foreign exchange auction;
and (iii) finalize and publicize the rules and regulations pertaining to the foreign exchange
auction (an end-March program benchmark). Regarding the latter, staff suggested that the
“special” auctions held occasionally for the foreign exchange bureaus be folded into the
regular weekly auctions. In addition, the authorities agreed on the importance of beginning to
prepare for eventual reintroduction of short-term securities, starting with the basic operational
5

See Country Report No. 07/356, for a description of Liberia’s domestic debt resolution strategy.

6

The finalized amount of domestic claims on the government is not significantly different from that resulting
from the 2006 audit (US$272 million), and does not materially affect the debt sustainability assessment
presented in Country Report No. 08/106, Supplement 1.

7

Given its very open economy, changes in Liberia’s exchange rate translate swiftly into changes in the prices of
goods and services priced in Liberian dollars, and because these are mostly used in small transactions by the
poorest segment of the population, stability in the exchange rate has been the main focus for monetary
management.

18
framework for auctioning and trading these securities. To support the demand for Liberian
dollars, the authorities indicated they would consider some of the policy actions identified
above (¶17).
25.
Substantial progress has been achieved in strengthening the banking sector (see
text table), including: (i) adoption of a corporate governance framework; (ii) increasing the
regulatory capital adequacy ratio and the minimum capital requirements; 8 and (iii) employing
regulatory directives under the supervision of the Compliance Committee to ensure that
actions are taken to correct identified deficiencies.

26.
The authorities indicated their intention to further strengthen the banking
sector. Measures have been implemented to improve supervision of the banking system,
including a requirement for semiannual on-site examinations of all operating banks (an endSeptember performance criterion) and a comprehensive system for off-site examinations. The
authorities agreed with staff that these arrangements, together with the licensing of another
four commercial banks, would impose significant demands on the Banking Supervision
Department’s limited capacity, making training of both current and new staff a priority. Staff
emphasized that the CBL should enforce all current banking supervision regulations and take
firm steps to ensure full compliance, including the increase in capital requirements scheduled
for 2009 and beyond. Finally, staff and the authorities agreed that given the supervisory
constraints and global financial market uncertainty, the CBL should avoid issuing new
banking licenses in the near future. They also agreed that growth in private sector credit
would require close supervision of bank credit risk management and loan classification
8

The CBL Board of Governors increased the required minimum capital from US$2.0 million to US$6.0 million
by December 2008, to US$8.0 million by December 2009, and to US$10.0 million by December 2010; the
capital adequacy ratio has been raised from 8 percent to 10 percent by end-December 2008.

19
policies. 9 Staff also recommended that the authorities seek funding and technical assistance
for development of a fast-track commercial court, and for development of the payments
system, which remains rudimentary.
27.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ focus on strengthening the institutional
environment to prevent money laundering. Under current legislation all licensed banks are
required to have in place adequate know-your-customer policies, and to report suspicious
transactions to the CBL. The authorities have requested assistance from the InterGovernmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa to review the current
anti-money-laundering/combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation to ensure
that it is consistent with international best practice. They would welcome Fund review of the
draft legislation.
28.
Progress has been made in strengthening internal financial controls at the CBL.
The CBL received an adverse opinion from its external auditors on the 2007 accounts due to
non-compliance with international financial reporting standards, and the Fund’s 2007 interim
safeguards assessment identified serious weaknesses. An update safeguards assessment
conducted in early 2008 found that while the CBL had largely addressed the measures to
increase transparency recommended by the 2007 interim assessment, significant risks exist in
the control framework of the Bank. Of particular concern was a delay in assuming co–signing
authority for CBL financial matters by the Fund-supported Special Advisor and weak internal
audit capacity, including the lack of effective oversight of CBL financial reporting, audit and
control systems by the Audit Committee. A special external audit conducted in August 2008
(one of the main safeguards recommendations), indicated that the monetary data submitted by
the CBL are accurate and comply with the definitions in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, and that progress has been made on improving aspects of the general control
environment, including the assumption of co–signing authority by the Special Advisor. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to complete by February 2009 a second special
external audit covering the period through December 2008. The CBL had also made progress
in implementing a number of other major recommendations, including adoption of
investment guidelines and segregating the duties of the Banking and Financial Departments
regarding placement of CBL financial resources. Staff welcomed progress to date, and urged
the CBL to further strengthen internal audit and controls, including appointing an expert to
conduct an external assessment of the internal audit function, developing an action plan to
implement recommended improvements, and adopting an internal audit charter.
29.
The staff welcomed the CBL’s commitment to a cash-based balanced budget
for 2009. Staff emphasized the importance of prudent assumptions about the average level of
9

Private sector credit growth averaged about 80 percent in the first three quarters of 2008, although year-onyear growth slowed a little to 58 percent in September—on average, around 90 percent of loans are denominated
in U.S. dollars.

20
government deposits at the CBL given that the government budget for FY2008/09 targets a
draw-down of deposits to finance expenditures. 10 On expenditures, the authorities agreed that
future capital expenditures on the CBL’s building, completion of which was interrupted by
the civil war, should be prioritized in terms of available resources and other important CBL
functions.
C. Other Structural Reforms
30.
The staff welcomed progress with establishing the independent Liberia AntiCorruption Commission (LACC). The act, approved in August 2008, gives the LACC
independent investigative and prosecutorial powers and mandates that it lead implementation
of the government’s anticorruption strategy. Staff welcomed appointment of the
commissioners, but emphasized the importance of finalizing preparations for making the
commission operational, especially providing a budget for the remainder of FY2008/09 and
appointing the necessary personnel. 11 Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to finalize
the LACC’s medium-term work program, inclusive of those elements of the national
anticorruption strategy directly under the Commission’s control. Staff noted that elements of
the strategy outside the LACC’s direct control would require close coordination with other
government institutions, such as the General Auditing Commission (GAC).
31.
The GAC completed some external audits of public sector institutions in
FY2007/08, including a number of state-owned enterprises and the Ministry of Finance.
It is commendable that external audits have recommenced after a long hiatus, but staff noted
the importance of focusing scarce resources on the audits that are required for Liberia to
reach the HIPC Initiative completion point; in this regard, successive audits of the Ministries
of Education; Finance; Health; Lands, Mines and Energy; and Public Works would need to
be completed (completion of the external audit of the government’s accounts for fiscal year
2007/08 is a performance criterion under the program).
D. Statistical Issues and Fund Technical Assistance
32.
Severe data deficiencies hamper surveillance and monitoring of PRSP
implementation. Fund technical assistance has been provided in a number of areas and the
staff welcomed progress over the past three years in improving fiscal, monetary, price, and
balance of payments data. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue implementing
recommendations to maintain momentum in improving data availability and quality
(completing balance of payments data for 2008 is a program benchmark). The recently
10

for around 37 percent of interest income.

finalized National Statistical Development Strategy (NSDS) envisages the resumption of
production of national accounts data and a household income and expenditure survey that
would improve consumer price statistics (completion of the national accounts establishment
survey is a performance criterion, see MEFP, ¶37).
33.
The authorities have been very receptive to technical assistance from the Fund
(Informational Annex, Appendix I), and Liberia’s development partners. The Fund has
provided extensive technical assistance over the past three years in the areas of statistics and
fiscal, monetary and financial policies. Staff agreed with the authorities that continued Fund
support would be important to further strengthen institutional capacity.
E. Moving toward the HIPC Completion Point
34.
Liberia has made progress toward achieving a number of completion point
triggers: (i) Liberia’s full PRSP was finalized in April 2008; (ii) performance under the
PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory; and (iii) a revised investment incentive code
to ban tax exemptions other than those specified in the Liberia Revenue Code has been
finalized, and is expected to be submitted for legislative approval in early 2009. The
authorities have also: (i) submitted a comprehensive PFM law for legislative approval; (ii)
adopted a debt management strategy; (iii) passed legislation to establish an independent
anticorruption commission; and (iv) made progress in public reporting of extractive industry
financial flows consistent with EITI criteria. Implementation of these triggers for at least
twelve months is a requirement for reaching the completion point, and the authorities
affirmed their continuing commitment to achieving these completion point triggers
expeditiously. Staff considers that the completion point could be reached in 2010, as had
been assumed in the decision point debt sustainability analysis.
F. Financing Assurances
35.
The program is fully financed through 2009 through existing debt rescheduling
agreements. Following clearance of arrears to the World Bank and African Development
Bank in December 2007 and the IMF in March 2008, and a rescheduling agreement with the
Paris Club in April 2008, the authorities have continued seeking agreement with other
multilateral, official and private creditors consistent with the HIPC Initiative. The authorities
have continued discussions with private creditors, and expect that an agreement under the
World Bank’s Debt Reduction Facility could be reached in early 2009. Discussions have also
continued with non-Paris Club and other multilateral creditors—in this regard China has
announced its intention to forgive all outstanding claims, while IFAD, the Saudi Fund, OFID,
and BADEA have agreed to grant Liberia debt relief on terms fully consistent with the HIPC
initiative. Following cabinet approval of a debt management strategy, the authorities have
strengthened efforts to expand capacity of the debt management unit, including establishing a
mechanism for securing loan documents. Additionally, the authorities are seeking donor
support to acquire a debt management software package (a program benchmark).

22
G. Program Monitoring and Risks
36.
The second year of the program will cover the period through December 2009.
The program will be monitored on the basis of biannual quantitative performance criteria for
June 30 and December 31, 2009, and indicative targets for March 31 and September 30, 2009
(MEFP, Table 3). Structural conditionality is consistent with the government’s PRSP (MEFP,
Table 4). Staff and the authorities agreed to eliminate the program conditionality related to
the ceiling on CBL expenditure in order to allow the CBL to undertake important capital
expenditures if income performance is better than projected.
37.
Although the authorities are firmly committed to reform, there are considerable
risks ahead. They relate to continued significant capacity constraints and the need for the
cooperation of the opposition-led legislature. Furthermore, continued donor support would be
important to support achieving a number of program objectives. Additionally, current global
economic developments pose a risk for Liberia’s short-term economic prospects (see ¶10).
H. Outreach
38.
Staff met with key representatives of the legislature, civil society, donors, and the
private sector. Members of civil society were concerned about the slow pace of translating
improvements in growth into improvement in the welfare of individuals and about potential
weaknesses in the anticorruption framework. They noted the need for closer dialogue with the
government on these and other policy issues and considered the participatory PRSP to be a
step in the right direction. Cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of
government remains important for achieving program objectives. Staff met with key
legislative representatives to discuss progress on the program. They noted the recent passage
of the legislation on the Bureau of the Budget and on governance and also stressed the
importance of close dialogue with the executive branch. Meeting with members of the donor
community, the staff emphasized the need to ensure that their support is aligned with the
PRSP, particularly since most donor support is not yet going through the government budget,
and the need for continued financial support to assist the government in its response to higher
commodity prices.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The staff welcome the prudent fiscal and monetary policies being adopted in
Liberia. In the past two years the authorities have limited government spending to available
cash resources and kept the exchange rate generally stable. Growth has been robust, foreign
investment has increased, and core inflation has remained under control.
40.
The authorities’ response to higher food and fuel prices was appropriate. Their
comprehensive food security strategy aims to mitigate the impact of domestic rice price
increases, ensure domestic supply and access to food for vulnerable households through
safety nets, and promote domestic production. Looking forward the authorities should

23
continue to focus on securing donor support to finance the strategy in view of limited public
resources.
41.
Performance on the PRGF-supported program through June 2008 was
satisfactory, and the program remains on track. In particular the staff commends the
Executive and Legislature for their continued commitment to strengthening PFM, improving
governance and establishing an institutional framework focused on combating corruption.
Policies for the second year of the program are appropriately aimed at continued progress in
strengthening PFM, monetary and financial sector policies, and governance, and improving
data availability and quality. Continued donor support will be important for reaching program
objectives.
42.
The staff considers that economic prospects for 2009 remain favorable. Real
growth is projected to rise strongly with the expected resumption of logging and iron ore
mining operations, inflation is projected to decline to single digits, and the current account
deficit is likely to narrow. However, a sharper-than-projected slow-down in global growth, or
stronger decline in world commodity prices, could reduce demand for Liberia’s key exports,
or delay investment activity in these sectors, more than projected.
43.
Revenue projections in the 2008/09 (July-June) budget are subject to downside
risks, particularly stemming from assumed one-off nontax revenue sources. The
authorities should put in place an effective cash flow management system as soon as possible
and, in the meantime, identify potential expenditure reductions in case revenue shortfalls
materialize.
44.
The staff does not consider the Liberian dollar to be either over- or undervalued.
However, a marked appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the last quarter of 2008 is likely to
contribute to slower growth through its impact on Liberia’s main exports. The main factors
affecting Liberia’s international competitiveness are inadequate infrastructure and an
institutional environment that is not conducive to private sector development. Continued
donor support for rebuilding infrastructure will be critical.
45.
The staff consider that the high level of dollarization has contributed positively
to the stability of the economy in Liberia’s postconflict environment. While the
authorities would like to encourage greater use of the Liberian dollar, staff urge that policy
initiatives to strengthen the demand for Liberian dollars should be market-based and focus on
strengthening policy credibility and developing the financial market.
46.
Staff agrees that the current monetary policy framework, given a high
dollarization, has contributed to maintenance of relative price stability. However, the
staff emphasized that the CBL should not attempt to target a specific level for the exchange
rate, and in particular not to resist persistent downward pressure on the exchange rate due to
exogenous shocks.

24
47.
Staff support the waiver of nonobservance for the structural performance
criterion on the adoption of legislation to merge the Bureau of the Budget into the
Ministry of Finance by end-June 2008. Legislation to this effect was approved in
September, and since then the authorities have made strong progress in effecting the merger.
Staff also support the request for modification of the quantitative performance criteria for
end-December 2008 relating to the floors on revenue collection and the fiscal balance, and
for the CBL, the floor on the budget balance and the ceiling on expenditure. Based on the
performance to date, staff recommends completion of the first review under the PRGFsupported arrangement.

The cost is net of estimated value of goods and services purchased by UNMIL (and its staff) in Liberia.
Up to 2007 interest payments are charged on total stock of debt. After 2007, they are charged on debt stock after application of traditional debt
relief mechanisms.
3
UNMIL operations are projected to decline in the years ahead, thus impacting negatively on services receipts in the
current account.

GDP in millions of US dollars
Sources: Liberian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

1/ Starting in 2008/09, this represents debt service due after traditional debt relief mechanisms until the completion point is reached. Projections assume completion point for the second half of 2009/10.
2/ Contributions to the domestic debt trust fund are reported as a financing item.
3/ Until fiscal year 2009/10, budgets are assumed to be balanced on a cash-basis, with borrowing projected to start in 2010/11. Non-zero fiscal balances reported up to 2009/10 are due to some budget expenditures, including
payment of arrears, amortization and payments to the domestic debt trust fund, being reported as financing items. Beginning with 2008/09, debt relief in the interim HIPC period is also shown as a financing item. The 2008/09 budget
assumes a drawdown of previously accumulated cash balances.
4/ Amount of debt relief expected beyond traditional mechanisms.
5/ Includes pre-NTGL wage and foreign mission arrears.

Sources: Liberian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Budget is shown on a cash basis, i.e. debt service payments are shown after all debt relief.
2/ Contributions to the domestic debt trust fund are reported as a financing item.
3/ Until fiscal year 2009/10, budgets are assumed to be balanced on a cash-basis, with borrowing projected to start in 2010/11. Non-zero fiscal balances reported up to 2009/10 are due to some budget expenditures, including payment
of arrears, amortization and payments to the domestic debt trust fund, being reported as financing items. The 2008/09 budget assumes a drawdown of previously accumulated cash balances.
4/ Amount of debt relief expected beyond traditional mechanisms.
5/ Includes pre-NTGL wage and foreign mission arrears.

Appendix I – Letter of Intent
Monrovia, December 3, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The attached memorandum updates our policy framework supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as set out in our Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) of February 27, 2008. It describes our policies for the period
January-December 2009.
Liberia was significantly affected by the sharp rise in world food and fuel prices in the
first half of 2008; year-on-year inflation peaked at almost 27 percent in August, and the trade
deficit in the first three quarters of the year was double that recorded in the same period of
last year. Recognizing its limited own resources, the government formulated a comprehensive
food security policy with the assistance of key international donors to protect the most
vulnerable segments of our society. However, despite these challenges, economic activity
remained strong, with real GDP growth of around 7 percent, and we made further good
progress in implementing our poverty reduction strategy. We are cognizant of the risks posed
by current global financial market turmoil, and the possibility for spill-over into the real
sector, but are optimistic about our economic prospects for 2009.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program through June 2008 has been strong;
we have met all of the quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria under the program,
as well as all of the structural benchmarks and performance criteria, although the
performance criterion relating to the merger of the Bureau of the Budget into the Ministry of
Finance was met with a slight delay. Legislation to allow the Bureau of the Budget to be
merged into the Ministry of Finance (an end-June 2008 performance criterion), a key element
of our program to strengthen public finance management, was passed by the legislature in
September 2008. Since then we have made strong progress to effect the merger, including
through the employment of a change management adviser to advise us on the new
organizational structure of the Ministry of Finance. We are confident that the merger will be
completed by end-December 2008, and we therefore request a waiver of nonobservance with
respect to this performance criterion.

38
The Government of Liberia and the CBL believe that the economic and financial
policies set forth in the attached memorandum provide an adequate basis for achieving the
objectives and targets of our program, but we will take any additional measures that may
become necessary for this purpose. We will consult closely with the IMF staff on the
adoption of such measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP. We will provide the Fund with all information necessary to monitor implementation
of the program supported by the PRGF in a timely manner. Moreover, after the period
covered by these arrangements, and while Liberia has outstanding financial obligations to the
IMF arising from loan disbursements under the arrangements, we will consult with the IMF
from time to time, at the initiative of the government, or whenever the Managing Director of
the IMF requests consultation on Liberia’s economic and financial policies. Two program
and financing assurances reviews will be conducted during the second year of the program
and are expected to be completed by end-October 2009 and end-April 2010.
On the basis of this performance, and on the strength of the policies set forth in the
attached memorandum, we request that the IMF complete the first review under the PRGF
arrangement and approve the second disbursement (in the amount of SDR 7.0 million).
We remain committed to transparent policy-making and are willing to make the
contents of this letter and those of the attached MEFP and technical memorandum of
understanding, as well as the staff report for the 2008 Article IV consultation discussions and
first review under the PRGF available to the public.

Sincerely yours,

/s/
Augustine Ngafuan
Minister of Finance

Attachment I – Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
for January–December 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum describes the Government of Liberia’s achievements in 2008
under the program supported by the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
and Extended Fund Facility (EFF). We also describe our annual program of economic and
financial policies for January to December 2009.
2.
Under our economic program in 2008, we have maintained broad macroeconomic
stability and successfully implemented critical structural reforms aimed at strengthening
governance, public financial management, and financial sector stability. Our economic
achievements thus far, and our program for 2009, reflect our continued commitment to sound
economic policies consistent with the national medium-term objectives that we have outlined
in our three year Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) which was established in April 2008.
II. POVERTY REDUCTION AND GROWTH STRATEGY
3.
Our three-year PRS that is supported by the PRGF/EFF arrangement was finalized in
April 2008 following a participatory process involving all levels of society and our
international partners. The central objectives of the PRS are to firmly establish a stable and
secure environment across Liberia; to be on an irreversible path toward rapid, inclusive and
sustainable growth and development; to rebuild the capabilities of and provide new
opportunities for Liberia’s greatest asset–its people–and to have established responsible
institutions of justice, human rights, and governance.
4.
The strategy to achieve these objectives is built on four pillars: (i) consolidating peace
and security; (ii) revitalizing the economy; (iii) strengthening governance and the rule of law;
and (iv) rehabilitating infrastructure and delivering basic services. All four pillars are critical
for establishing the foundation for sustained growth and development, and actions in one
pillar reinforce actions taken in others.
5.
In the context of this memorandum, the basic strategy for economic growth and
poverty reduction is particularly important. There are three basic prongs to our growth
strategy:
•

First, we must rebuild our infrastructure, particularly roads. The PRS process revealed
that across the country, Liberians’ number one priority is better roads, which Liberians
see as essential for creating jobs and new economic opportunities, revitalizing
agriculture, reducing prices, strengthening local governance, facilitating access to
health and education services, increasing the effectiveness of the police and other
security forces, and helping to maintain peace.

40
•

Second, we must quickly revive our traditional sources of economic growth – rubber,
timber, mining and cash crops – and ensure that the benefits accrue to all Liberians in a
sustainable manner. Concession contracts aim to balance the need to generate
competitive returns for investors with the need for robust and transparent financial
flows. The Government is working hard to revitalize agriculture as the bedrock of the
economy, as it provides livelihoods for the majority of Liberians, and this has become
even more important in the context of the global food crisis. A vibrant agricultural
sector is central to reducing poverty, providing food security, and ensuring progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals.

•

Third, the Government is beginning to take strong steps to diversify the economy over
the medium term into the competitive production of labor-intensive downstream
products, manufactured goods, and services. It aims to create an open economy with a
strong business environment with low tariff and non-tariff barriers, strong linkages to
international markets, minimal government intervention except where necessary to
address market failure, and low levels of red tape and unproductive regulation.

6.
In all of these activities, the private sector will be the main driver of growth. Of
course, economic growth alone will not ensure poverty reduction. But taken together with
actions across the pillars—creating a peaceful and secure environment, building strong
institutions of governance, and delivering effective health and education services—these
actions will provide the foundation for rapid, sustainable and equitable growth. The actions
described in this memorandum are all taken to further the objectives of Liberia’s PRS.
7.
For the three-year period 2008/09-2010/11, we estimate the total cost of
implementing the PRS at US$1.6 billion. We expect to be able to finance about a third of this
with our own resources, which leaves a funding gap of approximately US$1.1 billion, or
about US$370 million per year. While the precise level of donor support is uncertain—
improving data collection and strengthening aid management is one of our key priorities—
present donor support, while extremely important, does not fill the funding gap, and is not
always fully aligned with the PRS. 1 In particular, our highest priority in the PRS,
infrastructure, continues to need funding. Owing to the near absence of donor support
through the budget, we are actively working on a mechanism to better coordinate and manage
aid in line with the PRS priorities. We expect our national budget to be the central instrument
for coordination of donor assistance and PRS alignment. We would therefore welcome higher
levels of budgetary support to provide us with greater fiscal space over time. We have made

1

According to the OECD, total official development assistance (ODA) to Liberia in 2006 was US$269 million.
We are in the process of refining our detailed estimates of the PRS programs and of donor support following the
June 2008 Berlin Partners’ conference.

41
great strides in improving our public financial management systems. Going forward, we
remain committed to deepening and strengthening the PFM reform program.
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
8.
Liberia’s economy continued its strong recovery in 2008 with growth estimated at
about 7 percent. The pace of economic growth continues to reflect our natural resource
sectors—in particular agriculture, domestic forestry activity, and mining; the service sector
also continues its strong recovery supported by a large donor presence, construction services,
and the expansion of government activity.
9.
Liberia has, however, been hit hard by the global surge in food and fuel prices.
In 2008, our trade deficit is estimated to have widened by 17 percent of GDP owing to these
shocks. Rice is an important part of Liberians daily diet, and the surge in international
prices—around 120 percent in the twelve months to September—poses a severe risk to food
security as two thirds of rice consumption in Liberia is imported. To mitigate the impact of
these shocks, we have (given our limited resources) implemented a number of measures: (i)
with the help of our development partners expanded food aid to vulnerable households,
including school children; (ii) secured rice seed and farm tools for small farmers and
approved two large concession agreements for commercial rice production; and (iii)
suspended the rice import levy as well as import duties on agricultural tools and raw
materials. The suspension of the rice import levy resulted in a revenue loss of about
US$3 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007/08 and will cost a further US$8 million in
FY2008/09. To mitigate the poverty impact of higher prices, we also increased the minimum
wage for civil servants by close to 30 percent in our FY 2008/09 budget and eliminated the
withholding tax on annual incomes of up to US$840. These measures are consistent with our
broader civil service and tax reform strategies. To provide some limited relief to users of
public transportation in greater Monrovia, we have provided a small fuel subsidy to the
public transit authority in Monrovia, while maintaining our policy of full pass through of all
international fuel prices to the domestic market.
10.
Notwithstanding the rise in international food and oil prices, we have maintained
broad macroeconomic stability supported by our implementation of a cash-based balanced
budget, and the achievement of broad exchange rate stability. While the overall inflation rate
reached 20 percent year-on-year in September, core inflation, i.e. excluding food and fuel
prices, was just over 7 percent. The Liberian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange depreciated by
3.2 percent in the twelve months to September. Given the high degree of dollarization and
openness of the economy, the broad stability of the exchange rate has been significant in
restraining domestic inflation. For 2009, we expect inflation to subside significantly to
single-digit levels as international food and oil prices fall somewhat from their currently high
levels and domestic food production increases.

42
IV. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH 2008
A. Fiscal Policy
11.
In the execution of the FY 2007/08 cash-based budget, we made substantial gains in
revenue collection as revenues rose by close to 40 percent compared to FY 2006/07. This is
almost 10 percent higher than the budget target. Our strong performance reflects the
continued strong economy, iron ore concession payments, and gains from the reorganization
of domestic tax administration. Total expenditures (including payment of arrears) increased
by about 50 percent relative to the previous fiscal year, broadly in line with the budget.
Budget implementation was supported by further progress in strengthening the procurement
capacity of line ministries which reduced the rejection rate of vouchers at the commitment
stage. We observed the program target for the fiscal balance by a comfortable margin and did
not accumulate any new domestic payment arrears (Table 1).
12.
We have made considerable progress advancing the legislative agenda for improving
public financial management. On March 14, 2008, the Legislature passed legislation to limit
transfers between budget lines without legislative approval to a cumulative total of no more
than 20 percent (end-March 2008 performance criterion). This Law will help us to improve
accountability and predictability of budget execution. In September the Legislature passed the
law for the merger of the Bureau of Budget (BoB) into the Ministry of Finance (MoF). This
Legislation was an end-June 2008 performance criterion, Table 2), which is a key step toward
overcoming the present segmentation of budget preparation and execution. We have put in
place a high level committee to make final recommendations on integration issues and expect
to complete the merger by end-December 2008 (end-December 2008 benchmark). In
September, we also submitted a new comprehensive Public Financial Management Act to the
Legislature (an end-December performance criterion). We are working closely with the
relevant legislative subcommittees with a view to approving this important legislation in
January 2009.
13.
The budget for FY 2008/09 continues our policy of maintaining a cash-based budget
that precludes borrowing. The budget consists of a base budget and a contingent budget.
Expenditure items in the latter will only be spent if contingent revenue projections are
realized (they are more uncertain than those in the base budget) and if the base budget is not
experiencing underperformance in revenue. We are in the process of formalizing procedures
to be adopted before end-December 2008 for the execution of Contingent Budget
expenditure, consistent with our Financial Rules and commitment control system. The
expenditure allocations in the base budget (US$270.2 million, including debt repayments) are
consistent with our commitment to allocate at least 55 percent of our total resources to PRS
implementation. These expenditures will be financed through collection of US$249 million
in revenue and the remainder through cash reserves accumulated in the previous fiscal year.
Part of the projected revenue collection, however, is related to concession payments (about

43
US$28.5 million linked to the Western Cluster and Bong mining concessions). With due
diligence on Bong Mines finalized, and the process of re-tender for the Western Cluster
begun, we expect to complete the concession awards in early 2009, but they could slip into
the following fiscal year. On the upside, we expect to receive about US$19 million in
budgetary support from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank that was
not included in the budget. Nevertheless, to guard against revenue risks, we are currently
considering contingency measures for reducing expenditures in case cash shortages
materialize. We are also working on a cash flow framework to help improve our cash
planning and management.
14.
We recognize the need to strengthen the commitment control process for county
development funds (CDF) which have increased in recent years. We have received financial
reporting for spending in the previous fiscal year and field inspections are underway. The
budget act for FY 2008/09 also specifies guidelines for improved accountabilities for these
funds that we intend to enforce. We are also conducting joint project monitoring exercises
with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
Improving the effectiveness of CDF spending as well as its transparency and accountability,
is an ongoing priority.
15.
We have made progress in preparing a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF, endDecember 2008 benchmark), which serves as a first step toward introducing a medium-term
perspective to budget preparation. We have developed a detailed MTFF-template that
captures most of our fiscal activities, but the underlying projection and financial
programming methodologies need to be further refined as our capacity for macroeconomic
analysis develops.
B. Governance and Public Financial Management
16.
We have made substantial progress in setting up an institutional framework for
combating corruption. The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) Act was signed
into law by the President on August 21, following which the Chairperson and other
Commissioners were appointed and confirmed by the legislature (establishment of the LACC
is an end-September 2008 performance criterion). Members of the LACC have been
commissioned by the President. The LACC is charged with investigating acts of corruption
discovered or reported to have occurred in public, private, and civil society sectors of Liberia,
and also has independent prosecutorial powers. We expect that with donor support, the
LACC will be fully functional by end-December 2008.
17.
The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is an integral part of our
policy to achieve accountable and transparent resource governance. To promote this
initiative, we issued in September 2008 a proclamation making disclosure and publication of
information on revenue and payment transactions covered under EITI binding on all
government agencies as well as extractive companies operating in Liberia. We also intend to

44
proceed with the drafting of specific legislation that will deepen our commitment to the EITI
principles in Liberia.
18.
In line with our commitment to greater transparency, the General Auditing
Commission (GAC) has completed several audits including of the MoF, the consolidated
revenue and expenditure accounts of the government for FY 2006/07, and several
commissions, funds and autonomous agencies. The GAC has highlighted the need for
improvements in public financial management systems, procedures, and reporting, including
internal audit capacity, on which we are actively working as part of our broad PFM reforms.
19.
We have begun the preparatory work for introducing an IFMIS, which is targeted to
become fully operational on July 1, 2010. The World Bank is supporting us with this project.
We will implement this system in a phased modular approach, with the first phase
encompassing (i) a general ledger (critical for accounting and reconciliation functions), (ii) a
cash management module (for handling bank reconciliation and cash forecasting), (iii) an
accounts payable module (critical for commitment control), (iv) an accounts receivable
module for recording revenue receipts), (v) a budget preparation module, and (vi) a payroll
management module. We have finalized the project charter that defines the major goals and
objectives of this project, contains a risk analysis, and sets milestones and key dates.
C. Monetary Policy
20.
The CBL has met all of the quantitative program targets through June, and all
structural program conditionalities. We achieved our key objectives of implementing a
balanced operational budget and further building up the net foreign exchange position. The
latter increased to US$47 million in September from US$35.1 million at end-2007. Monetary
policy in the first three quarters of 2008 was aimed at maintaining relative stability of the
Liberian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate, the main policy anchor. While year-on-year
inflation accelerated in the year, this was mostly because of large increases in international
commodity prices and in the prices of domestically produced food items. We are cognizant
that a sustained real appreciation can undermine our international competitiveness. The
growth strategy outlined in the PRS also suggest that reforms in the real sector, in particular
infrastructure development, are the critical factors for reducing production costs and
developing our economic potential.
21.
We have made substantial progress in strengthening the domestic banks as evidenced
by a strong increase in the capital adequacy of the banking system. We also established a
system for regular on-site and off-site inspection of each operating bank, and will continue its
implementation in 2009. We took stock of all operating banks and published a list of banks
licensed to operate in Liberia as part of our strategy for the resolution of abandoned and nonoperating banks (end-March 2008 benchmark). The number of banks operating in Liberia
increased to six, with the opening of a new bank in July 2008. The CBL has granted
provisional licenses to two additional banks, one with a focus mainly on microfinance, whose

45
ownership includes the International Finance Corporation and the African Development
Bank.
D. External Policies and Debt Resolution
22.
As covered in our PRS, Liberia’s comparative advantage lies in natural resourcebased industries. This was also confirmed by the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study which
explored options for promoting trade and growth. We also recognize that over time we
should not rely solely on natural resources, and must take steps to diversify our economy and
increase competitiveness in downstream products, manufacturing and services. To realize our
economic potential, the study makes recommendations to strengthen financial services, the
investment climate (infrastructure development is the foremost challenge), improve customs
and trade facilitation, and develop sectoral strategies to promote agricultural and natural
resource sectors.
23.
Cabinet endorsed our debt management strategy for addressing Liberia’s external and
domestic debt overhang as well as establishing the institutional and legal framework for debt
management (end-June 2008 benchmark): 2
•

The resolution strategy for Liberia’s external debt overhang is based primarily on the
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. Following the decision point under the
HIPC Initiative in March 2008, we negotiated in April a generous restructuring of our
bilateral debt with the Paris Club. Since then, we have signed individual agreements with
the U.S.A, Germany and Denmark, and are close to finalizing agreements with several
other countries. We are seeking comparable debt relief terms from our non-Paris Club
and commercial creditors. Regarding the former, China has announced its intention to
forgive all our outstanding debt, and IFAD, the Saudi Fund, OFID, and BADEA have
agreed to treat our debt on terms fully consistent with the HIPC initiative. To settle our
commercial debt, we are now working on a potential buy-back operation with support
from the World Bank and other donors within the framework of the IDA Debt Reduction
Facility. The reconciliation of outstanding claims of commercial creditors has already
been concluded.

•

We have completed the validation of our domestic debt claims by creditors and, after
application of a discount, accepted claims of US$300.5 million, with the Central Bank of
Liberia being our largest creditor. We have finalized agreements with the CBL, LBDI,
and ECOBANK whose total discounted claims amount to US$267.9 million, and we

The strategy has been approved by the President, and was presented to and endorsed by Cabinet during its
meeting on June 20, 2008. It is being implemented during FY 2008/09.

46
expect to settle these claims over the next 40 years. We have also made significant
progress with payments on vendor and other claims.
•

To strengthen our institutional debt management capacity, we have assigned
responsibility for recording and managing public debt statistics, reviewing loan
documents, and assessing concessionality levels of new borrowing to the Debt
Management Unit within MoF. The immediate task is rebuilding the debt database and
implementing a secure record keeping mechanism for existing loan documents. We have
also begun a discussion with development partners for assistance to procure a debt
management software package. Given our limited debt management capacity at this stage
and the external debt overhang, we are not planning to contract or guarantee any new debt
in 2009 (this applies also to state-owned enterprises and the CBL).
E. Other Structural Reforms

24.
The civil service reform strategy was endorsed by Cabinet in June 2008 (endJune 2008 benchmark). The goal of this reform is to create a robust, professional, and
adequately compensated civil service that effectively and efficiently delivers high quality
services to the people aimed at improving and sustaining their quality of life. The strategy
comprises six key reform components: (i) restructuring and right sizing; (ii) pay and pension
reforms; (iii) improving public service delivery; (iv) human resources management; (v)
leadership development; (vi) gender equity. Work is advancing on the implementation of the
bio-metric identification cards, and on the pay and pension reform strategies.
25.
We also finalized in July 2008 a National Statistical Development Strategy (endMarch 2008 benchmark). This strategy lays out the institutional arrangements to improve the
comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of critical national statistics required to monitor
the PRS implementation. In light of their importance, we have prioritized economic statistics,
including national accounts, and the household income and expenditure surveys to be
completed by 2010.
V. 2009 PROGRAM
A. Fiscal Policy
26.
We plan to submit early in 2009 a number of amendments to the Liberia Revenue
Code (LRC):
•

Changes to income taxation: effective in early 2009, we intend to reduce the top
personal income and corporate tax rates from 35 to 30 percent and lower the
presumptive income tax rate from 4 to 2 percent on turnover. We also intend to enact
a minimum income tax threshold.

47
•

Investment incentives: the revised investment code will restrict all tax exemptions to
those contained in the LRC, which is a completion point trigger under the HIPC
Initiative. To limit the scope for discretionary tax incentives, we will also repeal
section 204(e) of the LRC, and replace it with a more transparent schedule of
investment incentives for selected economic sectors beyond the general provisions of
the LRC.

•

Income taxation of agricultural, renewable, and natural resources (mining and
petroleum): this amendment will codify general fiscal terms for the most important
concession agreements, thereby further restricting the scope for discretion and
ensuring best practice in an area that is vital for our economic development and that
will become a key revenue source over the medium to long run.

•

Reform of the Goods and Services Tax (GST): to strengthen our revenue potential
and harmonize our tax rates with those of our neighbors, we will raise the GST rate
on all goods and services (except food) in a number of steps from 7 to 10 percent, and
we will extend the GST coverage to telecommunication services, gambling services,
hotel services, and airline tickets. The raising of GST rates will be done on a phased
implementation basis, beginning with telecommunications services.

•

External tariff reform: we are committed to a phased implementation of the
ECOWAS common external tariff (CET) by 2012 and will begin this process in 2009
by adopting the ECOWAS tariff book. In a first step toward tariff harmonization, we
will reduce rates that are above the CET. The revenue impact will be compensated for
by an increase in excise taxes in line with our medium term tax reform program.

27.
The next phase of our revenue administration reform centers on automation of tax and
customs administration. The World Bank is supporting us in procuring and installing an
integrated tax administration system (ITAS); for the automation of customs administration,
we intend to use budget support resources from the AfDB to acquire the ASYCUDA system
developed by UNCTAD. To enhance customs services, we plan for March 2009, the opening
of a one-stop customs facility in the port of Monrovia that will house representatives from
customs, the port authority, the PSI company, and the CBL.
28.

We are planning several initiatives for 2009 to improve budget execution:
•

Improving procurement practices: we have reviewed the Public Procurement
Concession Act and prepared a number of amendments (e.g., raising of thresholds for
competitive biddings) to be submitted to the Legislature in early 2009. Following
legislative passage, we are going to prepare and issue a comprehensive set of
implementing regulations and manuals that will provide detailed instructions on the
correct application of the law. We will also begin to publish regularly procurement
information and summaries of contract awards. Finally, we will continue our training

48
programs to strengthen procurement capacity within line ministries and to ensure
smooth implementation of the procurement plans of the Ministries and Agencies
(M&As).
•

Further strengthening of payroll management: building on a pilot program for direct
deposit of salaries and allowances currently under way in some M&As, we plan to
introduce this more widely in 2009. As part of the implementation of our civil service
reform strategy, we also aim to approve a pay reform strategy that consolidates base
salaries and allowances and help make the civil service more attractive for qualified
staff by decompressing the pay scale.

•

Better reconciliation between MoF and CBL: currently, the large number of checks
issued and the need for manual reconciliation represents a major bottleneck. To move
toward automatic reconciliation, we plan to fully deploy a software system with
accounting and reconciliation functions. This will also help us to move toward a
double-entry accounting standard within MoF. To this end, we intend to approve the
accounting standards and an updated chart of accounts currently under development
by end-June 2009 (end-June 2009 benchmark). Following completion of the training
program for MoF accountants, we will adopt double entry accounting by endJune 2009 in MoF. Training programs will continue for accountants of other line
ministries in preparation of extension of double-entry accounting throughout the
government.
B. Governance and Public Financial Management

29.
We recognize the critical importance of a strong legal foundation for public financial
management. 3 We have therefore maintained active dialogue with members of the
Legislature with a view to facilitating passage of the PFM Law in early 2009. In anticipation
of the new Law, we have also secured technical assistance from the IMF for the preparation
of the implementing regulations for the Law, which we intend to issue no later than endJune 2009.
30.
We expect to finalize our first EITI report in early 2009.4 We also intend to proceed
with the drafting of specific legislation that will deepen our commitment to the EITI
principles in Liberia which also covers activities in the forestry sector.

3

Implementing the PFM act and supporting financial regulations for at least 12 months is a completion point
trigger.

4

Regular reporting of payments and revenues related to the extractive industry in line with EITI criteria is
another completion point trigger

49
31.
A key objective of our external audit strategy is the completion of successive external
audits of five key ministries. 5 We expect the GAC to complete the FY 2006/07 audits of the
Ministries of Finance, Health, Education, Public Works, as well as Land, Mines and Energy
by end-January 2009. The audit reports will be submitted to the Legislature and disclosed
publicly. The corresponding audits for FY 2007/08 should be completed within the first half
of 2009. The GAC will also audit the central government’s accounts for FY 2007/08 and we
expect this report to be completed, submitted to Legislature, and made public by endMarch 2009, in time for the budget deliberations for FY 2009/10 (performance criterion).
C. Monetary Policy
32.
In 2009, monetary policy will continue to aim at maintaining relative exchange rate
stability, and with the recent decline in international commodity prices, notably for food and
fuel, we anticipate that inflation will decline to single digits by end-year. The CBL will
continue to operate a balance budget. However, this is likely to pose a challenge to meeting
the operational and developmental needs of the Bank in the wake of lower international
interest rates associated with the response in major financial centers to the international
financial crisis and the likelihood that its income could also potentially be affected by lower
average government cash balances in FY 2008/09. The CBL is therefore targeting a modest
build up on its net foreign exchange position to US$62.7 million at the end of
December 2009. Meanwhile, the CBL will also conduct foreign exchange auctions aimed at
maintaining broad exchange rate stability of the Liberian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar,
which is the major anchor for containing inflation. Efforts will also continue to strengthen the
monetary policy framework and to strengthen supervision capacity to safeguard the banking
system from the contagion risks associated with the ongoing international financial crisis,
although Liberian commercial banks have limited exposure to international capital markets.
In this regard, the CBL will engage with domestic banks as well as regular public statements
to enhance public understanding of the current monetary framework. Given the importance of
the foreign exchange auction to its monetary policy, the CBL intends to finalize the foreign
exchange auction rules including regulations for the conduct of purchase auctions and the
direct placement of foreign exchange through foreign exchange bureaus, and will publicize
these rules by end-March 2009. The CBL will also collect more data on volumes in the
foreign exchange market and the flow of remittances, and will continue efforts to regularize
the large number of informal foreign currency traders. Steps will be taken to support the
demand for Liberian dollars, including working with the fiscal authorities to increase the use
of the Liberia dollar in government revenue and expenditure operations.
33.
We will continue to work closely with all operating banks to ensure they follow
prudent credit risk management and loan classification policies, and under supervision of the
5

A completion point trigger.

50
Banking Compliance Committee, will ensure that banks implement all corrective actions
noted in CBL directives. In this regard, we will continue implementing our comprehensive
system for quarterly off-site inspections and on-site inspections (two each per bank per year).
To implement these inspections will require two full inspection teams, and will require
additional staff and training in the Banking Supervision department. We intend to seek
continuing IMF technical assistance in this regard. By the end of September 2009, the CBL
plans to complete its first half-yearly on-site inspection report for each bank. Going forward,
we expect the number of banks operating in Liberia by mid-2009 to reach a total of nine.
However, a temporary moratorium on licensing of additional banks has been put in place,
unless there are very clear mitigating circumstances which call for a special dispensation by
the Board of the CBL. In any event, particular attention will be given to the limitations of the
domestic market as well as the ability of the CBL to effectively exercise its regulatory
responsibilities. To further strengthen the domestic financial sector, we will finalize
comprehensive anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism legislation. The
Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa, has agreed to
assist in the drafting of such legislation.
34.
The CBL’s income in the first three quarters of 2008 was higher than budgeted
(2.4 percent), while expenditures were 15 percent lower than budgeted. This enabled the CBL
to comfortably meet the program floor on its budget balance and its expenditure ceiling, and
to exceed the programmed accumulation of U.S. dollar reserves by US$3 million (7 percent).
For 2009, the CBL will continue to target a balanced budget in order to further strengthen its
reserves. During the year we have made substantial progress in strengthening internal
management and financial controls, as confirmed by the recent special audit by our external
auditors, and we are on target to complete work on implementing the International Financial
Reporting Standards accounting system at the CBL beginning with the 2008 financial
accounts. We have also strengthened internal controls at the CBL, including implementing
the key recommendations from the 2008 IMF safeguards assessment.
D. External Policies and Debt Resolution
35.
As part of our resolution strategy for the external debt overhang, we will finalize
in 2009 the remaining individual Paris Club agreements and continue our efforts to seek
comparable relief from our non-Paris Club creditors. We also expect to complete the
commercial debt buy-back operation in early 2009. To improve our debt management
capacity, we will complete the purchase of a debt management software early in 2009, upload
all relevant data, and make the system fully operational by the end of 2009. With the
completion point on the horizon, and having made progress in increasing our debt
management capacity, we will begin considering the appropriate timing, amounts, and
purposes for possible new concessional borrowing. This analysis will draw on the debt
sustainability analysis to be conducted jointly by the Debt Management Unit and the Macro

51
Fiscal Unit. After consultation with the IMF and World Bank, we will incorporate our new
borrowing approach into an updated debt management strategy.
36.
Regarding domestic debt payments, we will continue to make provisions in the budget
for our agreed payments on our restructured debts to the financial institutions, and on
payments for the validated and discounted debts within our available revenue envelope.
E. Other Structural Policies
37.
A key objective of the National Statistics Development Strategy is the compilation of
national accounts. Based on the establishment census completed in 2008, we will establish a
sample frame for, and conduct an establishment survey that covers non-agricultural
businesses. Using the 2008 population census, we will also establish a sample frame for a
household income and expenditure survey. In 2009, we intend to undertake additional
surveys, including on agriculture production, and mining. These surveys will provide us with
the necessary data to compile a first set of national accounts, with a first set of results
expected in 2010. Building on the progress thus far in completing balance of payments
statistics for 2004 to 2007, we plan to complete the 2008 balance of payments statistics
in 2009.
PROGRAM MONITORING
38.
The second year of the three-year PRGF- and EFF-supported program will continue to
be monitored on the basis of six-monthly quantitative performance criteria for June 30 and
December 31, 2009, and indicative targets for March 31 and September 30, 2009 (Table 3).
The structural conditionalities for the program shown in Table 4, are consistent with the goals
of our PRS.

Attachment II – Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Liberian authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and
structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the three-year PRGF/EFF program, as
well as the reporting requirements. The definitions are valid at the start of the program but
may need to be revisited during the program reviews to ensure that the memorandum
continues to reflect the best understanding of the Liberian authorities and the IMF staff in
monitoring the program.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
A. Test Dates
2.
Quantitative performance benchmarks have been set for end-March and endSeptember 2009, and quantitative performance criteria for end-June and end-December 2009.
B. Definitions and Computation
3.
For the purposes of the program, the Government is defined as the central
Government of Liberia (GoL). This definition excludes legally autonomous state-owned
enterprises whose budgets are not included in the central government budget. The operations
of the central government will be presented in U.S. dollars with all revenues and expenditures
that are denominated in Liberian dollars converted at the end of period exchange rate.
4.
Government revenue includes all tax and nontax receipts transferred into the U.S.
dollar GoL accounts at the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), including income and transfers
from state-owned enterprises and public institutions (excluding external loans and grants).
The GoL accounts at the CBL include the GoL General Account No. 2, the GoL Special Rice
Fund, and the Liberian dollar account at the CBL comprising the GoL General Account. Any
new accounts opened by the GoL at the CBL or at any other local financial agency shall be
reported to the IMF also. For the purposes of the program, the revenues of the GoL are
measured on the basis of cash deposits in the four accounts specified above converted to U.S.
dollars using the end of period exchange rate.
5.
The fiscal balance is defined as the difference between (a) government revenue
defined in paragraph 4 of this TMU (including budget support grants, but excluding
earmarked external loans and grants); and (b) government current expenditure plus capital
expenditure (excluding foreign-financed expenditure for earmarked purposes) on a
commitment basis.
6.
Noncash tax/duty payment is defined as any noncash settlement of duty/tax
obligations to the GoL through the exchange of goods or services.

57
7.
New domestic borrowing is defined as new claims on the central government since
the start of the program. It will be measured by the change in the stock of all outstanding
claims on the central government (loans, advances, and any government debt instruments,
such as long-term government securities) by the banking system. The definition also includes
the issuance of debt instruments by the GoL to the nonbank sector. For the purposes of
measurement, all claims in Liberian dollars will be converted at the end of period exchange
rate.
8.
New domestic arrears/payables of the government are calculated as the difference
between government payment commitments and the actual payments made on such
commitments, providing for a processing period of no more than 15 days from the date of
commitment. Actual payments are defined as having taken place on the date of issuance of
the checks by the Ministry of Finance. Government payment commitments include all
expenditure for which commitment vouchers have been approved by the Director of the
Bureau of General Accounting (BGA), and expenditure that are now automatically approved,
namely, wages and salaries, pensions, debt payments to the CBL and commercial banks, CBL
bank charges, and transfers of ECOWAS levies into the ECOWAS account.
9.
Contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt by the public sector. For the
purposes of the program, external debt applies not only to the meaning set forth in point
No. 9 of the "Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt" ( see
Decision No. 12274-00/85, August 24, 2000 attached in Annex I), but also to commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. In this memorandum, the
public sector consists of the central government, state-owned enterprises and the CBL.
10.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt that it
owes or guarantees, with the exception of external payments arrears arising from government
debt that is being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club creditors. Arrears on
external debt are defined as any unpaid obligation on the contractual due date. In cases where
a creditor has granted a grace period after the contractual due date, arrears are incurred
following the expiration of the grace period.
11.
Payment arrears of the CBL are calculated as the difference between payments due
on commitments from the start of the program and actual payments made on those
commitments. For the purpose of this memorandum, the CBL’s commitments due include all
expenditure for which goods and services have been delivered but have not been paid for.
12.
The CBL’s cash-based budget balance is defined as the difference between (a) total
revenues (the sum of interest income and non-interest income) on a cash basis; and (b) total
current expenditure plus capital expenditure, on a cash basis.
13.
The CBL’s net foreign exchange position is defined as the difference between (a)
the CBL’s gross foreign reserves, as currently defined in the monthly monetary survey and
(b) the sum of its gross foreign liquid liabilities and liquid liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars, as currently defined in the monthly monetary survey.

58
II. PROGRAM MONITORING
A. Program–Monitoring Committee
14.
The Liberian authorities shall maintain a program-monitoring committee composed of
senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the CBL, and other relevant agencies. The IMF

Annex 1: Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 24, 2000
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the
form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time;
these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.
Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures,
commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest,
by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until
some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use
for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service
life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made
during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not applicable

3

This schedule is not the currently applicable schedule of payments to the IMF. Rather, the schedule presents
all payments to the IMF under the illustrative assumption that repayment expectations – except for SRF
repayment expectations – would b extended to their respective obligation dates by the IMF Executive Board
upon request of the debtor country. SRF repayments are thus only shown on their current expectation dates,
unless already converted to an obligation date by the IMF Executive Board.

4

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts ca not be added.

5

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4
IX. Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) was completed in
August 2008. The update found that while the CBL had largely addressed the measures to
increase transparency recommended by the 2007 interim safeguards assessment, significant
risks exist in the control framework of the bank. Of particular concern during the course of
the assessment was a delay in the assumption of co–signing authority for CBL financial
matters by the Fund-supported Special Advisor. The assessment also found that internal audit
capacity was weak and that the Audit Committee was not exercising effective oversight of
CBL financial reporting, audit, and control systems. A priority measure to utilize the services
of an external auditor to conduct a series of special audits was completed in August 2008 and
it indicated that the monetary data submitted by the CBL are accurate and in compliance with
TMU definitions, and that progress has been made to improve some aspects of the overall
control environment, including the assumption of co–signing authority by the Special
Advisor. The CBL has also made progress in implementing other safeguards
recommendations, including drafting investment guidelines for CBL financial resources.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Liberia maintains an exchange rate system that is free of restrictions on payments for current
and capital transfers. The currency of Liberia is the Liberian dollar. The U.S. dollar is also
legal tender. The current exchange rate arrangement is a managed float, with no
predetermined path for the exchange rate. The exchange rate of the Liberian dollar is market
determined, and all foreign exchange dealers, including banks, are permitted to buy and sell
currencies. Liberia’s exchange rate at end-October 2008 was L$63.5=US$1.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Monrovia during February 16March 1, 2006 in Monrovia. The staff report (Country Report No. 06/166, 5/08/06) was
discussed by the Executive Board on April 26, 2006 and is posted on the IMF website.

Appendix III. Liberia—Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
There are serious shortcomings in the national accounts and balance of payments, which stem
mainly from lack of source data, limited scope, and appropriate timeliness; these
shortcomings have required Fund staff to estimate historical data in these areas.
2.
The government passed legislation in July 2004 to create the Liberia Institute of
Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS) as a semi-autonomous agency. This
agency will have the lead in coordinating and reestablishing national economic and social
statistics.
3.
As one of twenty-two countries participating in the GDDS Project for Anglophone
Africa, Liberia has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework to develop its national
statistical system. Metadata and plans for improving the data over the short and medium term
have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since October 24,
2005.
Real sector statistics
4.
National accounts data are estimates as opposed to statistics compiled on the basis of
a standard statistical methodology. Estimates of GDP by production and by sector
components are prepared by the LISGIS. The Fund staff has estimated total GDP by sectoral
origin for the period 1997–2006 with the assistance of the Ministry of Planning and
Economic Affairs (MPEA) and LISGIS. Estimates for GDP by expenditure are not available.
Consequently, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding estimates of the level and
growth rate of GDP, sectoral components, and all ratios to the GDP. STA urges that remedial
measures be included in the agenda for discussion with the authorities with close monitoring
of implementation. Improvements in data quality would require: (i) the establishment of a
national business register; (ii) the resumption of an annual Establishment Survey and
National Accounts Questionnaire for manufacturing, mining, utilities and agriculture; and,
(iii) a Household Income and Expenditure Survey is needed to develop reliable data on
informal household sector production activities as well as on expenditures by households.
Price statistics
5.
The CPI has been compiled since October 2005 jointly by the Central Bank of Liberia
(CBL) and LISGIS. Prior to January 2007, price data were based on the Monrovia Consumer
Price Index (MCPI) which contained a basket of only 79 items, which were weighted
according to a household income and expenditure survey from 1964. In January 2007, the
authorities formally adopted the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI). The HCPI is
based on an expanded basket of goods and services consistent with the ECOWAS
harmonized market basket, and updated weights (using consumption patterns in neighboring
countries in the absence of an updated household survey). A further review of weights should

9
take place once the results of the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire are available. The
June 2007 CPI technical assistance mission provided recommendations on the
implementation of the review of weights. The reference base retained for the new series was
set as December 2005=100.
Government finance statistics
6.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) regularly provides AFR with monthly disaggregated
data on government revenue and on government current and capital expenditure on a cash
and commitment basis. There is scope, for improving the quality of the government finance
statistics, including reporting on financing items and expenditures on domestic debt and
arrears. A 2006 STA mission noted several issues regarding data quality, including problems
in reporting customs revenue, problems in revenue classification, and lack of budget codes
for fiscal reporting. The authorities plan to adopt the GFSM 2001 methodology, and
additional requests for technical assistance could be forthcoming. The authorities have not
reported data for publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook and in the IFS.
Monetary and financial statistics
7.
The CBL has made progress in adopting the statistical methodology recommended in
the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. In November 2007, an STA monetary
and financial statistics (MFS) mission assisted the CBL to develop a framework for
compiling standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF and
resolve problems in the data reported by some commercial banks. Despite these
achievements, further steps are needed to strengthen the CBL’s accounting system, including
proper accounting of foreign reserves, segregating required reserves by currency
denomination, and adequate classification of other assets and liabilities. In addition, while the
reporting of preliminary statistics by commercial banks has improved, the response by banks
to requests for explanations and follow-up to inconsistencies continues to be weak. The
report of the Special Audit of the CBL in August 2008 proposed a number of steps to
improve the accounting data, including the reporting of arrears. An MFS follow-up mission
planned for 2009 will work with the new source data for the central bank to update the SRFs
for publication in the International Financial Statistics Supplement on Monetary and
Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments statistics and external debt
8.
Official balance of payments statistics are not reported comprehensively. However,
the Fund staff has prepared provisional balance of payments statistics in cooperation with the
CBL, the Ministry of Commerce, MPEA, and the MoF. The CBL is responsible for
compiling balance of payments statistics in coordination with other agencies. Some progress
has been made in compiling certain current and financial account components—mainly on
trade and related services, government expenditures, remittances, and on nonresident
deposits in the financial account. In November 2006 an STA mission set out

10
recommendations to strengthen compilation of balance of payments statistics in the CBL
including training of staff. In February 2008, an STA long-term advisor in balance of
payments statistics was assigned to the CBL to assist in improving balance of payments data.
With the support of STA, the authorities are developing a comprehensive balance of
payments data collection program to address the paucity of primary source data. In an effort
to reconcile the significant discrepancies in international trade statistics (ITS) reported by
various agencies, the CBL has also initiated work on a new ITS database aimed at
incorporating new data sources. The CBL has completed a census of foreign direct
investment enterprises in preparation for an FDI survey. The authorities have reported annual
balance of payments data for the period from 2004 to 2007 for publication in IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
9.
Significant gaps exist in the records of external public debt, particularly those related
to bilateral and commercial creditors. The 2006 STA mission identified inadequate staffing
and poor coordination with data providers as key impediments to improving balance of
payments and external debt statistics. A task force comprising staff seconded from the CBL,
MoF, MPEA, General Auditing Office and the Bureau of the Budget (BoB) is making
progress in obtaining loan agreements and financial statements from external creditors to
update the external debt database maintained by the MoF. On training, STA trained three
officials in 2005—one in balance of payments and two in debt statistics. Another official
from the CBL attended the 2007 INS BOP course in Washington D.C. The authorities have
also engaged the services of an international financial advisor to assist with rebuilding the
database on external commercial debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Liberia
On December 22, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Liberia. 1
Background
Over the past three years the Liberian authorities have achieved significant progress in laying a
sound foundation to support the country’s postwar reconstruction and sustain poverty-reducing
growth. Liberia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) lays out a comprehensive strategy
for sustaining higher growth by maintaining macroeconomic stability, attracting private
investment, and improving infrastructure, governance and security. Guided by its PRSP, Liberia
has made progress in strengthening public revenues and public finance management, revising
its institutions to improve governance, and strengthening the banking sector. The authorities’
efforts have been supported by considerable financial support from the international
community—donor support is estimated at US$85-$100 per capita—and passage of key
reforms by the Liberian legislature.
A key achievement has been the normalization of Liberia’s relations with the international
community. Long-standing arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank were
cleared in December 2007, and in March 2008, to the IMF. In April 2008, the authorities also
agreed on a comprehensive rescheduling of outstanding obligations to the Paris Club group of
creditors. The authorities are continuing discussions with other official and private creditors on
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

rescheduling Liberia’s obligations consistent with the requirements of the Enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
Economic activity in Liberia has been solid in 2008 despite the significant impact of large food
and fuel price increases; real GDP growth is estimated at about 7 percent (it was 9½ percent
in 2007). Growth in 2008 was supported in particular by continued recovery in agriculture and
healthy growth in construction services, as well as by the resumption of forestry-related
activities. However, year-on-year inflation surged, peaking at 26½ percent in August before
declining to 20 percent in September, mostly on account of higher food and fuel prices. These
developments also widened Liberia’s trade deficit by about 17 percentage points of GDP to
57 percent of GDP.
Responding to these developments is particularly challenging for Liberia given that around
64 percent of Liberians live below the minimum poverty line, the government has no access to
new borrowing, its international reserves equal less than one month’s imports, and monetary
policy implementation is limited by a very high level of dollarization. To deal with this, the
government developed a comprehensive food security strategy designed to: (i) mitigate the
impact of domestic rice price increases and ensure domestic supply; (ii) maintain access to food
for vulnerable households through safety nets; and (iii) promote domestic production.
Liberia improved its fiscal management further in 2007/08 (July-June). Government revenue,
boosted by the continued economic recovery and better revenue administration, increased by
36.7 percent over 2006/07, and exceeded the budget target by 5.7 percent. Expenditure, which
lagged revenues for most of the year (in part due to delayed passage of the budget), rose
sharply in June, resulting in overall spending of US$203.3 million against total appropriations of
$209.4 million, inclusive of a US$10 million supplementary budget late in the fiscal year. The
government’s balance at the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) increased to US$51.2 million from
US$40 million on account of the higher revenues and moderate underspending, as well as a
small amount of checks issued but not yet cashed.
The Liberian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate has been relatively stable in 2008, depreciating by
3.1 percent in the 12 months through October. This is consistent with Liberia’s current monetary
policy which targets exchange rate stability in the recognition that in its highly dollarized and
open economy, the foreign exchange market is the main channel through which monetary
impulses affect prices. The real effective exchange rate (REER) has also been relatively stable
since 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
While prospects for 2009 remain favorable, Directors noted the downside risks from a sharp fall
in global growth or in world commodity prices, and from potential shortfalls in donor financing.
Also, inflation remains high and the external current account deficit is large. Directors
highlighted the significant medium-term challenges facing Liberia, including the need to diversify
the economy—and, in particular, to develop the agricultural sector to enhance food security.

3
Directors called for continued fiscal prudence, and welcomed in this regard the authorities’
commitment to a balanced cash budget, with zero borrowing. They noted the projected
continued strong revenue growth and sharply higher current spending in 2009 and 2010. In view
of Liberia’s large reconstruction needs, Directors reiterated the importance of current
expenditure restraint, effective cash management, and the availability of sufficient grant
financing. They called for the identification of contingent expenditure cuts to cover any revenue
shortfalls.
Directors commended the authorities’ comprehensive food security strategy that was developed
in response to higher world commodity prices. They supported the focus on securing donor
financing for measures to mitigate the impact on the poor, and on policies to stimulate domestic
food production.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthening public financial management,
improving governance, and establishing an institutional framework to combat corruption. They
applauded the creation of the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission and the recommencement of
public auditing by the General Auditing Commission, and called for continued donor support of
these initiatives. They also stressed the importance of adopting a comprehensive Public
Financial Management law. Particularly important will be to strengthen budget planning and
execution and debt management in the context of a medium-term fiscal framework.
Directors supported efforts to strengthen central bank operations and improve the monetary
policy framework. They agreed that monetary policy is appropriately focused on maintaining
broad exchange rate stability in order to reduce inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, in view of
the low level of foreign exchange reserves, they believed that the authorities should not target a
specific level for the exchange rate. Directors urged continued progress in implementing the
recommendations of the safeguards assessment report on the central bank.
Directors considered that dollarization has served Liberia well by helping to stabilize the postconflict economy. They saw no urgency in reversing dollarization, and stressed that efforts to do
so over the medium term should be market-based, and focus on implementing credible
policies—including strengthening the banking sector and the payments system. In this regard,
Directors commended the banking sector reforms being implemented, and looked forward to
continued progress in this area. To address the possible impact of the recent dollar appreciation
on Liberia’s export competitiveness, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with
rebuilding Liberia’s infrastructure and reforms to support private sector development.
Directors stressed that continued steadfast pursuit of sound policies and reforms,
complemented by adequate external financial and technical assistance, will be crucial to
achieving the HIPC completion point and Liberia’s Millennium Development Goals.
Acknowledging the good progress being made towards meeting the completion point triggers, a
number of Directors took positive note of the authorities’ desire to reach the HIPC completion
point in 2009.

4
Directors noted that data deficiencies hamper surveillance and monitoring of program
implementation. They welcomed the finalization of Liberia’s medium-term national statistical
development plan, and the ongoing efforts to improve the national account statistics.
The next Article IV consultation with Liberia is expected to be held in accordance with the
relevant Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with Fund
arrangements.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 22, 2008

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review under PRGF Arrangement for
Liberia and Approves US$10.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review of Liberia's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review makes SDR 7 million (about
US$10.8 million) available to Liberia, which would bring total disbursements under the
arrangement to SDR 214.26 million (about US$331 million).
The Executive Board also granted a waiver for the non-observance of a structural
performance criterion related to the adoption of legislation by end-June 2008 to merge the
Bureau of the Budget into the Ministry of Finance, following passage of the legislation in
September 2008. The Board also completed the country's financing assurances review under
the arrangement.
The three-year PRGF arrangement for Liberia was approved by the Executive Board on
March 14, 2008 (see Press Release No 08/52) in an amount equivalent to SDR
239.02 million (about US$369.3 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Liberian authorities have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies and
structural reforms under their IMF-assisted program to support postwar reconstruction and
economic recovery. Important measures have been taken to strengthen public financial
management and fight corruption.
“Sound policies have contributed to strong economic growth, rising foreign direct
investment, a build-up of net international reserves, and broad exchange rate stability.
Economic prospects remain favorable. Nevertheless, the current global slowdown could
negatively affect foreign direct investment, exports, and remittance flows.

2

“The authorities responded appropriately to the challenges posed by higher fuel and food
prices in 2008. Their comprehensive food security strategy focuses on raising domestic food
production and securing donor resources to finance social safety net programs. Continued
donor support will be essential to ensure the success of the strategy, in view of the limited
availability of public resources.
“The 2008/09 (July-June) government budget assumes further strong revenue growth and
continues to limit spending to available cash resources. In this context, it will be important
for the authorities to utilize prioritized monthly cash plans and to identify expenditures that
could be reduced if revenue shortfalls were to materialize.
“Monetary policy focuses on maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate against the US
dollar to contain inflationary pressures. While this policy remains appropriate given the high
level of dollarization, the authorities are advised not to target a specific level for the
exchange rate, in view of the still low level of foreign exchange reserves.
“The authorities’ policies for the second year of the economic program are consistent with
Liberia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. They aim to build on progress to date in
strengthening public financial management, the monetary and financial sectors, and
governance, while improving data availability and quality,” Mr. Lipsky said.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Liberia
December 22, 2008
1.
The Liberian authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s continuous engagement
and value their support under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. The authorities also appreciate the candid exchange of views with staff
during discussions for the 2008 Article IV Consultation and the First Review under the
PRGF arrangement.
Recent economic developments
2.
Liberia’s economy has continued with its robust growth in 2008, albeit slower
than in the previous year. Real GDP growth is estimated at about 7 percent in 2008
compared to 9.5 percent last year, reflecting broad-based recovery in key sectors coming
from low-base levels of production, although output in agriculture and mining was lower
than projected. Inflation year-on-year increased in 2008, chiefly because of the surge in
global food and fuel prices, which also contributed to the widening of the external trade
deficit.
3.
The surge in international price of rice, around 120 percent in the twelve months
to September 2008, poses a severe risk to food security in a country where rice is the
staple and is mostly imported. To mitigate the impact of these shocks, the Liberian
authorities implemented a number of measures to ensure food security and to ameliorate
the impact of the higher prices on vulnerable households. They also provided a limited
fuel subsidy to the public transit authority in Monrovia, while maintaining a policy of full
pass through of all international fuel prices to the domestic market. These limited
measures are considered essential for a country where over 75 percent of the population
live below the poverty line.
Performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
4.
The Liberian authorities have continued to show their strong commitment to
implementing the policies intended in the PRGF-supported program, despite severe
capacity constraints. Performance through June 2008 was satisfactory, and the program
remains on track. All quantitative targets were achieved, and all structural benchmarks
were met except one -- adopting the legislation to merge the Bureau of the Budget with
the Ministry of Finance an end-June criterion that was met in September.
5.
Fiscal management improved in 2007/08 with the authorities’ continued
implementation of a cash-based budget. During the period, the authorities redoubled their
efforts to mobilize revenue and, helped by the continued robust economic performance
revenue collection rose, by almost 40 percent. Several measures were also taken to
improve budget execution, including strengthening the procurement capacity of line
ministries.
6.
The authorities consider that given the high degree of dollarization and openness
of the economy, maintaining relative stability of the Liberian dollar/US dollar exchange

2
rate remains an essential policy anchor to keep domestic inflation under control. The
Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) has performed well on its objective to build up the net
foreign exchange position, which increased to US$47 million in September from US$35
million at end-2007. Liberia’s banking sector has also remained resilient to the contagion
effects, despite the global financial turbulence, mainly as a result of reforms to the
banking system, including strengthening of bank supervision, increasing the regulatory
capital adequacy ratio and the minimum capital requirements.
HIPC completion point
7.
Liberia has made a considerable progress toward achieving a number of
completion point triggers. These include the finalization of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in April 2008, satisfactory performance under the PRGFsupported program, and a revised investment code, which is awaiting legislative approval
in January 2009. The recent establishment of an independent Anti-Corruption
Commission would further consolidate gains made in the institutional and governance
environment. In addition, public reporting of extractive industry financial flows,
consistent with Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) criteria, and a
finalized comprehensive PFM awaiting legislative approval in early 2009 indicate the
urgency, determination and commitment of the authorities to achieve all the HIPC
triggers as soon as possible.
8.
While staff considers that completion point could be reached by 2010, as had been
assumed at the decision point, the authorities are of the view that given the progress made
in key areas of completion point triggers there is a need to consider reaching completion
point in 2009. This would provide a substantial fiscal space and be consistent with the
recent sense of urgency and flexibility on the part of the Executive Board in assisting
countries seeking support during this difficult period of the ongoing financial crisis and
global economic slowdown.
Sustained donor support in the face of borrowing constraint
9.
In spite of the recent growth trends, the incidence of poverty remains high and
several aspects of the social situation remain dire. The Liberian authorities therefore
recognize that improving health and education, as well as the basic infrastructure such as
roads, needs to be pursued with urgency. However, they are aware that given limited
resources, as well as the conditionality of zero borrowing, rehabilitating the infrastructure
and improving basic services would remain a key and difficult challenge in the period
ahead. It is in this regard that they appeal to the international community to continue with
their support to enable them to consolidate the reform program and achieve sustainable
growth. In addition, the authorities are of the view that modest borrowing at highly
concessional level and ring-fenced, targeted at projects with substantial economic rates of
return, may be necessary in the absence of full-donor funding.
Structural reforms
10.
Over the past three years, the Liberian authorities have made commendable
progress in carrying out key reforms, including laying a sound foundation to support the

3
country’s postwar reconstruction and satisfactory growth. In order to consolidate these
gains, my Liberian authorities are determine to increase their efforts to implement their
structural reform agenda to boost international competitiveness. Key elements of this
agenda include addressing the inadequate infrastructure referred to earlier and
undertaking institutional reforms to improve the business environment for the private
sector. This is clearly laid out in Liberia’s PRSP, which details a comprehensive strategy
for sustaining higher growth by maintaining macroeconomic stability; attracting private
investment; and improving infrastructure, governance and security.
11.
In this context, the Liberian authorities believe that investing in physical
infrastructure, particularly roads, and well functioning ports to facilitate transportation of
exports such as timber, iron ore, and cocoa is key to improving competitiveness and
sustaining growth. Guided by its PRSP, Liberia has made progress in other key reform
areas such as strengthening public finance management, including raising public
revenues, improving institutional governance, and strengthening the banking sector. The
authorities are also committed to adopting measures aimed at achieving accountable and
transparent exploitation of their natural resource wealth, including adoption of specific
measures that will further deepen their commitment to the EITI principles.
12.
Strengthening the institutional debt management capacity at the national level,
particularly at the Ministry of Finance, is considered a key priority by the authorities to
avoid recurrence of unsustainable debts accumulation in the future. In this regard, the
authorities have established a Debt Management Unit, assigned with the responsibility for
recording and managing public debt statistics, reviewing loan documents, and assessing
concessionality levels of new borrowing.
13.
The monetary authority is committed and has adopted measures to strengthen the
current monetary policy framework. Efforts in this regard, include publicizing the
current policy framework, and enhancing the efficiency and transparency in the foreign
exchange market through setting of auction rules and regulations. The authorities
appreciate staff’s advice on de-dollarization. In this context, they are considering marketbased measures to support the demand for Liberian dollar, including increase in the use
of the Liberia dollar in government revenue and expenditure operations.
14.
The Central Bank of Liberia has made substantial progress in addressing internal
financial control weaknesses identified in the Fund’s 2007 interim safeguard assessment
as well as with the implementation of the IFRS new accounting framework. As we may
be aware, the transition to the IFRS is a complex task -- even for advanced economies -and particularly challenging for Liberia, a post-conflict country. However, the updated
safeguard assessment conducted in early 2008 demonstrates progress made, including the
implementation of measures to increase transparency, and adoption of investment
guidelines. Measures to strengthen general control environment have been adopted,
including oversight of CBL financial reporting, co-signing authority by the Special
Advisor, and audit and control systems by the Audit Committee, and are being
implemented. The CBL remain also committed to a cash-based balanced budget for
2009.

4
15.
As part of the resolution strategy for external debt overhang, the authorities are
engaging all creditors. Recently, they agreed on a comprehensive rescheduling of
outstanding obligations to the Paris Club group of creditors. Discussions with other
official and private creditors are also bearing positive fruits as attested by some creditors
who agreed to forgive Liberia’s all outstanding claims, while others have agreed to grant
debt relief on terms fully consistent with the HIPC Initiative. Liberia is also looking
forward to reaching an agreement under the World Bank’s Debt Reduction Facility in
early 2009.
Conclusion
16.
The Liberian authorities remain mindful of the challenges ahead, and are
committed to proceed with their reform agenda to rebuild the economy and intensify
efforts to reduce poverty. It is in this regard that they are requesting that the HIPC
completion point be reached in 2009 to provide urgent support in meeting these
challenges. My authorities appreciate the continued support of Management, the
Executive Board and the development partners in this regard.
