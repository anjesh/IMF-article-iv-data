HUNGARY
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2006 Consultation with Hungary
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
July 24, 2006
Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation concluded in Budapest on June 6, 2006. The
staff team comprised Mr. Mody (Head), Ms. Fabrizio, Messrs. Abiad and Mathibe (all EUR),
Ms. Corbacho (FAD), Mr. Morris (ICM), and Messrs. Rosenberg and Sierhej (Regional
Representative Office, Warsaw). Mr. Kiekens (Executive Director) and Mr. Abel (Advisor to the
Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with Prime Minister Gyurcsány, Finance
Minister Veres, President Járai of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), other senior officials, and
representatives of the private sector and the academic community.
The new government’s policies and market sentiment are likely to evolve, possibly rapidly.
Following its reelection in April, the Socialist Party-led coalition has sought public support for
reducing the budget deficit. The authorities are expected to clarify and enlarge the scope of fiscal
consolidation, leading up to the submission of their Convergence Programme to the European
Commission on September 1. A staff supplement, if needed, will provide an update prior to the Board
meeting.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and intend to publish this staff
report. The staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation was discussed by the Board on
June 11, 2005. It was subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 05/213.
Hungary has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In accordance with UN
Security Council resolutions, Hungary maintains restrictions on, and imposes sanctions against,
individuals, groups, and organizations associated with terrorism. Hungary subscribes to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data provision is, in general, timely and facilitates effective
surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Despite its many strengths, Hungary faces important challenges. Following robust
performance between 1997 and 2001, Hungary’s growth has recently been respectable but at
the low end among the New Member States of the European Union. It is projected, moreover,
to trail regional peers in the coming years. Also, the ratio of employment to working-age
population remains low. Of immediate concern are vulnerabilities caused by rising public
and external debt ratios and the growing currency mismatches. Financial markets have
sounded their warning signals.
Central to Hungary’s economic outlook is progress in containing its runaway budget
deficit. The new government’s consolidation program is ambitious in intent and speed. While
the proposed package contains some measures that take the long view, tax increases may not
deliver the anticipated revenues and undermine growth and competitiveness. If market
sentiment weakens, serious consequences could follow.
Action on several fronts is required to place public finances on a sound footing. A fiscal
consolidation matching the intent of the authorities’ program but extended over another two
years would reverse the trend increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio and bring it below the
Maastricht limit by 2010, allowing euro entry from a position of strength. A focus on
expenditure reforms and revenue enhancement by broadening the tax base will achieve
sustainable consolidation. The endemic overruns in the budget deficit must be stemmed,
through stronger controls, and greater transparency and accountability.
While interest rate policy is on a sound course, the forint should float. The recent
increase of the policy rate by 25 basis points and the signal of a measured tightening cycle
are appropriate in light of the risks to inflation. Because the exchange rate band is wide, it
does not presently pose a constraint to the pursuit of inflation targeting. However, with euro
adoption some distance away and the band serving no useful purpose, a risk-management
perspective suggests that a floating exchange rate regime should be adopted.
The banking sector has valuable safeguards, but recent trends call for more proactive
supervision and regulation. The profitability and capitalization of the banking system
remain robust. However, the increase in foreign currency lending and signs of worsening
credit quality are causes for concern. Supervision will be strengthened by regular stress tests
of individual banks and more intensive on-site assessment of risk-management practices. A
requirement of higher provisioning against foreign-currency loans should also be considered.
Needed reforms to increase employment and enhance competitiveness are linked to
structural fiscal measures. A smaller tax wedge and more effectively targeted social
welfare programs (especially the disability pension and early retirement programs) will help
raise the low employment rate. While the trade-weighted exchange rate is not obviously
overvalued, a broader perspective highlights that productivity enhancement will be crucial
for maintaining competitiveness. Ensuring that the EU funds are effectively used to raise
productivity will require linking their deployment to fiscal structural reforms.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Hungary’s growth potential may be eroding, and vulnerabilities are making
markets impatient. While robust between 1997 and 2001, Hungary’s GDP growth rate has
recently been at the low end among the New Member States (NMS) of the European Union
(EU), and projections push it further down in the rankings (Text Figure 1). Moreover,
reflecting concerns about growing public and external debt, Hungary began to be
differentiated by financial markets as early as September 2005 and has been further afflicted
by the global increase in financial market volatility (Text Figure 2). For now, economic and
financial buffers, assiduously built up over the last decade, offer some protection from a
further slide in the currency and rise in interest rates. If these cushions wear thinner, and,
especially, if global sentiment worsens, serious consequences cannot be ruled out.

Since early 2005, growth has been respectable but disappointing in a regional
perspective. GDP growth slowed from 5.2 percent in 2004 to 4.1 percent in 2005
(Table 1)—the lower end of the economy’s potential, which is estimated at 4-5 percent.1
Hungary and Poland were the only two NMS whose growth decelerated in 2005. However,
while the Polish economy picked up in the last quarter of 2005 along with stronger
growth elsewhere, Hungary’s economy continued to lag (Text Figure 3). Consumption
growth moderated in 2005 with restrained wage growth and weak employment trends
(Text Figures 4 and 5). Fixed investment growth largely reflected government-sponsored
motorway construction. The strong contribution of net exports was likely exaggerated by the
changed method for estimating imports; the unusually slow import growth was statistically
balanced by a large drawdown of inventories.2

Schadler, Susan, and others, 2006, Growth in the Central and Eastern European Countries
of the European Union (Occasional Paper 252, forthcoming). The growth rate in 2005 (and in
the previous three years) benefited from an upward revision of about half a percentage point,
following the European Commission’s recommendation relating to “financial intermediary
services indirectly measured.”

Import growth is possibly underestimated because of a shift from border data collection
(customs) to survey self-declaration, following EU accession in 2004.

Corporate performance indicators give mixed signals. According to tax data, the
average pretax return on corporate assets was about 5½ percent in 2004, in the same range as
in recent years (Figure 1). In 2005, profitability was apparently maintained, with a continued
decline in real unit labor costs, and optimism was reflected in the strong performance of the
Hungarian equity market. However, profits have been unevenly distributed. While large
firms and banks are typically highly profitable, about two-fifths of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) are unprofitable. Moreover, since May this year, the stock market has
experienced a significant correction. And, since mid-2005, Hungarian industrial production
has not maintained its customary link with the improving German IFO index of business
expectations.
4.
Inflation has declined to historic lows, helped not only by one-off domestic
factors, but also by globalization and declining inflation expectations. Headline inflation
(based on the consumer price index (CPI)) fell in May to 2.8 percent, year on year, and core
inflation fell to 1.0 percent (Text Figure 6). Absent the cut in the value-added tax (VAT) rate
in January 2006, year-on-year headline inflation would have been 4.5 percent, still within the
±1 percentage point band around the 3.5 percent end-2006 inflation target. The gap between
headline and core inflation reflected rising energy and unprocessed food prices. Contributing
to the containment of inflation was the global disinflation in traded goods (Text Figure 7).
The VAT rate cut seems to have had a bigger effect on non-traded goods, which also
benefited from a decline in inflation expectations.

The trade-weighted exchange rate appears to be close to its equilibrium value,
but competitiveness concerns remain. The CPI-based real exchange rate appreciated by
36 percent from 1997 to 2005 (Text Figure 8). Meanwhile, the real exchange rate became
overvalued sometime around mid-2001, and by end-2005 was overvalued by about 5 percent,
reflecting principally the accumulation of net external liabilities (in line with the MNB’s
estimates). Since the start of 2006, the exchange rate has depreciated significantly. This
suggests no obvious overvaluation, for now. However, such an assessment is characterized
by considerable uncertainty, and cautionary signs are also present. In particular, competitive
pressures are being increasingly exerted by Asian economies, which are underrepresented in
these trade-weighted measures; China, in particular, has rapidly expanded its share in the EU
market, whereas Hungary’s market share has plateaued (Text Figure 9).

The debt dynamics are worrisome. Hungary now has the largest fiscal and current
account deficits among sizable emerging markets (Text Table 1 and Table 4). In 2005, the
fiscal deficit was 7.6 percent of GDP (Table 2).3 The 2005 current account deficit, at 7.4
percent of GDP, showed some contraction relative to 2004 (Figure 2 and Table 3) but is
3

Allowing for the exclusion of the cost of pension reform would lower the deficit by
approximately 1½ percent of GDP.

10

possibly underestimated by up to 2 percent of GDP, on account of the likely underreporting
of imports, reflected in much larger errors and omissions. Both public and external debt
ratios are rising and were at 62 and 75 percent of GDP, respectively, at end-2005
(Text Figure 10). If trends continue, the existing liquidity buffers could come under strain.
Public debt has relatively long maturities and low foreign currency exposure, minimizing
rollover risk and the costs of a large depreciation. The ratio of reserves to external short-term
debt has remained at or above 100 percent. However, markets could destabilize debt
structures or force involuntary contraction of the current account if debt trends are perceived
to be unsustainable.

For now, banks retain cushions against the rising risks from foreign currency
lending to small businesses and households. Reflecting low international interest rates and
the relatively stable exchange rate in 2005, the foreign currency share of outstanding bank
loans increased from about 43 percent in December 2004 to 53 percent in March 2006

11

(Text Table 2). Households borrow in foreign currency directly from banks and indirectly via
nonbank financial intermediaries (whose borrowings from banks are reported in the “other
loans” category). Hungarian banks’ exposure to foreign currency lending is now the highest
of the four central European economies (Text Figure 11). Since banks are fully hedged
against currency risk, they primarily face increasing credit risk—the possibility that
borrowers may default if there is a large currency correction. While both the 2005 FSAP
update and the authorities’ April 2006 Financial Stability Report have tried to estimate the
default risk, its magnitude is not known with any precision. On the favorable side,
indebtedness levels are still low by western European standards. Moreover, the banking
sector is at present able to withstand losses, as reflected in declining operating costs, strong
profitability, and the system’s capital adequacy ratio of around 11 percent (Figure 3 and
Table 5). However, these buffers could prove inadequate for some banks if currency
depreciation weakens borrowers and aggressive lending weakens banks.

The rising debt levels and currency mismatches will have aggravated
implications if financial markets continue to differentiate Hungary. With “convergence
play” and emerging market sentiment waning, domestic fundamentals have come under
increased scrutiny (Box 1). Hungary’s rating downgrades stand in contrast to the unchanged
or improved ratings of the other CEECs (Text Figure 12). The differentiation has accentuated
since March, with the unwinding of the so-called carry trade and the sharp correction in the
Icelandic krona. The MNB estimates that portfolio investors have been withdrawing money
from Hungary in large amounts. Commercial banks are, therefore, increasingly important
suppliers of foreign currency financing through their lending, largely in Swiss francs, to
domestic subsidiaries for on-lending to businesses and households. If these credit lines are
not rolled over, the current account and output would contract.

Box 1. Decomposing Exchange Rate Movements
A common component explains a substantial portion of currency movements in the four central
European (CE-4) currencies, which are analyzed in an accompanying selected issues chapter.
However, the forint movements have been relatively independent, with the smallest share of the
variance explained by the common component (Box Figure 1.1). While interest rate differentials visà-vis the euro area could potentially explain some of the country-specific currency movements, the
weakening of the forint since end-September 2005 has not been related to the narrowing of interest
rate differentials.

In turn, the CE-4 common component has had two parts. The “convergence play” related to EU
accession and anticipation of euro zone entry held central European asset prices strong through late
2004. When that ended, asset prices remained supported in 2005 because of the positive sentiment
toward emerging markets generally (Box Figure 1.2).

These supporting forces have kept the forint from depreciating even further. With weakening
emerging market sentiment, the forint is likely to be guided even more by domestic fundamentals.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The state of public finances—epitomized by endemic deficit overshooting—is
undermining growth prospects and economic stability. By rapidly proposing sizable fiscal
measures, the new government has acknowledged the urgency of containing the growing
public debt. However, not least because the tax measures under consideration could hurt
competitiveness and, hence, may require reversal, the present political window of
opportunity should, staff urged, be used more aggressively to cut spending and implement
budgetary controls (Box 2). In this context, the discussions also addressed the conduct of
monetary policy, safeguards for the financial sector, and measures to improve labor
absorption and strengthen competitiveness.
Box 2. Response to Fund Advice
The authorities have broadly concurred with Fund’s policy advice, but have viewed necessary steps as
less urgent. Moreover, fiscal consolidation has been constrained by domestic political considerations.
Fiscal policy. The authorities have relied principally on ad hoc measures to stabilize public finances.
Limited effort has been directed toward expenditure reduction to achieve sustainable consolidation.
The authorities’ tax reform in 2005 was, in staff’s view, not affordable without concomitant
expenditure cuts. Staff’s recommendations for enhanced fiscal transparency and credibility have not
been taken on board.
Monetary policy. Since 2004, monetary policy has more closely hewn to its stated objective of
inflation targeting, as recommended by the Fund. Policy credibility has also been helped by the
MNB’s more consistent and transparent communications strategy. Authorities have resisted the
Fund’s recommendation to move to a floating exchange rate regime.
Financial sector. The 2005 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update reported significant
advances in financial sector regulation and supervision. In line with the update’s recommendations,
the authorities have strengthened the bankruptcy regime and pension regulation, and raised consumer
awareness of the risks inherent in foreign currency borrowing. Progress has been slower in evaluating
credit risks from unhedged foreign currency borrowing.

A. Fiscal Consolidation Plans and Macroeconomic Outlook
10.
The authorities have announced a large fiscal adjustment program. Absent new
measures, the budget deficit in 2006 was projected at 11.1 percent of GDP (in ESA’95 terms,
without the credit for the pension adjustment). The authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan, to
commence in the second half of 2006 and continue through 2008, is projected to achieve
savings of over 10 percent of GDP, about three-fifths relying on higher taxes (Text Table 3).
Since the measures include limiting the anticipated deterioration of the baseline (about
3 percent of GDP), and given known additional obligations, the cumulative deficit reduction
would be about 7 percent of GDP. The authorities project in 2006, a deficit of 9.5 percent of
GDP, going down sharply to 5 percent of GDP in 2007 and to around 3 percent of GDP in
2008.

11.
While the authorities project painful short-term macroeconomic results, they
anticipate medium-term gains. After GDP growth of 4½ percent in 2006 (despite the
continuing large fiscal stimulus of about 2½ percent of GDP), the authorities expect growth
to fall to 2½ percent in 2007, but followed by rapid recovery thereafter. Staff expressed
concern that expectations of a quick rebound may be overly optimistic since the new capital
and labor taxes add to the already high tax rates and would reduce the incentives to work and
invest, and hurt competitiveness. If the tax increases need to be undone, new solutions will be
needed to stabilize public finances: policy variability can only hurt. The authorities project
that the additional taxes and reduction in subsidies will raise inflation to about 6 percent in
2007, despite the anticipated slowdown in consumption, but expect the one-off effects to
subside quickly. They see the principal gain of this strategy as reversing the recent trend rise
in the public debt (however, they had not completed their estimates). Staff project a public
debt-to-GDP ratio of about 68 percent of GDP by end-2006, and if the authorities’ package is
implemented fully, it will fall to 63 percent by 2010.4
12.
Staff took the view that the consolidation package would deliver less than what
the authorities expect. Given the likely political, legal, and administrative delays in the
approval and implementation of the proposed measures, staff’s estimate of the fiscal deficit

16

in 2006 is 10 percent of GDP.5 Staff projects the deficit to fall to only 7½ percent of GDP in
2007 and to 6½ percent in 2008 (see Text Table 3 and Table 6). Staff expects lower yields
from solidarity taxes on personal and corporate income, health and social security
contributions, and public administration and health reform.6 In contrast, ad hoc measures to
raise labor and capital taxes carry several risks.
13.
In staff’s baseline scenario, premised on the smaller deficit reduction, short-term
growth and inflation outcomes will be less painful but public debt will continue to rise.
GDP growth is likely to be 3½ percent in 2007 and remain below 4 percent through 2010
(Text Table 4), thus continuing to trail regional growth (see Text Figure 1). Growth will be
dampened for the same reasons as in the authorities’ scenario—reduced demand, weak
incentives, and the risk of continued policy variability—but by a smaller extent than if the
authorities’ anticipated consolidation took place in full. Under staff’s baseline, inflation
could rise from 3½ percent in 2006 to about 5¾ percent in 2007. An upside risk to inflation
arises from the possibility of a greater depreciation than currently envisioned. While
concerns about second-round effects exist, staff agreed with the authorities that the risks are
presently low, based on the experience with accession-related tax hikes of 2004 and with
wages rising more slowly than productivity. Staff’s principal concern is that public debt
under the baseline will continue to rise, exceeding 70 percent of GDP by 2008 (Figure 4 and
Table 7).

If some recent PPP investments are included, the deficit would be about 11 percent of GDP.
The fiscal transparency ROSC in May 2006 concluded that the motorway investment
spending through a PPP between the government and the state-owned motorway company
AAK should be recorded on budget because the motorway ownership will remain with the
government.

The regional reform bill, necessary to significantly reduce public employment and the wage

14.
External vulnerabilities will also continue to increase. The current account deficit
could rise to about 9 percent of GDP this year (if the suspected underreporting is reversed)
and decline gradually to about 7 percent of GDP by 2010. However, these projections will
remain subject to uncertainty because of the changed approach to estimating imports.
Importantly, staff cautioned that the external financing requirement (arising either from
underrecorded imports or inflows recorded in errors and omissions) would remain high, and
external debt would likely rise to about 82 percent of GDP by end-2006 and maintain an
upward trajectory (Figure 5 and Table 8).
15.
During the currency’s slide, sufficient confidence has ensured the necessary
financing of the current account, and balance sheet effects have been minimal—but this
cannot be presumed. The authorities recognized that, if the political willingness to
consolidate were to fade, a significant exchange rate correction could be accompanied by
higher interest rates, reduced confidence, a retrenchment of consumption and investment, and
a contraction of the current account. They acknowledged staff analysis, which shows that,
although the likelihood of a sudden stop in capital inflows—or an involuntary contraction in
the current account—is in the 3-5 percent range, this likelihood can quickly increase with
trends in external debt servicing and an adverse turn in market sentiment.7 Under currently
plausible scenarios, the authorities viewed the risk of a balance-sheet-induced crisis to be low
(Box 3). While staff agreed with that assessment, it cautioned that trends in the banking
sector were a source of growing concern.

Box 3. Perspectives on Balance Sheet Risks
Public debt. Stress tests show that Hungarian public debt dynamics will be more seriously affected
by a sharp rise in interest rates than by currency depreciation. With its gradual shift toward long-term,
fixed-rate local currency borrowing, Hungary’s public debt has considerably less exposure to
currency and interest rate risks than in Turkey in 2000 and Brazil in 2001 in the run-up to their crises
(Box Figure 3.1).

Private sector. The large Hungarian firms carry significant natural hedges. The MNB is concerned,
however, that weak SMEs may not be able to withstand a sharp currency correction. Households have
buffers in the form of substantial forint-denominated financial assets (Box Table 3.1). However, some
households with large foreign currency liabilities may lack significant financial assets, though
information on this score is fragmentary. Overall, the private sector exposure to currency risk is
significantly less than in Thailand in 1996 (Box Figure 3.2).

Banking sector. With banks’ foreign currency assets and liabilities roughly matched, the banking
sector is more susceptible to substantial increases in short-term interest rates (Box Table 3.2). The
extent of credit risk from unhedged borrowers is uncertain, but a doubling of nonperforming loans
will hurt some banks, affecting their capital. Systemically important banks are likely to remain
protected by their existing cushions. However, the continued rise in foreign currency lending implies
the need for a closer monitoring of such credit risks.

Box 4. The Composition of Fiscal Adjustment and Economic Performance
Expenditure cuts have proved more sustainable than adjustments relying heavily on tax
increases. IMF research1 has shown that expenditure-based adjustments work particularly well when
focused on the reduction of subsidies, wages, and transfers, supported by structural reforms. Revenuebased consolidations have often been reversed, except when they have emphasized broadening the tax
base and strengthening tax administration. Particularly in countries with heavy tax burdens and weak
revenue administrations, tax measures have been prone to evasion and a larger informal economy,
weakening the sustainability of the adjustment. Following large, expenditure-based fiscal
adjustments, GDP growth recovered to its trend during the first two years of the adjustment, driven by
private investment and gains in consumption and trade balances.
Expenditure-based consolidations are also supportive of growth, as the European experience
confirms. Spain reduced primary spending by over 6½ percent of GDP during 1994–97, mainly
through cuts in subsidies and transfers. Finland consolidated social security and welfare payments by
8 percent of GDP during the 1990s through reforms of the pension system and unemployment
benefits. Following fiscal consolidation, growth in these countries outpaced their own average prior to
fiscal consolidation, while exhibiting less variability (Box Table 4.1 and Box Figure 4.1).

The authorities’ expenditure reduction measures are welcome, but staff
underscored the urgency of bolder efforts. The steps under consideration in such areas as
public administration, government employment, health, education, and subsidies go in the
right direction, and the task is to rapidly establish supporting legislation and administrative
procedures, including for individual health accounts. The authorities acknowledged that the
fiscal implications of an aging population needed early attention. In this context, staff
recommended indexing pension benefits to inflation; gradually increasing the retirement age;
eliminating the thirteenth-month pension for new retirees; introducing more stringent rules
for the disability pension; and phasing out early retirement schemes (Text Table 5). Staff also
argued for reforming the welfare system, redirecting budget support to families to the poor,
and eliminating the house subsidy scheme. These steps would help restore public finances
and increase households’ incentives to save. The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s
suggestions but viewed these as medium-term objectives.

Because the fiscal consolidation needs are so large, staff also argued for
broadening the revenue base. Staff supported some measures under consideration,
including taxing pension benefits under the personal income tax, unifying the VAT rate, and
taxing all income from fixed-income securities. The authorities’ intention of postponing even
the desirable elements of the 2005 tax reform is a regrettable necessity. Staff recommended
broadening the tax base by eliminating tax exemptions, introducing a more far-reaching real
estate tax, and strengthening tax administration. The authorities noted that eliminating
exemptions was politically difficult.

23

19.
Fiscal slippages would continue, staff cautioned, if even well-founded
consolidation measures were not accompanied by tighter budgetary controls. Persistent
deficit overshooting has become characteristic of Hungarian public finances, with the
projected 2006 excess a new high

benchmarks for guiding policy.
The authorities aim to implement new rules for budgeting open-ended expenditures, holding
line ministries responsible for meeting targets. This is a welcome development, but ambitious
and long-lasting solutions are needed. The practice of allowing budgetary spending without
appropriations and parliamentary approval should be discontinued. Quasi-fiscal activities
associated with public enterprises and PPPs should be accounted for when setting fiscal
deficit targets for the general government. To aid monitoring and ensure timely responses to
slippages, quarterly reviews on an ESA’95 basis should be undertaken. The authorities were
receptive to staff’s proposals, but concrete plans have yet to be formulated.
C. Monetary Policy
20.
Staff commended the authorities for strengthening the credibility of inflation
targeting. Through sharp policy rate increases in the midst of currency weakness in 2003,
the authorities conveyed support for an exchange rate target. Since then, they have
demonstrated greater consistency in targeting an inflation rate, via policy actions and
communications. Staff agreed that the commitment to inflation targeting, alongside better
anchoring of inflationary expectations, has helped price stability. The commitment was
noteworthy in the response to the weakening of the forint in March. That weakening was
appropriately evaluated in the context of subdued overall inflationary pressures, and the
policy interest rate was held steady despite anticipation by markets that the MNB would prop
up the exchange rate. Moreover, the rationale behind the decision was transparently
communicated.

24

21.
With inflation risks on the upside, the authorities indicated that a tightening
cycle may be called for. With the projected reduction of subsidies and tax increases,
inflation will exceed the MNB’s 3 percent target in 2007 and possibly also in 2008. By itself,
this projection does not call for a policy response since, as the authorities noted, the tax
changes will likely have one-off effects on inflation. Staff estimates that, absent the recent
fiscal measures, inflation would stay within the target band. The authorities, however,
agreed that inflationary expectations had recently turned up after a substantial decline
(Text Figure 17). They therefore concluded that a tightening cycle in small step increases of
the policy rate may be required, especially if second-round effects become evident from the
tax and energy price increases and a further depreciation of the forint. The 25-basis-point
increase in the policy rate on June 19 was appropriate in this context.

The authorities agreed that, in the current uncertain environment, consistency in
communication is required to keep inflation expectations anchored. In particular, a
continued steady depreciation or a sharp depreciation beyond the central parity of
Ft 282.36 per euro would require clarity on the implications for inflation and monetary
tightening (Text Figure 18).10 A sizable and unexpected interest rate hike to defend the
exchange rate, as in 2003, could prove ineffective if rising debt-servicing costs further
undermine confidence and add to the policy uncertainty, hurting private investment and the
banking sector.

The exchange rate pass-through has declined to about 20 percent over a 24-month span.

23.
The authorities again rejected calls to shift to a floating exchange rate regime.
Because the band is wide, the authorities argued, it does not currently constrain the pursuit of
inflation targeting. Staff, however, noted the risk that, if fundamentals weakened further and
international market sentiment worsened, the pressure on the exchange rate could be
aggravated by the band. Moreover, with euro adoption far away (Text Figures 19 and 20), an
ERM II-like framework will not become pertinent for some years, and greater exchange rate
variability will help reduce incentives to borrow in foreign currency. The authorities
maintained that any change in regime could result in unpredictable and destabilizing market
reactions, as occurred when the central parity was changed in June 2003.

D. Financial Sector Stability
24.
It was agreed that several developments bear close watching. First, foreign
currency lending can be expected to continue its rise. From 53 percent of outstanding loans,
foreign currency lending, on current trends, could increase by about 5 percentage points a
year. Second, the Senior Loan Officer Survey identifies more aggressive bank lending
activities and practices (often through nonbank financial affiliates), which have raised credit
risks (though the authorities emphasized this development was also consistent with financial
deepening). Finally, the financial fragility of SMEs appears to have increased, as interpreted
from the increase in the share of loans on the “watch list” of banks. For the banking sector,
the ratio of nonperforming to outstanding loans has remained relatively steady, at about
2½ percent, but with riskier lending and SME fragility, more nonperforming loans may be in
the pipeline.
25.
The authorities assess the banking sector as able to withstand substantial shocks,
but staff recommended more sophisticated supervisory and precautionary regulatory
measures. The main risk that banks face is that of increased default in the event of a sharp
currency depreciation. The authorities reported that, due to short credit histories, the credit
risks are difficult to assess. While they are concerned that an exchange rate correction and
other macro demand shocks may hurt the repayment capacity of some SMEs and households,
they remain confident, and staff agrees, that the risk of a systemic banking crisis is low, with
borrowers and banks possessing sufficient buffers. The authorities noted their stepped-up
efforts to increase awareness of risks associated with foreign currency lending but also
conceded that these efforts had had limited effects. Staff suggested more proactive
supervision. More intensive on-site supervision of risk-management practices is needed to
ensure that the banks factor in the possibility of a decline in collateral values coincident with
heightened credit risk. Staff expressed concern that no stress tests of individual banks had
been undertaken since the 2005 FSAP update and, while recognizing the data limitations,
emphasized that such tests should become an integral part of the supervision effort. The
authorities reported that they were developing a new methodology for stress testing, to be
implemented early next year. Staff further proposed consideration of increased risk weights
or additional provisioning requirements for foreign currency lending. While the authorities
were receptive to stepped-up supervision, they did not view further regulatory measures
favorably, since these could be circumvented in open capital markets. Staff noted that such
measures were in place in other countries and would signal the authorities’ strong concern
regarding these trends.

27

E. Labor Markets and Competitiveness

27.
The discussions identified three
relevant policy areas. First, the tax wedge is
wide; in the currently weak labor market
situation, lowering the tax wedge should
reduce employee costs and help generate
employment. Second, the welfare system can
be rationalized. Both men and women drop
out of the labor force to take advantage of the
generous disability benefits (Text Figure 22).
Child care benefits can also be rationalized to
allow for greater scope for temporary and
part-time work. Finally, the employment ratio
is particularly low among workers with
primary education (Text Figure 23). The rapid
shift of the Hungarian output structure to
relatively skill-intensive activities has implied
a low demand for unskilled workers. A greater
effort to raise the productivity of unskilled
workers and to maintain the economic
relevance of higher education must be
priorities.

28.
Staff remains concerned about competitiveness pressures. The authorities
emphasized that, during the period of exchange rate appreciation, export strength was
maintained through a counteracting shift from “low-” to “medium-”skilled export products
(Figure 7). While recognizing the technological shift and the associated gains in market
shares by Hungarian exporters, staff emphasized (as documented in the multi-country
selected issues chapter) that competitive pressures are rising and that technological upgrading
had become a necessary but not sufficient condition for further penetration into world
markets. As noted above, market shares have flattened (see Text Figure 9). Continued
emphasis on raising productivity growth and the savings rate remains crucial for long-term
external sustainability.
29.
The authorities view the expected step-up in the use of EU funds as an
opportunity to raise productivity and improve infrastructure. The absorption of EU
funds has been growing and is likely to increase further, from about 2 percent of GDP in
2006 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008 (net inflows will be about 1 percentage point less,
reflecting Hungary’s payments to the EU) (Text Table 6). Projects related to small and
medium-sized enterprises’ technology upgrading, the road network, and education and
training are moving ahead steadily. These are encouragingly linked to much-needed
productivity growth. However, measures to improve employment adaptability and increase
access to the global information network are lagging. Staff emphasized, and the authorities
agreed, that continued efforts based on cost-benefit analysis are needed to utilize the
remaining structural funds by end-2008 and administer a threefold increase in new
commitments for 2007-13. Absent fiscal structural reforms, the effectiveness of these
resources will likely be diminished.

30.
Despite the economy’s many strengths, its growth is at risk, and a loss of market
confidence and a sharp contraction in output cannot be ruled out. Extensive engagement
in European production networks, the continuing technological and quality upgrading of the
production structure, and buoyancy in export growth indicate the resilience of the private
sector despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Economic growth in recent years, however,
owes much to a strong fiscal stimulus. With a needed fiscal contraction now planned for
2007, growth can be expected to slow. Indeed, a largely tax-based consolidation risks
reducing competitiveness and increasing policy uncertainty, since some of the new taxes will
eventually need to be reversed. The greater short-term risk arises from the inability to
implement a significant consolidation, which could further undermine investor confidence
and, interacting with the financial market volatility, force an involuntary contraction in the
current account and, hence, in output.
31.
The principal policy task is to place public finances on a sound footing. A fiscal
consolidation, sustained over a longer period than currently envisaged by the authorities and,
hence, somewhat more sizable, would reduce vulnerabilities and lower the debt ratio to
below the Maastricht limit, allowing euro entry from a position of strength. Furthermore, a
focus on expenditure reforms, including improved expenditure targeting and efficiency, will
contribute to lasting consolidation. Revenue enhancement is also required and should be
achieved through a broadening of the tax base, including instituting a more far-reaching

30

property tax, rather than through surcharges on already high taxes on capital and labor. Of
paramount importance, the endemic overruns in the budget deficit must be stemmed, through
stronger controls, and greater transparency and accountability.
32.
For monetary policy, the challenge is to identify one-off inflationary influences,
communicate these to the public and financial markets, and deal with second-round
effects. Much progress has been achieved in establishing the credibility of the inflationtargeting framework. These gains will be consolidated by continued consistent actions and
communications. Currently, the risks to inflation are mainly on the upside, but contributory
factors may have primarily one-off effects. The concern is that, despite better anchoring than
in the past, short-term inflation spikes may raise inflationary expectations. Communicating
the nature and extent of the one-off effects, therefore, is important for containing the
expectation of a medium-term rise in inflation. If the likelihood of second-round effects
increases, anticipatory policy tightening will be required. However, in this uncertain
environment, a measured course of tightening, rather than sharp changes in policy rates, will
likely better serve the goal of maintaining stable expectations. Hence, the June policy rate
increase and the prospect of a tightening cycle represent the right stance.
33.
From a risk-management perspective, a floating exchange rate regime is best
suited to Hungary’s present needs. With euro adoption some distance away, an ERM IIlike exchange rate band is not currently relevant. If anything, its presence interferes with the
operation of the inflation-targeting anchor. If global imbalances unwind, they may interact
with domestic vulnerabilities in unpredictable ways, creating additional policy challenges.
Moreover, the perception of greater exchange rate variability will help reduce incentives to
borrow in foreign currency.
34.
Although the banking sector has valuable safeguards, recent trends call for more
proactive supervision and regulation. The profitability and capitalization of the banking
system remain robust. However, the steady increase in foreign currency lending and signs of
worsening credit quality are causes for concern. The authorities should institute regular stress
tests of individual banks. More intensive on-site supervision of banks’ risk-management
practices, especially with respect to their foreign currency lending, is needed. Consideration
should also be given to requiring higher provisioning against foreign currency loans.
35.
Improving labor market performance and enhancing competitiveness are tied in
important ways to fiscal reforms. A reduction in the overall cost of labor is important for
increasing employment. In turn, this requires reducing the tax wedge, a goal rendered
difficult by the current fiscal position. Raising the employment rate will require targeting
social welfare programs more effectively, especially the disability pension and early
retirement programs. While the trade-weighted exchange rate is not obviously overvalued, a
broader perspective highlights that productivity enhancement will be crucial for maintaining
competitiveness. The improved pace of EU funds’ absorption in productivity-enhancing
activities is encouraging. Ensuring that the funds are effectively used will require linking
their deployment to fiscal structural reforms.
36.
The next Article IV consultation with Hungary is expected to be conducted under the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
2/ General government gross debt.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currencydenominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2 as αε(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
three of the last projection years.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)

APPENDIX II

HUNGARY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is timely and facilitates effective surveillance. Significant
progress has been made in improving the coverage, periodicity, and other aspects of quality
related to Hungarian economic and financial statistics. Most data quality issues noted in the
data module of the 2001 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) have
been satisfactorily addressed, but some still remain.11
2.
Hungary subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Hungary meets
the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the
dissemination of advance release calendars.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts
3.
A statistical discrepancy between the final version of GDP by production activities
and GDP by expenditure components emerged in 1997, and has persisted. From 2000, the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO) has been regularly publishing an estimate of
this discrepancy for final annual data. Subsequent methodological refinements and a change
in the base year have trimmed the magnitude of the discrepancy to about 1 percent of GDP,
based on 2001 current price data, and ½ percent in 2002. From June 2002, the HCSO began
publishing seasonally adjusted estimates of quarterly GDP by type of economic activity and
by expenditure components beginning with the first quarter of 2002, with retrospective
coverage from 1995. The benchmarking of the quarterly estimates to the annual estimates has
been applied from 2000. Beginning with the annual data for 2000, the methodology for
estimation of imputed owner-occupied rent, which had been based on 1993 benchmarks, was
changed in line with recommendations of Eurostat. Series of quarterly GDP at constant 2000
prices extend back to 2000.
4.
There have been some methodological changes in the 2001–2002 annual national
accounts, with substantial progress in the transition to calculating the data on accrual basis.
There was a change in the accounting method of re-export and the net base accounting was
calculated for 1998 going backwards. The full set of non-financial accounts of the general
government sector was compiled for the period of 2001–02. Revision of the Gross Fixed
Capital Formation (GFCF) data was facilitated by further development of the data collection
system, the estimation of the previously missing items of GFCF, and the application of the
methodology of ESA95. All the important GFCF items were estimated by applying the same
methodology for the breakdown of sectors, industries, and regions for 2000–02.
11

The original 2001 ROSC Data Module and its annual updates are available on the IMF
internet web site. The latest update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (July 2004).

50

APPENDIX II

5.
The weights of the monthly consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index
(PPI) are updated each year. The weight reference period used in for the CPI is two years
prior to the current year.
External Sector Statistics
6.
A work plan, with clear time tables, has been implemented to replace the cash-based
balance of payments statistics, compiled by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), with the
accrual-based accounting principles of the fifth edition of IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). The following improvements have been implemented: exports and imports
of goods are derived from foreign trade data, which from May 2004 are based on the
Intrastat/Extrastat system; and balance of payments statistics record goods under processing
and repair on goods, and financial lease arrangements according to the BPM5 methodology.
Moreover, in 2004, estimates of reinvested earnings were included in the balance of
payments statistics, raising the current account deficit with an offsetting impact on the
financial accounts. Further improvements were implemented in 2004, with the recording of
investment income on an accrual basis. These modifications completed the process of
shifting Hungary’s balance of payments statistics to accrual-based accounting consistent with
the BPM5. The release of revised quarterly series by the MNB in 2004 covered the period
1995–2003.
7.
The MNB and the HCSO have reconciled their data sources and methodologies with
regard to travel receipts and payments, eliminating a discrepancy which had existed in this
area between the balance of payments statistics and the national accounts.
8.
Since 2002, improved cooperation between the HCSO and the MNB has been
formalized through memoranda of understanding signed each year between the two
institutions, identifying areas to improve statistics and harmonizing data sources and
methodologies.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
9.
The International Financial Statistics (IFS) country page for Hungary provides timely
data for the monetary authorities, banking institutions, and the banking survey. Since January
2003, the MNB has collected and compiled monetary data using the European Central
Bank’s (ECB) methodological framework. Accordingly, the monetary financial institutions
sector now includes money market funds (MMFs); credit is classified on a gross basis; fixed
assets are classified at acquisition cost; deposits at face value (without interest accrued); and
zero coupon bonds recorded at their discounted values.
10.
An area where the monetary statistics is not fully in line with international standards
is in the valuation of securities. Presently, the securities on the balance sheets of depository
corporations are not always valued at market prices. Progress, however, has been made.
Since 2004, the MNB has encouraged depository corporations to use market valuation for
securities in their trading portfolio. In 2005, the MNB made market valuation compulsory for
depository corporations that are listed on the stock exchange. In addition, the securities of all

51

APPENDIX II

companies that are listed on the stock exchange and held by depository corporations in their
trading portfolio must be market valued.12 Depository corporations are required to revalue
their securities at least quarterly, and more frequently if possible. At present 12 banks (out of
40) apply market valuation for securities in their portfolios.
11.
The ROSC mission of 2001 also noted that the MNB’s statistical practices are not
guided by revisions studies. In September 2001, a study was prepared with the aim of
summarizing the revision practice of the monetary statistical publications. The main elements
are as follows. New monetary accounts and interest rate data which are first published
according to the advance release calendar can be considered preliminary, because crosschecks with other statistics (e.g. BOP stocks) are made in the course of the next month.
Corrections can be performed due to on-site and off-site controls of the reports as well
(focusing on time series of given reports or on the cross checking of various reports relating
to a given date of reporting institutions). Publication of the necessary revisions is performed
on the next publication dates together with the newest data. Revisions of the publications
may take place due to methodological changes as well, which are generally made public in
advance and go back as many years in the time series as possible. In doing so, estimations are
also applied.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
12.
In January 2004, STA conducted a substantive update of the GFS dataset using the
July 2003 Data Quality Assessment Framework. The mission reported that, overall,
significant progress has been made in addressing the shortcomings of budget execution data
and GFS identified in the original ROSC Data Module. These improvements relate mainly to
institutional coverage of general government, consolidation of data and reconciliation of
deficit and financing. However, plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an
economic basis have yet to come to fruition.
13.
The latest data reported for publication in the 2005 GFS Yearbook refer to 2003.
These data now cover the operations of the consolidated central government and consolidated
general government sectors, as well as their corresponding subsectors. The data for 2000
onwards have been compiled on an accrual basis and reported in the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 format.

12

The securities of companies not listed on the stock exchange will be priced on the basis
of secondary market values. In the absence of a secondary market, the valuation will reflect:
(i) company profitability using the last two annual company reports, or (ii) the present value
of securities. If no other information is available, the acquisition price is used.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
HUNGARY
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Susan Schadler and Adnan Mazarei
October 4, 2006
1.
This supplement reviews developments since the issuance of the 2006 Article IV
consultation staff report and provides a brief staff assessment. It also updates the PIN. The
thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. The authorities’ Convergence Programme
(CP) submitted to the European Commission (EC) on September 1 sets out a slower but more
realistic consolidation path than envisaged in June and reported in the staff report.1 Financial
markets have cautiously endorsed the resolve to reduce the fiscal deficit, which will also
lower the current account deficit. Nevertheless, the task of mitigating short-term risks and
achieving long-term fiscal sustainability has just begun and continued resolve will be needed
in implementing durable structural reforms. With the economy weakening earlier than
anticipated, staff’s call for caution on the speed of monetary tightening is reinforced.
IV. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The recent political disturbances have served as a wake-up call on the need for
greater transparency. Street demonstrations followed the leakage of Prime Minister
Gyurcsány’s speech, in which he acknowledged that the government had concealed the
seriousness of the fiscal situation prior to the April parliamentary elections. The Prime
Minister, however, retained the strong support of his party and coalition, and reiterated the
need for dealing with the critical fiscal challenges. Markets remained calm and asset prices
moved in a small range. In the October 1 municipal elections, the government’s popular
support eroded and the opposition party, Fidesz, made strong gains. However, the governing
coalition held on to the Budapest mayoral position, and with its safe majority in parliament,
the government should be in a position to win the upcoming vote of confidence and pursue
the goals articulated in the CP.

1

On September 26, the EC endorsed the CP, highlighting continuing risks and calling for strict implementation.
The Council of Economics and Finance Ministers of the European Union will make its decision on October 10.

54

V. IMPLICATIONS OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE OUTLOOK
3.
Recognizing the significant actions taken, staff has lowered its projections for the
fiscal deficits. The required tax legislation has been passed and the higher rates are in effect.
Steps have been taken to reduce central government employment, freeze public wages, lower
energy price subsidies, and implement measures in healthcare and education. With these in
place, along with some budgetary control measures, staff estimates the fiscal deficit will
decline from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2007, and further to
5.6 percent of GDP in 2008 (Text Table 1 and Table 1).2 On this basis, staff now projects
additional consolidation of 0.6 and 0.9 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2008, respectively,
relative to the staff report. At the same time, the authorities have raised their deficit
projections, which now present a more realistic assessment of the likely fiscal consolidation
path (Table 2). The continuing differences in deficit projections—of 0.6 percent of GDP in
2006 and about 1 percent of GDP a year thereafter—reflect staff’s caution in light of the
uncertainties associated with implementation. Both the staff and authorities’ estimates point
to a rising debt ratio through 2008, when it is expected to peak at about 73 percent of GDP.
However, in staff’s central scenario, the debt ratio’s decline in the outer years would be
noticeably less than that projected by the authorities. Important pension and social welfare
reforms, as well as steps to broaden the tax base, have yet to be detailed and remain crucial
for more rapid and durable deficit and debt reduction.

These deficit numbers include for the first time the budget of motorway construction-related expenditures, a
practice adopted by the authorities in their September CP (as recommended by recent staff reports and the fiscal
ROSC). These expenditures amount to 0.6, 0.9, and 0.1 percent of GDP through 2006 to 2008.

55

4.
Financial markets continued to differentiate Hungary through the summer but
have since cautiously reduced this differentiation. Calmer international markets, which
saw the Icelandic krona and the Turkish lira regaining part of their sharp losses, also
benefited the forint, though with a lag. Markets appear to be viewing the prospects of
consolidation favorably, as indicated by the mild reaction to the recent demonstrations. The
forint has traded in a very narrow range and yields on local currency bonds have increased by
about 25 basis points. The rating agencies, however, have taken a more cautious view of the
political disturbances. Fitch changed its outlook from stable to negative (within the rating
category BBB+) on September 20 and Moody’s placed Hungary on review for a possible
downgrade on September 25. These actions had limited impact.
5.
Reflecting an earlier than anticipated slowdown, staff has lowered its projection
of GDP growth and current account deficit estimates. A slowdown in the second quarter
(going against the trend of accelerating growth elsewhere in the region) reflected a pullback
in publicly-sponsored motorway investment and a fall in corporate and residential
investment. Import growth, which tends to be a forward-looking indicator, also decelerated.
Since the announcement of the fiscal consolidation package in June, retail sales have been
weaker than expected and indices of consumer and business confidence have been falling.
The anticipated higher personal income taxes and public sector lay offs and the wage freeze
may have begun to restrain spending earlier than had been projected. Accordingly, staff’s
GDP growth projection has been revised down from 4.5 to 3.6 percent for 2006 and from
3.5 to 2.8 percent for 2007.3 As a consequence, import growth is also expect to slow, and the
current account deficit projected for 2007 is now 7.2 percent of GDP, 0.8 percent of GDP
lower than in the staff report. The trajectory of lower expected current account deficits over
the next few years will reduce the pace of external debt accumulation.
6.
Inflation is expected to recede close to the target range over the medium term.
Inflation has risen modestly since the staff report was issued. While inflation is expected to
increase further in the next twelve months due to tax and administered price increases, the
slowing economy should keep inflation contained. The authorities and the staff have revised
upwards their inflation projections for 2006 and 2007. Staff is now expecting inflation at
3.6 percent in 2006 and 6.1 percent in 2007, when the one-time effects of the tax and
administered price increases will kick in. Reflecting the expected slowdown in growth, staff
projects inflation to fall to 3.8 percent in 2008, just inside the ±1 percent range around the
3 percent inflation target, while the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is forecasting a slightly
higher 4.2 percent inflation rate. The MNB has raised the policy rate by a cumulative
175 basis points in four steps since June. With the projected 2008 inflation rate either within
3

The authorities’ growth estimates have not yet incorporated the recent deceleration. Their
growth projections and that of staff are broadly similar—slower growth in 2007 and 2008
relative to 2006 and a rise thereafter.

56

or just outside the target band, staff continues to recommend measured tightening that
responds to second-round effects if they do emerge, or a pause if these inflationary effects are
mitigated by the recent growth deceleration and the expected fiscally-induced slowdown.
VI. STAFF ASSESSMENT
7.
The CP marks a significant step forward towards needed fiscal consolidation,
but, if this objective is to be durably achieved, firm implementation of structural
reforms and a high level of transparency remain essential. The CP has been successful in
alleviating short-term vulnerabilities. Risks, however, are inherent to the strategy of relying
initially on tax increases on personal and corporate incomes and on one-off measures such as
wage freezes. First, the tax hikes could produce less revenue than anticipated due to evasion
or slower than projected growth. Second, the 2009 budget will need to address the pressure to
raise the frozen public sector wages. Also, the high tax wedge cannot be sustained. If the
more durable measures (of the type emphasized in the staff report) are not in place by then,
the financial turbulence of this spring and summer may repeat. Even if everything goes as
planned, the deficit will still be sizable (3½-4 percent of GDP) in 2009, government
expenditure (45 percent of GDP) disproportionate to Hungary’s per capita income, the tax
wedge high, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio above 70 percent. These features could cause a
prolonged period of below-potential economic performance. Finally, though the government
successfully navigated the recent political disturbances, transparent communication of the
risks and sacrifices that lie ahead will prevent more disruptive reactions in the future.
8.
Policy interest rates should remain focused on achieving the inflation target 18 to
24 months ahead. Short-term inflation tendencies are currently characterized by
considerable uncertainty in view of the many changes to taxes and subsidies. Thus, it is
difficult to infer inflationary trends from the recent rise in inflation. Both the authorities and
staff see inflation declining to close to or within the target range by 2008 and, hence, over the
horizon relevant for monetary policy decisions. The recent increases in policy interest rates
appear to have been at the higher end of the range of interest rate hikes needed under current
circumstances to bring inflation two years out within the target range. Staff urges continued
communication that the interest rate policy will be guided by the inflation target (and not by
an exchange rate target) and that further rate increases will respond to the strength of secondround effects from the tax and subsidy changes.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Hungary
On October 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Hungary.1
Background
Economic performance was respectable in 2005, though with mixed signals. GDP growth
slowed to 4.1 percent in 2005, the lower end of the economy’s potential estimated at between
4 and 5 percent a year. Consumption moderated, while investment and exports were sources
of strength. Fixed investment growth reflected largely government-sponsored motorway
construction. While business profitability was maintained overall, about two-fifths of small-and
medium-sized enterprises were reported to be unprofitable. Inflation declined significantly,
helped by globalization and one-off domestic factors.
Despite the relatively good macroeconomic performance, a loss of fiscal discipline has created
a twin deficit problem and worrisome debt dynamics. The series of missed fiscal deficit targets
continued in 2005, with the deficit reaching 7.5 percent of GDP, compared with a budgeted
deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP. The current account deficit remained high, at 7.4 percent of
GDP. Reflecting these developments, fiscal and external debt levels have risen to worrisome
levels over the last few years. The continuing sharp increase in foreign currency lending to
small businesses and households has created a further source of vulnerability. The risks were,
however, somewhat mitigated by the presence of buffers. The reserves-to-short-term debt
ratio remained above 100 percent, and public debt had long maturities and low foreign
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

currency exposure, minimizing the government’s rollover risk and the costs of a large
depreciation.
The vulnerabilities caused financial markets to differentiate Hungary from the rest of the
region. The differentiation of the forint started in late 2005 and increased thereafter, as did its
volatility. Yields on local currency bonds increased along with spreads on foreign currency
credit default swaps. Two major rating agencies downgraded Hungary and the third has put its
rating on review, pointing to persistent twin deficits and rising debt ratios, while the ratings of
other new member states of the EU have either remained unchanged or have been raised.
However, financial markets have been calmed by the fiscal consolidation package laid out in
the Convergence Programme submitted by the authorities to the European Commission on
September 1, and market reaction to recent political disturbances has been relatively mild.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Hungary has benefited greatly over the past decade from
significant economic reforms, and commended the performance of Hungary’s private sector
and its resilience despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Directors noted, however, that the
persistently large fiscal deficits and weak budget execution of recent years have led to
unsustainable increases in public debt, and economic growth, while respectable, has lagged
behind the performance of the New Member States of the European Union. While inflation has
fallen to historic lows, vulnerabilities relating to large fiscal and current account deficits have
weakened the forint and local currency bond prices. Against this background, Directors
stressed that urgent actions are needed to restore policy credibility and redress the fiscal and
current account balances in order to strengthen the groundwork for sustained high growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ EU Convergence Programme and the associated multiyear fiscal consolidation package, which they viewed as a significant effort to address
Hungary’s difficult challenges. They underscored that steadfast implementation of the
proposed adjustment will be crucial, along with the authorities’ readiness to take any additional
measures that may be required to signal to markets and partners the authorities’ strong
commitment to achieving Hungary’s goal of rapid nominal and real convergence. Equally,
continued resolve will be needed in carrying forward structural reforms to strengthen budgetary
processes and increase the flexibility and competitiveness of the economy.
Directors emphasized that the principal policy task is to place public finances on a sound
footing. They were encouraged by the significant steps reported in the authorities’
Convergence Programme, which they felt is based on a realistic reassessment of the fiscal
challenges facing Hungary. The expected fiscal consolidation would lower the current account
deficit and alleviate short-term vulnerabilities. Directors noted, however, that reaching the
targets in the program would require detailing further measures. Moreover, they emphasized
that a fiscal consolidation that is sustained over a longer period will be needed to lower
progressively the public debt-to-GDP ratio to a safer level. Directors urged the authorities to
implement a medium-term budget framework with multi-year expenditure ceilings to guide
fiscal policy.
Directors stressed that the composition of fiscal adjustment will have an important influence in
shaping the medium-term economic outlook going forward. Hungary will benefit from greater
reliance on expenditure-based consolidation that can enhance growth and efficiency, while
avoiding the growth dampening effects of undue reliance on revenue measures. In this
context, Directors welcomed the expenditure reduction measures in the Convergence
Programme. They urged more forceful reforms of pensions and social welfare transfers,

while noting that improved targeting and efficiency will contribute to lasting consolidation.
Directors stressed the continuing importance of containing overruns in the budget deficit
through greater transparency and accountability, and in this context supported recent efforts to
institute budgetary controls. Strengthening budgetary management was seen as a priority to
engender confidence that the envisaged fiscal consolidation will be successfully implemented.
Directors considered that any gains in revenues would best be achieved through broadening
the tax base, including by instituting a more far-reaching property tax, rather than through
surcharges on already high taxes on capital and labor.
Directors commended the National Bank of Hungary for its success in establishing the inflation
targeting regime, highlighting the important role played by timely communication of policy
actions. Directors considered that a measured monetary policy tightening may be needed in
the event of price increases in the coming months due to recent tax hikes and subsidy
reductions. However, given the one-off nature of the envisaged pressures and with a
weakening economy, inflation is expected to fall back close to the target in 2008. The
challenge, Directors observed, is to identify one-off inflationary influences, communicate them
to the public and financial markets, and fine-tune interest rate policy to deal with second-round
effects.
While acknowledging the robustness of the banking sector, including its profitability and
capitalization, Directors highlighted the increasing risks stemming from the rapid growth in
foreign currency lending. They noted that those risks are amplified by recent aggressive
lending practices and financial fragility of small and medium-sized enterprises. Directors
emphasized the need for more proactive supervision and regulation, including by instituting
regular stress tests of individual banks and more intensive on-site supervision of banks’ risk
management practices.
Directors had a wide-ranging discussion of the view that a floating exchange rate regime may
be best suited to Hungary’s circumstances. A number of Directors considered that a floating
exchange rate regime would be appropriate from a risk-management perspective and would
strengthen the inflation-targeting anchor. They also felt that increasing the perception of
greater exchange rate variability could reduce incentives to borrow in foreign currency. Some
other Directors, however, noted that the fluctuation band already provides adequate room for
maneuver in the conduct of inflation targeting. In any event, it was recognized that timing
issues will be crucial, and many Directors expressed concern that a formal switch in the
exchange rate regime in present circumstances could send a mixed signal to markets.
Directors stressed the need for actions to enhance labor market performance and
competitiveness. Raising employment will require reducing the overall cost of labor and better
targeting social welfare programs. Directors emphasized that productivity enhancement will be
crucial for maintaining competitiveness. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to
improve the pace of absorption of EU funds in productivity-enhancing activities, while linking
their deployment to fiscal structural reforms.
