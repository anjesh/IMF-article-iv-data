Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Dominique Desruelle
December 8, 2008
Discussions. A mission visited Freetown September 9–23, 2008 and met with
President Koroma, Finance Minister Carew, Central Bank Governor Kamara, other
government officials, parliamentarians, and representatives of the business community,
labor unions, civil society, and development partners. The mission team comprised
Messrs. Toé (head), Nsengiyumva, Sriram (all AFR), Takats (SPR), and Hilaire (resident
representative). Mr. Itam (OED) participated in several policy meetings.
PRGF arrangement. Approved on May 10, 2006 in an amount equivalent to
SDR 31.1 million (30 percent of quota); three disbursements totaling SDR 13.5 million
have been made to date. The authorities are requesting an augmentation of access in an
amount equivalent to SDR 10.4 million (about 10 percent of quota). Upon completion of
the third review, a disbursement of SDR 7.0 million (6.7 percent of quota) will become
available.
Exchange rate regime. In March 2008, the de facto exchange rate regime was
reclassified from a crawling to a conventional peg. The de jure classification is a floating
exchange rate regime. The country has accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Last Article IV consultation. The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded on
December 15, 2006. Executive Directors’ views and comments can be found at

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. Since the last Article IV consultation, Sierra Leone has moved forward to
consolidate peace. A smooth political transition brought into power a new government with a
pro–reform, anti–corruption agenda and a strong commitment to maintaining a stable
macroeconomic environment. Macroeconomic performance was again mixed. Output growth
was strong and broad-based, but inflation reverted to double digits in 2007 and stayed high
throughout 2008, largely due to the global food and fuel crisis.
Article IV issues. The Article IV discussions focused on four themes:
•

•

•

•

Coping with the impact of rising world food and oil prices. The authorities lowered
import duties in 2008 on rice, flour, and oil as a temporary measure. Going forward,
they intend to allow a full pass–through of world oil prices to domestic pump prices
and promote domestic agricultural production. However, the decision to not yet
reverse the tariff reduction for key imported food items may interfere with the latter
objective.
Making macroeconomic policies more effective. The authorities agreed on the need to
reinforce the monetary framework and concurred that fiscal policy should continue to
be supportive to reduce inflation.
Maintaining external stability and competitiveness. Staff analysis indicates that the
real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly aligned with economic fundamentals
and there are no major concerns about competitiveness at present. Nevertheless, staff
underscored the need for greater nominal exchange rate flexibility, not least to
prevent a disruptive appreciation of the REER going forward.
Promoting private sector-led growth. This requires improvement in basic
infrastructure and a more business-friendly environment.

Program issues. Program implementation continues to be challenging. Two quantitative
end–June 2008 PCs were missed, but there is progress on the structural front because the
authorities are committed to revitalizing the reform agenda. They are implementing
corrective measures to ensure that the end–2008 quantitative targets will be met. Staff is
proposing that the primary fiscal deficit be revised upward by 0.4 percentage points of GDP
to accommodate the unanticipated budget impact of the rise in world oil prices. The
authorities are requesting an augmentation of access in an amount equivalent to
SDR 10.4 million (about 10 percent of quota). The program for 2009 aims to: (i) reduce
inflation; (ii) rebuild gross foreign reserves; and (iii) strengthen the foundations for higher
and sustained economic growth. It faces risks that have been heightened by the unfolding
global financial crisis. The authorities are resolved to take actions to mitigate the risks; which
staff considers manageable. Staff recommends approval of the authorities’ requests for
waivers of nonobservance of the two quantitative PCs, modification of another PC,
completion of the third review, and augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement.

6
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sierra Leone’s main economic indicators still lag behind the averages for subSaharan Africa (SSA) and even other fragile SSA countries (Figure 1 and Table 11).
While its real GDP growth has exceeded the averages of SSA countries for the past five
years, GDP per capita in constant dollars remains well below them, and the country ranks
last among those surveyed in the United Nations 2007 Human Development Report. Having
also the lowest domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio, Sierra Leone has little fiscal space to fight
poverty. This underscores the magnitude of the efforts needed to achieve the MDGs.
2.
Sierra Leone’s record in responding to Fund policy advice has improved
somewhat (Box 1). Following setbacks leading up to the 2007 legislative and presidential
elections, implementation of the PRGF–supported program improved, paving the way for
completion of the much-delayed second review under the PRGF arrangement on
July 7, 2008. The landmark 2007 general elections were followed in July 2008 by peaceful
local council elections, creating an environment conducive to reforms. But to preserve
peace, the authorities must address the rising cost of living due to the global food and fuel
crisis in the context of pervasive poverty.

Box 1: Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
Advice

Status

Increase the domestic revenue-to-GDP
ratio and rationalize public expenditure to
create fiscal space for poverty reduction.

A three-year modernization plan for the National
Revenue Authority (NRA) is being implemented,
and preparation to introduce a Goods and Services
Tax (GST) early in 2009 is well advanced. An action
plan on public financial management (PFM) reforms
is being implemented, with assistance from budget
support donors.

Reform the civil service to improve the
quality of public services and bring the
wage bill under control.

The civil service reform has not yet been launched,
but because progress has been made in controlling
the wage bill, the conditionality on it has been
removed.

Adopt and implement a time-bound
comprehensive strategy to strengthen the
financial system and carry through with
implementation of the Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) Act.

The strategy was adopted in June 2008 and the
authorities are reviewing the AML Act 2005 and
drawing up regulations in line with international
standards to enhance AML/CFT compliance. A
Financial Intelligence Unit has been established at
the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL).

Pursue a flexible exchange rate policy to
facilitate economic adjustment to
exogenous shocks.

The nominal exchange rate of the leone against visà-vis the U.S. dollar has been relatively stable since
the last Article IV consultation, partly due to the
BSL’s de facto management through auctions as the
only seller of foreign exchange.

Accelerate governance and other
structural reforms to enhance
transparency and accountability, and
improve the regulatory framework.

A number of laws were amended to strengthen
institutions, notably: (i) the Anti-Corruption Act
(ACA), which now gives the Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC) more investigative and
prosecutorial powers; (ii) the Companies Act; and
(iii) the Bankruptcy Bill.

Avoid using tax incentives to stimulate
activity; adopt instead a rules-based and
predictable fiscal regime that applies
uniformly to all companies.

No cases of tax incentives to stimulate activity were
reported in 2007–08.

8
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
3.
Macroeconomic performance in 2007 and through September 2008 was mixed
(Figure 2):
•

Real GDP grew by an estimated 6.4 percent in 2007, led by solid agricultural and
mining production and buoyant activity in the construction and services sectors.
Preliminary information through August 2008 points to continued robust economic
activity in 2008, as evidenced by fast growth in credit to the private sector.

•

Headline inflation reverted to double digits in 2007 and has shot up since then, rising
to 17 percent (year-on-year) by September 2008. This reflected largely global food
and oil price developments. Higher-than-expected reserve money growth also added
to inflationary pressures in 2007.

•

The external current account deficit (including official transfers) increased slightly
in 2007 (3.8 percent of GDP versus 3.5 percent in 2006) following a slight
deterioration in the terms of trade. The foreign reserve position of the BSL is still
strong; at end–September 2008, international reserves stood at US$212 million (about
4.6 months of import coverage).

•

The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated enough in 2006–07 to offset the rise
in inflation, keeping the REER fairly stable. However, the REER appreciated by an
annual average of 2.9 percent between September 2007 and September 2008.

¶ 2):

Progress in program implementation in the first half of 2008 was uneven (MEFP
•

Two end-June quantitative PCs—on domestic government revenue and the
primary fiscal balance—were missed (MEFP, Table 1). The revenue shortfall
was Le 10.1 billion (about 0.2 percent of GDP), of which about Le 6 billion
was due to technical reasons 1 and the rest to the authorities’ decision to
suspend a vehicle license fee until the vehicle registration process could be
improved. Higher-than-programmed cost for fuel for the World Banksupported Emergency Power Project (EPP) and duplicate transfers to Local
Councils for health services 2 contributed to overruns on nonwage noninterest
expenditure of 0.4 percent of GDP, thus breaching the other PC.

•

Structural measures under the PRGF-supported program were implemented as
planned (Table 12). The continuous structural PC on the monthly meetings of
the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been observed starting in
June 2008 and legislation introducing the GST has been adopted by the
Cabinet and submitted to Parliament (June structural benchmark—SB). In
other areas of the reform agenda, the BSL finalized in June a comprehensive
strategy and action plan for reform of the financial sector; the Cabinet
launched a national Anti-Corruption Strategy (ACS) and Action Plan
for 2008–13 in early June; and a revised ACA, granting investigative and
prosecutorial powers to the ACC, was signed into law in September 2008.

•

The government completed an audit of domestic arrears accumulated in 2005–
07. Verified domestic arrears accumulated in 2007 amount to Le 20 billion
(0.4 percent of GDP); they are being cleared, as programmed, using FY 2008
resources. Arrears accumulated in 2005–06, also verified by the audit, amount
to Le 21 billion; the government intends to clear these over the medium term
as fiscal space is created. The authorities adopted a strategy on how to address
a recent out-of-court settlement with a domestic supplier in a manner
consistent with the agreed macroeconomic framework for 2008 and 2009.

1

A payment of Le 6 billion received from a mining company in June was credited to the CRF at the BSL on
July 2.
2

Due to clerical errors, first quarter allocations were transferred twice in April, along with those for the second
quarter; third quarter allocations were adjusted accordingly.

11
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Article IV Issues
5.
Against the backdrop of the global food and fuel crisis, the Article IV discussions
dealt with four challenges: (i) coping with rising world food and oil prices; (ii) making
macroeconomic policies more effective; (iii) promoting private sector-led growth in order to
make progress toward the MDGs; and (iv) maintaining external stability and competitiveness.
There was a general convergence of views on many, though not all, policy issues.
Coping with rising world food and oil prices
6.
The food and fuel crisis prompted the authorities to take a number of measures
to alleviate its impact on the population. They have: (i) cut import duty rates on rice and
flour from 15 and 20 percent, respectively to 10 percent; (ii) reduced taxation of petroleum
products by shifting the import duty from an ad-valorem rate to a specific rate and lowering
the excise tax; and (iii) imposed a ban on export of rice and palm oil. In parallel, with donor
assistance, the authorities intensified distribution of food to some of the most vulnerable
groups. 3
7.
Staff advised against general subsidies through reductions in taxes because they
tend to be ineffective but very costly to the budget. Pump prices of petroleum products
are lower than those in neighboring countries, providing incentives for cross-border
smuggling. Staff therefore recommended a full pass-through of world oil prices to domestic
prices and adoption of an automatic pricing mechanism to effect that. The authorities agreed
to review the price structure; they

(ii) increasing the access of

3

In August, the World Bank approved a grant of US$4 million for a “Food-for-Work Program” and
supplemental budget support of US$3 million to help compensate for the increased cost of food and fuel.
4

Pump prices are to be, henceforth, adjusted automatically when the combined effects of world market prices
and the exchange rate cause a variation of 5 percent in the leone-based landed cost of the petroleum products.

12
Making macroeconomic policies more effective
8.
The twin global crises (food and fuel, and financial) have brought to the fore
the need for more effective macroeconomic policies. Staff underscored that more
effective policies would improve the economy’s response to shocks and reduce domestic
absorption as needed. More effective policies would also help sustain growth, contain
inflation, and create fiscal space for pro-poor spending and public investment. To
accomplish this, monetary aggregates should be monitored closely so that monetary targets
can be promptly adjusted.
9.
The authorities concurred with staff that monetary policy should aim to
prevent the second-round effects of higher import prices of food and fuel. They
indicated that monetary policy will lean against the wind to prevent higher inflation
expectations from becoming entrenched. Given the high volatility in food and energy prices,
staff suggested that a measure of core inflation also be used in assessing whether the
monetary policy stance is appropriate.
10.
The authorities consider the intermediate objective of targeting reserve money
growth to contain inflation as the appropriate policy framework. The BSL is refining its
market-based instruments, including open market operations (OMOs) through the sale of
treasury bills and weekly foreign exchange auctions, but they have been handicapped by the
lack of an adequate supply of treasury bills for monetary policy purposes. While welcoming
the provision of additional T–bills for OMOs, staff underscored the need to improve monthly
forecasting of liquidity to make BSL interventions more effective, so that it can better control
reserve money growth and rein in inflation. 5 Staff pointed to the inherent tension between the
de facto exchange rate regime (a conventional peg) and reserve money targeting and
encouraged the authorities to allow greater exchange rate flexibility to supplement an
appropriate mix of treasury bills and foreign exchange sales. The authorities indicated that
the BSL had no target exchange rate path and limits its interventions to the achievement of
the program objective for international reserves.
11.
It is essential that that fiscal policy support monetary policy. The authorities
agreed to reduce the fiscal dominance of the past few years and gradually lower the domestic
primary fiscal deficit to limit government recourse to domestic financing. 6 7 This would help
prevent crowding-out private sector credit and contain inflation.

5

A Selected Issues Paper on monetary transmission mechanism concludes that a shock in the BSL’s policy rate
(91–day T–bill yield) typically impacts market interest rates and prices gradually, with the effect on prices
peaking between 10 and 15 months later.

6

Central bank financing will be limited to the use of MDRI resources consistent with the annual repayment
schedules of the original obligations.

12.
Mobilizing domestic revenue mobilization still poses a challenge. Sierra Leone
has the lowest domestic revenue-to-GDP ratio of all SSA countries (Figure 1) and needs to
step up efforts in this area to create fiscal space. The authorities have made commendable
progress in several areas, but recognized the need to sustain the reform efforts through timely
passage of supporting legislations and effective implementation of the modernization plan for
the NRA. Of particular note is their work to: (i) strengthen the Large Taxpayer Office;
(ii) modernize the customs administration; and (iii) prepare to introduce the GST. They
reiterated their commitment to introducing the GST but plan to delay its launch slightly to
allow more time to educate stakeholders. 8 They are also determined to review mineral rights
to maximize the contribution of the mining sector. Staff and the authorities agreed that
current revenue mobilization efforts, if sustained, could raise the domestic revenue-to-GDP
ratio from 11.8 percent in 2008 to 13.6 percent in 2011.
13.
Better management of public expenditure is essential to ensure budget
credibility and make public spending more effective. A National Action Plan (NAP) for
PFM, prepared in 2005–06, is being updated in light of the findings of a Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability assessment and the recommendations of a Fiscal Affairs
Department March 2008 technical assistance (TA) mission. Use of the IFMIS to process
transactions is improving budget execution. Staff emphasized the need to: (i) strengthen the
legal and regulatory framework for PFM; (ii) extend the IFMIS to all ministries,
departments, and agencies (MDAs) to more tightly control spending commitments and
prevent accumulation of domestic arrears; (iii) complete the reform of the procurement

decline from 25.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 18.1 percent in 2012.

framework; and (iv) build up audit and evaluation capacities. The authorities agreed that the
current medium-term expenditure framework process will need to be revamped to
emphasize strategic planning and introduce few selected performance indicators to ensure
that budget allocations are consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) objectives.
Promoting broad–based private sector–led growth
14.
Staff and authorities concurred that current growth rates are insufficient to
reduce poverty significantly, particularly for the large rural population. The authorities
recognized that raising economic growth will require higher factor accumulation and
productivity. The discussions therefore focused on policies needed to raise private sector
investment and improve the efficiency of all factors of production. The authorities indicated
that these policies will be reflected in the new PRSP, which is expected to be finalized later
this year. 9

Box 2: Sources of Economic Growth in Sierra Leone
Assessing the sources of growth within the standard growth-accounting framework, using a
capital-output elasticity of 0.35 (corresponding to the mid-value of the range of elasticities
generally used in many other studies for low-income countries) leads to the following
conclusions:
•

During the period 1980–90, the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) was
negative and the low level of real GDP growth was mostly generated by the labor
force.

•

The civil war (1992–2001) severely weakened productive capacity and institutions,
leading to very negative real GDP growth. The negative TFP during that period
explains more than 75 percent of the decline in economic activity.

•

Since the end of the civil war, each factor contributed positively to growth, especially
TFP (61 percent). There was, however, considerable volatility around the average,
reflecting large variations in the level of annual real GDP growth.

The turnaround in TFP contribution since the end of the conflict reflects a catch-up effect,
mainly driven by reconstruction, a substantial surge of aid flows (including debt relief), and the
payoff of improved structural and macroeconomic policies undertaken by the authorities
starting in 2002. The challenge facing the authorities is to increase the contribution of physical
capital to economic growth by raising public and private investment and maintaining or even
improving the level of TFP experienced over the last few years. This will require preserving
macroeconomic stability, deepening growth-conducive structural reforms, and improving the

business environment for private-sector-led growth.

17.
Financial sector stability needs to be addressed. Although most banks respect the
required prudential ratios, staff raised concerns about the continued rise in nonperforming
loans (NPLs) amid the significant increase in credit to the private sector (Table 10). The BSL
explained that the NPLs are confined to a small number of banks suffering from a handful of
large bad loans and that these banks are increasing provisioning and working to recover the
loans or writing-down the NPLs. It noted that the planned introduction in 2009 of risk-based
banking supervision (Basel II) and current efforts to introduce a credit reference bureau
should help reinforce the banking system and improve credit quality.
Maintaining external stability and competitiveness
18.
Staff assessed the value of the leone to be broadly in line with fundamentals,
but stressed the need for more exchange rate flexibility to help in adjusting to
exogenous shocks. The mission discussed with the authorities the preliminary results of a
Selected Issues Paper (SIP) that assesses external stability (Box 3). Employing different
methodologies, all results indicated no significant deviations from estimated equilibrium
values—although the analysis was hindered by data weaknesses. The authorities welcomed
the analysis and reiterated their commitment to increased exchange rate flexibility, not only
to allow for appropriate response to external shocks but also to prevent a disruptive
appreciation of the REER going forward. The BSL is prepared to actively participate in the
foreign exchange market also as a buyer (MEFP, ¶ 20). There was, as noted, agreement on
the importance of structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness and growth.

17

Box 3: Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
Results of a SIP on the REER and external competitiveness found the REER to be broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. The paper uses the three methodologies proposed by the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER). The results are as follows:
•

The macroeconomic balance approach finds that the current REER deviates by a narrow range from its
equilibrium values. The underlying current account balance is estimated to range from -4.6 to -5.3 percent
of GDP, depending on the smoothing methodology chosen. The current account norm is estimated at 4.1 percent of GDP. With the current account elasticity with respect to the real effective exchange rate
estimated to be 0.4, REER overvaluation is estimated to be between 1.3 and 3.1 percent, depending on the
underlying current account balance estimate used.

•

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach finds that currently the REER is slightly
undervalued. Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models are used to estimate the coefficients of the
major determinants of REER. Productivity, openness, investments, aid, and government expenditures are
used in the estimates. Even though the REER has historically shown large under- and overvaluations (see
figures below), currently it is undervalued by only 2.8 percent.

Using historical average net foreign assets position from 1980 to 2007, the external sustainability
approach finds that the REER overvaluation ranges between 0.9 and 2.7 percent.

19.
Trade integration is fundamental to Sierra Leone’s development strategy.
Improving cross–border trade could significantly reduce poverty and help diversify the
economy. After world prices recently declined from earlier peaks, the authorities rescinded
the ban on exports of rice and palm oil and reiterated their commitment to remain active in
regional initiatives on trade integration, especially within the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) and the MRU. They raised concerns, however, about
uneven implementation among ECOWAS countries of trade liberalization and the common
external tariff, which makes Sierra Leone vulnerable to smuggling and unfair competition.
20.
Sierra Leone is at a moderate risk of debt distress. The conclusions of the Fund
and World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) completed in June 2008 are still valid

18
(Country Report No.08/249). External debt indicators are expected to remain below the DSA
thresholds through 2028, barring unexpected adverse external developments. 10 Staff
reiterated the need for continued prudent macroeconomic policies and reliance on grants and
highly concessional resources to finance government operations. The authorities indicated
that they are discussing with commercial creditors debt relief through the IDA–Debt
Reduction Facility, and they are pursuing negotiations with official bilateral creditors on debt
relief agreements that are consistent with the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
B. Program Issues
Medium–term macroeconomic framework
21.
The medium–term macroeconomic framework agreed with the authorities
during the second PRGF review has been updated to reflect changes in the
international environment. The main changes are: (i) a downward revision in GDP growth
of 0.5 percentage points for both 2008 and 2009 to take into account the global downturn and
an unanticipated drop in mining production; 11 and (ii) an upward revision of inflation by
about 2 percentage points in 2008—due to the food and fuel price shocks—but a return to a
downward path in 2009. The updated macroeconomic framework still envisions a build up of
the BSL’s gross foreign reserves to 4.5 months of import coverage by 2012 and a significant
increase in domestic investment.
22.
The revised 2009 program is still subject to uncertainties related to the
unfolding financial crisis. Output growth is projected at 5.5 percent (compared with
6 percent in the original program), predicated on agriculture picking up any slack resulting
from the dampening effects of the global downturn and improved supply of electricity. 12 A
deceleration in inflation is projected (12.7 percent against 15.6 percent forecast for 2008),
helped by expected decline in food and oil world prices. The external current account deficit
is expected to decline slightly thanks to projected improvement in the terms of trade. Donor
financial support, more active participation of the BSL in the foreign exchange market as a
buyer should help achieve the objective of raising gross international reserves slightly above
4 months of import coverage. There are significant downside risks—not yet quantifiable—to
these projections stemming from: (i) lower remittances flows ; (ii) reduced foreign direct

Policies for the rest of 2008
23.
Additional measures are being taken to ensure that the fiscal targets for the
year as a whole will be achieved. On the revenue side, the measures include: (i) the
transfer of all off-budget revenue collected by MDAs to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, as
required by the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts; (ii) restoration petroleum product taxation to
its 2006 level; and (iii) the imposition, effective October 1, of interest and penalties on late
or under payment of tax. On the expenditure side, the authorities have cut allocations for the
last quarter to offset the spending overruns of the first half of 2008.
24.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at containing inflation pressures. The
capacity of the BSL to conduct OMOs has been enhanced (see ¶ 10) and the option to
convert an additional Le 32.5 billion of noninterest- into interest-bearing marketable
securities before year-end bodes well for the conduct of monetary policy.
Policies for 2009
25.
Fiscal policy will aim to consolidate macroeconomic stability and lay the basis
for solid economic growth (MEFP, ¶ 17). The 2009 budget envisages a reallocation of
resources from current toward capital expenditures, in line with the authorities’ decision to
give priority to basic infrastructures. A significant improvement is expected in revenue
collection, reflecting efficiencies realized as the NRA modernization plan takes hold. In
particular, the NRA will establish a Domestic Tax Department as a vehicle for achieving
integration of domestic tax collection (end–December PC). Also, a strict application of policy
measures specified in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts, and the introduction of the GST in
the first half of 2009 should enhance revenue performance. To bolster the shift in expenditure
composition, the authorities intend to enforce budget execution procedures and avoid

20
overruns and extrabudgetary spending (MEFP, ¶ 18). In line with the requirements of the

program will be financed primarily
by donor support of the government’s PRS and the use of MDRI resources.
26.
Monetary policy will aim at lowering inflation to single digits by the end
of 2009. To limit second-round effects of the food and fuel price increases in 2008,
monetary policy will be tightened moderately, with reserve money growth below growth in
nominal GDP. The mission reiterated the need for an appropriate mix of T–bills and foreign
exchange sales to help sterilize foreign exchange liquidity injections and use of MDRI
resources.
27.
Structural reforms in 2009 will strengthen the foundations for economic growth
and improve delivery of public services by
•

Implementing the comprehensive strategy for reform of the financial sector that was
adopted in June 2008. The plan calls for strengthening bank supervision, enhancing
competition, increasing access to commercial bank credit, and improving the payment
system. A number of laws have already been approved or are being revised (MEFP, ¶
22). The BSL is moving to build the capacity of its banking supervision department to
conduct supervision of banks, both onsite and off. It will adopt new off-site
surveillance guidelines and introduce reporting requirements based on these
guidelines (end–September PC).

•

Shoring up the capital base of the BSL to enable it to perform its core mandates more
effectively. Staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to recapitalize the BSL, by
converting in 2009 Le 130 billion of noninterest-bearing securities into 5–year T–
bonds at a 9 percent interest rate), as was recommended by the May 2008 IMF
Monetary and Capital Markets Department TA mission.

•

Putting the National Power Authority (NPA on a sound financial footing. The
authorities plan to adopt a comprehensive electricity tariff policy by December 2008
(SB) that would cover generation and distribution costs. Closer oversight of financial
and technical operations of the NPA is envisaged through the appointment of resident
financial experts and a supervisory engineer, in consultation with the World Bank.

21
•

Promoting good governance and accountability and enhancing transparency in the
use of public resources. Following the strengthening of the ACC (¶ 4), the authorities
will conduct semi-annual assessments of the status of progress on the national ACS to
ensure sustained progress in the fight against corruption (MEFP, ¶ 25). Sierra Leone
became a candidate for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in
February 2008 and agreed on a work plan to be implemented within two years to
reach validation status. The World Bank is helping with implementation of the work
plan.

Program monitoring, risks, and augmentation of access
28.
The proposed conditionality for the fourth review is consistent with program
goals. It has been streamlined to focus on tax and customs administrations, PFM, and
financial sector reform—all critical to achieving program objectives (see MEFP Table 3 for
the rationale for the measures). Staff is proposing an upward revision of the end–
December 2008 target for the primary fiscal deficit by 0.4 percentage points of GDP to
accommodate the full-year impact of the rise in world oil prices on the cost of fuel for the
EPP.
29.
The authorities are requesting augmentation of access equivalent to 10 percent
of quota (LOI, ¶ 5). While the external current account is expected to improve relative to
the program’s original target because of the significant World Economic Outlook downward
revision of oil prices for 2009, the balance of payments remains vulnerable to adverse
exogenous shocks. In addition, as indicated in the staff report for the second review
(Country Report No. 08/249), the authorities deferred their request for an augmentation
earlier in the year. The additional support will enable the BSL to build up its foreign reserve
position in 2009–10 and better cope with the unfolding global financial crisis should
additional risks to the program materialize (¶ 22).
30.
Given Sierra Leone’s arrears to private external creditors, the staff discussed
financing assurances. The authorities have been engaging with external commercial
creditors and have made goodwill payments to some of them to avoid litigation. The current
status of Sierra Leone’s relations with its external creditors provides sufficient financing
assurances for the Fund-supported program.
31.
•

Risks to the program include:
Lingering effects of increases in world food and oil prices. Notwithstanding the
measures taken to lessen the impact of the global food and fuel crisis and a recent
reversal in world prices, the rise in inflation may intensify wage demands causing
public spending to increase beyond what is budgeted for 2009.

22
•

The global financial crisis. While the financial system has yet to feel the impact of
the global financial crisis because Sierra Leone’s commercial banks have limited
exposure to international markets, the crisis could cause problems as commercial
banks might lose some of their deposits with troubled foreign correspondent banks. In
addition, parent banks of Sierra Leonean subsidiaries might be forced to repatriate
capital, thus constraining credit.
32.
The authorities have provided reasonable assurances to address these risks.
They pointed to the moderate general salary increases planned for 2009, which, in addition
to the measures on import tariffs for essential goods, should broaden domestic support for
their public sector wage policy. As to global financial crisis, the BSL will closely monitor
closely developments in the financial, especially bank open positions in foreign currency.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES

33.
Statistical weaknesses hamper surveillance, even though fiscal and monetary
statistics are in general adequate for program monitoring. There are still shortcomings in
balance of payments and national accounts data. The authorities are cooperating fully in
providing data to the Fund and regularly disseminating economic and financial data to the
public. The Fund Statistics Department has conducted a series of missions to Freetown as
part of the GDDS/DfID Project to help improve the collection and dissemination of national
accounts estimates. The authorities are making efforts to improve the timeliness and quality
of economic and financial data.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Sierra Leone has managed its post-conflict transition well, adopting policies
that support economic growth and poverty reduction. Peace is being consolidated,
economic growth has been robust and broad-based, inflation has been contained (although
the recent surge in world food and oil prices has made it difficult to bring it back to single
digits), and external reserve position has been relatively strong. Yet Sierra Leone’s social
indicators still lag far behind those of other fragile states. Sustained efforts are needed to
preserve macroeconomic stability and fight poverty, which is pervasive.
35.
While the authorities’ response to the food and fuel crisis in 2008 addressed
short-term concerns, a better-targeted more sustainable response is now needed. The
expansion of such social programs as school feeding and food-for-work programs would go a
long way in protecting more vulnerable groups while limiting budgetary costs. The recent
decision to allow full pass-through of world oil prices to domestic pump prices is welcome
and will facilitate efficient adjustments of the domestic economy.
36.
Mobilizing more domestic revenue should continue to be a priority. The
authorities are encouraged to steadfastly implement the NRA modernization plan and to
introduce the GST as planned in the first half of 2009. Given Sierra Leone’s relatively low

23
revenue-to-GDP ratio, the current review of mining rights needs to be expedited to explore
whether there is room to boost the sector’s contribution to domestic revenue while ensuring a
predictable environment for doing business.
37.
Weaknesses in budget procedures and execution must be addressed. Budget
discipline needs to be enforced to avoid expenditure overruns and extrabudgetary spending.
The authorities are encouraged to increase their efforts to improve public expenditure
management to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the use of
public resources.
38.
There are no major concerns about competitiveness and external stability at
present. However, given Sierra Leone’s high inflation differential with major trading
partners and the current account deficits likely over the medium term, there is a risk of a
disruptive appreciation of the REER. It is important that the authorities pursue sound
macroeconomic policies and allow for greater flexibility in the nominal exchange rate. They
also need to accelerate structural reforms and strengthen institutions to improve external
competitiveness.
39.
The global financial crisis has brought to the fore the urgency of addressing
weaknesses in the financial sector. While the banking system is well capitalized and
moderately profitable, the high level of NPLs is a cause of concern. It is important that the
BSL strengthen its supervisory capacity and monitor developments closely to detect financial
sector vulnerabilities early.
40.
The DSA for Sierra Leone shows little room for it to accumulate debt. The
authorities should rely on grants and highly concessional loans for financing their
development program. The authorities’ resolve to strengthen debt management and seek
grants from donors for implementation of the new PRS is understandable.
41.
Structural reforms need to be accelerated to raise economic growth and improve
delivery of public services. The authorities have made a notable commitment to return the
NPA to financial viability and promote good governance and accountability in the use of
public resources. They now need to accelerate the reform of the NPA and push down further
the cost of doing business in order to create an environment that is business-friendly.
42.
Staff recommends completion of the third review and augmentation of access.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers for the nonobservance of two quantitative
PCs because corrective measures have been taken that should ensure that the related end–
December targets can be met.
43.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months,
in line with the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
December 5, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements
the one attached to my letter to you dated June 5, 2008. It describes recent economic
developments and progress in the implementation of the PRGF-supported program during the
first half of 2008 as well as the policies that we intend to implement during the remainder
of 2008 and in 2009.
2.
On July 7, 2008, the Executive Board completed the second review under the threeyear arrangement for Sierra Leone under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
The Government of Sierra Leone in collaboration with staff of the IMF carried out a review
under the program for the first half of 2008 during 9–23 September 2008. The mission also
reviewed the program for the remaining period in 2008 and the framework for 2009.
3.
Despite strong efforts, program implementation during the first half of 2008 was
uneven. Two out of the 9 quantitative performance criteria (PCs)—domestic revenue and
domestic primary fiscal balance—were missed. The shortfall in revenue was due to technical
reasons as a payment of about Le 6 billion received from a mining company in June was not
credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) until 2 July 2008. The target for domestic
primary fiscal balance was not met because of expenditure overruns in the provision of fuel
for the World Bank-supported Emergency Power Project (EPP) due to the increase in the
price of oil and duplicate transfers to Local Councils. We are currently implementing
revenue-enhancing measures in order to meet the revenue target for the year as a whole. We
have also reduced budgetary allocations for the third and fourth quarters of 2008 to ensure
that full-year budget envelopes will be adhered to (except for the provision of fuel for the
EPP).
4.
In view of the foregoing, the Government of Sierra Leone requests for a waiver for
the non-observance of the performance criteria related to domestic revenue and domestic
primary fiscal balance.

37
5.
The Government of Sierra Leone requests the completion of the third review under
the PRGF arrangement and the release of the fourth disbursement upon completion of the
review. It also requests additional support from the Fund representing 10 percent of the quota
to help strengthen the central bank’s foreign reserve position. The government is aware that
an augmentation will require completion of an update safeguards assessment of the central
bank, and is fully committed to providing Fund staff will all the information and cooperation
required to complete this in a timely manner.
6.
The government of Sierra Leone believes that the policies set forth in the attached
MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program for 2008 and 2009, but stands
ready to take any further measures that become necessary for this purpose, in close
consultation with the Fund. The fourth and fifth reviews shall take place in May 2009 and
November 2009, respectively based on the end-December 2008 and end-June 2009
quantitative PCs and the applicable structural PCs. In addition, we will hold discussions with
IMF staff on the sixth review to be completed by April 2010, based on quantitative and
structural PCs for end-December 2009. The government of Sierra Leone will also continue to
provide the staff of the Fund with the information required to accurately assess
Sierra Leone’s progress in executing the policies contained in the attached MEFP.
Furthermore, it will continue to consult with the IMF on its economic and financial policies,
in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
7.
The government of Sierra Leone agrees, in line with its commitment to transparency
and accountability, to the publication of this letter, its attachments, and the related staff
report.
Very truly yours,

/s/
David O. Carew
Minister of Finance and Economic Development

APPENDIX I. ATTACHMENT I. SIERRA LEONE: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES
December 5, 2008
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum supplements the policies presented in our Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) of June 5, 2008 (IMF Country Report No 08/249).
It reviews developments during the first half of 2008 and outlines the macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms that the government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) will pursue
during the remainder of 2008 and in 2009.
II. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008
2.
Despite strong efforts, program implementation during the first half of 2008
was uneven. Two out of nine quantitative performance criteria (PCs)─for domestic
government revenue and primary fiscal balance─were missed (Table 1). On the structural
front, the continuous structural PC on the monthly meetings of the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) as well as the June structural benchmark (SB) on the legislation
introducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) were observed. The end–September structural
PC on the promulgation of the interest rate and penalties for late/underpayment of taxes, as
well as the end-September structural benchmark on the introduction of Tax Payer
Identification Number (TIN), was observed. Also, the ban on exports of rice and palm oil
instituted at the beginning of the food crisis, has been removed.
3.
The global food and fuel crisis has posed serious challenges to macroeconomic
stability. While growth prospects remain strong as evidenced by the fast growth in credit to
the private sector during the first half of this year, continued intensification and expansion of
food crops, and robust activity in the construction and service sector, inflation has picked up
significantly reaching 18 percent at end–July (12-month inflation). The surge in food and oil
prices has also been exerting heavy pressure on the balance of payments. The external
current account deficit is expected to increase in 2008 and the foreign exchange reserve
position of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) would drop more than originally programmed, in
nominal terms, to absorb the terms of trade shock.
4.
Despite stepped up revenue mobilization efforts by the National Revenue
Authority (NRA), the domestic revenue target was missed. The NRA collected
Le 294.5 billion, against a target of Le 301 billion. The shortfall is due to technical reasons as
a payment of about Le 6 billion received from a mining company in late June was not
credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) until July 2. Domestic revenue not
collected by the NRA was short of the target by Le 3.5 billion (less than 0.1 percent of GDP)

39
mainly due to a decision by the Ministry of Transport to suspend the vehicle license fee
pending improvement in the vehicle registration process.
5.
Budget execution during the first half of 2008 was complicated by the need to
consolidate the new administration and by lapses in fiscal discipline. Nonwage
noninterest current expenditures were higher than programmed by Le 22 billion (0.4 percent
of GDP) due to overruns and extrabudgetary spending. The overruns related mainly on the
following items: (i) fuel cost for the World Bank-supported Emergency Power Project (EPP)
due to higher-than-projected increase in world oil prices; (ii) transfers for health services
administrated by local councils; (iii) domestic and overseas traveling by government
officials; and (iv) recall and postings of new ambassadors and diplomatic staff.
Extrabudgetary expenditures comprised essentially GoSL contribution to the Bumbuna
Hydroelectric Project (BHP) and a payment for the printing of new passports. Despite
underspending on wages and salaries, shortfall in revenue and spending over commitments
on nonwage noninterest expenditures led to a higher-than-targeted primary fiscal deficit by
about Le 23 billion (0.4 percent of GDP). The larger-than-programmed primary fiscal deficit
was financed by the nonbank private sector.
6.
A final audit report on the verification of domestic suppliers’ arrears for the
period 2005–07 has been finalized. Total verified and accepted arrears for 2007 amount to
about Le 20 billion (0.3 percent of the 2008 nominal GDP), against an initial estimate of
Le 26 billion. 1 Verified and accepted arrears accrued in 2005–06 also amounted to
Le 20 billion. The 2007 audited arrears will be cleared in 2008 while those accumulated
in 2005–06 will be in 2009–10 as fiscal space is created. With respect to the out-of-court
settlement agreed with a domestic supplier to repay domestic arrears dating back to the civil
war in the late 1990s, we have reached an agreement to defer implementation of the out-ofcourt settlement pending the mobilization of resources to retire the claims. In the meantime, a
goodwill payment will be made in 2008, consistent with our strategy note on how
government intends to implement the agreement reached with the creditor.
7.
On the monetary side, both reserve and broad money grew less rapidly than
programmed during the first half of 2008. This was mainly on account of lower than
projected net foreign assets. The PCs on net domestic assets of the BSL and net bank credit
to the government were observed.
8.
Bank credit to the private sector continued to grow strongly. Falling lending
rates in response to a drop in Treasury bill yields, continued strong demand for loans from
construction, import trade, and communication sectors, and the entry of new banks with high
liquidity were the main reasons for this sharp increase. Yield on the 91–day treasury bills fell
1

This initial estimate is the difference between the total unpaid claims of Le 41.1 billion indicated in our June
2008 MEFP, minus budgeted allocations for Local Councils that were not effectively transferred in 2007.

40
significantly (by 600 basis points) to about 15 percent during the first half of 2008 due to
excess demand from market participants, arising from a drop in the amount of 91–day
treasury bills offered, mainly as a result of the fact that the BSL had commenced sourcing the
182–day and 364–day treasury bills from the stock of the maturing 91–day T–bills.
9.
The banking sector continues to be saddled by rising nonperforming loans.
However, banks are making efforts to set aside adequate provisions or writing down bad
loans. Loss of several staff members has strained the ability of the BSL to closely supervise
the banks. Nevertheless, steadfast implementation of the recently-adopted financial sector
development strategy aimed at strengthening the banking supervision capacity of the BSL
will help address this problem.
III. POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2008
10.
We have revised slightly the macroeconomic framework to incorporate the
impact of the global food and fuel crisis. Real GDP growth is projected at 5.5 percent,
down 0.5 percentage points compared to the program. Average inflation is expected to rise to
15.6 percent (against the previous projection of 14.1 percent). The deeper-than-anticipated
food and fuel crisis, coupled with an unexpected drop in diamond production, would widen
the external current account deficit (including official transfers) to 7.1 percent of GDP
compared to the previous projection of 6.5 percent. Gross official reserves are expected to
absorb some of the fuel and food price shocks, dropping from 4.6 months of imports
coverage in 2007 to 3.9 in 2008.
11.
To ensure that the revenue target for the year as a whole is achieved, we have
taken a number of additional short-term measures. These include: (i) the transfer of all
off-budget revenue collected by Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to the CRF;
(ii) restoration of the excise tax and the ad-valorem import duty on petroleum products to
their 2006 levels; (iii) enforcing the payment of tax arrears with the application of interest
and penalties on under/late payment of tax; and (iv) the transfer of the collection of the
vehicle license, mining fees, freight levy fees pharmacy license fees, and cost recovery
proceeds on the sale of essential drugs from the current collection agencies to the NRA. The
NRA will implement and enforce the findings of the recently concluded field audit of firms
and continue to strengthen the Enforcement and Debt Management Unit of the Income Tax
Department.
12.
It has become necessary to revise the projected domestic primary fiscal
balance by 0.4 percent of GDP to accommodate the impact of higher fuel prices. As
indicated in ¶ 5, fuel for the EPP will cost Le 24 billion more than budgeted and the GoSL’s
contribution to the BHP (about Le 22 billion) was not programmed. These budgetary
overruns will be partly offset by projected savings on wages and salaries (about
Le 16 billion) and the remaining financing needs will be covered by the transfer of
Le 2 billion per month (starting in September 2008) by the National Power Authority (NPA)

41
to the CRF, as agreed in the context of the EPP, as well as a targeted budgetary assistance
expected from the Peacebuilding Fund.
13.
Money growth will continue to be restrained to reduce inflation expectations.
The BSL will conduct open market operations to control the growth of reserve money. To aid
in this effort, the government has converted in September another Le 15 billion noninterest–
bearing non–marketable securities held by the BSL and plans to convert an additional
Le 32.5 billion by end-2008 in order to reach Le 100 billion that has been agreed upon in
MOU between the MoFED and the BSL. The Monetary Policy Technical Committee
(MPTC) will continue to meet on a monthly basis and coordination between the MoFED and
the BSL will be improved.
14.
Measures are being taken to strengthen the financial sector. The BSL is
promoting competition in the banking sector. Between June 30, 2008 and
September 30, 2008, three new banks have commenced operation. The BSL is focusing on
developing interbank market by discouraging banks to access its rediscount facility so that
banks can lend/borrow from each other for their short-term liquidity needs. It is also working
on introducing an efficient payments system, including a Real Time Gross Settlement System
(RTGS). To help build the securities markets, the BSL has harmonized the government
securities auction system, has introduced 182–day (since July 31) and 364–day (since
January 15) treasury bills, and a book-entry system (BES) has been installed and is near
completion. However, the use of the BES is currently restricted to primary markets auction.
To reduce the vulnerability from nonperforming loans, the BSL will enforce the minimum
capital requirement for all banks of Le 12 billion by end–2008 and Le 15 billion by end–
2009. To prevent money laundering, the BSL has developed a draft strategy on anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. A Financial Intelligence Unit has been
set up to implement the strategy once validated with stakeholders.
15.
The BSL has initiated the preparation of a comprehensive financial sector
development plan (FSDP) and an internal Medium-Term Strategy (BSL-MTS). These
two diagnostic reviews are being undertaken in collaboration with other stakeholders in the
financial sector and supported by development partners interested in the financial reform and
are expected to be completed by end-2008. They come on the heels of the strategy for the
financial sector adopted in May 2008 (a prior action for the second review). Both the FSDP
and the BSL-MTS will provide the analytical and diagnostic foundation on which to
modernize and increase the responsiveness of both the central bank and the overall financial
system to growth, quality employment and poverty alleviation, as well as to global
challenges.
IV. PROGRAM FOR 2009
16.
The program objectives for 2009 are to achieve real GDP growth of
5.5 percent, reduce end–of–period inflation to single digits, and rebuild foreign

42
exchange reserves to at least 4.2 months of imports. Output growth should continue to
benefit from improved supply of energy, ongoing public initiatives to increase agriculture
productivity and intensification, and higher public investment in basic infrastructure. With a
mix of domestic policies and external developments, inflation should ease but remain in
double digits due to lingering effects of the world food and fuel crisis. International reserves
are expected to slowly recover in 2009, helped by the requested augmentation of access
under the PRGF arrangement. The government is also finalizing the second generation
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II), which will clearly set the Government’s
priorities for reducing poverty over the medium term.
Fiscal policy
17.
Fiscal policy in 2009 will aim at consolidating macroeconomic stability and
laying the basis for sustained economic growth. The proposed 2009 budget envisages a
significant reduction in the primary fiscal deficit (1 percent of GDP) while accommodating
an increase in public investment. Its main features are:
•
On the revenue side, total domestic revenue is projected at 12.3 percent of GDP (from
11.8 percent in 2008), based on strict enforcement of the provisions of the existing tax
legislations, application of policy measures adopted in the 2007 and 2008 Finance
Acts, as well as the expected improved efficiency expected from the modernization
plan of the NRA, in particular the automation of the customs procedures and the
establishment of the Domestic Tax Department. In addition, a “specific” excise tax
will be introduced on alcohol beverages based on alcohol content and the import duty
on cement will be restored (to 20 percent ), consistent with the ECOWAS Common
External Tariff. The government will ensure timely passage of relevant legislation for
the introduction of the GST by April 2009 and fast-track the renegotiation of mineral
rights to enhance domestic revenue collection. Government will eliminate
discretionary tax and duty exemptions and provide logistics to the Preventive
Services and Special Duties unit of the NRA to intensify border patrols to reduce
cross border smuggling.
•
On the expenditure side, the wage bill is projected to stay at around 6 percent of GDP.
It includes an increase of 15 percent in basic pay for civil servants and the hiring of
about 1000 police officers. Current nonwage noninterest expenditures will be limited
at 6.9 percent of GDP and include an allocation of Le 42 billion (0.6 percent of GDP)
to cover the government’s share in the EPP during the first half of the year. 2 Capital
spending will be increased by 1.2 percentages points of GDP to accommodate the
public infrastructure improvement program. The domestic interest bill includes the
cost of the planned conversion of an additional Le 60 billion from the outstanding
noninterest-bearing non-convertible securities into marketable securities and the
issuance of a Le 130 billion of T–bonds in two tranches to recapitalize the BSL.
2

The BHP is expected to come on-stream by June 2009.

43
•

Regarding financing items, the government’s recourse to central bank financing will
be limited to the use of MDRI resources, which should not exceed Le 88 billion.
Commercial bank financing will be limited to Le 12 billion. Domestic financing will
also include an allocation of about Le 11.9 billion to clear part of the audited 2005–06
domestic arrears.

18.
Budget execution and control will be enhanced in 2009. In particular, control
over expenditure commitments will be tightened to avoid overruns and prohibition of
extrabudgetary spending will be strictly enforced. To strengthen the role of line ministries in
the budget execution process, budget officers will be recruited and assigned to MDAs that
have IFMIS “rolled out”, with a view to make budget committees in these public entities
fully operational. The recently-adopted policy of full pass-through of world oil prices to
domestic petroleum prices will help insulate the budget, and the social consequences will be
effectively addressed via well-targeted subsidies for vulnerable groups.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
19.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at mitigating second round effects of the
food and fuel crisis. Reserve money is projected to grow at a rate just below that of nominal
GDP (13.4 percent against 14.3 percent). This level will be sufficient to accommodate the
continued strong expansion of private sector credit, projected donors’ inflows, the use of
MDRI resources and the rebuilding of international reserves to 4.2 months of import by end–
2009. In addition, the government has committed to provide additional Le 60 billion of
marketable securities to enhance the ability of BSL to control reserve money growth.
20.
The BSL will seek to increase exchange rate flexibility to allow for appropriate
exchange rate responses to external shocks. In particular, the BSL will participate, as
needed, on the foreign exchange market also as a buyer, not solely as a seller. This would
allow the BSL to more actively manage its foreign exchange reserves. The BSL will continue
to seek to balance treasury bills sales, foreign exchange auctions, and potential foreign
exchange purchases for its optimal monetary policy mix.
Other structural reforms
21.
Our structural reform agenda will continue to be directed at supporting
private sector development. To this end, efforts will aim at strengthening the financial
sector, restoring the financial viability of the power and water public utility companies, and
improving governance and accountability in the use of public resources. The support of our
development partners remains critical for the success of these reforms.
22.
Ongoing reforms in the financial sector will be actively pursued to deepen
financial intermediation and ensure strong and competitive financial sector. The action
plan for the development of the financial sector adopted in June 2008 calls for a number of

44
measures to be taken in 2009 to strengthen banking supervision in light of the large
expansion in private sector credit and deterioration in banks’ asset quality. In this context, the
BSL will recruit and train staff on banking supervision. It will also adopt new off-site
surveillance guidelines for banks, consistent with the requirements of the Revised Banking
Act and Other Financial Services Act. Also, establishment of a credit reference bureau is
under consideration. The Sierra Leone Stock Exchange Company has been granted license to
operate a stock market starting in September 2008 and it plans to commence trading by the
end of 2008. A number of acts (Companies Act, Securities Bill, Bankruptcy Bill, and
Collective Investment Scheme Bill) have been revised or drafted to help promote financial
intermediation, especially in the riskier and longer–term segments of financial markets. The
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act 2005 is being revised to include provisions for
combating the financing of terrorism (CFT)and regulations in line with international
standards are being developed to enhance our AML/CFT compliance program. The BSL is
also in the process of revising the Bank of Sierra Leone Act of 2000. Actions will also be
taken to timely complete an audit of the 2008 financial statements of the central bank. The
hiring process will be completed by end-December 2008 and the audit will be finalized by
end-March 2009.
23.
The capital base of the BSL will be strengthened to enable it perform its
mandates. In line with the recommendations of the May 2008 Fund technical mission, the
government will recapitalize the central bank by allowing it to covert, in two tranches,
Le 130 billion of noninterest-bearing securities into 5–year T–bonds at 9 percent interest rate.
24.
Steps are being taken to accelerate the restructuring of the NPA and improve
its finances. Preparations are advancing for the adoption of a comprehensive electricity tariff
policy by end-December 2008. Greater oversight over the finances and technical operations
of the NPA will be henceforth exercised. 3 In this regard, the GoSL, in consultation with the
World Bank, will appoint resident experts at the NPA for billing/collections and financial
control with line authority and a Supervisory Engineer to advise the NPA Board. Under the
EPP, which is partly funded by World Bank and the GoSL through the use of MDRI
resources, the NPA was to be making a monthly payment of Le 2 billion starting April 2008.
Up to August 2008, NPA did not pay any amount into the CRF and as a result, total amount
outstanding is Le 10 billion (for 5 months). NPA will put in place a credible plan for the
payment of these arrears starting this year. NPA is to make further monthly payments of
Le 2 billion from September to December 2008 as well as Le 1.92 billion of a loan extended
to the NPA in December 2006. This will bring total payment in 2008 to Le 11.9 billion.
25.
The government remains committed to promoting good governance and
accountability in the use of public resources. We have recently launched the national Anti3

NPA has been instructed to comply without any further delay with the commitment to transfer monthly
Le 2 billion to the CRF.

45
Corruption Strategy (ACS) for 2008–13 4 and enacted into law in September 2008 a revised
Anti-Corruption Act that strengthens the power of the ACC. The Act is now in conformity
with the African Union and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and requires
that all high-level public servants declare their assets. 5 The GoSL will conduct semi-annual
assessments of the national ACS to monitor progress in its implementation and take remedial
actions as needed.
26.
Two major risks may affect the implementation of the 2009 program but steps
are being made to mitigate them. First, the lingering effects of the global food and fuel
crisis may intensify pressure to increase basic pay for civil servants beyond what is budgeted
for 2009. Second, the ongoing financial crisis could impact negatively on the balance sheet of
commercial banks, thus constraining credit availability. Also, a decline in remittances would
adversely affect the balance of payments. The government will continue to seek consensus
among political and social players concerning the need to maintain fiscal discipline by
executing the budget as voted by the parliament. Also, the BSL will monitor closely
developments in the financial sector and will take necessary measures to avoid any major
credit crunch in the economy. As in 2008, we will take the necessary steps to ensure that
the 2009 budget is shielded from the potential liabilities of the contract with the second
independent power provider.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING
27.
The program will be monitored based on quantitative PCs set for endDecember 2008, end–June 2009 and end–December 2009, as well as on quantitative
benchmarks set for end–March and end–September 2009, as indicated in Tables 1 and 2
annexed to this attachment. The program will also be monitored based on structural
performance criteria and benchmarks during 2009, as presented in Table 3.

4

The government also nominated a high-powered Steering Committee to ensure that the strategy will be fully
implemented.
5

President Koroma has already declared his assets.

ATTACHMENT II. SIERRA LEONE: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
December 5, 2008
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Sierra Leonean authorities
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and
structural performance criteria (PCs) and benchmarks for the reminder of the program
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, as well as the
related reporting requirements. Unless otherwise specified, all quantitative PCs and
indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from the beginning of the
period, as specified in Table 2 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) of the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) for 2009.
2.
Program exchange rates. For the purpose of this TMU, foreign currency
denominated transactions will be converted into Sierra Leonean currency (leones) using the
program exchange rates shown in the box below and the market exchange rate against the
US$ in effect on October 31, 2008 (as published in International Financial Statistics) for
transactions in other currencies than the US dollar, the Euro, the U.K. Pound, and the Special
Drawing Rights (SDR).

II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)
3.
Definition. Unless otherwise noted here, gross foreign exchange reserves of the Bank
of Sierra Leone (BSL) are defined as reserve assets of the BSL. Reserve assets are defined in
the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (5th ed.) and elaborated in the reserve template of the
Fund’s International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines for a Data
Template. They exclude foreign assets not readily available to, or controlled by, the monetary
authorities.
4.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on gross foreign exchange reserves will be adjusted
(a) downward (or upward) by the amount in U.S. dollars of the shortfall (excess) in
programmed external budgetary assistance—the downward adjustment will be capped at the
equivalent of US$20 million while the upward adjustment will be equal to the amount—if

50

any, exceeding US$20 million; 1 (b) downward (upward) for any shortfall (excess) in the
U.S. dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; and
(c) upward (or downward) for any increase (or decrease) in BSL short-term (one year or less
in original maturity) foreign currency-denominated liabilities (to residents and nonresidents).
B. Net Domestic Assets of the BSL
5.
Definition. Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BSL are defined as the end-period
(based on daily data) stocks, during the month of the test dates, of the reserve money less net
foreign assets calculated at the program exchange rates. Reserve money includes currency in
circulation and required reserves on leone deposits. Net foreign assets of the BSL are defined
as gross foreign exchange reserves (defined above) minus foreign liabilities (defined below).
Foreign liabilities are defined as short-term (one year or less in original maturity) foreign
currency-denominated liabilities of the BSL to nonresidents and the outstanding use of Fund
credit.
6.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on the NDA of the BSL will be adjusted upward by
the amount of the shortfall in the external budgetary assistance at the test dates, up to a
maximum of US$20 million. In the event of an excess in the external budgetary assistance
greater than US$20 million, the NDA ceiling will be adjusted downward by the amount
exceeding US$20 million. The leone value of the cumulative shortfall or excess in external
budgetary assistance will be converted at the program exchange rates.
C. Net Domestic Bank Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
7.
Definition. NCG refers to the net banking system’s claims on the central government
and is defined as follows:
•

the net position of the government with commercial banks, including: (a) treasury
bills; (b) bonds issued by the GoSL; (c) loans and advances; less (a) Central
government deposits (defined to include account balances under the authority of
controlling officers, but excluding deposits in the sterilization account); plus

•

BSL holdings of (a) GoSL statutory bonds; (b) ordinary GoSL bonds; (c) bonds in
respect of loans to current and former parastatals; (d) treasury bills on the trading
portfolio of BSL; (e) other government stock; (f) HIPC debt relief deposits; less
(a) special noninterest-bearing government stocks to cover foreign exchange
valuation losses; (b) treasury bills and treasury bearer bonds held by the BSL for

1

External budgetary assistance is defined as program grants and program loans, excluding HIPC assistance.

51

monetary policy operations; and (c) bonds issued by the GoSL in subscription to the
paid-up capital of the BSL.
8.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on the increase in NCG will be adjusted upward
(downward) by up to the amount of the shortfall (excess) in external budgetary assistance.
The upward adjustment will be capped at the equivalent of US$20 million while the
downward adjustment will be equal to the amount—if any, exceeding US$20 million. The
leone value of the cumulative shortfall or excess in external budgetary assistance will be
converted at the program exchange rates. The ceiling will also be adjusted downward
(upward) by the excess (shortfall) in the leone value of net issues of government securities to
the nonbank private sector vis-à-vis the program target (specified in the memorandum items
in Table 2 of the MEFP).
9.
Data source. The data source for the above will be the series “Claims on Government
(Net)” submitted to Fund staff and reconciled with the monthly monetary survey prepared by
the BSL. These data will be reconciled with monthly reports with the monetary data
(Treasury bill transactions, ways-and-means account, and Treasury bearer bond transactions).
10.
Definition of Central government. Central government is defined for the purposes
of this memorandum to comprise the central government and those special accounts that are
classified as central government in the BSL statement of accounts. The National Social
Security and Insurance Trust and public enterprises are excluded from this definition of
central government.
D. Domestic Revenue of Central Government
11.
Definition. The floor on total domestic central government revenue is defined as
total central government revenue, as presented in the central government financial operations
table, excluding external grants.
E. Domestic Primary Fiscal Balance of Central Government
12.
The floor on the domestic primary budget balance of the central government is
defined as domestic revenue minus total expenditure and net lending, excluding interest
payments, and externally-financed capital expenditure.
F. Subsidies to the National Power Authority (NPA)
13.
Definition. The term “subsidy” refers to any financial government support (i.e.,
unrequited transfers) to the NPA. It does not include the government’s on-lending of external
loans for capital expenditure of the enterprise. The subsidy is to be reduced by the amount of

52

arrears accumulating in regard to the charges for government’s electricity consumption. This
PC will apply on a continuous basis.
G. External Payment Arrears of the Public Sector
14.
Definition. External payment arrears of the public sector are defined as the stock of
new external overdue debt-service payments by the public sector. For the purposes of this
PC, the public sector comprises the central government, regional government, all public
enterprises and the BSL. The nonaccumulation of external arrears is a performance
criterion during the program period. Excluded from this PC are those debts subject to
rescheduling. This PC will apply on a continuous basis.
H. New Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Public Sector
with an Original Maturity of One Year or More
15.
Definition. Those are defined as all forms of new debt with original maturity of one
year or more contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. 2 This PC applies not only to debt
as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
(Decision No. 12274 (00/85), August 24, 2000) but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from this PC are disbursements
from the IMF and those debts subject to rescheduling. For the purposes of this PC, the
“public sector” is as defined in ¶ 14 above. This PC will apply on a continuous basis.
I. External Short-Term Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Public Sector
16.
Definition. External short-term debt is defined as external debt stock with a maturity
of less than one year contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. Debt is defined in
Annex I of this TMU. For this purpose, short-term debt will exclude normal trade credit for
imports. For the purposes of this PC, the public sector is as defined above. This PC will apply
on a continuous basis.

2

Debt is considered concessional if it has a grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more. Calculation of the
degree of concessionality of new external borrowing is based on the last 10-year average commercial interest
reference rate (CIRR) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for loans with
maturities of at least 15 years and on the last six-month average CIRR for loans maturing in less than 15 years.

53

III. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Poverty-related Expenditures
17.
Definition. Poverty-related expenditures refer to those expenditures in the areas
identified in Table 2 of the Sierra Leone HIPC Decision Point Document. These budgetary
expenditures include but are not limited to those sub-components that are financed by
drawdown from the HIPC Relief Account at the BSL.
IV. STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
18.

The government will complete the following actions in 2009:

•

The Ministry of Finance will provide monthly projections for government revenue
and expenditures to the BSL for use in producing a monthly liquidity forecast to be
transmitted to the Monetary Policy Committee, which will meet monthly to provide
guidance on the stance of monetary policy in the month ahead. Minutes of each
meeting will be transmitted to Fund staff (on a continuous basis).

•

Recruit and assign budget officers to MDAs that have IFMIS “rolled out” and ensure
their budget committees are fully operational (by end–June).

ANNEX I

Implementation of the Revised Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August 24, 2000 which reads as follows:
“(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision
of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor
to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on
which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements
under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more
specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to
be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the
operation, repair or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out
above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt”. (c) Excluded from this performance criterion are normal
import-related credits, disbursements from the IMF, and those debts subject to rescheduling
arrangements”.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the IMF safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Sierra Leone was subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement approved on May 10, 2006.
The assessment, which was completed on June 12, 2006, proposed recommendations to
address new and continuing vulnerabilities in the financial reporting, internal audit, and
internal controls areas. The implementation of these measures is being monitored by IMF
staff.

Completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end–2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

4
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The BSL calculates an official exchange rate every Friday morning as the weighted average
of the auction rate, the commercial banks’ mid-rate and the bureaus’ mid-rate in the previous
week, for customs valuation purposes and for official transactions. Commercial banks may
buy and sell foreign exchange from/to individual customers, as well as trade among
themselves or with the BSL on a freely negotiable basis. As of November 6, 2008, the BSL
mid-rate was Le 3003.68=US$1. In March 2008, the exchange rate regime was reclassified as
“conventional peg” to reflect the nominal stability of exchange rate developments under de
facto management by the BSL through the auction as the only seller of foreign exchanges.
With effect from December 14, 1995, Sierra Leone has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. On June 29, 2001, Sierra Leone removed the remaining exchange
restriction, in the form of a tax clearance certificate required for payments and transfers of
certain types of current international transactions. Sierra Leone continues to maintain an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
December 15, 2006. The next Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone will be held in
accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on
July 15, 2002.

Appendix III. Statistical Issues
1.
Data provided to the Fund are affected by serious shortcomings that significantly
hamper surveillance. The prolonged civil war resulted in a virtual collapse of statistical
systems in the late-90s. Serious deficiencies still affect balance of payments statistics,
national accounts, and social indicators. The authorities are cooperating fully in providing
data to the Fund and disseminating economic and financial data to the public on a regular
basis. The country participates in the GDDS, but its metadata needs to be updated.
2.
A major and sustained improvement in the coverage and timeliness of economic data
will require greater inter-agency coordination and restructuring the institutional framework.
Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) continues to face scarce budgetary resources, which adversely
affect the compilation of national accounts and price statistics. Since March 2004, and with
support from the GDDS Anglophone Africa Project, six national accounts TA missions
visited Freetown, the most recent in January 2008. These missions reviewed source data,
methodologies, compilation, and dissemination issues and assisted with data development
and improvements in methodology.
National accounts
3.
The coverage of private sector activities in the national accounts is hampered by an
outdated business directory and low response ratios to surveys. Small businesses in
particular, which represent a very high proportion of business activity, are not adequately
captured in national account statistics. The consumer price index (CPI) is used extensively to
derive estimates of GDP at constant prices. AFR missions continue to make their own
estimates and projections of key national accounts aggregates, as well as adjustments to
historical data using available information.
4.
Efforts to reconstruct the national accounts estimates commenced during 2003/04,
with the main effort focusing on preparing new estimates for the period starting in 2001.
Resource constraints significantly delayed production of final estimates and only preliminary
data for 2001–04 were made available. Efforts are underway to prepare revised national
accounts based on a 2005 benchmark and using 2005 prices to compile constant price
estimates. However, shortages of resources and staff continue to pose major constraints to
statistical development undertaken by SSL.
Prices
5.
The CPI is compiled on a monthly basis by the SSL and published with a lag of about
three weeks. It has been rebased to 2003 using the 2003 Sierra Leone integrated household
survey and continues to cover the capital city and three towns. While national CPI is being
compiled, the authorities continue to publish the old CPI (1992=100). To avoid confusion,
the authorities should be encouraged to cease publication of the old series, although they may

10

Government finance statistics
6.
The budget reporting system was established with assistance under the Fund/UNDP
technical assistance project. Monthly data on central government revenue, current
expenditure, and financing are provided with appropriate detail. The European Commission
(EC) is providing technical assistance to the Accountant General’s Office to improve the
timeliness and quality of fiscal data. Data on capital expenditure are poor. Fiscal data are
reported to AFR but the submission of annual data for publication in the GFS Yearbook has
been discontinued (the most recent data refer to 2004). Fiscal data only cover the central
government, excluding extrabudgetary agencies and local governments.
7.
There is an urgent need for greater timeliness and accuracy of data on foreignfinanced development projects. Reports on the implementation of the development budget
and its financing are currently not produced in a format that is suitable for budget analysis as
implementation data are not available. There is also need for assuring quality control of the
final data. The authorities are currently considering the introduction of a flash reporting
system for government expenditure in general- and foreign aid-financed projects. In the
context of the GDDS regional project for Anglophone African countries, work has been
undertaken to reconcile fiscal and monetary data, and to improve the coverage and
classification in these two data sets.
Monetary statistics
8.
The main components of the central bank balance sheet are available on a daily and
weekly basis; this system provides an early warning system on key financial targets. The full
monetary survey is compiled by the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) with a lag of about six
weeks, with comprehensive coverage of commercial banks.
9.
There has been some progress in the compilation of data in line with the 2000
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The BSL, with assistance from STA, has
completed the preparation of a standardized report form (SRF) for central bank, but it has not
started regular reporting to the IMF yet. Work is ongoing in the preparation of the SRF for
other depository corporations.
10.
Reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics remains a challenge. In the past,
compilation of fiscal data solely on a cash basis, and differences in the coverage of the
central government explained most of the discrepancies between both datasets. In 2007, a TA
mission found limited progress on previous recommendations on the fiscal reporting system
for extra budgetary agencies and projects. The coverage of reporting agencies had improved,
but there were many obvious errors and omissions in the reported data and in the BSL

11
database. In June 2008, the authorities notified the IMF, however, that the fiscal data have
been reconciled with the expanded BSL monetary data.
Balance of payments
11.
The BSL is responsible for the compilation of balance of payments (BOP) statistics.
The BSL obtains source data from the SSL, government ministries, the Customs and Excise
Department (Customs), and the “Financial Survey of Major Limited Companies,” for data on
foreign direct investment. Imports and exports of goods estimates are based on data compiled
by Customs and are adjusted for coverage, valuation, and timing to accord with BOP
definitions. The BSL does not make adjustments to BOP data using supplementary
information to take account of unreported data.
12.
External transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in the informal
sector, principally the smuggling of diamonds. A considerable portion of imports is financed
by these unrecorded exports. As a result, official BOP statistics tend to substantially
understate transactions. The staff has been addressing this problem through the use of thirdcountry (principally EU member) import data. STA has been providing technical assistance
on BOP issues under the GDDS project to help the authorities with the implementation of the
Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5).
13.
Outstanding data problems also exist for trade in services, income statistics, current
transfers, and in the capital and financial accounts. Regarding the latter, there are substantial
difficulties in tracking financial transactions of the public and private sectors that are routed
through commercial banks. While the authorities are producing data on international
investment position, improvements are required in coverage and in valuation adjustments.
These difficulties are manifested in reconciling flow data in the BOP and stocks in the
international investment position. Estimates of smuggled imports and exports, in particular
diamonds, are also not available.
14.
Against this background, information on official grant and loan receipts is relatively
good and is prepared by AFR on the basis of contact with the authorities and donor agencies.
In contrast, data on private capital flows are very poor. Some information on private banking
flows can be derived from the monetary survey. Other private capital flows, especially those
linked to the informal diamond trade, are implicitly included in “errors and omissions.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 12, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Sierra Leone
On December 22, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone. 1
Background
Sierra Leone’s macroeconomic performance in 2008 was mixed. Output growth reached
6.4 percent in 2007, led by solid agricultural and mining production and buoyant activity in the
construction and services sectors. Available information points to continued robust economic
activity in 2008, despite the impact of the global downturn and a drop in mining production.
Inflation reverted to double digits in 2007 and has gone up significantly in 2008, rising to
17 percent (year-on-year) by September, mostly due to the global food and fuel crisis.
The primary fiscal deficit (including grants) was reduced to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 from
3.1 percent in 2006 as the government implemented a cash-budget management in the face of
a significant decline in domestic revenue mobilization. For 2008, the deficit is expected to reach
2.8 percent of GDP to accommodate the impact of the food and fuel crisis on the budget.
Reserve money growth exceeded the targets in 2007 (26 percent against 15.6 percent) and 2008
(end-September) due to unexpectedly high bank reserves caused mainly by the establishment of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
new foreign banks. Credit to the private sector grew rapidly in 2007 and 2008 as commercial banks
continued to increase lending in support of buoyant activity in the construction and service sectors.

The external current account deficit (including official transfers) increased slightly in 2007
(3.8 percent of GDP versus 3.5 percent in 2006) following a slight deterioration in the terms of
trade. The foreign reserve position of the Bank of Sierra Leone has remained relatively strong.
The nominal effective exchange rate depreciated enough over the last two years to offset the rise in
inflation, keeping the real effective exchange rate (REER) fairly stable. However, with the
acceleration of inflation in 2008 outpacing the depreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate,
the REER started to appreciate somewhat.
The authorities have made significant progress in implementing structural reforms in key areas.
In particular, they have adopted: (i) a modernization plan of the National Revenue Authority,
which is being actively implemented; (ii) a comprehensive strategy and action plan for the
reform of the financial sector; and (iii) a new anti–corruption strategy and action plan for 2008–
13 in the context of a revamped Anti-Corruption Act. In addition, preparations are well advanced
for the introduction of a value added tax (called the Goods and Services Tax—GST) during the
first half of 2009.
Growth prospects over the medium term remain encouraging with the expansion of available
land for agriculture and intensification of extension services, and improved supply of electricity
with the expected completion in early 2009 of a major hydroelectric project. The projected
growth will, nevertheless, not be sufficient to make a significant dent in poverty reduction.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Sierra Leonean authorities for further consolidating peace
with a smooth political transition in 2007, creating an environment conducive to reforms.
Directors welcomed that economic growth has continued to be robust, but noted that inflation
remains in double digits, pushed up until recently by the surges in global food and fuel prices.
Directors considered the real effective exchange rate of the leone to be broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. They stressed, however, that Sierra Leone’s wide inflation differential
with its major trading partners and the likely persistence of current account deficits over the
medium term call for a more flexible exchange rate policy to facilitate adjustment to exogenous
shocks.
Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt better-targeted and more sustainable measures in
their response to the food and fuel crisis. They welcomed the recent decision to allow full passthrough of world oil prices to domestic pump prices, which will facilitate domestic adjustment
and free up fiscal resources for other urgent spending needs.
Noting that Sierra Leone has one of the lowest domestic revenue-to-GDP ratios among subSaharan African countries, Directors considered that enhancing domestic revenue mobilization
should continue to be a high priority in order to strengthen the fiscal position and create space

3
for poverty-reducing and infrastructure spending. They commended the authorities for the
progress made in modernizing the National Revenue Authority, and encouraged them to
introduce the Goods and Services Tax in the first half of 2009, as planned. Directors noted the
authorities’ efforts to improve the contribution of the mining sector to domestic revenue, and
stressed the need to make the ongoing review of mining rights more transparent.
Executive Directors observed that improved public expenditure management will be essential to
ensure budget credibility and make public spending more effective. They encouraged the
authorities to address weaknesses in budget procedures and execution, and to ensure greater
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ renewed commitment to accelerating structural
reforms to promote private sector activity, improve external competitiveness, and strengthen the
economy’s resilience to external shocks. In light of the current global financial crisis, they called
for timely implementation of the reform of the financial sector, notably steps to strengthen bank
supervision and enable the Bank of Sierra Leone to detect vulnerabilities at an early stage.
Directors called for accelerating the reform of the National Power Authority to put it on a sound
financial footing.
Noting that Sierra Leone is at a moderate risk of debt distress, Executive Directors encouraged
the authorities to maintain prudent borrowing policies and rely on grants and highly
concessional loans.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 22, 2008

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review under PRGF Arrangement for
Sierra Leone, Increases Financial Assistance to Mitigate Food and Fuel Price Impact,
and Approves US$10.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Sierra Leone's performance under a four-year arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Board also approved an SDR 10.4 million
(about US$16.1 million) augmentation to help strengthen Sierra Leone’s foreign reserve
position to cope with the external shocks from world food and fuel price increases and the
unfolding global financial crisis. The completion of the review enables the disbursement of
SDR 7.0 million (about US$10.8 million), which would bring total disbursements under the
arrangement to SDR 20.51 million (about US$31.7 million), including a portion of the
augmented amount.
The Executive Board also granted waivers for the non-observance of two performance
criteria related to domestic government revenue and the primary fiscal balance, on the basis
of remedial actions taken. The Board also completed the country's financing assurances
review under the arrangement.
The three-year PRGF arrangement for Sierra Leone was originally approved by the
Executive Board on May 10, 2006 (see Press Release No 06/94) in an amount equivalent to
SDR 31.11 million (about US$48.1 million). The period of the arrangement was extended to
four years to 2010 on July 7, 2008 (see Press Release No 08/166). With the Board’s approval
of the augmentation today, the total amount of the arrangement will be equivalent to SDR
41.51 million (about US$64.1 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
“Economic growth continued to be robust and broad-based in 2008, but downside risks have
increased with the global economic downturn. Sierra Leone’s output growth has exceeded
the average of sub-Saharan African countries for the past five years, and the external reserve

2
position has been relatively strong. However, the country’s social indicators lag well behind
those of other fragile states, and inflation remained in double digits in 2008 against the
backdrop of global food and fuel price increases.
“The main challenges for Sierra Leone in the medium term include making macroeconomic
policies more effective, promoting private sector-led growth to make progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals, and maintaining external stability and competitiveness.
“Fiscal policy in 2009 will aim at enhancing domestic revenue mobilization and addressing
weaknesses in budget procedures and execution. The authorities need to remain steadfast in
the implementation of the modernization plan of the National Revenue Authority and the
introduction of the Goods and Services Tax, planned for the first half of 2009. Budget
discipline will be key to avoid expenditure overruns and extrabudgetary spending.
“Bringing inflation back to single digits is the main objective of monetary policy for 2009.
The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) will need to apply the appropriate mix of treasury bill and
foreign exchange sales to help sterilize liquidity injections from budgetary support and the
use of resources freed under the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI). Greater
nominal exchange rate flexibility would facilitate achieving the monetary targets and
responding to external shocks.
“Structural reforms need to be accelerated. Not least in light of the global financial crisis, it is
important that the BSL strengthen its supervisory capacity and monitor developments closely
to detect early signs of financial sector vulnerabilities. Improving the financial viability of
public utilities, particularly the National Power Authority, and promoting good governance
will be critical to promoting a high level of economic growth,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Sierra Leone
December 22, 2008
Introduction
1.
My Sierra Leonean authorities are committed to further consolidation of the post
conflict reconstruction, macroeconomic stability and growth tempo, as well as public
accountability and structural reforms, despite the challenging external environment.
Building on the broad-based economic growth that averaged 7.5 percent annually during
the last five years, they are determined to maintain strong growth in the near to mediumterm. The authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and support of the Fund, the
World Bank and the donor community, and thank staff for their candid policy dialogue
and advice under the program. The support and dialogue have been invaluable to the
authorities’ efforts to raise and sustain growth and reduce poverty.
2.
Since the completion of the second review in July 2008, Sierra Leone has made
progress in consolidating peace and macroeconomic stability. As a result, implementation
of the PRGF-supported economic program has been strengthened. To this end, most of
the end-June 2008 performance criteria were met, except for two quantitative
performance criteria on domestic revenue and primary fiscal balance that were missed
mainly due to technicalities and the impact of the high global prices of fuel. Progress in
the implementation of the reform agenda was attained. In view of the good economic
performance and the continued commitment to reforms under the program, the authorities
request Directors’ support for the associated waivers and the completion of the third
review under the PRGF arrangement, modification of a performance criterion for endDecember 2008, and augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement.
Economic developments and program performance
3.
The recent robust economic performance has been broad-based, sustaining the
country’s reconstruction and growth effort. Real GDP growth was estimated at 6.7
percent in 2007 and this growth momentum is projected to be sustained for the current
year, reflecting strong performance in the agriculture, mining, service and construction
sectors. Prospects for continued strong growth in 2009 are positive as these sectors
experience further expansion. Inflation, however, has edged up further largely because of
the lagged impact of the surge in global food and fuel prices. The authorities recognize
the enormous challenges and inflationary implications of the protracted increases in the
prices of oil and food. Nonetheless, they are of the view that the measures taken to ease
food shortages, as well as the commitment to prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
together with the recent easing of global fuel and food prices, inflationary pressures
would ease in the coming months. The nominal exchange rate of the leone against the US
dollar has remained quite stable and its value has continued to be in line with

2
fundamentals. Foreign reserve accumulation has proceeded well, standing at US$ 212
million (4.6 months import cover).
4.
The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) has further strengthened its monetary policy
framework in line with the recently adopted financial sector development strategy. As a
result, reserve money growth has decelerated to less than program targets during the first
half of 2008. Likewise, net bank credit expansion to the government was contained, thus
meeting the program performance criterion. Strong growth in credit expansion to the
private sector was sustained. The authorities are concerned about the rise in nonperforming loans (NPLs) and, in response, they are putting in place measures to improve
credit quality.
5.
The shortfall in domestic revenue continued to constrain significant improvement
in the fiscal position. The revenue shortfall of 0.1 percent of GDP was mainly due to the
decision to suspend the vehicle licence fee pending improvement in the vehicle
registration process. The cash budget management system helped the authorities to meet
all quantitative performance criteria (PCs) and the related indicative targets. However,
cost overruns due to fuel costs for power generation, transfers for heath sector, and
government staff movements led to higher expenditure levels that also contributed to a
higher than targeted primary fiscal deficit. Consequently, the primary fiscal deficit
exceeded program target by 0.4 percent of GDP.
6.
Despite capacity constraints, the authorities have made significant progress in
implementing structural reforms in a number of key areas with a view to raising
economic growth and improving public service delivery. On the revenue front, the three
year modernisation plan for the National Revenue Authority (NRA) is being
implemented. The audit of domestic arrears for 2005-07 has been completed, and arrears
are being cleared in a manner consistent with the agreed macroeconomic framework for
2008 and 2009. The BSL finalized in June 2008 a comprehensive strategy and action plan
for the reform of the financial sector.
Policies for 2009 and the medium term
7.
The authorities remain committed to maintaining a stable macroeconomic
environment, creating conditions for sustained broad-based economic growth, and
persevere with the structural reform agenda. Efforts to create employment opportunities
through significant public investment in infrastructure and reforms to the business
environment remain priorities. Notwithstanding the recorded strong macroeconomic
performance, the authorities concur with staff assessment that the country faces a number
of challenges going forward.

3
Fiscal policy
8.
The authorities will continue to pursue prudent fiscal policies in the medium term,
aimed at limiting debt-creating domestic financing while providing fiscal space for
increased investments in infrastructure and key MDG clusters. The main elements of the
authorities’ fiscal program include renewed efforts to enhance revenue collection,
increase public investment in infrastructure while continuing with efforts to reduce
domestic arrears.
9.
The authorities are confident, and staff concur, that domestic revenue
mobilization effort would improve if current efforts are sustained, aiming for revenue rise
from 11.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to 13.6 percent of GDP by 2011. This is largely on
account of broadening the tax base and improving customs administration, strengthening
fiscal controls, reducing discretionary tax exemptions, reviewing the existing mining
contracts, and enforcing the tax code and code of conduct for all NRA staff. The
authorities will continue implementing the three-year modernisation program for the
NRA that will enable it to strengthen the large taxpayer’s office, modernize the customs
administration, and finalize preparation for the introduction of the Goods and Services
Tax (GST) in early 2009. Other targets are to improve field audits, enforce tax payment,
collect tax arrears, and step up anti-smuggling activities. The authorities intend to
stabilize current expenditure at about 15 percent of GDP, while increasing the poverty
related expenditure from the 3 percent spent in 2007 of GDP to 6 percent of GDP by
2010. Spending would target improving access to basic social services, particularly in
education and health, as well as improving access to public facilities like water,
electricity and roads in the rural areas.
10.
To ensure budget credibility and make public spending more effective, the
authorities have also made an unequivocal commitment to enhance the management of
public expenditure. To this end, the 2005-06 National Action Plan (NAP) for PFM is
being upgraded to take into account the findings and recommendations of the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment and the recent Fund technical
assistance mission. To improve budget execution, the authorities are also using the
integrated financial management information system (IFMIS) to strengthen expenditure
commitments and controls. The authorities concur with staff’s recommendations for
revamping the medium-term expenditure framework process to allow for strategic
planning and introduction of selected performance indicators that would ensure that the
budget allocations are consistent with the PRS objectives.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
11.
The authorities reaffirm their commitment to target base money growth for
containing inflation as an appropriate policy framework. The BSL will continue to

4
strengthen its market-based instruments, including open market operations using treasury
bills and bearer bonds and weekly foreign exchange auctions. In this regard, the BSL will
be recapitalised and provided with additional interest bearing securities. The authorities
remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime with the official rate determined via
weekly auctions to meet the reserve targets of the program.
Structural reform agenda
12.
Impressive gains have been made in implementing the structural reform agenda as
an integral part of the policy priorities. The reform agenda includes the reform of the
financial sector, strengthening of the financial viability of the power and water utilities,
privatizing state owned enterprises, and promoting public accountability. They will
further continue reforming the public procurement systems through strengthening the
operational capacity of the National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA) and enhancing
procurement transparency through quarterly procurement bulletins. In this regard, the
authorities appreciate the support from the development partners and would like to stress
that this support remains critical for the successful implementation of their reform
agenda.
13.
The BSL, drawing on the recently adopted strategy for reform of the financial
sector, will expeditiously implement the plan with Fund–Bank support for the broader
development of the financial sector, which will include the establishment of a Financial
Intelligence Unit and community banks to broaden access to financial services in the
rural areas. The BSL also intends to vigorously address the stability of the financial
sector. To that end, it plans to introduce in 2009 a risk-based banking supervision system
and a credit reference bureau.
14.
Structural reforms in the power utility will entail ensuring financial viability
through the strengthening of management and a comprehensive electricity tariff policy
that covers the generation, distribution and maintenance costs. The authorities envisage
that such a policy would be formulated through close examination of the tariff and
sector’s quarterly reports. With respect to the water utility the authorities are also
committed to undertake a tariff review, improve billing and collection, as well as
promulgate legislation that prevents unauthorized connections.
15.
As part of the commitment to promote public accountability, in June, the Cabinet
launched the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (ACS) and Action Plan for 2008-2013.
The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has been significantly strengthened by enacting
a revised Anti-Corruption Act (ACA) that gives the ACC investigative and prosecutorial
powers. The legal framework regulating the mining sector will also be revised so as to
increase transparency and accountability, as well as to make the sector internationally
competitive. The government intends to establish soon a secretariat charged with the

5
responsibility of implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in
Sierra Leone.
Conclusion
16.
Despite challenging internal and external environment, the authorities have shown
their commitment to implement appropriate stabilization and structural policies. In the
near-term, the authorities are determined to focus on sustaining macroeconomic stability,
increasing domestic resource mobilization, promoting pro-poor growth, and increasing
investment in infrastructure and key MDG clusters. Their commitment to the PRGFsupported program remained unwavering and all quantitative PCs for end June 2008 were
met, except those related to domestic revenue and primary fiscal balance mainly due to
late posting of revenue receipt and the impact of high costs of fuel on power generation.
To this end, they request the associated waivers and the completion of the third review
under the PRGF arrangement, and modification of a performance criterion for endDecember 2008. In addition, the authorities request an augmentation of access under the
PRGF arrangement to deal with the shocks associated with food and oil prices while
appropriate policies are being designed and implemented.
17.
The authorities are confident that going forward, continued engagement with the
Fund and the support of the development partners – both financial and policy advice –
will enable them achieve their development goals and provide a sound basis for realising
some of the critical MDGs.
