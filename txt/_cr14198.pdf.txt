STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
WITH MEMBER COUNTRIES

KEY ISSUES
Context. Real output has expanded for four consecutive quarters, and financial market
sentiment has improved markedly. But the recovery is weak and uneven. Inflation has
been too low for too long, financial markets are still fragmented, and structural gaps
persist: these hinder rebalancing and substantial reductions in debt and unemployment.
Policies. The economic expansion is grounded in complementary policy actions at both
the national and euro area levels, but more is needed to strengthen the recovery:
Supporting Demand. Recent ECB actions—including a rate cut, negative deposit rates
and policy support for new bank lending to companies—should help address low
inflation and financial fragmentation. But if inflation remains too low the ECB should
consider a substantial balance sheet expansion, including through asset purchases. The
broadly neutral overall fiscal stance is appropriate but any negative growth surprises
should not trigger additional consolidation efforts as this would be self-defeating.
Mending balance sheets and completing the banking union. Successfully executing the
ongoing asset quality review and stress tests should spur balance sheet repair and help
reverse fragmentation. Agreement on a single resolution mechanism and bail-in rules
comprise important milestones towards banking union, but a common fiscal backstop is
still needed.
Advancing structural reforms. Alternative sources of funding through securitization,
especially to credit-constrained SME’s, should be promoted. A comprehensive strategy,
which boosts demand and removes country-specific structural impediments, is needed
to tackle high youth unemployment. Competitiveness-enhancing reforms in debtor
countries and higher public investment in creditor countries would promote needed
rebalancing.

EURO AREA POLICIES

CONTEXT: FROM CRISIS TO RECOVERY
1.
The euro area recovery is taking hold (Figure 1). Real activity has expanded for four
consecutive quarters. An incipient revival in domestic demand, owing partly to reduced fiscal drag, is
adding to the impetus from net exports.

2.
Financial market sentiment has improved dramatically (Figure 2). Sovereign and
corporate yields have fallen markedly, benefiting from increasing foreign demand. This has
narrowed sovereign spreads between stressed and core economies, and supported corporate bond
issuance and equity markets across the region. Bank funding costs have also declined, helping banks
to raise capital and deleverage their balance sheets.
3.
Strong policy actions have boosted investor confidence and laid the foundations for
recovery. At the national level, governments have made further progress repairing sovereign and
bank balance sheets and implementing structural reforms to restore competitiveness. At the areawide level, the ECB has taken a wide range of measures to support demand and address
fragmentation. The Comprehensive Assessment of systemically important banks is on track to be
completed in October 2014 before the ECB assumes supervisory responsibilities in November 2014.
Further progress on building a banking union—such as the agreements on a Single Resolution
Mechanism (SRM), backed by a Single Resolution Fund (SRF), the Bank Recovery and Resolution
Directive (BRRD), and the deposit insurance harmonization directive—has demonstrated the
collective commitment to EMU.
4.
But the appetite for further integration has diminished. The euro-skeptic outcome of the
European elections may pose risks to the single market (particularly the free flow of labor) and test
the credibility of the nascent fiscal governance framework. With the economic recovery taking hold
and financial markets rallying, additional progress on reforms may be prone to reform fatigue—both
at the national and euro area level.

5.

And lingering damage from the crisis has manifested itself in several ways.



Real activity and investment in the euro area have yet to reach pre-crisis levels. In the first quarter
of 2014, euro area growth was weaker than expected and unevenly distributed across countries.
Investment continues to be constrained by limited access to credit in stressed countries (Box 1).



Financial markets are still fragmented. Private borrowing costs remain too high in stressed
economies. The flow of credit to the private sector in stressed economies is contracting at a
faster rate than for the euro area as a whole, with SMEs in particular subject to credit rationing.
Moreover, cross-border banking flows continue to shrink, suggesting that liquidity provision is
becoming splintered along national lines.



Inflation remains worryingly low. Both headline and underlying inflation rates are fluctuating
below 1 percent—away from the ECB’s price stability objective of close to (but below) 2 percent
for headline inflation (Figure 3). They remain low even in the core. Energy and food price
developments, euro appreciation, and structural reforms have contributed to disinflationary
pressures but cannot fully explain them. The still-sizeable output gap continues to pull down
inflation. Although long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, short- and medium-term
expectations have been drifting down.



Unemployment and debt are still stubbornly high. The average unemployment rate for the euro
area remains at 12 percent, although it is much higher in economies under stress. Youth
unemployment is even more elevated, averaging 24 percent across the region, but with
unprecedented highs in stressed economies (e.g., over 50 percent in Greece). Private and public
debt levels remain elevated in many countries (Figure 4).

6.
For the euro area as a whole, the external position is assessed to be broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals and desired policies (Figure 5). But this masks the asymmetry
of past adjustments and some continued imbalances, viz. an undervaluation in some creditor
economies and overvaluation in most debtor economies (see 2014 External Sector Report). In
debtor countries, relative price adjustments have been proceeding gradually. While these efforts
have contributed to a rebound in exports, slumping internal demand has accounted for much of the
reduction in current account deficits in these economies. This has not been matched by stronger
demand and lower external surpluses in the core. Hence, the current account surplus of the euro

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

EURO AREA POLICIES

area as a whole has grown further, putting upward pressure on the euro. Staff analysis indicates that
further adjustments in relative prices are still needed for some countries to regain competitiveness.
Such adjustments will be increasingly difficult to achieve, given nominal rigidities in these countries
and low inflation in trading partners. A fall in the surpluses of creditor countries would allow debtor
country surpluses to increase further without pressure for euro appreciation. In addition, although
the euro is broadly in equilibrium in real terms, a weaker nominal exchange rate (and higher
inflation) would help support the recovery by improving cyclical conditions.
Box 1. Investment in the Euro Area: Why has it been Weak? 1/
Investment has been hit hard since the onset of the crisis. It
remains below its pre-crisis level, particularly in stressed countries
and it has been weaker than in most previous recessions and
financial crises
Staff analysis shows that output changes can explain broad
trends in investment in the euro area and selected individual
countries. But, in most cases and with the exception of Spain, a
model controlling for output changes only does not fully account
for the decline in real non-residential private investment after the
European sovereign debt crisis.
The elevated cost of capital, greater financial constraints, high
corporate leverage, and uncertainty have also weighed on
investment across the euro area. The relative importance of
different factors varies across countries. The real cost of capital is
2
important in explaining investment in many cases. In addition,
financial constraints (from the EC consumer and business survey)
have limited investment, particularly in stressed countries. High
corporate sector leverage and uncertainty are additional
impediments to investment in Italy, Spain, and to a lesser extent in Portugal and France.
Output changes and country specific impediments explain the weak investment performance well. While
output dynamics play a dominant role in determining investment, the real cost of capital, credit rationing (proxied
by a financial constraints variable), high corporate indebtedness, and uncertainty are additional factors pulling
down investment across the euro area, particularly after the European sovereign debt crisis. For example, while
investment in cumulative terms (since 2010Q2) has been below the levels that would have been predicted by
controlling only for output changes (about 3 to 6 percent of GDP), once the other factors are controlled for the
“missing” investment declines to about ½ to 2 percent of GDP.
Investment is expected to pick up as the recovery strengthens and uncertainty declines. However, a
sustained recovery in investment will require dealing with the corporate debt overhang and financial
fragmentation. Corporate debt-to-equity remains elevated in some stressed countries, and the deleveraging
process is still at an early stage. At the same time, borrowing costs need to be substantially lower particularly for
smaller firms.

The real cost of capital is calculated as a weighted average of financing costs of bank loans, corporate bonds, and
equities, adjusted for inflation and depreciation. In stressed economies it is currently higher than its historical
average, while for Germany it is lower. See the accompanying Selected Issues Paper for further details.

OUTLOOK: A LONG ROAD TO FULL RECOVERY
7.
Despite recent improvements in financial markets and economic prospects, the
obstacles to strong, sustained growth remain substantial.


Insufficient aggregate demand is weighing on real activity and pulling down inflation across the
euro area, as corporates, households and banks all attempt to repair their balance sheets.
Despite the reduced drag from fiscal policy, contracting credit and high borrowing costs are
constraining investment in countries with large output gaps, large debt burdens, and high
unemployment.



Impaired balance sheets continue to inhibit monetary transmission and the flow of credit,
particularly to SMEs. Weakness in banks’ balance sheets and uncertainty about their quality are
contributing to fragmentation, constraining the ability and willingness of banks to support credit
and investment. Corporate and household debt overhangs in some countries are further
reinforcing fragmentation along national borders.



Remaining structural gaps in capital, labor, and product markets present hurdles to financing
investment, deploying resources from non-tradable to tradable sectors, adjusting relative prices,
raising productivity, and creating jobs.

8.
Against this backdrop, the outlook is for a modest recovery and subdued inflation
(Table 1).


Growth is projected at a little over 1 percent this year and 1½ percent next year. This is
predicated on a further pick-up in domestic demand, owing to limited fiscal drag, better lending
conditions, and resilient external demand. In the medium run, the euro area economy is
expected to expand at a moderate pace (1½ percent), reflecting the many constraints to growth
bequeathed by the crisis. Thus, the output gap is not expected to close until 2019.



Inflation is expected to remain below the ECB’s primary price objective for a protracted period.
Persistent output gaps, weak credit conditions, and an impaired monetary transmission
mechanism—especially in stressed economies—will combine to contain prices. Annual inflation
in the euro area is forecast at 0.7 percent this year, before picking up to 1.2 percent in 2015.



The current account surplus of about 2¼ percent of GDP is forecast to persist, with the pick-up
in domestic economic activity balanced by sustained external demand from major trading
partners (e.g., the US and China).

9.
Risks are still tilted to the downside (Table 2). With limited policy space in the near term,
further negative shocks—either domestic or external —could sour financial market sentiment, halt
the recovery, and push the economy into lower inflation and even deflation (see Risk Assessment
Matrix). Bond market stresses could re-emerge if the AQR or stress tests uncovered unexpectedly
large capital shortfalls in the absence of a common fiscal backstop. External risks could stem from a
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

EURO AREA POLICIES

slowdown in emerging market growth, escalation of geopolitical conflict, and an abrupt exit from
unconventional monetary policies in the United States (see Spillover Report). Over the medium term,
there is a high risk of stagnation, which could stem from persistently depressed domestic demand
due to deleveraging, insufficient policy action, and stalled structural reforms. More positively,
improved confidence could raise growth above forecast levels. For example, greater political and
policy certainty could boost investment sentiment and create a virtuous cycle.
10.
A protracted stagnation could have significant spillovers on neighboring European
countries through trade and financial channels. Staff analysis suggests a 1 percentage point
slowdown in the euro area could reduce growth in emerging European countries by an estimated
½-¾ percentage points. Low inflation is already affecting countries in the region, especially those
that peg their currencies to the euro, with core inflation in some of these countries in negative
territory. In this context, further unconventional monetary easing in the euro area would generate
positive spillovers for trade partners by supporting domestic growth and inflation, outweighing
potentially adverse effects on balance sheets (due to possible currency depreciation).

THE POLICY AGENDA: STRENGTHENING THE
RECOVERY
11.
To strengthen the recovery, policy efforts should focus on three priority areas: (1)
support demand (to reduce spare capacity and combat low inflation/deflation risks); (2) repair
balance sheets and completing the banking union (to tackle fragmentation, revive credit supply, and
ensure financial stability); and (3) advance structural reforms (to boost investment, employment,
productivity, and foster rebalancing). Such policies would help mitigate risks to the recovery and
reduce spillovers from low growth and low inflation to the rest of the world (see Spillover Report).
Providing more demand support to tackle low inflation and strengthen the recovery
12.
Further monetary policy easing would counteract the dangers posed by an extended
period of low inflation. Several considerations point in the same direction:


Damage from “lowflation”: By keeping real interest rates and real debt burdens elevated, very
low inflation stifles demand. Given significant downward nominal rigidities in debtor economies
and low inflation in creditor economies, it also makes difficult the adjustment in relative prices
and real wages that must occur for sustainable growth to take hold.



Deflation risk: Negative external shocks and/or further euro appreciation could easily push
inflation into negative territory.



Undershooting target: A persistent failure to meet the inflation target could undermine central
bank credibility and de-anchor inflation expectations. Staff analysis suggests that even a small

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

and temporary decline in inflation expectations could have sizeable output effects (see Spillover
Report).


Expectations: Past deflationary episodes illustrate that long-term expectations tend to adjust too
little and too late to provide a useful signal for monetary policy (Figure 6). In this context, the
recent downward movement in short- and medium-rum inflation expectations could be
worrisome.



Shrinking balance sheet: The contraction of its balance sheet (in the context of LTRO repayments)
has made it increasingly difficult for the ECB to credibly communicate that monetary conditions
will be kept sufficiently accommodative, particularly when conventional policy space is almost
exhausted. This puts upward pressure on the euro, pulling inflation down further.

13.
Most recently, the ECB announced a wide range of actions. Fully in line with past staff
recommendations,2 these measures will help tackle low inflation and address fragmentation.
Collectively, they should lead to a substantial expansion of liquidity.


The reductions in policy interest rates (by 10 basis points for each the MRO and deposit rates,
taking the latter to negative territory, and by 35 basis points for the MLF) will provide a credible
signal of the ECB’s accommodative stance, and will limit the level and volatility of money market
rates. The broad application of the negative deposit rate will ensure that banks do not arbitrage
their deposit holdings across other facilities.



The targeted credit easing (TLTROs) will support term funding and ensure credit provision. The
substantial tenor and successive operations of the TLTROs are likely to attract a wide range of
banks, thereby helping to address both fragmentation and low inflation. While the initial TLTRO
allocation may offset some of the repayment of the previous 3-year LTRO coming due, the new
TLTRO offers significant incentives for banks to use the facility. Nevertheless, the ECB has only
indirect control over the expansion of its balance sheet, as take up depends on banks’ demand.



The extension of fixed rate full allotment will strengthen the ECB’s forward guidance and ensure
the continued availability of liquidity.



The suspension of sterilization of the SMP holdings is warranted given low inflation and new
measures to boost liquidity.It will help ease money market pressures by freeing up around €165
billion (current SMP holdings).



The extension of existing collateral eligibility will enhance access to liquidity facilities for stressed
banks.



The preparatory work related to outright purchases of ABS is being intensified. If and when
implemented, direct ABS purchases would circumvent the banking system, helping to address
fragmentation and providing the ECB direct control over the expansion of its balance sheet.
However, the ABS market is small, limiting its effectiveness to address low inflation.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

14.
Also reassuring is that if inflation remains too low, the ECB has expressed willingness
to do more. In staff’s view, this should involve a substantial balance sheet expansion, including
through asset purchases.


The deepest potential market for asset purchases—and therefore likely the most effective in
significantly expanding the ECB’s balance sheet—is the sovereign bond market. Buying
sovereign assets, in proportion to ECB capital key, would reduce government bond yields,
induce higher equity and corporate bond values, and ultimately raise demand and inflation
expectations across the euro area. Such purchases can work even in a bank-centric system.
Higher asset prices caused by ECB purchases would strengthen bank balance sheets and hence
their capacity to lend, while stronger corporate balance sheets (from higher equity and bond
values) would increase banks’ willingness to lend to them.



Private asset purchases may be preferable on many counts, but the volume of eligible
securities appears small and yields on assets like covered bonds have already compressed
sharply. Buying private assets would also entail very uneven help across the area and favor the
banks that hold more marketable assets. Nonetheless, the ECB could allocate a portion of its
interventions to these markets. A mix of purchases from highly rated private bond markets
(including NFCs and securitized assets) would complement interventions in sovereign markets,
directly transmitting lower interest rates to the real economy through the credit channel.



A large-scale, non-targeted LTRO on a long-term, fixed-rate basis could also deliver a sizeable
expansion of the ECB balance sheet and send a credible signal of the ECB’s accommodative
stance. Its impact would be especially powerful if the establishment of the SSM facilitates the
cross-border flow of liquidity within and between banks.



By signaling the ECB’s commitment to its price stability objective, the above measures would
likely have an important impact through expectations. They may also counter appreciation
pressure on the euro, pushing up flagging inflation.

15.
The broadly neutral (area-wide) fiscal stance this year strikes a balance at the current
juncture (Table 3 and Figure 7). On the one hand, persistently high debt ratios continue to cast a
shadow over the medium term, and risks to fiscal forecasts remain significant. On the other hand,
the still-large output gap would argue for fiscal support. Against this background, the fiscal
response has to remain flexible. Large negative growth surprises should not trigger additional
consolidation efforts. Moreover, if deflation risks materialize and monetary policy options are
depleted, the escape clauses in the fiscal framework may need to be used to respond in these
circumstances.
16.
While significant progress has been made to strengthen the fiscal governance
framework in recent years, critical gaps remain. Successive reforms of the SGP have had many
positive elements, including stronger economic underpinnings for the rules; a tighter link between
fiscal targets and the debt objective; better enforcement; and greater flexibility and specificity.
Nonetheless, these reforms have made the system increasingly complicated, creating risks of overlap
and inconsistency between rules, as well as difficulties of public communication (Box 2). Staff
advised examining the complexity of the framework over the medium term, and looking into the
possibility of reducing the number of rules (e.g., by consolidating the preventive and corrective arms
of the SGP and possibly focusing on some measure of the structural balance as the single
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

EURO AREA POLICIES

operational target). Another area is to enhance the credibility of the rules and foster compliance
(e.g., by introducing administrative sanctions, accelerating procedures in predefined cases, and
continuing to strengthen national fiscal frameworks).

Box 2. The Stability and Growth Pact—Design and Implementation Issues1/
The implementation of the fiscal governance
framework has revealed gaps in the design of
rules and enforcement mechanisms:
The rules of the system have become
exceedingly complex. Successive legislative
changes have added new constraints and
procedures, creating possible inconsistencies
and redundancies. Individual rules have also
become more sophisticated, in particular those
specified in cyclically-adjusted terms.



The structural budget balance is
undermined by large measurement errors. The
structural balance indicator is now at the center
of the fiscal surveillance system both in the
preventive and the corrective arms. However,
its calculation relies on output gap estimates,
which are generally underestimated in real
time, making the structural balance prone to significant downward revisions (on the order of 0.5 percent of
potential GDP per year).



The SGP may reduce incentives to foster long-term growth. Two issues feature prominently in current
discussions. The first is that the SGP may limit the space to finance structural reforms that entail sizeable shortterm budgetary costs. Although the 2005 reform explicitly recognized that these costs should be accommodated,
the present framework has so far only been applied to some types of pension reforms. Going beyond pension
reforms is proving contentious. A second question is whether the MTO and, to a lesser extent, the 3 percent deficit
cap, discourages public investment by limiting the capacity to borrow to fund projects that increase long-term
growth potential.



Enforcement mechanisms may need to be strengthened further. Sanctions and corrective actions are mild
compared to existing federations. In addition, the unique EU governance structure undermines the incentives for
strict implementation (the Council has the final word on monitoring decisions, while the EC only makes
recommendations), although recent changes to voting procedures may have partially mitigated this problem.
Finally, supranational controls are not sufficient to ensure fiscal discipline at the national level, as credible
enforcement has also to take place at the level where fiscal sovereignty is exerted.

Mending balance sheets and completing the banking union to reduce fragmentation and
revive credit
17.
The ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment of bank balance sheets is well underway, with
results expected to be announced in October 2014. Importantly, the asset quality review (AQR)
establishes consistent definitions of capital and NPLs across national jurisdictions, and incorporates
independent third party involvement in valuing bank assets, thereby ensuring cross-comparability of
asset quality and providing transparency to the market.

18.
In general, the exercise is proceeding well (Figure 8). Capital hurdle rates are
appropriately set higher than the regulatory minimum under Basel III: an 8 percent Common Equity
Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is required under the baseline and 5.5 percent under the stress scenario. However,
the treatment of sovereign risk might be perceived as too lenient by markets.3 Staff recommended
development of an effective and clear communications strategy for the test results—particularly in
light of some national discretion over the treatment of sovereign holdings, the lack of an adverse
scenario incorporating a complete assessment of deflation risks, and the heterogeneity in stress test
parameters across national and EU-wide variants. Staff welcomed independent third-party
involvement in the AQR, but urged that efforts be made to ensure uniformity in the level of such
involvement across countries.
19.
Banks falling below the required capital ratios will be expected to remedy the shortfall
speedily. Banks falling below the AQR requirement will have 6 months to fill the gap, while banks
falling below the stress test requirement in the adverse scenario will have 9 months. Moreover,
banks will be asked to present a formal plan describing their recapitalization strategy to
3

Sovereign holdings in the trading book and available-for-sale (AfS) portfolios are to be marked to market. National
supervisors may allow the use of prudential filters for unrealized losses in sovereign AfS holdings, while hold-tomaturity (HtM) holdings will only be subject to changes in risk weights arising from banks’ internal models (and
remain zero-rated under the standardized approach).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

EURO AREA POLICIES

supervisors—for their approval—within two weeks of the results being announced. Staff welcomed
the simplicity and clarity of this approach, but raised two issues:


Timetable: Staff supported the ambitious recapitalization timetable. As noted earlier, many banks
have been raising capital well in advance of the publication of the AQR and stress test results.
This reduces the chances that they will need to raise capital after the exercise. However, if capital
needs are high and the market environment unfavorable, it is reassuring that the framework has
some flexibility to respond to such circumstances. But the authorities should continue to
encourage banks potentially in need of capital to act pro-actively, taking advantage of current
favorable market conditions.



Bail-ins: If a bank proves unable to raise its minimum capital ratio to the desired level, the
conversion of subordinated debt to capital must be applied before recourse to public support
under EU state aid rules. Staff urged careful consideration of financial stability concerns when
applying any capital conversion or bail-in provisions: if necessary, the systemic risk exception or
proportionality principle should be invoked to mitigate risks.

20.
The credibility of the exercise would be markedly enhanced by a common fiscal
backstop, which would help sever sovereign-bank links. In particular, direct recapitalization of
banks from the ESM should be an option in case private capital is insufficient. There has been recent
political progress in making operational ESM direct recap. But the timetable remains uncertain and
the proposed threshold to access the mechanism is very high: direct recap must be preceded by
bail-ins of at least 8 percent of eligible bank liabilities (in line with the BRRD); and the country’s fiscal
position must rule out the possibility of indirect recapitalization (via the sovereign) from the ESM.
21.
There has been substantial
progress toward a banking union
along three dimensions: bank
regulation, supervision, and
resolution. However, the design will not
fully sever bank-sovereign links in the
foreseeable future, possibly delaying
financial reintegration.


14

Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM):
The SSM is on-track to become fully
operational in November 2014. The transition to a single supervisor should increase the
fungibility of liquidity within cross-border banking groups in the euro area, thereby reducing
financial fragmentation. Joint supervisory teams are being created to oversee individual banks,
with staff drawn mainly from national central banks and regulatory authorities, but also the ECB.
Staff stressed the need to guard against implementation risks, including the treatment of homehost supervisory coordination and—for banks with relevant activities outside the euro area—the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

importance of reciprocal macro-prudential policies through supervisory colleges, as discussed in
the 2013 FSAP.


Single Resolution Mechanism and Fund (SRM/SRF): Compared with earlier plans, the final
agreement specifies a more streamlined decision-making process with faster mutualization.
However, the SRM decision-making procedure remains cumbersome, the SRF transition period
too long (8 years), and its financial capacity limited given the concentration and size of large
financial institutions. This raises questions about the ability of the framework to deliver leastcost, effective, and timely resolution in a systemic banking crisis. The possibility of a credit line
with the ESM will help, but such concerns could be more directly mitigated by making direct
bank recapitalization via the ESM less stringent.



Backstop: There remains a need for a common fiscal backstop that could be deployed quickly in
the event of a systemic crisis, when industry-based funds and purely national deposit insurance
schemes may be insufficient. By supporting confidence in the banking sector, the availability of
such a backstop could reduce the likelihood it would be used. Moreover, potential support
measures for systemically relevant non-bank activities, such as insurance and central
counterparties may need to be considered.

22.
Macro-prudential authority will be shared between the SSM and national competent
authorities (NCAs). While the SSM will take over primary supervision of the largest banks from the
NCAs, the ECB and the national central banks in the SSM area, via the Financial Stability Committee
(FSC), will assess any system-wide vulnerabilities and the scope for macro-prudential policies. Staff
urged the ECB to continue joint discussions with national authorities and the European Systemic
Risk Board (ESRB) on macro-prudential coordination under the new dispensation (as highlighted in
last year’s FSAP recommendations), especially with respect to EU banking activities outside the euro
area and policy measures related to non-banking sectors. Staff also encouraged effective
cooperation with national authorities on anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks.
23.
Working out the corporate debt overhang will play an important role in repairing
bank balance sheets and supporting investment. Although many countries have taken steps to
reform their insolvency regimes, continued progress is needed on harmonizing and strengthening
national insolvency frameworks, encompassing terminology, definitions and processes. Measures
should also be taken to: (1) facilitate out-of-court settlements; (2) reduce impediments to more
efficient debt restructuring (e.g. incentives for creditor coordination in debt restructuring, and
schemes to provide priority financing for restructured entities); (3) standardize debt restructuring
contracts for SMEs; (4) strengthen liquidation procedures to enable rapid exit of non-viable firms;
and (5) introduce guidance on tax incentives and debt resolution procedures in line with
international best practice.

Advancing structural reforms to boost growth and address imbalances
24.
Structural reforms can play an important role in reviving investment, employment,
and productivity, as well as resolving intra-euro area imbalances. To this end, national reforms
to improve labor market functioning and increase competition in product and service sectors need
to progress further (Table 4 summarizes staff’s country-specific recommendations and priorities).
These would be helped by reform efforts at the euro area level to implement the Services Directive,
negotiate free trade agreements, and further integrate energy markets to mitigate possible
disruptions in global commodity markets due to geopolitical events. Specifically, an energy strategy
aimed at increasing interconnections of national networks could help ensure security of gas and
electricity supply by pooling and allocating energy reserves across countries more efficiently. In
addition, some reforms, such as capital market development, youth unemployment, and rebalancing
have both national and area-wide dimensions.
25.
Improving SMEs’ access to finance is crucial to investment and growth. SMEs account
for around 80 percent of employment and 70 percent of value added in Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
SMEs applying for loans are experiencing difficulties in obtaining credit from banks, particularly in
Spain and Italy, where about a fifth of SMEs were credit rationed during the last 6 months, either
because their applications were rejected or offers were prohibitively expensive.
26.
Developing diversified funding markets would help ensure lending to viable smaller
firms and enhance financial system resilience (Box 3). In particular, SME securitization could draw
upon a large existing pool of assets and reduce the high reliance on bank-intermediated funding,
while helping firms to rebalance their financial structure towards longer maturities and attracting
new investors. Securitization would boost bank liquidity, free up regulatory capital, and allow banks
to lend again. SME securitization could also improve the transmission of monetary policy, facilitate
cross-border investment, and boost the growth of other funding markets. Staff recommended policy
actions in the following areas:


Regulatory frameworks: Capital regulations should appropriately differentiate between high-and
low-quality SME-backed securities. Most securitization transactions in Europe showed
remarkable resilience during the financial crisis. This was largely due to conservative loan
origination standards; high equity participation and servicing being retained by the originator,
together with issuer due diligence; and adequate post-issuance monitoring. Reducing the capital
intensity of safer structures would encourage the supply of simpler (less capital intensive)
transactions, with greater transparency of the underlying SME loans. This could also involve a
more even capital treatment for different institutional investors (banks, insurance companies,
and asset managers) and the use of SME loans as collateral in refinancing operations.
Harmonization of reporting requirements would not only broaden the investor base but create
scope for developing securitization instruments that pool SME loans on an EU-wide basis.



Public sector support: The official sector should be a catalyst by creating institutional demand
when markets are insufficiently developed. Area-wide and national initiatives—such as the joint

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

EC–EIB SME initiative, the EIB-EIF securitization program, or plans by several national central
banks to support the bundling of SME-backed loans for ECB refinancing—move in the right
direction, but should be broadened to have a significant impact.
Box 3. Capital Market Development: SME Financing in the Euro Area1/
The corporate sector in Europe is highly dependent on bank-based financing, with only the largest firms able to
directly access capital markets. Developing diversified funding for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
including through securitization, could help overcome the adverse effects of financial fragmentation and support crossborder investment.
2

But SME securitization faces several challenges. Unfavorable economic terms (e.g., the high cost of issuance, a lack of
uniform reporting standards, and cumbersome insolvency regimes) and adverse cyclical factors (e.g., cheap alternative
funding sources for banks and rising SME loan default rates in stressed economies) reduce the incentives for issuance. In
fact, most recent transactions have been arranged for funding purposes and do not offer any regulatory capital relief for
issuing banks. In 2013, more than half of all issuances were “retained”—well in excess of the 5 percent “skin in the game”
regulatory requirement under CRD2— for use as collateral for short-term funding from Eurosystem liquidity facilities
(“securitization to repo”). Moreover, pending regulatory changes—Basel III for banks and Solvency II for insurance
companies—have weakened the institutional investor base by adversely affecting the capital intensity of holding highlyrated securitization transactions and their eligibility for liquidity purposes.
Current initiatives to improve the economics of SME securitization are too small and too narrowly focused to have
a broad impact. A joint EC-EIB SME lending program using EU structural funds will be operational by end-2014, and will
complement the existing funding schemes for SMEs provided by the EIB/EIF. Both efforts provide greater official support
to mostly bank-sponsored SME lending, but fall short of standardized mechanisms to entice non-banking funding sources
and schemes that would allow direct capital market access. In April 2014, the EC issued recommendations on a new
3
approach to business failure and insolvency, aimed at addressing some of the structural impediments to SME financing.
4

Reforms in the following areas would facilitate development of the SME securitization market:






The regulatory regime should appropriately differentiate between high- and low-quality securitization transactions.
Reducing the capital intensity of safer structures to reflect the resilience of European asset securitization markets
during the financial crisis would encourage the supply of transactions that fund real economic activity. This could
involve a revised capital treatment for transactions that meet higher standards of loan portfolio disclosure and
performance monitoring.
Official sector involvement could help incubate market-based solutions for risk transfer. The EIB/EIF could initially act as
guarantors or strategic investors (risk sharing) while guarding against long-term distortionary effects by making any
risk-sharing time-bound. In this regard, a targeted change to the ECB collateral framework could provide incentives
for creating a viable structure for the entire transaction rather than only that part of it placed with the ECB (possibly in
combination with an ECB liquidity facility and the option for outright asset purchases of SME transactions to establish
a floor to market prices).
Structural improvements could further facilitate market development. National insolvency frameworks should continue
to be strengthened, with a view to cleaning up banks’ balance sheets and boosting the quality and transparency of
collateral. Greater harmonization of SME lending standards and credit registries across countries would facilitate the
establishment of a truly single market. Also, forms of non-bank intermediated securitization (such as trade
receivables) and equity finance should be explored in areas where structural impediments to asset securitization are
too high and cannot be overcome in the near term.

27.
The crisis has left a legacy of unacceptably high unemployment, especially in stressed
economies. For instance, euro area countries hit hardest by the crisis have had unprecedented
increases in youth unemployment rates, ranging from 25 percent in Ireland to over 40 percent in
Spain on average during 2007–13. Large and persistent youth and adult unemployment rates lower
potential output due to skill attrition and depreciated human capital. Youth unemployment also
leads to a lower probability of future employment and lower wages, and erodes social cohesion and
institutions.

28.
A comprehensive and country-specific approach will be necessary for addressing high
unemployment. Staff analysis suggests that youth unemployment in the euro area has been
especially sensitive to cyclical conditions (Box 4). Nonetheless, structural factors also make a
difference: a larger tax wedge, higher minimum wage (relative to median wage), and lower spending
on active labor market policies (ALMPs), especially on training, are associated with higher
unemployment. Overall, a broad, comprehensive strategy to tackle youth unemployment is needed,
which involves both measures to boost growth and remove country-specific structural impediments.
The latter could include properly designed, cost-effective ALMPs, together with measures to lower
hiring costs (by reducing the tax wedge and better aligning minimum wages to average labor costs)
and improve skill levels (by providing work-related training).
29.
Further policy efforts in both creditor and debtor economies are necessary to prevent
intra-euro area imbalances from re-emerging as the recovery takes hold. In addition to
supportive macroeconomic policies, product and labor market reforms are crucial to rebalance the
euro area. Higher infrastructure investment in the creditor countries could improve disposable
incomes in these economies and lead to higher external demand, thereby reducing excessive
surpluses including vis-à-vis the rest of the world. Further improvements in competitiveness are
particularly important for stressed economies, which need to lower costs, shift resources to tradable
sectors, and reduce external debt. Staff analysis shows that in a “good” rebalancing scenario—with
higher public investment in creditor countries and more structural reform progress across the euro
area—would improve current account balances in debtor economies, while reducing the surpluses
of creditor economies. The growth dividends under this scenario could be substantial, ranging from
a ½ to ¾ percentage point rise in growth annually over a five year horizon (Box 5).

The business cycle is the most important driver of unemployment in the euro area. It explains up to
70 percent of changes in the youth (age 15–24) unemployment rates in stressed euro area countries. Youth
unemployment rates are more than twice as sensitive to the business cycle as adult (age 25-64) rates,

Structural characteristics also affect the responsiveness of unemployment to the business cycle. For
example, in stressed economies such as Greece and Spain, a higher tax wedge makes unemployment rates
more pro-cyclical.
These results are subject to important caveats. Given data limitations, the estimations assume that
structural factors have the same effect across countries. Moreover, the variables do not capture every
relevant detail of the labor market structure, e.g. eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits differ
across countries, and the tax wedge may vary across income levels in a given country, and in progressivity
across countries.

Box 5. External Rebalancing in the Euro Area: Developments and Policies1/

4

The euro area has shifted into strong surplus since the crisis. However, country-level developments underlying this shift
have been highly asymmetric, with debtor economies (such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) seeing large
improvements in their current accounts (sometimes into surplus), while creditor economies (like Germany and the
Netherlands) have maintained their surpluses. At the sectoral level, the change in current accounts has been largely driven
by falling private investment, mostly from the corporate sector.

Statistical analysis indicates that euro area external imbalances can be traced to deviations in both saving and
investment from model-based estimates. Creditor economies with large surpluses (such as Germany) have seen
persistent under-investment and over-saving in recent years, compared to what would be predicted by a model
incorporating fundamentals (see text figure). On the other hand, the analysis also points to persistent and substantial overinvestment by some debtor economies prior to the crisis (such as Spain). The magnitude of over-investment in debtor
economies has fallen since the crisis, but there is a risk that this
reflects, at least in part, the large output gaps that remain in these

some debtor economies (such as Greece) and temper the net
external assets of some creditor economies (such as the Netherlands). More importantly, potential growth and productivity
would improve across the board, with growth dividends ranging from ½–¾ percentage points of real GDP over the
medium term. This would be accompanied by faster closing of the output gaps and higher inflation (helping aid relative
price adjustment).
The External Stability Report’s assessment suggests that the euro area as a whole exhibits an external position and
real exchange rate that are broadly consistent with fundamentals. The 2013 real exchange rate gap is estimated to be
somewhere between -5 and 0 percent, while the current account gap is estimated to be between -½ and 1 percent of GDP.
However, this masks imbalances in constituent member economies, with some showing real exchange rate overvaluation
(such as Spain) and others undervaluation (such as Germany). There is a need for continuing structural reforms in product
and labor markets in both creditor and debtor economies to help rectify these imbalances. Moreover, in a few creditor
economies, there is some scope to use fiscal space to boost public investment.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
30.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of economic developments in the
euro area and the downside risks to growth. They noted that the recovery, despite showing signs
of being sustained, was still too weak to make a significant impact on high unemployment and debt
levels. They acknowledged strong headwinds to growth from persistently weak credit conditions,
financial fragmentation, and private sector deleveraging.
31.
The ECB’s recent package of policy measures demonstrates its resolve to raise inflation
towards the price stability objective and counter financial fragmentation. The authorities
agreed with staff that low inflation makes adjustment difficult and emphasized that a prolonged
undershooting of the inflation objective is not acceptable to the Governing Council of the ECB.
32.
The ECB considered this package sufficient to address low inflation and support
greater bank lending. But they are ready to respond swiftly if inflation remains unacceptably
subdued including, potentially, asset purchases to expand the ECB’s balance sheet. Despite their
limited size, private asset purchases could address fragmentation by injecting liquidity and
supporting credit. Quantitative easing (QE)—mainly through sovereign but also private asset
purchases—is an option, particularly if external risks materialize and the inflation outlook worsens.
Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that QE is no panacea, and is subject—just like any other
measure—to some limitations. Despite some uncertainty about standard transmission mechanisms
in an environment of already very low sovereign yields, the expectations channel is expected to play
a significant role in transmitting an ECB balance sheet expansion into higher inflation.
33.
The EC agreed that the broadly neutral fiscal stance at the euro area level is helping
sustain the recovery, but cautioned against the risk of policy complacency. Member states’
2014 consolidation plans are now based on more realistic macroeconomic assumptions, perhaps
reflecting the role of the new fiscal councils. The composition has also improved with less reliance
on capital spending cuts. But the EC argued that a premature relaxation of SGP targets to tackle
weak aggregate demand would undermine the credibility of the recently-reformed framework.
Nonetheless, if inflation remained subdued after the monetary policy arsenal had been exhausted,
the escape clauses of fiscal rules could be activated.
34.
On fiscal governance, the authorities acknowledged that some revisions to the
framework were necessary but emphasized legal and political constraints to introducing
radical changes. They noted that the complexity of the existing framework owed much to prior
attempts to make the framework more flexible (and less pro-cyclical) in the face of large shocks. The
EC also saw benefits in creating more incentives to foster long-term growth and fill the investment
gap but warned that modifying the rules to accommodate structural reforms and higher public
investment would create loopholes and make procedures even more complex. They also cautioned
against an overly pessimistic view of existing enforcement mechanisms, pointing to the track record
of several member countries successfully exiting the EDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

EURO AREA POLICIES

35.
The authorities were optimistic that the ongoing AQR and associated stress tests
would be successfully completed. This will provide a major boost to confidence in the banking
sector and facilitate balance sheet repair. The authorities pointed out that since the middle of 2013
there has already been a large improvement in European banks’ capital positions. Total capital has
risen almost €90 billion, nearly 4 percent, since May 2013. Coordination between the ECB and
national competent authorities (NCAs) is so far proceeding smoothly, and independent third party
involvement in asset valuations has been an integral part of the process. Clear and prompt
recapitalization plans would be required of banks found to fall short of AQR or stress test hurdle
rates. Recent improvements in the funding environment for banks should be conducive to banks’
ability to fulfill the ambitious timetable for recapitalization. The timetable is expected to be strictly
followed, in order to preserve the credibility of the exercise. That said, the authorities agreed with
staff that banks may be granted some flexibility in extraordinary circumstances. They also concurred
that financial stability concerns would be appropriately taken into account in all decisions.
36.
Major progress has been made on the banking union. The authorities noted that the
transition to a single supervisor is likely to facilitate cross-border liquidity provision within the euro
area, which could help reduce financial fragmentation. The SSM is making institutional
preparations—including hiring staff—to ensure that it will be ready to assume supervisory
responsibilities in November. The authorities highlighted that recent agreements had made SRM
decision making procedures less cumbersome—improving the prospects for quick resolution in a
crisis—and the SRF transition period made shorter. Apart from a quicker overall mutualization of
national compartments, they pointed to the front-loaded nature of the timetable, with 40 percent of
the SRF funds being mutualized by the end of the first year of operation, and 60 percent by the end
of the second year. They also noted that passage of the BRRD, which will become fully operational in
2016, has established tiered depositor preferences and a bail-in tool for creditors. Moreover, the
Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes harmonizes the coverage and speed of payout of national
deposit guarantee schemes across the EU.
37.
On a common fiscal backstop for the AQR and more generally for bank resolution, the
authorities pointed to recent progress in enabling direct bank recapitalization from the ESM.
They agreed with staff that the threshold envisaged for direct recap is very high, but argued that this
was broadly appropriate in light of the desire to minimize the chances that public aid would be
deployed. The principle that creditors rather than taxpayers should be liable for payments in case of
bank failures or capital shortfalls is firmly entrenched in the resolution framework.
38.
The authorities agreed that the ongoing rebalancing is incomplete. Wages are adjusting
and current account positions are improving in the debtor countries. But these developments are
occurring against a backdrop of still-large output gaps and could be partially reversed as economic
activity recovers. Further efforts in these countries should focus on microeconomic reforms to
improve competitiveness. Meanwhile, there are limited signs of symmetric adjustment in surplus
countries. The authorities agreed that higher infrastructure investment in these countries should
contribute towards reducing intra-euro area imbalances.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

39.
On structural reforms, the authorities agreed with staff that action was needed on
both the national and regional levels. The “Youth Guarantee Scheme” will provide EU structural
funds to support country-specific programs, subject to an assessment by the EC. It will be targeted
at countries where youth unemployment exceeds 25 percent. Progress was also being made on
fostering a single market for energy, with wholesale prices for gas and electricity converging across
countries. The most pressing challenges were to inter-connect national electricity grids, and
harmonize country-specific climate change measures to achieve the common target for renewable
by 2020. Negotiations continue on a free trade agreement with the US, and with other countries,
although greater political uncertainty could slow the momentum.
40.
The authorities welcomed staff’s emphasis on capital market development. They
viewed this area as an integral part of the drive toward a Single Market. In this context, they
supported proposals for facilitating greater SME access to finance. Widening the existing EIB-EIF
program for SME securitization and exploring synergies with the EC-EIB SME Initiative would foster
greater capital market integration. The authorities saw merit in pursuing a number of proposals:
differentiated capital intensity of high- and low-quality securitization transactions; more equitable
regulatory treatment of securitized and non-securitized SME loans; harmonization of loan reporting
requirements, credit scoring, and credit registry information; and non-bank intermediated forms of
structured finance, such as cash flow (receivables) securitization.
41.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s risk assessment. Surges in global financial
market volatility due to revised expectations of US exit from UMP could complicate the ECB’s own
polices to increase inflation expectations and support demand, if the ECB forward guidance proved
less effective under such scenario. A protracted slowdown in emerging markets (EMs) could weigh
on growth prospects through the trade channel, although such a channel is unlikely to be strong
and there could be a potential offset from capital flow substitution from EMs to euro area periphery
countries. An escalation of geopolitical tensions could have adverse—and uneven—consequences
for several euro area countries, but the authorities observed that it was very difficult to attach
meaningful probabilities to this event. They also noted that such risks seemed to have diminished
recently. They agreed that internal risks arising from stagnation or a de-anchoring of long term
inflation expectations remained germane. However, the authorities argued that some of these risks
were interlinked, and the impact would be high only if they were all to be realized at the same time.
Moreover, the probability of such scenarios materializing was reduced by the endogenous policy
response that signs of stagnation would call forth, in particular as regards balance sheet repair. They
attached a higher likelihood to the danger of reform fatigue setting in, especially in light of a more
euro-skeptic configuration in the new European Parliament.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The euro area’s economy has now expanded for four consecutive quarters, with
varying strength across countries. Financial market sentiment is buoyant, sovereign spreads have
narrowed to pre-crisis levels and bank funding costs have declined sharply. These improvements
have been grounded in vigorous policy actions. The ECB has provided demand support through
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

EURO AREA POLICIES

conventional monetary policy—including the recent rate cut and negative deposit rates—while the
fiscal drag in 2014 has diminished. Rapid progress has been made with establishing a banking
union, with the ECB ready to assume supervisory authority in November, soon after the results of the
ongoing AQR are announced.
43.
But the recovery is neither robust nor sufficiently strong. Investment remains well below
pre-crisis levels, constrained, at least in part by the continuing contraction of bank credit. Credit
conditions in periphery countries are particularly weak, with many SMEs—a major source of output
and employment—being rationed. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, remains
unacceptably high, and the private debt burden remains elevated in many countries. Therefore,
greater growth momentum is required to substantially repair the damage from the crisis.
44.
Inflation has been too low for too long. This stifles demand by keeping real interest rates
and real debt burdens too high, while making the unfinished task of rebalancing more difficult. A
protracted period of inflation below the central bank’s target could de-anchor expectations and
undermine monetary policy credibility. And a negative external shock could tip the economy into
deflation.
45.
Concerted policy efforts are needed to strengthen the recovery. ECB actions have
provided welcome demand support. Successful execution of the AQR and a common fiscal backstop
are needed to facilitate balance sheet repair and sever bank-sovereign feedback links. And structural
reforms are needed to tackle high unemployment and facilitate intra-euro area rebalancing.
46.
The ECB’s recent policy package signals its determination to address low, below-target
inflation and fulfill its mandate. Collectively, the wide range of measures should lead to a
substantial expansion of liquidity. The provision of targeted term funding for banks should
encourage credit to SMEs, especially in stressed economies.
47.
But if low inflation and fragmentation are not reversed, a substantial expansion of the
ECB’s balance sheet may be necessary to complement the recent package. This could be
achieved through a large program of asset purchases—primarily sovereign assets for reasons of
market depth—or a new non-targeted LTRO on a long-term, fixed-rate basis. Both asset purchases
and a large-scale LTRO involve balance sheet risk for the ECB, strengthening the pre-commitment to
accommodative policy, and thereby influencing inflation expectations.
48.
The overall broadly neutral fiscal stance of the euro area in 2014 strikes an appropriate
balance between demand support and debt sustainability considerations. Negative growth
surprises should not trigger additional consolidation efforts.
49.
Successful completion of the AQR will facilitate bank balance sheet repair. The
ambitious timetable for recapitalization of banks should be feasible given markedly improved
market conditions, but some flexibility might be necessary if several banks need to raise capital at
the same time. Creditor bail-ins for systemically important banks, if necessary, would need to be

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

applied with due consideration given to financial stability concerns. Efforts are also needed to
reduce the corporate debt overhang, by strengthening national insolvency frameworks and
facilitating debt restructurings.
50.
There has been rapid progress towards a more complete banking union. The transition
to a single supervisor—the SSM—should facilitate cross-border liquidity provision, thereby reducing
fragmentation. SRM decision-making procedures have been simplified, and the timetable for
mutualization of the SRF has been shortened.
51.
Work needs to continue on establishing a common fiscal backstop to effectively sever
sovereign-bank links. While the proposal for ESM direct recap is a step in the right direction, as
currently envisaged the thresholds for such support are too high.
52.
Capital market development should be encouraged to provide an alternative to bank
lending. Developing capital market financing alternatives, like greater securitization for corporate
funding, would help ensure lending to viable smaller firms, enhance the resilience of the financial
system, and improve monetary transmission. To bolster securitization markets, regulatory risk
weights for high quality (simple and transparent) liquid asset-backed securities should be reduced.
This would free up capital for further lending.
53.
More structural reforms are necessary to tackle high unemployment, burnish
competitiveness, and facilitate rebalancing. A comprehensive strategy to tackle youth
unemployment would involve both measures to boost growth and remove country-specific
structural impediments. The latter could include cost-effective ALMPs, measures to lower the
opportunity cost of employment, and better-targeted training programs. Higher infrastructure
investment in the creditor countries would help reduce excessive surpluses. Meanwhile,
competitiveness-enhancing reforms to product and labor markets in debtor countries would aid
further rebalancing, by boosting export growth as the recovery takes hold and import compression
unwinds. Efforts should continue to implement the Services Directive, make progress with free trade
agreements, and more closely integrate energy platforms and policies.
54.
Over the medium term, ideas to simplify and strengthen the fiscal governance
framework should be explored. Consideration should be given to a more parsimonious framework
with a single objective and an economically sound operational lever. The credibility of the rules
would be enhanced by much stronger enforcement mechanisms. Boosting the ability of the center
to fund public infrastructure projects—such as cross-border investments in transportation,
communications and energy networks—would help lay the foundations for sustained growth, while
keeping countries within the bounds of the fiscal framework.
55.
Staff proposes that the next Article VI consultations on euro area policies follow the
standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30
percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more).

Includes large scale purchase of government securities, and credit easing measures.
Primary gap defined as P-P*. P is the structural primary balance as % GDP in 2013. P* is the debt stabilizing primary balance in the medium term defined as (r-g)*d, where r is a weighted average
(by average maturity) of the 2013 effective interest rate and the average 10-year yield over the last 6 months minus 2%, g is av. potential growth in 2016-2018 and d is the debt ratio in 2013.
Weighted average of subcategories (red = 5, yellow = 4, grey = 3, light green = 2, dark green =1). Monetary policy space modifies the weight on the cycle: i.e., if full monetary policy space, fiscal policy is determined by
sustainability concerns. If zero monetary space, then fiscal policy determined by the weighted average of cyclical and sustainability factors. The weight for cyclal conditions are reduced by: "Limited" = 25% adjustment,
"significant" = 50%, "substantial" = 75%, "full" = 100%.
The values for each variable are colored depending on their signal for the fiscal stance based on the thresholds.
Staff estimated structural headline adjustment from Authorities' budget plans submitted to EC under the Six Pack, as percent of potential GDP, slightly different from change in CAPB.
Staff advice for Germany is to consider an additional deficit of -0.5 percent of GDP, with the caveat that spending should be tilted towards public investment.

private sector pension system regime by
2020 and increase the effective
retirement age.
 The government has subsidized firms’.
permanent hiring of young workers (a
€4000 subsidy for the first three years).
 The government has committed EUR 30
billion of labor tax cuts over 2013–16.
 The reform of training (Dec. 2013) is a
positive step towards better skills
matching and labor mobility.
 The latest reform of unemployment
insurance (March 2014) does not change
the benefit structure.
 Implementation of the Services Directive
has strengthened competition, but some
sectors remain protected.
 New mandatory mediation scheme,
measures to deal with backlog of
pending cases and speed up case
processing (2013).
 Packages on wage bargaining
decentralization and labor contracts
agreed in 2011 but implementation has
stalled.

permanent contracts, increase in
training, apprentice and internship
schemes).
 Fornero labor market reform (April
2012), reduced cost of individual
dismissals.
 Liberalization of gas sector;
establishment of transport authority.

 A framework (legal, tax, financial) that

skilled and women.
 Further facilitation of immigration by
creating new pathways for immigration of
medium skilled workers in addition to
supporting immigration of the high skilled.
 Review the family policy to improve its
efficiency.
 Adjustments in the minimum wage should
be tied to the recommendations of a
council with independent expert
representation.
 Accelerate the integration of panEuropean transportation and energy
networks and increase competition in
network industries.
 Increased competition in services sector.
 Additional unemployment benefit reforms
could aim for more degressivity and
stricter activation measures.
 Open up distribution, some transportation
services, and professional services to
competition. Strengthen competition
authority to review anti-competitive
practices more effectively.
 Regulatory simplification.
 Simplify employment protection
legislation and labor code and reduce
judicial uncertainty
 Remove obstacles to labor mobility
(unification of pension schemes, tax and
cost distortions to selling a house etc.)

Germany

participation and
facilitate immigration
of qualified workers
 Increase productivity
and competition, in
particular in the
services sector
 Clarify future energy
policy with respect to
pricing and
infrastructure

 Promote the use of out-of-court
mediation, comprehensive review of court
fees; strengthen court organization and
management, fully open up the legal
profession.
 Remove structural bottlenecks that push
up average production cost. Enhance
competition in supply and distribution of
electricity.
 Improve coordination and efficiency of
ALMPs and employment services at the
local level to support the youth guarantee
program starting in 2014. Shift to more
flexible, single contracts for new workers
that gradually increase job protection with
seniority to lower the hiring cost and
support apprenticeships.
 Decentralize wage setting.
 Link unemployment support to
employability: redesign wagesupplementation scheme to turn it into
universal support system conditional on
job search and training.
 Faster implementation of plans to open up
professional services and privatization of
local services.

Appendix. Statistical Issues

1

European statistics are developed, produced, and disseminated within their respective spheres of
competence by the European Statistical System (ESS) and the European System of Central Banks
(ESCB). The ESS, composed of Eurostat and the national statistical institutes (NSIs), and the ESCB,
composed of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs), operate under separate legal frameworks
reflecting their respective governance structures and cooperate closely when designing their respective
statistical programs.2 The European statistics produced by the two statistical systems are of sufficient
coverage, quality, and timeliness for effective macroeconomic surveillance. This appendix provides an
update on developments of statistical issues since the previous Article IV consultation of the euro area.
1.
Significant progress has been made in implementation of the new international
statistical standards. The shifts to the new European System of National and Regional Accounts
(ESA 2010) and to the Sixth Edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6) are well on track. 3 Eurostat and ECB are working closely with all
stakeholders on preparing the new data compilation and transmission, as well as methodological
and statistical revisions. According to the current schedule, the new set of national accounts under
ESA 2010 will be compiled and disseminated from September 2014, and the new euro area BOP
statistics in line with the BPM6 will be published from Q4 2014. Monetary and financial statistics (e.g.
interest rate, investment funds, financial vehicle corporations, securities issues) have also been
adapted and new statistics will become available in 2015.
2.
These new changes are to bring remarkable benefits to economic surveillance and
analysis. The new statistical standards would allow economics data for the euro area to be
disseminated in a timely manner with broadened coverage. In particular,


Broadened data coverage and shorter transmission periods. ESA 2010 comes with a modified
transmission program to Eurostat from the member states, with extended coverage (e.g. of
non-financial assets and pension schemes) and advancement of transmission deadlines.
Under the new schedule, national account aggregates are now to be transmitted at t+60
days (rather than t+70 days). The quarterly non-financial accounts by sector intended for
euro area aggregates will be transmitted by the euro area countries at t+85 days (instead of
t+90 days).



Flash quarterly GDP estimates at T+30 days. In parallel to the adoption of ESA 2010, a Task
Force (TF) is established by the National Accounts Working Group to assess the feasibility to

1

Prepared jointly by the European (EUR) and Statistics Department (STA) of the IMF in consultation with the Eurostat
and ECB. Claudia H. Dziobek acted as the STA coordinator.
2
The ESS is defined by Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No. 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
European statistics. The ESCB performs its statistical function on the basis of Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB and
of the ECB.
3
The transition to ESA 2010 is regulated by EU Regulation No. 549/2013 and the transition to BPM6 is regulated by
EU Regulation No. 555/2012 and ECB Guideline ECB/2011/23, as amended. Changes to monetary and financial
statistics are regulated by the ECB.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

EURO AREA POLICIES

produce a flash estimate of the euro area and European Union quarterly GDP at T+30 days
The TF started its work in June 2013 and intends to finalize the work by the end of 2015.
Provided that the compilation of reliable T+30 days estimates is deemed to be feasible by
the TF, a first T+30 flash estimate for the euro area and EU quarterly GDP could be published
for Q1 2016.


More detailed analysis and presentation of pension schemes. A compulsory supplementary
table on pension entitlements will be required from 2017 to show the liabilities of all
pension schemes, including those of government, whether they are unfunded or funded.
This will improve comparability across countries and quantify the accrued-to-date pension
entitlements of private households. Under ESA 2010, unfunded pension obligations of
general government will not be reported in the core financial accounts and will not impact
the Maastricht debt.



Improved statistics and coverage of balance of payments data under BPM6. The ECB’s data
reporting requirements on external statistics under the BPM6 are more detailed, particularly
as regard the instrument detail within the various functional categories of financial
transactions. The first dissemination of BPM6 data will also be accompanied by
comprehensive back-data, whose length will depend on national data availability and
quality. In addition, a more detailed geographical breakdown of the euro area international
investment position will be available on a quarterly basis, instead of the current annual
frequency.

3.
The implementation of the new international statistical standards, combined with
improved national data collections, will result in revisions to the economic statistics. Revisions
of historical GDP components are expected to raise GDP estimates for most EU members, partially
due to the capitalization of research and development (R&D) expenditure and military weapons. The
methodological revisions will for most countries coincide with regular benchmark revisions in which
new data sources and methods will be introduced. While the exact impact on GDP levels varies
across countries and they are not available until the data compilation is fully completed, the average
impact of methodological changes (leaving aside statistical changes) on nominal EU GDP is expected
to be an increase of 2.4 percent. In addition, the inclusion of part of illegal activities is likely to raise
GDP estimates for some countries. Overall, as these re-categorized expenditures are relatively stable
as share of GDP over time, most of methodological revisions are expected to affect GDP levels
backwards with a limited impact on growth profile.
4.
There are remarkable improvements in government finance statistics to enhance
economic and fiscal governance. The Enhanced Economic Governance Package (so called “Six
Pack”) adopted in 2011 required adoption of measures for the collection and dissemination of
monthly and quarterly fiscal data based on public accounts, and data on contingent liabilities for all

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EURO AREA POLICIES

general government subsectors.4 Eurostat established a Task Force on the implications of the
Directive under the “Six Pack” on the collection and dissemination of fiscal data. Important progress
has been achieved up to date.


Enhanced fiscal data reporting. By the end of 2013, countries brought into force the
provisions necessary to comply with these requirements. Since February 2014, monthly fiscal
data5 for central and state government and social security funds are publicly accessible for
almost all countries on their national websites. A complete set of the general government
accounts (including also local government) is available on a quarterly basis since end June
2014.



Planned publication of general government contingent liabilities. In parallel to the new ESA
transmission program, national publication of annual data on contingent liabilities and other
indicators with potential impact on fiscal deficit and/or debt will start from October 2014.
Eurostat will collect and disseminate new comparable sets of data regarding contingent
liabilities and potential obligations of general government, such as the amounts of
guarantees, the debt of public corporations, nonperforming loans, and potential obligations
under Public Private Partnerships.

5.
Important steps are taken at the European level to support the ECB’s role as a single
supervisor and monetary policy. In October 2013 a new EU regulation conferred to the ECB the
sole responsibility for supervision of large banks in the euro area and in those EU member states
that voluntarily adhere to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).6


Expanded data collection and collaboration. The ECB will collect supervisory data for the
banking groups based on the harmonized Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) of the
European Banking Authority, which has six parts: financial reporting, consolidated reporting,
asset encumbrance, large exposures, liquidity ratios, and leverage ratios. Additional ad hoc
datasets, including but not limited to those required for stress-testing purposes, may also be
requested. Data is also to be transmitted directly from national supervisory authorities when
the national central bank is not the supervisory authority.



Financial sector surveillance supporting SSM and monetary policy. Since 2013 balance sheets
of 246 monetary financial institutions (MFIs) are transmitted to the ECB on a monthly basis.
This supports the analysis of deposit and lending decisions of the financial sector, and
provides insights into the sources of bank funding. Quarterly data on the activities of nonbank financial institutions, including investment funds other than money market funds and
including hedge funds, financial vehicles engaged in securitization and insurance companies
and pension funds, are now collected by the ECB, complementing existing data relating to

4

See Council Directive 2011/85/EU on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States.
The monthly fiscal data are cash based in the majority of countries, but the link with the accrual ESA 95 accounts is
explained in the explanatory notes and a reconciliation table.

Securities holdings statistics. A new dataset on securities holdings statistics is being collected
by the ECB since end 2013 on the basis of the ECB Regulation concerning statistics on
holdings of securities. The new data contains security-by-security information on holdings of
individual securities by institutional sectors. Additionally, a second module comprises
security-by-security information on the holdings by each of the largest euro area banking
groups (i.e. also including the securities held by their subsidiaries and branches, both inside

The survey on the access to finance of SMEs in the euro area (SAFE). 7 ECB conducted the tenth
semiannual survey on SME financing conditions, which provides evidence mainly on changes
in the financial situation, financing needs, and access to financing from October 2013 to
March 2014. The survey results suggest that financing conditions for SMEs continue to differ
significantly across euro area countries and are in general more difficult than those of larger
companies. Increasing quantitative coverage are to be expected in future surveys on firm
characteristics including investment, export intensity, employees, and lending conditions
such as interest rates, payment delays, and sources of financing. Moreover, from 2014, a
larger version of the survey which is conducted every second year together with the
Commission will become annual.

develop a robust quality monitoring procedure in order to ensure the highest quality of the MIP

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation on Euro Area Policies
On July 9, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Euro Area.
The euro area recovery is taking hold. Real output has expanded for four consecutive
quarters, and financial market sentiment has improved markedly. Complementary policy
actions have supported demand, boosted investor confidence, and eased financial conditions.
At the national level, governments have made further progress repairing sovereign and bank
balance sheets and implementing structure reforms to restore competitiveness. At the areawide level, the ECB has taken a wider range of measures to support demand and address
fragmentation. Progress on building a banking union continues, with the ECB set to assume
supervisory responsibilities in November 2014, following the planned completion of the
Comprehensive Assessment of systemically important banks. Additional steps—such as
agreements on a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), backed by Single Resolution Fund
(SRF), the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), and the deposit insurance
harmonization directive—demonstrate collective commitment to EMU.
But the recovery is neither robust nor sufficiently strong. Weak aggregate demand is
weighing on real activity and pulling down inflation across the euro area, as corporates,
households and banks continue to repair their balance sheets. Financial markets are still
fragmented, with contracting credit and high borrowing costs constraining investment in
countries with large output gaps, large debt burdens, and high unemployment. In this context,
euro area GDP is expected to grow by just over 1 percent this year, before expanding by
1.5 percent in 2015. Headline inflation is expected to remain below the ECB’s primary price
objective for a protracted period, underscoring the risks from low inflation. And there are
remaining structural gaps in capital, labor, and product markets, presenting hurdles to
financing investment, intra-euro area rebalancing, and raising productivity.
Risks to growth are still tilted to the downside. With limited policy space in the near term,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

further negative shocks—either domestic or external—could undermine financial market
sentiment, halt the recovery, and push the economy into lower inflation and even deflation. A
common fiscal backstop would strengthen the credibility of the asset quality review (AQR)
and stress tests. The recovery is also subject to external risks, including a slowdown in
emerging market growth, escalation of geopolitical conflict, and an abrupt exit from
unconventional monetary policies in the United States. Over the medium term, there is a risk
of stagnation, which could result from persistently depressed domestic demand due to
deleveraging, insufficient policy action, and stalled structural reforms. More positively,
improved confidence could raise growth above forecast levels.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the strong policy actions taken at the euro area and national
levels to prop up demand and ease financial conditions, which have improved market
sentiment and recovery prospects. Directors emphasized that sustained, higher growth is
needed to reduce unemployment and debt burdens in the euro area while also generating
positive spillovers to the rest of the world. This requires concerted efforts that focus on
additional demand support, completion of bank balance sheet repair and of a banking union,
and further advancement of structural reforms. Directors underscored the importance of
continued collective commitment to completing the architecture of the Economic and
Monetary Union.
Directors welcomed the exceptional measures recently taken by the European Central Bank
(ECB) to address low inflation and strengthen demand, as well as its intention to use further
unconventional instruments if necessary. They agreed that if inflation remains too low,
consideration could be given to a large-scale asset purchase program, primarily of sovereign
assets. Directors noted that the signaling of the ECB’s commitment to its price objective
would eventually raise inflation expectations across the euro area.
Directors acknowledged that the neutral area-wide fiscal stance is broadly appropriate,
balancing growth with debt sustainability considerations. They stressed, however, that
national fiscal policies should be carefully calibrated to support growth where space permits,
making use of the flexibility under the fiscal framework and avoiding further consolidation in
the event of large negative growth surprises, while adhering to the medium-term objective of
reducing public debt-to-GDP ratios. Directors also recommended using the escape clauses in
the fiscal framework if deflation risks materialize and monetary policy options are depleted.
They saw scope for streamlining the governance framework over the medium term with a
view to improving its clarity and compliance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors underlined the urgency of repairing bank balance sheets and reducing financial
fragmentation. While supporting the broad strategy and the ambitious timetable for bank
recapitalization, they saw merit in maintaining some flexibility to take account of market
conditions and financial stability concerns. They also considered that a common fiscal
backstop would decisively sever bank-sovereign links and enhance the credibility of the
ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment of bank balance sheets. Directors were encouraged by
the substantial progress toward a banking union, and looked forward to further advancement
at the national level to facilitate corporate debt resolution, including by strengthening
insolvency and debt restructuring frameworks.
Directors stressed the need to step up structural reforms with a view to promoting
employment, competitiveness, and intra-euro area rebalancing. Priority areas include:
(i) diversifying funding markets through securitization, especially to credit-constrained
smaller firms; (ii) removing country-specific structural impediments to tackle high youth
unemployment; and (iii) higher public investment in creditor countries and continued
competitiveness-enhancing reforms in debtor countries. Directors also encouraged steps to
improve labor market functioning and increase competition in product and services sectors,
which would support efforts at the euro area level to implement the Services Directive,
negotiate free trade agreements, and further integrate energy markets.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director, on the Euro Area
July 9, 2014

In my capacity as President of EURIMF, I submit this Buff statement on the Article IV
consultation with the euro area. It reflects the common view of the Member States of the euro
area and the relevant European Union institutions in their respective fields of competence.
The authorities of the euro-area Member States and EU institutions are grateful for open and
fruitful consultations with staff and for their constructive policy advice.
The authorities are generally in broad agreement with staff findings and recommendations.
Policy actions over the past year have laid the foundations for recovery and boosted investor
confidence. However, policy action is still needed to strengthen the recovery by supporting
domestic sources of growth, pursuing differentiated, growth friendly fiscal consolidation,
addressing financial fragmentation and facilitating the balance sheet repair in the private
sector as well as advancing structural reforms.
The authorities are making continued efforts to ensure deeper structural reforms throughout
the euro area in order to boost potential growth, to create jobs and to ensure that the intra euro
area rebalancing observed in recent years will continue. The analysis undertaken within the
economic surveillance framework under the European Semester leads to country specific
policy advice on fiscal and structural policies. The authorities reiterate their commitment to
take all necessary actions to strengthen the recovery in the euro area and ensure medium-term
growth and sustainability of public debt.
Economic outlook and risks
The authorities broadly share staff's view on economic prospects. Despite recent
improvements, the ongoing economic recovery remains moderate and is expected to gain
momentum only slowly in 2014-15, while job creation is still lagging behind.
In the first quarter, real GDP increased by 0.2% (quarter-on-quarter), following an expansion
by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. After four quarters of economic expansion, the real
economy has not yet fully recovered from the impact of the European sovereign-debt crisis.
Despite significant improvements in financial market sentiment, in the first half of 2014,
credit dynamics remain weak, which can only partially be attributed to the usual lagged
response of credit during a cyclical upturn. For instance, bank lending to the euro-area private
sector continued to decline over the last couple of months, at an annual rate of -1.4% in May
(adjusted for sales and securitisation). Lending volumes to the non-financial corporate sector
continued to be weaker with -2.5% annual growth in May (adjusted for sales and
securitisation), with market fragmentation still persisting, while the annual growth rate of
loans to households remained slightly positive, mainly supported by lending for house
purchases. Heterogeneity in lending volumes and interest rates across euro-area countries has
slightly receded but remains high. Financial fragmentation has reduced but is still hampering
the transmission of financial conditions to productive activity in some countries.

1

Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to continue, gradually gaining momentum
and broadening across countries, as domestic demand strengthens in the course of this year.
This includes fixed investment, which, as staff also emphasises, has been hit hard since the
beginning of the crisis in 2007-08. Fixed investment is expected to continue its expansion as
financing conditions remain favourable (on average), uncertainty declines further and the
recovery gains momentum. According to the Commission services' Spring 2014 forecast, real
GDP should grow by 1.2% in 2014 and by 1.7% in 2015, with all domestic GDP components
and net exports making positive contributions in both years. The mechanical impact of the
weaker-than expected first quarter on the annual figure for 2014 should be small. This outlook
is also broadly in line with staff's forecast, which appears to be marginally less optimistic for
output growth but comprises an identical outlook for employment growth. The on-going
balance-sheet repair in the private sector as well as the residual fragmentation of financial
markets are the main factors constraining growth in 2014. The expected uptick in growth in
2015 reflects not only stronger global growth, but also higher growth of private consumption
and gross fixed capital formation. Further progress with structural reforms, with the banking
union and with the repair of banks' balance sheets is expected to support the strengthening of
domestic demand and thus the recovery. In both years, the moderate pace of expansion
implies that unemployment rates should fall only slowly from current levels.
The staff’s assessment highlights that risks to the growth outlook remain tilted to the
downside with downside risks having recently increased on the external side. The authorities
are less pessimistic than the staff's report regarding their potential impact on the euro area. On
the domestic side, one of the main risks to growth remains the stalling or only partial
implementation of structural, fiscal and institutional reforms at the Member States and the EU
level.
Supporting domestic demand and strengthening the recovery
The authorities underline that the Fund's concern of a protracted period of slow growth and
even stagnation is not a central scenario.


Monetary policy and the outlook for price stability

The authorities broadly share staff's view on euro area inflation dynamics and outlook. At
present, inflation is very low at 0.5% both in May and, according to the flash estimate, also in
June 2014. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to remain at low levels over the coming
months, before increasing only gradually during 2015 and 2016. Inflation expectations for the
euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the ECB’s
aim to maintain inflation rates at levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Both
upside and downside risks to the outlook for price developments remain limited and broadly
balanced over the medium term. The ECB is strongly determined to keep inflation
expectations solidly anchored over the medium term.
Over the past year, the ECB forcefully responded to the risks to price stability, which at the
current juncture are associated with the risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation. To
address those risks, the ECB has lowered its key ECB interest rates in November and
announced a comprehensive monetary policy package in early June. All these measures
provide additional monetary policy accommodation and support lending to the real economy.
Taken together, these measures should contribute to a return of inflation to levels closer to
2%.

2

Specifically, the ECB measures of early June included a cut in the key ECB interest rates,
including, for the first time, a negative rate on the deposit facility now standing at -0.10%.
Moreover, the ECB has announced to conduct longer-term refinancing operations targeted to
support bank lending to the non-financial private sector and it is intensifying its preparatory
work related to outright purchases in the ABS market. To maintain a high degree of monetary
accommodation and to contain volatility in money markets all refinancing operations will be
conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at least until end 2016, and the
weekly operations sterilising the liquidity injected under the SMP have been suspended.
The ECB has also announced to maintain a high degree of monetary accommodation. The key
ECB interest rates will remain at present levels for an extended period of time in view of the
current outlook for inflation. If necessary, the ECB stands ready to use further unconventional
instruments within its mandate to address further risks of a too prolonged period of low
inflation. At the same time, the combination of monetary policy measures decided last month
has already led to a measurable easing of the monetary policy stance and is likely to provide
impetus to an expansion of loans to the real economy which in turn will support and reinforce
the on-going economic recovery.


Fiscal policy

On the fiscal policy side, the authorities broadly agree with the Fund's assessment that the
current fiscal stance for the euro area is appropriate and believe that, if needed, the
possibilities offered by the EU's existing fiscal framework to balance fiscal discipline with the
need to support growth should be used. Given the persistently high debt and unemployment
levels and the low nominal GDP growth, as well as the challenges of an ageing society and of
supporting job-creation, particularly for the young, fiscal consolidation must continue in a
growth-friendly and differentiated manner. Structural reforms that enhance growth and
improve fiscal sustainability should be given particular attention, including through an
appropriate assessment of fiscal measures and structural reforms, while making best use of the
flexibility that is built into the existing Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) rules.
On the fiscal governance framework, the authorities believe that the Fund should take into
account the legal requirements of the Treaty, when assessing possible changes to the current
governance framework. Substantial progress has been achieved in improving the SGP, and in
improving the methodology to interpret fiscal effort and the structural indicators. In addition,
the composition of fiscal consolidation is important to ensure a growth-friendly fiscal
adjustment. In the authorities' view, it is essential that the SGP is supported by credible
implementation and enforcement in Member States.

3

Financial markets, fragmentation and balance sheet repair
The authorities agree with the Staff Report that the financial crisis led to unwarranted
fragmentation of financial markets in the euro area and revealed the shortcomings of the
strong reliance of the euro area economy on bank lending. The progress made in the
establishment of the banking union will undoubtedly help further reduce financial
fragmentation by contributing to overcoming home bias among banks, leading to better
diversification of risk and a rekindling of cross-border lending. Agreeing that the debt
overhang in the private sector is a major force constraining growth in the euro area,
authorities welcome the Staff Report's recommendation to improve national insolvency
regimes.
The authorities recognise that a more diversified and accessible funding market of nonfinancial corporations could reduce the bank dependency of the euro area economy. They
therefore welcome the Staff Report's emphasis on the development of capital markets options
for corporate financing, in particular for SMEs, which are likely to be the most constrained
and the need to carefully recalibrate the regulatory framework, as suggested in the Bank of
England-ECB joint papers on EU securitisation market. They welcome the calls for the EIB
and EIF to support efforts in order to reduce market fragmentation, including through the
European Commission-EIB SME Initiative. A number of proposals could be explored such as
the creation of a European High Quality Securitisation market, enhancing data transparency
for SMEs in order to facilitate direct or indirect capital markets access, or enhancing the
market for corporate private placements on a European scale or widening the existing EIBEIF program for SME securitisation.
The authorities confirm that the ECB Comprehensive Assessment, including the asset quality
review (AQR) and the subsequent EBA stress test, is well on track and should lead to a
reinforcement of the euro area's banking system's soundness. The ESM's instruments
including a new direct recapitalisation instrument will be in place when needed and will allow
for an effective approach for those Member States that meet the eligibility criteria.
The fragmentation of financial markets will be further reduced and the soundness and
resilience of the euro area banking sector enhanced by the establishment of a Single
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The Union has
agreed on the SRM Regulation, which introduces a centralised system of decision making for
resolution, endowed with the adequate financing means through the establishment of the
Single Resolution Fund (SRF). Situations may arise when the SRF is not sufficiently funded
by the banking sector, especially in the initial period but also in the steady state. In the
transition period (1 January 2016 to 31 December 2023), bridge financing will be available
either from national sources, backed by bank levies, or from the ESM in line with agreed
procedures. A common backstop will be developed during the transition period. However, the
ability to implement bail-in fundamentally alters the dynamic for future resolution cases.
Resolution funds can only be used after a minimum bail-in of no less than 8% of the total
liabilities, including own funds, of the institution under resolution has taken place and are not
meant to be a financing mechanism for the capital of the bank.
Advancing Structural Reforms
The authorities believe that structural reforms are needed to address weak medium-term
prospects and foster job creation, in particular to tackle youth unemployment, but also to

4

boost potential growth. As financing conditions improve, structural drivers will become more
important in the medium-term. Sustained efforts need to be made for the adequate
implementation of structural reform measures in both labour and product market to strengthen
potential growth and ensure that the external rebalancing observed in recent years continues.
Most of the debtor countries still need to either further improve their current account balances
or sustain their existing surpluses to reduce risks to their external sustainability. Further
measures to boost competitiveness and facilitate the reallocation of resources to the tradable
sector are key in this respect. Creditor countries with large current account surpluses need to
foster appropriate policies to contribute to positive spill-overs. In line with the views
expressed in the staff report, creditor countries could adopt reforms that increase demand and
potential growth, particularly those aiming to support investment.
The authorities have taken a number of initiatives to tackle youth unemployment with targeted
policies (for example, reformed vocational education training, revised apprenticeship
frameworks, targeted hiring incentives, reformed public employment services, and reformed
EPL systems). The policy action has been better integrated into the European Semester
implementation over the last year, while financing of country-specific programmes has been
provided through EU structural funds (the "Youth Guarantee Scheme"), subject to an
assessment by the European Commission.
The completion of the Single Market is a continuous exercise and it is a central element of the
European growth agenda. According to the European Commission estimates, full
implementation of the Services Directive would significantly improve the functioning of the
single Market for Services and could lead to an additional economic gain of about 2.6% EU
GDP in the long term. The authorities agree with the Staff Report that further integration of
energy markets is important to mitigate possible disruptions in global commodity markets due
to geopolitical events. In this regard, connecting national electricity grids should not be
singled out as the most pressing challenge as improving the interconnection of national gas
networks is also crucial in the current geopolitical context.
Policy advice under the European Semester includes country-specific policy
recommendations in the structural domain for each Member State and the euro area as a
whole. In particular, for many Member States recommendations highlight the need to further
liberalise the services sector and to reduce the tax wedge on labour, and more generally, to
improve framework conditions for growth and jobs, including by completing the single
market, notably in the ICT industries, and by reinforcing an efficient competition framework.
Moreover, benefits can also be obtained from improvements in the quality of research and
innovation systems and from a prioritisation of R&D efforts. Further R&D investments
should be accompanied by in-depth reforms to modernise the public-private research and
innovation system and to improve the broader framework conditions for companies to become
more knowledge-intensive. It is clear that Europe as a whole needs to invest more in R&D,
innovation, education, skills and active labour market policies, as well as in energy, transport
and the digital economy. The authorities are committed to respect the country-specific policy
recommendations as endorsed in June under the European Semester.
