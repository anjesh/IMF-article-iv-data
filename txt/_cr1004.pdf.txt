Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with the Republic of Estonia
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Tessa van der Willigen
December 10, 2009
Consultation discussions were held in Tallinn October 14–26, 2009. The staff team—
Messrs. Rosenberg (head) and Lutz, Ms. Herzberg (EUR), Mr. Rodriguez (SPR),
Messrs. Kisinbay and Seelig (MCM), Ms. Eble and Mr. Grote (FAD), and Mr. Kangur
(EUR Warsaw Office)—met with President Ilves, Prime Minister Ansip, Minister of
Finance Ligi, Eesti Pank Governor Lipstok, and other senior officials. It also met with
members of Parliament and private sector representatives, social partners, and academics.
Given Estonia’s close financial sector ties with Sweden, discussions were held in Stockholm
with Riksbank Governor Ingves, Financial Services Authority Director General Andersson,
senior officials of the Finance Ministry and banking officials. Mr. Sutt (OED) participated in
numerous meetings. The mission organized a seminar on topical issues, and presented its
conclusions in a press conference.
Fund relations and exchange rate regime: The previous Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on March 2, 2009 and an FSAP update was completed in
February 2009. Since June 20, 1992, Estonia operates a currency board arrangement, with a
fixed rate of exchange of EEK 15.6466 per euro. Estonia has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, with some EU-wide exceptions.
Political background: Since the Social Democrats quit the ruling coalition in May 2009,
a center-right coalition under Prime Minister Ansip has been operating as a minority
government. Opposition parties gained in local elections held in October 2009. Parliamentary
elections are scheduled for early 2011.

I. SUMMARY AND APPRAISAL
1.
Following a credit boom, the Estonian economy is now undergoing a severe
recession, although a full-fledged crisis has been avoided. Sizable fiscal reserves and swift
adjustment measures taken in 2008 and throughout 2009 prevented funding problems of the
government and supported the currency board arrangement (CBA) at a time of regional
stress. Banks’ capital and liquidity cushions, including from their Nordic parents, headed off
liquidity problems. And relatively high reserve requirements and a proactive approach to
contingency planning, including a precautionary swap arrangement with the Swedish central
bank in support of Swedish banks operating in Estonia1, provided additional insurance and
further boosted confidence. The non-bank private sector has also reacted quickly, with wage
cuts and adjustments in employment, further enhanced by a new labor law.
2.
As a result of present and past efforts, euro adoption in 2011 appears within
reach. Following recent budget measures and assuming continued fiscal consolidation
efforts, Estonia could meet all Maastricht criteria, while the policy record to date provides
assurances for continued stability-oriented policies. This is remarkable, as it is being
achieved against the background of severe dislocations due to the crisis. Joining the euro
zone would remove residual currency and liquidity risks, adding stability to the Estonian
economy.
3.
The focus should now be on restoring economic stability and laying the
foundations for more balanced growth. Euro adoption by itself is unlikely to trigger any
major change in the pace of recovery, which staff—unlike the authorities—expects to be
relatively protracted given high unemployment and debt burdens, necessary deleveraging by
banks, and the need to fundamentally reorient the economy towards the tradable sector.
Within the authorities’ export-oriented growth strategy, a slower than expected rebound
among Estonia’s main trading partners represents a key risk to the outlook.
Putting Fiscal Policy on a Sustainable Path
4.
Staff supports the authorities’ goal of meeting the 3 percent Maastricht deficit
criterion. The benefits of euro adoption outweigh the mildly procyclical effects of fiscal
tightening during the crisis. Given considerable macroeconomic and implementation risks,
staff recommended additional structural measures of some 1 percentage point of GDP in the
context of the 2010 budget. This would provide an adequate safety margin for 2010, offset
one-off and potentially reversible measures, confront an anticipated shift in tax bases, and
help achieve the targeted medium-term structural balance. Following staff’s visit, the
authorities decided to further increase excise taxes by about ¼ percent of GDP.

5.
While there is some room for further expenditure reductions, much of the
adjustment effort may need to fall on the revenue side. The need to protect social safety
nets limits the room for spending cuts. Tax administration could be further strengthened and,
in keeping with Estonia’s streamlined tax system, poorly targeted exemptions eliminated.
Significant deferral benefits in the corporate income tax could also be reviewed.
Consideration could be given to enhanced use of environmental and property taxes, which
would broaden the tax base and reduce economic distortions. A further increase of the VAT
rate would support a shift from consumption to investment and exports.
6.
A strengthened fiscal framework could limit the budget’s procyclicality. The
annual balanced budget rule could be replaced by multi-year expenditure ceilings consistent
with the existing goal to bring the budget to structural balance by 2012. Reduced revenue
earmarking and tighter control over local government finances would also help in this regard.
Strengthening Competitiveness
7.
The economy needs to regain competitiveness lost during the boom years. Labor
and product markets seem capable of delivering the necessary adjustment. The recently
enacted labor law provides a timely boost to flexibility, although the agreed-upon increase of
unemployment compensation should be implemented as soon as fiscal space allows.
Targeting EU-funded projects to the tradable sector and other supporting structural policies
can also help to deliver the necessary rebalancing of the economy and spur economic
convergence.
8.
Seeking euro adoption at the current fixed exchange rate parity remains the
best exchange rate policy for Estonia. The economy’s flexibility suggests that the moderate
overvaluation identified by staff can be corrected through factor price adjustment alone.
While theoretically offering some advantages, a repegging of the kroon at a more depreciated
level would be unnecessarily disruptive, both for Estonia and the region.
Addressing Private Sector Debt
9.
The large stock of debt by households and corporates is expected to weigh on
growth, suggesting a focus on strengthening the credit enforcement and resolution
framework. Debtors’ financial difficulties may have eased somewhat recently, thanks to low
interest rates and banks’ willingness to reschedule a portion of debt payments. This relief is
likely to be temporary, however, as price and wage deflation and increases in euro zone
interest rates could result in higher debt servicing burdens. In dealing with private sector
debt, heavy-handed policy intervention, such as retroactive limits on debtors’ liabilities, must
be avoided. Appropriately designed credit enforcement legislation can facilitate the
rehabilitation of viable and speedy exit of non-viable firms and help good faith debtors make
a fresh start. In this spirit, the bankruptcy and reorganization acts could benefit from
enhanced flexibility to accommodate on a case-by-case basis the need for debt reduction and

5
institutional capacity could be strengthened. Changes to the corporate tax code would be
desirable to discourage excessive debt accumulation at the firm level.
Safeguarding the Financial Sector
10.
Though the financial sector has proven resilient, deteriorating credit quality
and high private sector debt present challenges. Overdue loans are likely to increase
further over the course of the year, amid limited near-term growth prospects, a depressed real
estate market and rising unemployment. Moreover, some debt restructuring agreements may
turn out to be unviable. This will necessitate banks setting aside additional provisions. High
capital adequacy ratios should not detract from the need for continued supervisory vigilance.
11.
Some recommendations of the last FSAP update still await implementation. In
particular, pending legislation on a bank resolution framework should be passed. This would
complement ongoing contingency planning for liquidity pressures. Complacency now would
risk future problems being less tractable and thus undermine public confidence.
12.

Estonia should remain on a standard 12-month consultation cycle.
II. THE CRISIS AND POLICY RESPONSES

13.
Following a period of severe overheating, the economy is contracting sharply
(Figures 1 and 2). Investment already started to slow in mid-2007, along with a bursting of
the property bubble, when the two main banks tightened lending conditions. The collapse of
global external financing and foreign trade in the Lehman bankruptcy aftermath exacerbated
the downturn. Output plummeted by almost 16 percent in the first nine months of 2009.
Deflation and wage declines are projected to persist through 2010; the latter may temper the
rise in unemployment, which nevertheless will likely reach 16 percent by the end of 2009.
The current account should remain in a small surplus in the short term, but declining nominal
GDP will worsen external debt and NIIP ratios in 2009. Staff expects the economy to resume
growth only in the middle of 2010, with a negative output gap peaking at 8½ percent of GDP.

A full-fledged crisis has been avoided due to existing buffers and a determined

sector, banks’ own capital and liquidity cushions—

6
further boosted by relatively high reserve requirements—and support from Nordic parents
prevented liquidity problems in spite of rising nonperforming loans. The private sector has
also reacted flexibly, with wage cuts and adjustments in employment, further enhanced by a
new labor law. As a result of these supporting policies, Estonia’s CBA has proven resilient to
regional tensions: although local currency interest rates, CDS spreads and forward exchange
rates increased (Figure 4), Eesti Pank did not experience a significant loss of reserves.
Box 1. Implications of Fund Policy Advice
Relations between Estonia and the Fund remain excellent. While policy formulation and
implementation has been characterized by a high degree of ownership—a key factor in Estonia’s
economic successes—the authorities report that their decisions benefit considerably from Fund
advice. Indeed, policies have been generally consistent with Executive Board recommendations.
In 2007–08, however, large increases in current spending, which were contrary to Fund advice,
resulted in a structural loosening of the fiscal stance. But recent corrective action, including
expenditure reversals and increased indirect taxes (the latter despite initial reluctance) have been
in line with staff suggestions. Most of the key recommendations of the 2009 FSAP update have
been adopted, except implementation of a bank resolution framework.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
As the economy rebalances, a quick rebound to pre-crisis growth rates seems
unlikely. Growth in recent years was unsustainably bolstered by a disproportionate rise in
nontradable sectors (construction, financial intermediation, real estate), with negative
implications for competitiveness.

be constrained, with staff estimates suggesting a slow-down of potential growth to

Price levels are close to 80 percent of the EU
average (more than in most new member states), suggesting that a substantial degree of
nominal convergence has already taken place.
Staff and authorities agreed that regional instability represents the main short-term
risk. While Estonia has evaded financial contagion from neighboring Latvia to date, the
difficult situation there could pose challenges to economic sentiment and banks’ liquidity.
Such risks are mitigated by considerable liquidity buffers and the authorities’ determined
contingency planning efforts. Moreover, the high share of external liabilities with foreign
parents suggests that potential liquidity, and even solvency tensions can be resolved at a
group level and rollover risks are considerably smaller than implied by standard measures of
reserve coverage (Box 2). The authorities also pointed to their ambitions for speedy euro
adoption, which would not only resolve residual currency and liquidity risks, but also
differentiate Estonia from regional peers by confirming its strong policy record.

8

Box 2. How Meaningful is the Ratio of Estonia’s External Short-Term Debt to Reserves for
Vulnerability Analysis?
Estonia’s short-term external debt is large. At around 360 percent, Estonia’s ratio of short-term
external debt (at remaining maturity) to international reserves is among the highest in Europe,
which raises concerns about the potential emergence of liquidity problems. The short-term
external debt is mostly owed by banks and private nonfinancial corporations.
Nevertheless, the country has faced little roll-over problems so far. Why?


Composition of the debt. Most of the short-term external debt is owed to parent companies,
which reduces the likelihood that liquidity problems will be resolved in a disorderly manner.
Furthermore, a non-trivial part of the debt is in the form of trade credits, which are usually
backed by merchandise.



Buffers. Estonia’s private sector holds relatively large assets abroad. This is particularly
important for banks, which keep half of their reserve requirements in liquid external assets
(Estonia’s reserve requirements are set at 15 percent of banks’ total liabilities).



Policies. The Swedish authorities put in place liquidity facilities to support banks, including
those active in the Baltics. This has benefited Estonia since its financial sector is primarily
Swedish owned. Furthermore, the central banks of Sweden and Estonia concluded a
precautionary agreement to compliment the high liquidity buffers of Swedish banks.

These factors are likely to continue playing an important role in the future, which would
mitigate Estonia’s exposure to roll-over risks. Eventual euro adoption would further contribute to
ameliorate these risks.

By the same token, a postponement of euro adoption plans would likely lead to an increase of
borrowing spreads, which have recently declined on the back of reduced regional tensions
and growing anticipated supportive statements by public officials.

should steadily decline (Table 7) and be
robust to several shocks (Figure 6).
18.
The authorities viewed growth prospects more optimistically than staff, mainly
on account of confidence effects associated with euro adoption. This, they expected, will
boost foreign direct investment inflows, restart growth as early as 2010 and reduce debt
burdens over time. They viewed continued real convergence as inevitable, although they
acknowledged that domestic demand cannot play the same role as in the past and growth
rates may on average be lower than during the boom. The recovery would therefore be
primarily driven by net exports. Staff acknowledged positive confidence effects, but
cautioned that euro adoption prospects are already reflected in relatively low risk premia. In
any event, it would be no panacea as the authorities’ export-led growth strategy required a
reorientation of the economy, which will take time and effort, especially in light of the
uncertain global environment. In this context, the authorities agreed that protracted slow
growth in Nordic trading partners, especially Finland, represented a key risk to the outlook.
With a more optimistic view on growth prospects, they viewed the risks of protracted
deflation as minor.
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES
19.
The authorities’ immediate challenge is to ensure a smooth and speedy adoption
of the euro, while managing the fallout of the economic crisis. They appear broadly on
track in addressing these issues, although obstacles remain.


In the fiscal area, the authorities are focused on containing the public deficit
in 2009, 2010, and beyond to below 3 percent of GDP to qualify for euro adoption
as of January 2011.

10


In the financial sector, rising loan default rates and bank losses will pose supervisory
challenges. Regional contagion risks require continued vigilance.

20.
Medium-term challenges are still greater, requiring substantial adjustment by
both private and public sectors. While euro adoption would remove residual currency and
liquidity risks, it would not provide a substitute for needed internal adjustment.


The private sector needs to reallocate resources from past boom sectors to
export-oriented and profitable activities to attain balanced and sustainable growth.
While Estonia’s history of economic flexibility is encouraging, the task is hampered
by high levels of private indebtedness and current deflation, the reduced availability
of foreign capital and lower potential growth, both in Estonia and its trading partners.



The public sector will also need to adapt to an environment of lower growth (and
hence revenues), while rolling back the unsustainable expenditure increases of the last
two years and replacing temporary fiscal measures by permanent ones. This will
require substantial structural reforms. A convincing medium-term fiscal adjustment
strategy will be key to making euro adoption successful.
A. Consolidating Public Finances

21.
The authorities’ fiscal policy is firmly geared towards qualifying for euro
adoption. Meeting the Maastricht deficit criterion appears within reach as budget
implementation has held up remarkably well during the downturn—indeed, Estonia’s public
deficit and debt remain among the lowest in the EU. This can be attributed to a large and
timely fiscal effort, a favorable starting position, as well as strong budget institutions
(Box 3). While the deep recession may have suggested to let fiscal stabilizers work fully,
staff endorsed the authorities’ all-out fiscal push on the grounds that speedy euro adoption
would sharply reduce remaining vulnerabilities (see above) and merely move forward fiscal
adjustment measures that are necessary anyway. Further, the procyclical impact is mitigated
by the increased use of EU grants funding as well as the limited domestic demand impact of
some fiscal measures (such as dividends from Eesti Pank and state owned enterprises). Staff
argued, however, that when designing measures the short-term focus on qualifying for euro
adoption should not distract from the need to initiate structural reforms that achieve a
balanced cyclically adjusted fiscal position in the medium-term.

11
Box 3: What Explains Differences in Fiscal Performance Among the Baltic Countries?
Estonia’s fiscal performance in 2009 has been markedly better than in the other two Baltic
countries. This was achieved despite seemingly similar macroeconomic trends. Why?
Better fiscal starting position. The fiscal cash deficit in 2008 was about ½ percent of GDP lower
than in Lithuania and Latvia. Further, Estonia, where the recession started first, began already with
fiscal tightening in 2008 (by passing a contractionary supplementary budget and revising the 2009
budget late in the approval process), while Lithuania and Latvia continued expansionary fiscal
policy paths through late-year wage and pension increases with a large carryover into 2009.
Lower automatic effects. The fiscal deterioration in Estonia due to the crisis was about 9 percent of
GDP less than in Latvia and 5 percent less than in Lithuania. This is related to:

explained by cross-border shopping following the depreciation of the polish zloty. In contrast,
revenue collection in Estonia has held up very well, even above macroeconomic parameters,
suggesting recent improvements in tax administration.



The larger interest bill in Latvia and Lithuania is directly related to their higher fiscal deficits.

A fiscal adjustment effort fully offsetting the automatic effects mentioned above. Latvia’s
adjustment package was in fact larger than in Estonia (and Lithuania), but a significant share was
used to offset expansionary fiscal initiatives taken in 2009, including PIT cuts and pension
increases. Estonia’s smaller package was sufficient to compensate for the recession’s automatic
effects on the budget.

The 2009 deficit target of 3 percent of GDP is achievable, but risks remain. The
authorities responded to a widening fiscal gap as early as late 2008 by making revisions to
the 2009 budget. In 2009, they passed two supplementary budgets in February and June,
totaling 7½ percent of GDP in measures, 2/3 of them on the expenditure side and
1/3 reversing planned or enacted previous expansionary policies. An additional 1½ percent of
measures taken in September relies heavily on one-off dividends from state-owned
enterprises. Altogether, adjustment was achieved in equal parts through durable structural
reforms, potentially reversible measures once fiscal space emerges, and pure one-offs. Key
risks to the outcome are larger than anticipated deficits of local governments and the health
fund, lower than projected non-tax revenues, and a weaker macroeconomic framework.

For 2010 and beyond, staff advocated a redoubling of the already planned fiscal
effort. The draft 2010 budget contains further spending cuts and some increases of excise
taxes, in addition to a number of one-off measures such as property sales (about 3 percent of
GDP in total). Staff estimates, however, that the current plans fall short of the deficit target of
3 percent of GDP. In light of considerable macroeconomic and implementation risks (notably
in local governments and land sales), additional structurally sound measures of about
1 percent of GDP would provide an appropriate safety margin. The procyclical effect would
be compensated by the expected increase in absorption of EU funds. Staff argued that this
was all the more necessary as many temporary measures (such as the diversion of
contributions from the second to the first pension pillar) will expire in 2011 and
medium-term fiscal balances are set to deteriorate under unchanged policies. Early
implementation, if possible as part of the 2010 budget, would also provide further evidence
of Estonia’s medium-term commitment to fiscal sustainability—a key consideration when
assessing preparedness for the euro—and provide assurances should early euro adoption
plans falter. The authorities agreed that some additional adjustment may be needed, although
they would prefer to wait until the 2010 fiscal picture has become clearer. Following
discussion with staff during the mission, additional excise increases on energy, amounting to
about ¼ percent of GDP, were added to the 2010 budget.
24.
While scope remains for further expenditure rationalization, staff argued that
much of the adjustment effort will need to fall on the revenue side. The size of
government in proportion to the economy rose substantially in the last years of the boom,
mainly in pensions and health. While some of this spending surge has since been unwound,

the authorities agreed that there remains scope for better targeting child and family benefits,
and further rationalizing public services (health and administration); pension reform
represents an important longer-term goal. The key medium-term fiscal challenge lies,
however, in a likely erosion of the tax base as economic activity shifts toward more lightly
taxed activities such as exports and investment. With the need to protect social safety nets
limiting the scope for further spending cuts, staff laid out a range of options to strengthen tax
revenues (Box 4).

14
Box 4. Revenue-raising options in support of fiscal consolidation
Estonia has a revenue-productive and cost-effective tax system, characterized by an internationally
acclaimed low compliance burden (with some 90 percent of taxpayers filing electronically). Thus,
additional revenue sources focus on broadening tax bases while maintaining low marginal tax rates.
In addressing under-collection risks due to the anticipated lower wage bill share and subdued
private consumption expenditure, a useful short-term focus would be on eliminating tax privileges.
These could include the following:


VAT: Elimination of the reduced rate for hotel accommodation, journals and other printed
materials.



PIT: Phased elimination of the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments, and the
withdrawal of the additional child allowance and tax exemptions for annuity income and interest
earnings from credit institutions. Pension incomes also enjoy a special tax-free minimum annual
allowance, which could be re-examined.



CIT: Based on preliminary quantitative analysis, the current CIT regime may create some bias
towards debt financing as the law provides for unlimited and immediate deduction of debt
servicing costs. The introduction of thin capitalization rules can shore-up the corporate tax base.



Annual motor vehicle tax: In the EU and international context, the non-taxation of motor vehicles
appears anomalous, especially in view of environmental objectives.



Revenue administration: Tax gaps in VAT, fuel taxes, under-declared employment income are
reportedly increasing, tax arrears are rising and the administrative capacity to tackle transfer
pricing practices seems limited. Addressing these shortcomings will require increased budget
appropriations, but with potentially material payoffs.

Over the longer-term and in support of the tradable sector, the authorities could consider enhancing
the revenue potential of core taxes. These measures could also increase fiscal space to reduce the tax
wedge on labor.


PIT: Collection potential and progressivity could be enhanced by increasing the personal tax-free
allowance. Revenue-neutrality could be preserved through the elimination of multiple other
allowances or by introducing a second higher marginal tax rate on high-income earners.



CIT: The dividend distribution regime is attractive in an expanding economy with ample
reinvestment opportunities. Revenue productivity is low and the system encourages tax planning
with long tax deferrals locking in dividends. It also discourages equity finance and could increase
the attraction of transfer pricing practices. The authorities could revisit other corporate tax options
such as the re-introduction of a low-rate classical system; the advanced corporate tax whereby tax
on distributions is credited against the regular tax; or a split-rate system with a higher tax rate on
distributed earnings and a lower tax rate on retained profits.



Social Tax-VAT rebalancing: The statutory social tax burden on employers could be lowered by
increasing VAT: a one percentage point hike in the latter is almost equal to the revenue loss from
a one percentage point reduction in the former.



Converting the urban land tax to a property tax on improvement value: Estonia underutilizes this
revenue source compared to OECD member states. As an interim step, stagnating land tax
collections could be improved by more frequent land valuations, the imposition of higher centrally
legislated rates, and less exemptions and exclusions.

15
The authorities indicated that some elements of Estonia’s tax system could indeed be
adjusted to the post-boom environment. In doing so, they would place a priority on growth
over distributional considerations and therefore prefer to focus on indirect and environmental
taxes, in line with their aim to move the economy from consumption to export-led growth.
They were also open to measures to broaden the tax base, consistent with Estonia’s
traditionally simple tax system.
25.
While the authorities’ “balance or better” budget rule has served them well, a
new medium-term framework could limit the budget’s procyclicality. The economic
boom allowed for maintaining low government debt and the creation of sizable fiscal
reserves, but it did not prevent a surge in current spending and tax cuts. Staff therefore
advocated to shift revenues to less procyclical taxes, to reduce revenue earmarking and to
strengthen multi-year expenditure ceilings. Further, tighter control over local governments
finances and limiting contingent fiscal risks (including from local public-private
partnerships) should support medium-term fiscal consolidation. The authorities
acknowledged that such institutional arrangements, especially limits on local government
borrowing, could aid in achieving structural fiscal balance by 2012—a goal to which they
remained committed. Staff encouraged them to spell out their fiscal strategy in support of this
target.

Although the current account has turned into a surplus, staff expressed some
concerns about Estonia’s external competitiveness (Figure 5). Staff calculations suggest
that the real exchange rate remains overvalued, in spite of the large swing in the current
account (Box 5). The performance of Estonia’s exports has been broadly comparable to
regional peers in recent years, falling sharply during the crisis. On the other hand,
depreciations in some trading partners, which
temporarily put additional pressure on the real

Sweden. Their assessment is that Estonia’s
competitiveness remains adequate, particularly in light of the turnaround of the current
account and wage declines that are taking place throughout the economy.

16
Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment
Standard methods for exchange rate assessment give mixed signals. On the one hand, current-accountbased methods suggests that Estonia’s real exchange rate is slightly undervalued, which constitutes a sharp
reversal vis-à-vis the assessments those indicators suggested less than a year ago. On the other hand, methods
based on direct assessments of the real exchange rate still suggest that the real exchange rate is substantially
overvalued. More broadly, since the previous assessment the overvaluation range (now -3 to 21 percent) has
widened and the mid-point overvaluation has declined somewhat.

Staff, nevertheless, thinks that real exchange rate overvaluation remains an area of concern. The
expansion in domestic demand observed during the credit boom put pressure on the labor market, and
generated wage increases that ran ahead of productivity growth even in tradable sectors not immediately
affected by the domestic credit boom. These developments are being partially reversed as firms have seen
profitability decline, but the process is not complete and it is being achieved in part with a large decline in
employment. Staff believes that the outcome of the current-account-based methods needs to be interpreted
with caution given the global crisis in financial markets. Rather than an indication of undervaluation, the
reversal may be illustrating the magnitude of the sudden stop in international financial flows, and a
stronger-than-estimated cyclical decline in Estonia’s demand for imports (particularly after a period of
over-consumption and over-investment).

17
27.
The economy seems flexible enough to rebalance economic activity towards
export-oriented sectors. The export sector is diversified and dominated by small and
medium-size enterprises integrated in supply chains with Nordic-Baltic neighbors. Domestic
prices, wages, and productivity are adjusting fast, to what has essentially been a global shock.
In this context, the authorities pointed to the recently enacted labor law which gives more
flexibility to the already nimble labor market by reducing high lay-off costs. At the same
time, they agreed that the corresponding security component of higher unemployment
replacement rates should be introduced as soon as fiscal conditions allow. Targeting
EU-funded projects to the tradable sector as well as active labor market policies and research
investments are also aimed at boosting competitiveness.
28.
The authorities and staff agreed that maintaining the CBA and seeking euro
adoption at the current exchange rate parity remains the best exchange rate policy for
Estonia. The overvaluation of the exchange rate, albeit moderate, imposes a burden on
competitiveness and growth. Nevertheless, Estonia’s negligible level of public debt, the
substantial fiscal adjustment that has already taken place, and the implied delay in imminent
euro adoption (due to the violation of the Maastricht exchange rate stability criterion) would
advise against repegging at a more depreciated level. Moreover, the economy’s proven
flexibility suggests that the necessary adjustment can be achieved through factor price
adjustment alone. The authorities felt strongly that any change of the parity, which has been
in place for over 15 years, would constitute a breach of trust and have a highly adverse
impact on the economy. In this context they reiterated their commitment to adopt the euro at
the current exchange rate.

While not representing a liquidity
risk, the large stock of private sector debt,
accumulated in the boom years, is likely to
weigh on growth prospects.2 With
non-financial sector loans at over
170 percent of GDP, private sector
indebtedness is high in Estonia relative to its
wealth, income level and measures of
‘fundamental’ credit deepening (Figure 3).3
Much of long-term debt (almost all
denominated in euros and at floating interest
rates) is linked to the depressed real estate

sector. Nonetheless, financial difficulties of debtors seem to have lately eased somewhat,
thanks to low interest rates in the eurozone and banks’ willingness to reschedule a portion of
debt payments into the future. Staff cautioned, however, that this relief was likely to be
temporary as price and wage deflation and increases in euro zone interest rates could result in
a higher debt servicing burdens in the years ahead. International evidence suggests that high
debt levels often slow the recovery of consumption and investment. At the same time
problematic legacy loans, if unaddressed, constrain intermediaries to provide fresh lending.
Some reduction of debt levels may therefore be desirable to ensure that the convergence
process can resume apace. Anecdotal evidence from banks suggest that currently only few
loan restructurings entail debt relief in net present value terms.
30.
While the authorities accepted that deleveraging was necessary, they were more
sanguine than staff about its impact on future economic activity. In the near term,
consumption would be more subdued than in the past, but this would not stop the catch-up
with the old EU member states, which was underpinned by strong supply-side factors and
market fundamentals. They also pointed out that Estonia’s public debt levels are much lower
than in comparator countries in the EU and other emerging markets.
31.
Staff agreed with the authorities that heavy-handed policy intervention to
address the debt overhang must be avoided. Any interference in private contracts, such as
retroactive limits on debtors’ liabilities, would severely undermine Estonia’s tradition of the
rule of law. Imposing such provisions on new contracts would also likely constrain the
availability of credit. Staff pointed out, however, that appropriately designed credit
enforcement legislation could promote the rehabilitation of viable and speedy exit of
non-viable firms, and help good faith individual debtors make a fresh start. It therefore
welcomed the recently enacted Reorganization Act which should facilitate debt
restructurings. A preliminary assessment had, however, identified some room for optimizing
current legislation. For example, the Bankruptcy Act imposed a relatively long period of
inactivity (5–10 years) on individuals in personal bankruptcy. More generally, while existing
legislation maintained payment discipline, it did not provide adequate incentives for viable
firms and their creditors to pursue debt workouts. The authorities stressed that any legal
changes needed to be mindful of moral hazard issues and expressed their strong support for
out-of-court restructuring. Regarding the Reorganization Act, they acknowledged some
teething problems, attributed largely to insufficient experience and training among judges
and insolvency administrators. Going forward, staff suggested that appropriate changes in
corporate taxation could discourage excessive debt accumulation at the firm level (Box 4).

19
D. Improving Financial Sector Resilience
32.
The financial sector has proven resilient, owing to high capitalization and
earnings, and a strong supervisory framework. Some 95 percent of Estonia’s banking
system is Nordic-owned, dominated by two Swedish banks with 65 percent market share and
a number of branches. The system successfully handled the real world test of liquidity strains
in October 2008. As an additional insurance element, Eesti Pank established in
February 2009 a precautionary swap arrangement with the Swedish Riksbank to compliment
high liquidity buffers of Swedish banks operating in Estonia (an FSAP recommendation),

which has however not been utilized.
Contingency plans to deal with possible pressures on deposits have also been put in place.
More recently, the liquidity position of parent banks has benefited from the reopening of the
European wholesale funding market.
33.
The main near-term challenge is credit risk, where rising nonperforming loans
(NPLs) may test banks’ resilience. While there are signs that the growth of NPLs has
slowed recently, this could prove temporary given the expiration of debt repayment holidays,
limited near-term growth prospects, and rising unemployment coupled with ending of
comparatively short unemployment insurance periods. It is also uncertain if real estate prices
have bottomed. Currently, banks have significant buffers against rising NPLs, as they have
high capital adequacy levels, which is partly due to a tax regime that has favored the
retention of earnings. The authorities’ own stress tests as well as those performed on a group
level by the Swedish authorities show that the system is resilient to a substantial increase in
NPLs. Nevertheless, staff suggested that the authorities continue to closely monitor banks’
financial conditions, including their debt restructuring practices, to ensure that they are based
on sound economic principles. The authorities agreed that banks should continue to maintain
adequate provisions for expected losses, and parent banks should stand ready to inject further
capital if needed. Consideration will also be given to further developing macrofinancial risk
analysis.
34.
Staff urged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of measures to
strengthen the financial system. Priority should be given to pending legislation on a bank

20
resolution framework—a key recommendation of the last FSAP update. Complacency now
would delay or dilute the necessary reforms, risk future problems being less tractable and
thus undermine public confidence. The authorities pointed to recent progress in strengthening
cooperation on cross-border financial stability in the Nordic region, including through a
memorandum of understanding on crisis management and burden sharing principles.
Additionally, they recently took steps to strengthen the deposit insurance fund by tripling the
annual premium to 10 basis points.

Source: Estonian authorities and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth
rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

ANNEX: DEBT OF NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATES AND HOUSEHOLDS IN ESTONIA4
Based on a number of indicators, the balance sheets of Estonia’s non-financial private sector
appear stretched, with a relatively large stock of debt facing reduced incomes and assets tied
to a depressed real estate sector. This is likely to weigh on domestic consumption and
investment, and could be exacerbated by current deflationary trends and future expected
increases in interest rates in the euro-zone. Restructuring of bank credits have temporarily
eased repayment pressures and hence reduced financial stability risks, but at the cost of a
higher future debt burden.
A. Stylized facts
The build-up of private sector debt accelerated with EU accession in 2004.
Since 2005-06 domestic private sector bank credit ratios have exceeded estimates of credit

depth that are commensurate with Estonia’s macroeconomic fundamentals.5 Both the
corporate and household sector participated in this accumulation of liabilities. As a share
of GDP, they now exceed levels in other EU new member states.
Corporate sector gearing is substantial and has reached similar or higher levels than in
the euro area.6 Though Estonian firms are less indebted than the most highly indebted
pre-1998 Asian crisis countries, they are not out of line with that region as a whole.
Domestic credit makes up the bulk of corporate debt and given its long maturity and
sectoral composition suggests that it may concentrate potential debt overhang
problems. Domestic bank loans, together with other domestic debt, accounted for the bulk of
increased corporate borrowing over the past four years. While supplier credits are by nature
of short duration, domestic bank credit has relatively long maturities. This protects borrowers
from liquidity risks, but at a cost of a potential debt overhang problem. More than half of
domestic bank credit has a maturity exceeding five years. In addition, domestic more than
external credit was directed towards the real estate sector: lending to commercial real estate
accounted for around 30 percent of total corporate debt and domestic lending nearly
70 percent of all lending to the same sector. According to industry specialists, around half of
total office space entered the market in just two years (2007–09). Current vacancy rates of
around 10–50 percent, depending on quality and location, indicate the degree of excess
supply in office space, which will probably take several years to clear. Manufacturing, in
contrast, attracted less credit than its share in GDP, and half of all credit to this sector was
sourced from abroad (two thirds of which from affiliated enterprises). Generally speaking,
about 10 percent of total corporate debt is estimated to be owed to affiliated foreign

Households in Estonia borrowed mainly to
acquire real estate, whose significant depreciation over the past year has weakened
their balance sheet position. In relation to gross disposable income, household borrowing is
similar to the euro area. However, this is not matched by financial assets. Net financial assets
as a percent of income are slightly negative, compared with a large positive buffer of euro
area households. While the upgrading of a dilapidated post-Soviet housing stock is welfare
enhancing in the long run, the large correction in house prices has severely diminished
Estonian housing wealth in the short to medium-run: house prices have halved since peaking
in mid 2007 and according to the Financial Services Authority, one fourth of mortgage
exposures (15 percent of contracts) was in negative equity in 2009 Q2.

Ideally, the calculations should also take account of amortization payments for which data is however
unavailable.

While the data thus underestimate the debt service of indebted households in Estonia, it
should also be noted that mortgages are heavily concentrated among high-income
households. Unofficial market estimates put overall debt servicing costs at 26 percent of
indebted households’ net income.

B. Problems of Debt Overhang and Resulting Risks to the Estonia’s Recovery
There is a substantial empirical and theoretical literature linking debt overhang to
economic activity. Overleveraged households tend to cut back spending when hit by a shock
that changes their perception of permanent income and wealth.9 Investment can also suffer

Volume 8, No 3.

because shareholders with debt overhang are unwilling to take up new projects if the returns
benefit solely existing debt holders.10 Overindebtedness can also impair the lending capacity
of financial intermediaries. Leveraged investors often have to reduce debt when asset prices
fall, while a deteriorating credit portfolio undermines banks’ willingness and ability to lend.11
Finally, asset price busts are relatively costly for economic activity. Particularly, house prices
busts tend to be longer lasting and are associated with greater output loss than other asset
market corrections.12
Price and wage deflation could magnify the contractionary effects of Estonia’s high
private debt levels on domestic demand. In Hong Kong, a country with a fixed exchange
rate regime like Estonia, deflation and the legacy of a property boom weighted on domestic
demand and growth for many years in the aftermath of the Asian Crisis. Real investment has
not yet returned to levels in 1997. Sweden’s revival from the 1992 crisis, in contrast, was
relatively fast because export-oriented firms benefited from exchange rate devaluation and

strong external demand. Corporate deleveraging was quick and relatively short-lived. In
Estonia, despite the turnaround in net savings, private sector loans as a percent of GDP have
risen further in 2009 and are expected to remain broadly unchanged at that level in 2010.13
Estonian firms will have to rely on improvements in productivity and cost reductions to boost
incomes, which takes longer and for the latter depresses domestic demand. Regarding
households, in addition to the overshooting of mortgage and consumer borrowing relative to
expected permanent income, the short-term dynamics of deflation and rising interest rates are
likely to weigh on demand. The negative wealth effects of a depressed housing market,
however, are likely to be more muted in Estonia as only few households have mortgages and
those who were previously credit constrained should now benefit from improved housing
affordability.
The debt overhang may also be constraining credit supply, though the relative strength
of Swedish banking groups should help mitigate this risk. Yet, even though housing
affordability has improved substantially in 2009, the number of new mortgages has sharply
declined.14 Banks’ willingness and ability to

13

For the purpose of assessing the more medium-term debt burden the focus here is on loans of corporates and
households only. Short-term trade and suppliers’ credits are excluded from the calculations. The share of
savings assumed to be used for debt payments is equal to the net savings rate of the private sector plus non-debt
creating capital inflows as a proportion of the total savings rate (equal to around 40 percent). The interest rate
on the debt stock is assumed to be 4 percent.
14
These figures may however overstate the true number of new mortgages, as restructured mortgages may also
be counted as new ones.
15
Many banks for example are charging higher risk premia and lowered loan to value ratios and debt servicing
ratios. As a result, 60 percent of new loans in April 2009 had a loan servicing ratio below 30 percent, compared
with only 39 percent a year earlier.
16

crises: Mexico 1995-1998”, NBER Working Paper 7042.

slow deterioration in banks’ credit portfolio is to be expected.17 The strong capitalization of
the Nordic banking groups should however help mitigate the risk of a protracted credit
crunch. The three largest banking groups raised substantive amounts of capital during 2009,
resulting in tier 1 ratios above 10 percent, well in excess of regulatory minima.

The existing debt burden and negative housing equity also bear the risk of accelerating
defaults in a ‘disorderly’ manner. Recent research based on household surveys in the
United States indicates that households’ probability to default increases nonlinearly with
respect to foreclosures in the neighborhood and with respect to depressed housing values. In
both cases, the social stigma attached to default fades, accelerating debt failures.18 So far,
banks’ proactive rescheduling of both corporate and household debt has prevented an
eruption of foreclosures and also contained personal

See Berge, Oddvar and Godding Boye, Katrine Norges Bank (2007) “An analysis of banks’ problem loans”,
Economic Bulletin. Further expected tightening in global capital and liquidity regulation is also likely to
dampen the availability of credit. The projections of NPLs shown in the chart are not based on a long-term
cointegrating relationship which is difficult to identify given the numerous structural breaks. The chart is thus
merely illustrative to highlight the importance of lags between economic shocks and non-performing loans.

The currency of Estonia is the kroon. The kroon replaced the ruble on June 20, 1992. Since
that date, the Bank of Estonia has guaranteed the conversion of kroon bank notes, coins, and
reserve deposits of commercial banks at a fixed rate of exchange of EEK 15.6466 per euro
(and EEK 8 per deutsche mark until 31 December, 2001). The de facto exchange rate regime
is a “currency board arrangement,” which corresponds to the de jure classification. Estonia
has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for those imposed for
security reasons in accordance with the European Council Regulations set forth in the letter
from the Bank of Estonia dated July 9, 2008, and notified to the Executive Board in
accordance with Decision No. 144-(52/51) (EBD/08/73, July 9, 2008).

The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 2, 2009.

APPENDIX II. ESTONIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes. A
May 2001 data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was
generally good. The 2009 fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly
all of the requirements of the transparency code, and approaches best international practice in
some areas.
2.
Estonia is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Also, the
Bank of Estonia (BoE) and the Statistical Office of Estonia (SE) periodically update on their
websites a wide variety of data on the key variables for the monetary, fiscal, real, and
external sectors.
3.
As a member of the European Union and a candidate to join the European Monetary
Union, Estonia has markedly upgraded its statistics to comply with European Central Bank
(ECB) standards and regulations.
A. Monetary and Financial Statistics
4.
The BoE regularly reports monetary data with minimal delay. The data are also
published by the BoE on its website. The BoE balance-sheet data (base money and net
international reserves) are reported monthly, and are available on the eighth day of the
following month. Broad money and its components are available monthly from the BoE on
the thirteenth banking day from the beginning of the month. Interest rate updates on domestic
and foreign currency transactions are provided monthly on the seventeenth banking day of
the month.
5.
BoE has adopted the framework of the ECB for the compilation of monetary and
financial statistics, which is consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. STA and BoE have completed the data work on mapping Estonia’s monetary data
into the Standardized Report Forms which have been published in the June issue of the IFS
Supplement.
6.
Aggregate financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis.
Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis, and consolidated data on
commercial bank reserves, NFAs, and net open foreign exchange positions are available on
the eleventh banking day of the month. Commercial bank off-balance sheet data, leverage
and liquidity ratios, and short term external debt are available on the eighteenth banking day
of the month. Average capital adequacy ratios are available on the thirteenth banking day of
the month. Data on non-performing loans are available on the seventeenth banking day of the
month.
7.
Estonia participated in the Fund’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators and regularly provides a large number of FSIs.

5

B. Balance of Payments Statistics
8.
Quarterly balance of payments and IIP data are compiled by the BoE. Daily exchange
rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly import/export data are available
with a two month lag. Quarterly balance of payments and public and private external debt
data are available with a quarterly lag.
C. Government Finance Statistics
9.
All fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Historical data are
also available on SE’s website.


Monthly central government operations data are available with a lag of up to 25 days
after the end of the month. The government began reporting monthly data on a
consolidated government basis in January 1999 on its Estonian-language web site.
Quarterly data on foreign loans and guarantees by the central government are
published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The MoF is using one of its two allowed
SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central government operations
data, and have recently started to disseminate these data on the National Summary
Data Page.



Comprehensive annual data on central and local government operations (cash basis)
are reported in the GFS Yearbook. These data include a statement of operations and
the government balance sheet, including data on financial assets and liabilities, both
domestic and foreign. Quarterly data for general government, based on the
GFSM 2001 framework, are now regularly reported for inclusion in the International
Finance Statistics.
D. National Accounts

10.
Data on GDP (quarterly, by semester, and annually) are published by SE with a lag of
three months after the end of the quarter. Flash estimates of aggregate GDP are available two
months after the end of the reference period. The monthly CPI is available seven days after
the end of the reference period. Monthly PPI and export price indices are available four
weeks after the end of the reference period. Monthly indicators of retail trade, industrial
output, industrial sales, are reported approximately six weeks to two months after the end of
the reference period. Nominal monthly wage data and quarterly nominal and real wage data
are published with a two-month lag.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 8, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2009 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Estonia
On January 6, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2009 Article IV consultation with Estonia. 1
Background
Estonia’s economy contracted sharply in 2009, but a full-fledged crisis was avoided due to
existing buffers and a determined response by both the public and the private sectors.
Following a period of severe overheating, investment started to slow in mid-2007, along with a
bursting of the property bubble, when the country’s two main banks tightened lending
conditions. The collapse of global external financing and foreign trade in the aftermath of
Lehman Brothers collapse exacerbated the downturn. Output is expected to drop by some
15 percent in 2009 and unemployment to reach 16 percent by year end. Deflation and wage
declines are projected to persist through 2010 and the current account should remain in a small
surplus in the short term. Staff expects the economy to resume growth only in the middle
of 2010.
Sizable fiscal reserves accumulated during the boom years, a very low level of public debt, and
swift fiscal adjustment measures taken in 2008 and throughout 2009 helped the government
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

keep the fiscal deficit in check and avoid financing problems. At the same time, the increased
use of European Union (EU) structural funds provided some countercyclical fiscal stimulus. In
the financial sector, banks’ own capital and liquidity cushions—further boosted by relatively high
reserve requirements—and support from Nordic parents prevented liquidity problems in spite of
rising nonperforming loans. As a result of these supporting policies, Estonia’s currency board
arrangement has proven resilient to regional tensions
The credit-fueled boom has resulted in a relatively large non-financial private sector debt stock.
With declining incomes, unemployment increasing sharply, and asset prices depressed,
balance sheets of households and corporates are under strain, weighing on domestic demand.
Non-performing loans have increased to over 6 percent of total and some banks are reporting
losses.
A flexible labor market is also helping to restore external competitiveness lost during the boom
years. The recently enacted labor law adds further flexibility by reducing lay-off costs. EU-funds
are being increasingly targeted at the tradeable sector. Nevertheless, export performance
remains highly dependent on developments in Estonia’s Nordic trading partners.
The government aims at euro adoption in 2011. Assuming continued fiscal consolidation,
notably to boost revenues, Estonia could meet all Maastricht criteria in 2010. Joining the euro
zone would remove residual currency and liquidity risks, adding stability to the Estonian
economy.
Executive Board Assessment
They agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the Estonian authorities for
implementing far-reaching adjustment measures in 2008-09, which, together with prudent
policies during the boom years, had helped avert a full-fledged crisis. Despite a severe
recession, the fiscal deficit has been contained, banks’ liquidity buffers remain sizable, and
investors’ confidence has improved. A gradual recovery is expected as the economy rebalances
amidst regional financial stresses. Directors underlined that laying the foundations for more
balanced growth and ensuring a smooth euro adoption require substantial adjustments by both
the public and private sectors, including further consolidating public finances, addressing private
sector indebtedness, and enhancing external competitiveness.
Directors supported the authorities’ aim toward speedy adoption of the euro, noting its effects in
fostering stability and confidence. Nevertheless, they cautioned that euro adoption is not a
panacea, given the policy challenges that lie ahead. The export-led growth strategy requires a
fundamental reorientation of the economy. At the same time, deflation risks, rising
unemployment, and the need to maintain tight fiscal policy would likely weigh on domestic
demand, although the increased use of EU grant funding has provided some countercyclical
fiscal stimulus.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ determination to keep the 2010 fiscal deficit below the
Maastricht criterion, and their commitment to implement contingency measures as needed.

3
Given considerable macroeconomic and implementation risks, and to secure euro adoption in
2011 and enhance fiscal sustainability, most Directors recommended adopting additional
structural fiscal measures. While there is some room for further expenditure cuts, Directors
stressed the importance of protecting social safety nets. This calls for adjustment on the
revenue side, particularly broadening the tax base and eliminating poorly targeted exemptions.
A strengthened medium-term fiscal framework would help reduce the budget’s procyclicality and
achieve a structural balance by 2012.
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining the currency board arrangement. Noting
the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued, they
underscored the need for continued structural reforms to restore competitiveness. They agreed
that adopting the euro at the current exchange rate parity remains the appropriate option, given
the negligible level of public debt, the substantial fiscal adjustment that has already taken place,
and the increased flexibility in factor price adjustments, facilitated by a new labor law.
Directors observed that financial difficulties have eased somewhat, with low interest rates and
banks’ willingness to reschedule a portion of debt payments. On the other hand, price and wage
deflation and increases in euro zone interest rates would result in higher debt servicing burdens
in the period ahead. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the credit enforcement
and resolution frameworks. To facilitate case-by-case debt restructurings, it will be important to
enhance the flexibility of the bankruptcy and reorganization acts while paying due regard to
moral hazard concerns and strengthening implementation capacity. Directors also
recommended amending the corporate tax code to discourage excessive debt accumulation at
the firm level.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the financial sector, a strong supervisory framework, and a
precautionary liquidity arrangement between the Estonian and Swedish central banks. They
considered that deteriorating credit quality, borrowers’ high indebtedness, and a depressed
property market warrant continued supervisory vigilance and contingency planning, including
strengthened cooperation among regional supervisory authorities. Directors looked forward to
swift implementation of the recommendations of the FSAP update, particularly the enactment of
pending legislation on a bank resolution framework.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Republic of Estonia will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 6, 2010
1.
This statement reports on data releases and policy measures since the staff
report was issued. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent macroeconomic developments are largely in line with expectations. Third
quarter GDP declined by 3 percent (Q3/Q2, adjusted for seasonal and working day factors)
and by 15.6 percent compared to the same quarter of the previous year, with domestic
demand continuing to make a strong negative contribution to growth. While this is slightly
worse than projected in the staff report, staff’s annual growth forecast for 2009 remains
unchanged at -15 percent. The current account surplus was equivalent to 6.6 percent of third
quarter GDP. Labor’s share of value added fell slightly in the third quarter, the second
quarterly decrease, while nominal hourly labor costs dropped by 4.3 percent during this
period.
3.
As anticipated, inflation fell in November below the Maastricht reference value.
Consumer prices declined both on a monthly and yearly basis. Barring unforeseen
developments, the 12 months average inflation rate is expected to remain below the reference
value during the coming year.
4.
Financial market spreads have dropped sharply in recent weeks, reflecting both
a calming of general market conditions and anticipation of euro adoption. Three- and
six-months forward exchange rate spreads have narrowed to less than 1 percent, interbank
interest rate differentials of similar maturities to less than 2 percent, and CDS spreads on
5-year maturities to below 200 basis points.
5.
Higher than expected revenues in recent months have increased the chances of
containing the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in both 2009 and 2010, but risks remain.
Improved tax collection, especially for the state budget, have more than offset higher than
expected local government deficits, with the overall balance now estimated at ¼ percent of
GDP better than previously projected. This better performance may carry forward into 2010.
The budget passed on December 9 was in line with staff’s expectations, including additional
excises on energy introduced after the mission. In addition, the Tallinn municipal
government announced its intention to levy a small sales tax from mid-2010. Despite these
developments, the assessment in the staff paper remains valid: additional structural measures
should be adopted to provide an adequate safety margin for meeting the deficit target 2010
and to support achieving the targeted medium-term structural balance.
6.
The authorities have made further progress in implementing the
recommendations of the FSAP update. The Bank of Estonia’s Monetary Policy Committee
approved its contingency plans for liquidity purposes. In addition, a bill on a bank resolution
framework has been prepared, and will soon be presented to Parliament.

Statement by Mr. Jens Henriksson, Executive Director for the Republic of Estonia and
Mr. Adres Sutt, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 6, 2010
The authorities thank Mr. Rosenberg and his team for the frank and constructive discussions.
They broadly agree with staff’s assessment in most areas and as always consider thoroughly
the mission’s policy advice.
The Estonian economy has faced major challenges since the fall of 2008. The world
economic crisis has put at test Estonia’s economic resilience and its ability to adjust. The
sharp decline in world trade and significant drop in domestic demand translated into a record
output decline and sharp increase in unemployment. Despite the severity of the common
external shock and significant domestic adjustment needs, the Estonian economy has stood
up to the challenge and is now poised to a continued convergence.
Forceful policy response supported orderly adjustment
After the sharp and broad-based decline in activity, the economy has by now stabilized and
the imbalances have closed in an orderly way. While domestic demand remains weak, the
volume of goods and services exports has held up reasonably well. Estonia is part of the
same supply chain with Scandinavian countries and there is no evidence that Estonia's
position in this chain has deteriorated. However, like in several other countries, the inevitable
cost of the adjustment has been a sharp increase in unemployment.
The currency board arrangement served Estonia well throughout the crisis. Flexible labor and
product markets, full integration of banking and financial system with the European single
market, and a timely fiscal response supported the confidence in the exchange rate regime.
Credible policy implementation and improvement in global market conditions have reduced
Estonia-specific perceived risks. Most financial confidence and vulnerability indicators are
on a declining path, although not yet at their pre-crisis levels. Smooth functioning of the
currency board continues to enable the borrowers to fully benefit from the ECB’s monetary
easing. All in all, Estonia’s performance over the past year demonstrates yet again the ability
of the economy to function efficiently under the regime of a firmly fixed exchange rate.
During 2008-2009, the authorities’ fiscal policy was guided by a principle of balancing the
short-term stimulus needs with the long-term sustainability target, in line with the European
Union common policy framework. At the outset, the accumulated fiscal surpluses of previous
years, and the use of EU funds, enabled the government to moderately support the economy
while keeping the consolidated budget deficit within the 3 percent limit set by the EU
Stability and Growth Pact. During 2009 the size of budgetary consolidation reached
approximately 9 percent of GDP. The Estonian government maintained a net creditor
position vis-à-vis the rest of the world in 2009 with the general government gross debt at
6 percent of GDP and gross reserves amounting to around 12 percent of GDP by end-2009.

2
Financial stability and private sector indebtedness
Full integration with strong Scandinavian parent banks and the authorities’ earlier measures
to strengthen the banks’ capital and liquidity buffers proved to be key strengths during the
global financial crisis. Supervisory cooperation with home country authorities has been
effective and further steps were taken in developing the cross-border crisis management
framework, in line with FSAP recommendations.
The authorities estimate the NPLs to peak at 8 percent in 2010 and the cumulative writedowns to amount to around 5 percent of GDP. The loan-loss provisions equal now to about
two thirds of the NPL’s, implying a comfortable safety margin. Stress-tests run by the
Estonian authorities as well as by the Swedish authorities at the banking group level indicate
that banks could sustain losses well beyond the levels projected under both the baseline and
risk scenario. Banks’ ability to finance the economy remains strong. As the provisioning
needs decrease and the operational efficiency is robust, banks are expected to return to
profitability in 2010.
The authorities view the private sector debt level, at around 140 percent of GDP, which is
close to the Euro area average, broadly consistent with the fundamentals, especially when
taking into account the very low level of public debt. It also corresponds to the high level of
financial sector development, manifested by high penetration rates in corporate and retail
banking, wide use of financial products via multiple distribution channels and widespread
use of advanced e-services.
However, the authorities fully agree that the ongoing adjustment of private sector balance
sheets is called for after the rapid credit growth in previous years. This process is well
underway. Credit stock is expected to decline by more than 6 percent in 2009 and remain
broadly unchanged in 2010. As the capacity utilization is low, consumer confidence weak,
and the recovery expected to be slow, the authorities forecast the demand for new credit to be
modest. Hence, the credit growth will remain in check over the medium term.
Outlook and policy agenda for 2010-2011 and beyond
The overarching policy goal of the authorities is to support balanced recovery and sustained
convergence of output and income in the years ahead. Euro adoption is the key short term
economic policy priority.
The authorities expect the economy to grow at up to 1.5 percent in 2010 and between 3 to
5 percent in 2011, driven by productivity growth and external demand. Domestic demand
continues to be soft in the context of the post-boom restructuring and labor market
adjustment. Unexpected negative developments in the world economy are seen as the biggest
downside risk for the Estonian economy.
According to the preliminary estimates by the authorities, fiscal deficit for 2009 is expected
to be well in line with earlier projections and remains clearly below the level of 3 percent of
GDP. For 2010, the authorities are fully committed to keep the fiscal deficit firmly within the

3
3 percent limit. To that end, the authorities have implemented a range of revenue and
expenditure measures with the estimated 2010-impact of 3 percent of GDP, in addition to a
direct carry-over effect of 2009 deficit reduction steps on the 2010 budget. As noted by staff,
the authorities increased some excise taxes in December 2009, supporting the budgetary
revenues in 2010 by about 0.25 percent of GDP.
After further deficit reduction in 2011, the authorities aim at targeting the balanced budget
by 2012 and return to surpluses thereafter. The strength of the medium-term fiscal stance will
rely on further increasing the efficiency and flexibility of the fiscal framework. For that
purpose, the authorities intend inter alia to reduce spending rigidities while further
reinforcing expenditure controls and the role of strategic planning. On particular structural
reforms to increase medium and long term fiscal sustainability, the cabinet has already
decided to increase the retirement age to 65 years and to overhaul the system of special
pensions. In January the government will discuss the phasing-out of the mortgage interest tax
deductibility.
The authorities view domestic inflationary pressures subdued and the risk of deflation
minimal. The mild deflation observed over the last quarters reflects ongoing corporate
restructuring and inventory adjustment, decline in real wages and increase in unemployment
as well as nascent global inflationary pressures. The past boom had narrowed the gap
between the nominal price level in Estonia and the Euro area to a great extent. As wages are
expected to continue the decline and stabilize only in 2011, the authorities estimate the
inflation to stay low at below 2 percent level.
Maintaining an efficient labor market, a sustained increase in the number of employed and
reducing unemployment are the most important medium-term priorities. Against the
backdrop of recent steps that have further improved market flexibility, the authorities plan to
implement active labor market policies over the next years with the targeted funding of
1/4 percent of GDP and focus on vocational training and retraining. In 2010, the funding of
active labor market policies will grow 48 percent in comparison with the previous year.
These policy measures with continued real convergence and revived FDI inflows are among
key factors to reduce unemployment.
Geographical proximity, similar business culture and significant cost advantage, particularly
in the labor cost, make Estonia attractive for investors, notably from world-competitive
Scandinavian countries. Low government debt provides an opportunity to further develop
investor-friendly business climate. On balance, the authorities estimate Estonia’s medium
term growth potential to be in the order of 3-5 percent, maintaining the growth differential
with the Euro area of about 1-3 percentage points over the next years.
