STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 11, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth remains robust while inflation has fallen to very low levels. However,
declining commodity export prices and a substantial fiscal slippage have weakened the
external position. The authorities have already tightened fiscal policy, but more will be
needed to buttress macroeconomic stability and entrench fiscal sustainability.
International reserves have dipped but remain adequate. Price competitiveness appears
acceptable, but warrants continued vigilance. Good progress is being made to
strengthen the monetary policy framework, financial sector resilience, the fiscal
framework, and structural competitiveness, with TA from the Fund and other institutions.
Focus of the consultation. The consultation focused on policies to offset recent fiscal
slippages and safeguard the fixed exchange rate, ensure long-term fiscal sustainability,
strengthen financial sector resilience, and advance structural reforms to enhance
competitiveness and growth.
Policy recommendations:


Tighten fiscal policy to strengthen macroeconomic stability and ensure sustainability.

 Establish a fiscal framework appropriate for this resource-rich country. This should
comprise a fiscal anchor consistent with sustainability, medium-term expenditure
ceilings, a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and revenue diversification including a VAT.
 The monetary authorities should stand ready to contain demand pressures if fiscal
adjustment proves insufficient, and press ahead with efforts to establish indirect
instruments of monetary policy and strengthen the financial sector resilience.
 Structural reforms to improve the business environment and increase the efficiency
of public utilities will be needed to enhance competitiveness.
Past surveillance. During the 2012 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors
underscored the need for sound management of future mining revenues and building of
policy buffers, and welcomed the significant improvement in the fiscal position in 2011
as well as the authorities’ commitment to strengthening financial sector resilience and
implementing prudent policies going forward. While there has been good progress in
strengthening monetary and financial sector policies, and public financial management
is being improved, the fiscal stance has slipped significantly.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Macroeconomic performance has strengthened
markedly over the past decade, but there are challenges
ahead. The period prior to 2000 was marred by large swings
in GDP growth and episodes of near-hyperinflation, reflecting
political turmoil and policy missteps. Since 2000, however,
stronger policies and buoyant commodity prices, supported
by political stability, have improved macroeconomic
performance, prompting upgrades from major ratings
agencies. Public debt declined from 52 percent of GDP in
2000 to 20½ percent in 2011, supported by increased fiscal
prudence and the establishment of robust debt ceilings. At
this juncture, however, with gold prices declining after a long
upswing, the main challenges are to strengthen institutions
and adjust policies to avoid the onset of a boom-bust cycle.
2.
Growth remains robust while inflation has
declined considerably. Staff estimates that in 2012 GDP
grew 4¾ percent; broadly similar to 2011 and among the
highest in the region, supported by buoyant gold and oil
prices (Figures 1&2 and Table 1).1 Available data indicates
that wholesale and retail trade, construction, transport and
communications services, and financial services all expanded
significantly. However, while export volumes for gold grew
strongly, they were anemic for the other two main
commodities—oil and aluminum—contracting one and
14¾ percent, respectively. For oil, the weakness reflected
limited reserves (currently estimated to be depleted in
15 years absent new discoveries) and temporary equipment
failure. The aluminum export decline was largely due to
persistently low international prices. Following a surge after
the 20 percent devaluation in 2011, inflation has dropped
sharply, and stood at 2½ percent in May 2013, reflecting
improved credibility of the exchange rate peg to the US
dollar and the high import content of demand.2

3.
Bank credit is growing strongly, stimulating
demand (Figures 3&4).3 Credit growth to the private
sector has risen to a robust 17¼ percent (y/y) in May
2013, led by trade and housing construction, with
stable lending rates in both domestic and foreign
currency. Financial intermediation remains low,
however, with private sector credit at 26 percent of
GDP in 2012. Deposit and credit dollarization have
remained broadly stable, contained by recent
measures such as a significant increase in reserve
requirements on foreign currency deposits and a
requirement that all government transactions be
carried out in SRDs. Banking system return on equity
is above regional norms at almost 25 percent in 2012.
Bank capital, at 12.3 percent of risk weighted assets,
is above the regulatory 8 percent minimum, though
below the regional average. NPL ratios are somewhat
high, but declined from about 8 percent in 2011 to
7.1 percent currently. Banks have ample liquid assets
and excess reserves.
4.
However, the fiscal position has weakened
substantially (Figure 5 and Table 2). The overall
fiscal balance fell by 5 percentage points to a deficit
of 4 percent of GDP in 2012. While nontax revenues
and grants fell significantly, much of the deterioration
was due to a jump in spending. Subsidies and
transfers rose by 1½ percent of GDP, led by pension,
child care, and disability benefit increases. Official
data also indicate that goods and services
expenditure (G&S) rose by 2¼ percent of GDP, while
capital expenditure declined by 1¾ percent of GDP.
However, in addition to substantial added spending
on education and health, a significant part of the
increase in G&S appears to be mis-classified capital
expenditures, a result of shortcomings with the
classification of expenditures.4 The statistical

discrepancy (essentially unclassified expenditure) also increased by 1¼ percent of GDP. Fiscal
pressures intensified further in Q1 2013 as a result of wage hikes granted in December 2012 and a
pickup in capital spending. While measures have been taken since March to contain spending
(monthly spending by all Ministries has been capped at levels consistent with expected monthly
revenue, with a view to run at least a balanced budget over Q2–Q4 2013), the overall deficit for 2013
is likely to be around 3 percent of GDP.

dipped moderately but remain adequate at 4¼ months of imports, 900 percent of short term debt,

informal foreign exchange market. Price competitiveness currently appears broadly adequate,
though vigilance is warranted (Box1).

Unsterilized foreign exchange
intervention has had monetary implications.
Money supply growth has been heavily
influenced by central bank purchase and sale of
foreign exchange in the pursuit of its primary
objective of maintaining the stability of the
exchange rate, lacking tools for sterilization. This
has likely had a pro-cyclical effect on the
economy by increasing banking system liquidity
in times where buoyant commodity prices or
substantial capital inflows have led to the
accumulation of international reserves, thus
stimulating credit.

Box 1. Suriname: External Competitiveness
A range of indicators suggest that competitiveness is broadly adequate, though the REER and CGER results
suggest that continued vigilance is warranted:



The REER has appreciated significantly, offsetting much

of the competitiveness gains from the devaluation in January

2011. Since the devaluation the Surinamese dollar has

appreciated about 13 percent in real effective terms, reflecting in

7.
The near term outlook depends heavily on commodity prices. Suriname is highly
exposed to gold which accounts for two-thirds of exports and 13 percent of fiscal revenues. Fiscal
exposure to oil is also high, as it accounts for 29 percent of revenues. In line with the latest WEO
commodity price projections, staff’s baseline projection assumes moderate declines in gold and oil
prices over 2013–14. At the same time, however, the substantial fiscal impulse and robust credit
growth stimulated activity in the first half of 2013. Thus, on balance, GDP growth in 2013 is expected
to be similar to that of 2012, but will ease to about 4 percent in 2014. Without additional measures
the fiscal deficit is likely to widen in 2014 as commodity prices decline and activity eases. Given
current trends, and FDI inflows expected in the mineral sector that will boost imports, the current
account balance is expected to decline substantially. Inflation is likely to remain relatively low
assuming policy settings consistent with the continued stability of the exchange rate regime.

8.
Over the longer run growth is expected to increase moderately if commodity prices
hold up. Two large international gold mining projects are expected to start operations over
2015–17, boosting production. Plans for infrastructure investment, if well implemented, will also
support growth. On this basis, GDP growth is expected to rise to about 4¾ percent over the
medium term. Higher gold output and a new oil refinery to be opened in 2014 should also help
improve the fiscal position and current account balance as large projects complete. This favorable
outlook assumes that commodity prices stay somewhat buoyant over the medium term, and that
macroeconomic stability will be maintained by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. At the same
time, however, a substantially higher growth path for the non-mineral part of the economy is
unlikely without progress in the authorities’ efforts to upgrade the business environment, as
Suriname scores significantly worse than regional peers on many indicators of the business
environment (Figure 7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

9.

Risks to the outlook appear tilted downwards.



Downside risks to gold prices are elevated, with recent substantial declines signaling a souring
investor appetite.5 A sustained decline would have a major adverse impact on the
macroeconomic outlook. Staff estimates that the first round effect of a reduction in the gold
price from levels of $1670/ounce in 2012 to a (still relatively high) price of $1200/ounce, would
reduce the current account by 8½ percent of GDP and cut growth by ¼ percentage point.
Alongside, fiscal revenues would decline by ¼ percent of GDP in 2013 and 1 percent in 2014. At
$1000/ounce international reserves would decline substantially, and at still-lower prices the
adverse impact could increase in a nonlinear fashion as prices fall below production costs.



Also, plans to issue a sovereign bond to finance the purchase of minority stakes in the two new
gold mining ventures will increase the central government’s debt burden by over 8 percent of
GDP in 2013, reducing fiscal space. While the participation could increase future fiscal revenues,
it significantly increases fiscal exposure to gold price fluctuations.



Fiscal buffers appear limited, as accumulated savings from mineral revenues during the
commodity price upswing are small, and while public debt is low the scope for borrowing is
constrained by the lack of a government securities market and restrictions on central bank
financing of deficits. Thus, pro-cyclical fiscal tightening is likely if key commodity prices decline,
intensifying the associated downturn. Any offsetting monetary stimulus under such a scenario
would be constrained by the fixed exchange rate and limited monetary instruments.



Inward spillovers from adverse movements in the outlook for emerging markets or the euro
area, provided they do not dampen commodity prices, are unlikely to have a major impact on
Suriname’s economy. Growth has been robust in recent years despite global economic
weaknesses, because commodity prices have remained high. Nevertheless, there could be some
confidence effects if the medium term global outlook were to worsen substantially. Also, inward
remittances from the Netherlands could slow if euro area stress were to intensify sufficiently to
significantly affect the core.



The banking system has limited international links and low domestic levels of leverage and risk,
and has been resilient to international financial spillovers.



Upside risks on the other hand, particularly over a longer horizon, could originate from
unexpectedly strong global growth raising commodity prices, the discovery of large oil or
mining reserves, or structural reforms that promote growth in the non-commodity sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions centered on downside risks and weakening fiscal and external positions, with staff
recommending policy tightening to buttress macroeconomic stability. The authorities agreed, and
indicated that the brunt of adjustment would be borne by the fiscal sector, with monetary tightening if
fiscal measures prove insufficient to safeguard the external position. There was also agreement on the
need to establish an appropriate fiscal framework to insulate policy making from commodity price
movements and build buffers for effective countercyclical policy. Staff also commended the authorities’
efforts to upgrade the monetary policy framework and to strengthen financial sector resilience, and
urged additional steps to improve the business environment and strengthen competitiveness.

A. Buttressing Macro Stability and Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
10.
There was consensus that fiscal consolidation is warranted.6 Over the near term, the
authorities plan to implement sufficient fiscal measures to bolster external and overall macro
stability. They have already tightened spending controls on line Ministries, and there is ongoing
work to improve the efficiency of customs and tax administration and increase taxes on the informal
gold sector. Additional options for consolidation are being considered. In this regard, staff observed
that the required fiscal effort to ensure sustainability was substantial. While estimates of mineral
wealth are subject to considerable uncertainty (total deposits are unknown, and their value depends
on a volatile long run price outlook), staff estimates of the fiscal stance consistent with long run
sustainability, based on a conservative valuation of mineral wealth, indicate that targeting a nonmineral deficit of around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term would be desirable. This
corresponds to a headline surplus of about 2½ percent of GDP in 2018, and would require a rapid
reversal of the recent fiscal slippage and an overall medium term adjustment effort estimated at
about 10½ percent of GDP, as a projected medium term decline in mineral revenues of about 3½
percent of GDP would also need to be offset, and the headline improvement would be partly limited
by the deceleration of growth that would accompany the fiscal tightening. 7 The authorities noted
that achieving this target would be challenging.
11.
Given the substantial adjustment effort needed to ensure sustainability, the authorities
are considering both revenue and expenditure measures. Staff welcomed these efforts, noting
the need to accelerate steps to establish a VAT, and suggested that spending restraint should be a
major part of the adjustment effort. In this context, public wage moderation would strengthen
consolidation efforts and help restrain private sector wage growth. Moreover, the targeting of
subsidies should be improved: for example, electricity subsidies are estimated at 2 percent of GDP,
largely benefiting the higher-income urban population. Ongoing efforts to contain spending on

Substantial frontloading of adjustment is advisable in light of still-favorable cyclical conditions, the large adjustment
effort required, and the downside risks to the gold price outlook (see also Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper).

goods and services and prioritize capital projects should also be intensified. Staff also noted the
need to clarify a provision in one of the gold agreements which appears to guarantee government
provision of electricity at a fixed below-market price, potentially creating a large unbounded
subsidy, and encouraged the authorities to make subsidies explicit in the fiscal accounts.
12.
The authorities were receptive to staff’s recommendations to enhance the fiscal
framework in light of the considerable sensitivity to mineral sector developments. Indeed, they
indicated that they would consider options to embed some of the recommended elements of the
framework, such as the fiscal anchor and medium term expenditure ceilings, within a draft Public
Financial Management (PFM) law under preparation.


Fiscal anchor. There was agreement that a clear fiscal anchor, based on a target for the non
mineral balance (which has the advantages of transparency and relative robustness to political
pressures) is needed to entrench fiscal sustainability and guide the consumption of mineral
revenues. The fiscal target would need to be periodically reviewed and adjusted as estimates of
mineral wealth are updated, consistent with long run sustainability. Staff stressed that
significantly weaker budget targets could lead to large and disruptive fiscal adjustments if
commodity prices decline significantly.



Medium term expenditure ceilings. There was consensus that developing medium term
expenditure ceilings consistent with the fiscal anchor would complement efforts to contain
expenditure pressures, aid fiscal planning, and strengthen the top-down aspect of the budgeting
process. In this context, the authorities are already taking steps to upgrade public financial
management, including the newly established financial programming framework, the new ICT
system being put in place, and the draft PFM law. These efforts would provide an essential
underpinning for the successful implementation of expenditure ceilings and controls.



The sovereign wealth fund (SWF). The SWF, as the repository for savings out of mineral
revenues, would help to dampen the impact of commodity price fluctuations on fiscal policy and
build up fiscal buffers. Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to establish an SWF, while
observing that it would be preferable to fund the SWF more aggressively over the near term
than currently envisaged. The draft SWF law before parliament apportions mineral revenues to
the budget in any year by applying prescribed growth rates to previous-year levels (with higher
rates if commodity prices are expected to increase), with the remainder going to the SWF. As the
starting level of on-budget mineral revenue used for the calculations is that for 2013, this
implies that little savings would be diverted to the SWF over the near term, though more could
be saved once the large gold mining projects bear fruit. Moreover, proposed amendments
would divert some mineral revenues into a separate investment fund. Staff cautioned that these
amendments limit scope for needed savings and may also fragment the planning and oversight
of capital spending. Also, to safeguard government net worth, funding should ideally be
allocated to the SWF only in years where there is a fiscal surplus.



Revenue diversification. The authorities noted that a diversified revenue base would enhance
the resilience of the budget to commodity price shocks, observing that the relatively low ratio of
revenue to GDP indicates scope for significant increases in revenue from the non-mineral sector.
In this context, they welcomed staff’s offer of additional IMF technical assistance to support their
efforts to introduce the VAT.

13.
There was agreement that VAT
implementation would also support
efforts to improve structural
competitiveness. A revenue-increasing VAT
would create scope for the authorities’ plans
to lower rates on personal income and
corporate taxes, currently higher than
regional averages, thus enhancing the
business environment for both domestic
and foreign investors.

help improve health outcomes, labor
mobility, and old age security. While spending related to the health insurance scheme will partly be
offset by savings from current social welfare spending on health care, the pension scheme will be
established on a PAYG basis.8 Staff observed that these are laudable social objectives, but could add
significantly to fiscal spending pressures. The authorities agreed, and indicated that their objective is
to introduce the reforms in a budget-neutral fashion, though some overruns could not be ruled out.
In any case, they would be vigilant to ensure that the scheme is affordable over the near and long
term, and any additional expenditure implications for the budget would be offset by measures
elsewhere to safeguard fiscal health. Staff suggested that possible measures to create space for the
scheme could include the streamlining of electricity subsidies and a revenue-increasing VAT.
15.
Public debt increases significantly in 2013, but appears sustainable over the medium
term (Appendix 1). The jump of 15 percentage points of GDP in 2013 is largely due to a sovereign
bond worth over 12 percent of GDP to be issued for two purposes, namely (i) the purchase of equity
stakes in the new gold mining projects (8 percent of GDP), and (ii) for on-lending to the state oil
8

Details of the health care scheme are being finalized, but it is envisaged that financing of health care premiums will
involve employer and employee contributions for employed persons, with government paying premiums for the
other members of the population. Health insurance coverage would be provided by the private sector.

company for its investment plans.9 Staff baseline projections indicate that debt rises to a peak of
40¾ percent of GDP in 2016, but declines thereafter as fiscal deficits fall. These projections are
robust to growth and interest rate shocks, but more sensitive to shocks to the exchange rate or
contingent liabilities—though debt remains manageable even with the latter shocks. However, gross
financing needs are projected to increase significantly over the medium term, and there is a risk of a
sharp increase when the bond comes due, indicating growing liquidity risks. Given the fiscal risks
and resource dependence, entrenching long run sustainability will require strong consolidation
efforts.
16.
Staff urged the authorities to implement reforms to put the main public electricity and
water companies on a sound financial footing. The current complex and nontransparent web of
subsidization, large arrears, and untargeted below-cost tariffs has led to perennial loss-making in
the two companies, sapped morale, and hampered investment in these critical sectors. Staff
observed that with the authorities contemplating substantial new investments in these sectors, this
would be an opportune time to modernize their regulatory frameworks and tariff structures to
ensure the efficient allocation of resources. The authorities agreed in principle but noted that
adjusting tariff structures would be politically sensitive, and required delicate handling.

B. Strengthening the External Position and Financial Sector Resilience
17.
There was consensus that moderating credit growth, together with fiscal tightening,
would help contain demand, thus safeguarding the external position. Significant demand
containment is needed to help offset the substantial adverse impact of commodity price declines on
the current account balance. The authorities agreed to consider the use of available monetary policy
instruments, including reserve requirements, sales of treasury bills, and intervention in the foreign
exchange market if fiscal adjustment proves inadequate to contain the weakening of the external
position.
18.
Welcome steps have been taken to establish indirect instruments of monetary policy.
Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities are planning to commence regular Treasury
bill auctions in early 2014 as the main vehicle for the development of an interbank money market
and a government securities market. The authorities agreed that these efforts should be
complemented by the other elements needed for open market operations (OMO), including a
liquidity monitoring/management framework and standing facilities. These additional tools would
improve the effectiveness of the monetary authorities in maintaining macroeconomic stability.
19.
The fixed exchange rate regime is broadly appropriate. Following the devaluation in
2011, the authorities established a fixed regime with buying and selling rates of SRD 3.25 and
SRD 3.35 to the US dollar, respectively, for official transactions. Commercial banks and cambios are
9

It is envisaged that the sovereign bond would be a 10-year bond, with the bulk of principal repayment at the end of
the term of the bond. However, the final terms would reflect market conditions and negotiations at the time the
bond is issued.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

legally allowed to quote buying and selling rates anywhere within this 3 percent band in line with
demand and supply, but not outside the band. There was agreement that given the relatively thin
foreign exchange market and substantial capital flows, a fully flexible exchange rate would likely be
subject to considerable volatility, with corresponding sizable shocks to competitiveness and
confidence that would be difficult to manage given institutional capacity constraints. Thus, a regime
that prevents such volatility in exchange rates would serve the country well, but only if supported by
an appropriate macro policy stance.
20.
However, Suriname maintains multiple currency practices (MCPs). The exchange rate
regime gives rise to MCPs arising from (i) the existing spread of more than 2 percent between the
buying and the selling rates in the official market for the government’s foreign exchange
transactions; and (ii) the potential spread of more than 2 percent between the official rates for
government transactions and those in the commercial markets. Staff encouraged the authorities to
phase out the MCPs, bringing the exchange rate regime in line with international norms. Options in
this regard could include (i) reducing the spread between the official buying and selling rate to
2 percent or less, or (ii) using the midpoint of the commercial buying and selling rates for official
transactions. The authorities considered that given public sensitivity to any news about the regime,
changes could potentially be disruptive and would have to be done at a politically opportune time.
21.
The financial sector appears relatively sound, but rapid credit growth particularly to
the housing sector, and relatively high NPLs, merit increased supervisory vigilance
(Tables 4&5). Banks dominate the financial system, holding about 77 percent of financial sector
assets, with pension funds and insurance companies holding 14 percent and 8¾ percent of financial
sector assets, respectively. One of the fastest growing segments of financial sector credit is to the
housing sector, with banks and pension funds substantially invested in mortgages. Average growth
of bank credit for housing construction has been 28 percent over the past six years, and mortgages
make up around 70 percent of pension fund assets. Insurance companies also reportedly have
significant exposures to mortgages. Although mortgage lending standards appear prudent and
loan-to-value ratios are reportedly moderate at up to 60 percent, rapid growth in mortgage lending
has often preceded banking sector turmoil internationally, and should be carefully monitored. Also,
rapid credit growth tends to bias NPL ratios downward, potentially blurring the assessment of credit
quality and suggesting need for vigilance.
22.
In this context, the authorities have made significant progress to strengthen financial
sector supervision. A new banking law was passed in 2011, followed by increased staffing and
training in the central bank’s banking supervision department. New banking regulations, including
stronger capital, loan classification, and provisioning standards (incorporating a more rigorous
treatment of real estate collateral), are to be implemented before the end of 2013. Other regulatory
improvements being finalized include those on corporate governance, risk management, internal
audit, and consolidated supervision. On-site banking supervision has also been strengthened. An
insurance law is being developed—there is currently no insurance law, and insurance supervision is
based on general financial sector legislation. A credit bureau and a deposit insurance scheme are
also under development. The authorities are also considering options to restructure three small
state-owned commercial banks and one small nonbank financial institution, and substantially reduce

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SURINAME

government participation in a large majority-state-owned bank. An FSAP (the first for Suriname) is
expected in 2014.
23.
There was agreement that efforts to reduce dollarization should continue. While
observing that dollarization is likely to decline gradually as confidence in macro policy grows, staff
suggested that additional measures, such as higher provisioning or risk-weighting on foreign
currency lending and limits on net open positions in foreign currency, should be deployed,
particularly as banks’ interest margins on foreign currency lending are significantly higher than those
in SRDs.
24.
Progress in improving the AML/CFT regime is ongoing. The most recent follow-up report
to the 2009 assessment by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) indicates
improvements, including recent legislation covering the identification requirements for service
providers, and the reporting of unusual transactions. However, some gaps remain, including in areas
related to the risks of smuggling of precious minerals and combating corruption. The authorities are
considering the next steps forward and are also improving AML/CFT supervision of financial
institutions to strengthen the implementation of the requirements already in place.

C. Enhancing Structural Competitiveness
25.
A more supportive business environment would enhance growth prospects. While
Suriname scores well on some indicators such as airport capacity and import costs, the latest World
Bank Doing Business Indicators suggest room for improvement in several areas such as starting a
business, enforcing contracts, protecting investors, and registering property.10 The authorities have
already made important steps in easing the impediments to starting a business, and staff
encouraged them to continue in this direction. Staff also noted that labor market flexibility could be
improved by some relaxation of the relatively stringent employment protection regulations, and
stressed that plans for a minimum wage should not compromise job creation for the lower skilled.11

D. Other
26.
The authorities continue their efforts to strengthen macroeconomic data. While there
has been much improvement in data quality, and the data are broadly adequate for surveillance,
there are still significant quality and coverage gaps in most macroeconomic data, sometimes
complicating macroeconomic diagnosis. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to upgrade the
statistics law including by strengthening reporting requirements for surveyed institutions.
10

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey, care should be exercised when
interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small
number of informants which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power (see
www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness).

11

Chapter V of the accompanying Selected Issues Paper discusses the characteristics of Suriname’s labor market.
According to the 2012–2013 World Competitiveness Report, Suriname is ranked 137 out of 144 countries in hiring
and firing practices.

SURINAME

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Growth performance has been strong, but the outlook is heavily dominated by
commodity price movements. Political stability and stronger policies have provided essential
underpinnings for growth, but a key driver has been the very strong increase in key commodity
prices over the past decade, particularly gold. This is evident also from the large role of gold in
exports and FDI inflows, and the heavy fiscal dependence on mineral-related revenues. With gold
and oil prices far above historical norms, and given the recent souring of investor appetite for gold,
downside risks to the outlook predominate, requiring policy adjustments to build up buffers in case
an adverse scenario materializes.
28.
The large fiscal slippage threatens macroeconomic stability, and staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to consolidation. Given the high import content of demand, the large
fiscal impulse has stimulated imports rather than inflation, helping to weaken the current account
balance and international reserves. Targeting a significant medium term fiscal surplus of about
2½ percent of GDP would be appropriate to bolster the external position, entrench sustainability,
and build up fiscal buffers for countercyclical policy and intergenerational saving. Commendably, the
authorities have already taken steps to begin to reverse the slippage and are committed to doing
more to buttress macroeconomic stability.
29.
In addition to planned revenue measures, successful fiscal consolidation will require
substantial and politically difficult streamlining of expenditure. While the relatively low ratio of
revenue to GDP indicates scope for significant increases in fiscal revenues, the bulk of efforts should
be focused on restraining the spending pressures that have been a key driver of the fiscal slippage.
Efforts in this area should include public wage moderation, improved targeting of subsidies,
streamlining of spending on goods and services, and prioritization of capital projects. Also, plans to
set up a nation-wide social safety net, while laudable, should be implemented in a fiscally
sustainable fashion. These measures are likely to be politically painful, but are necessary for a
durable return to a sustainable fiscal path.
30.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ intentions to strengthen the fiscal framework in light
of the considerable sensitivity to mineral sector developments. Ongoing work on drafting a new
PFM law, the new financial programming framework, and the new ICT system being installed will
provide a sound basis for establishing a fiscal anchor consistent with sustainability and medium term
expenditure ceilings. In addition, staff commends the authorities for their efforts to establish a SWF,
and cautions against any amendments that limit scope for savings or fragment policymaking. Efforts
to implement a VAT should also be intensified. Ongoing steps to strengthen revenue from customs
and improve tax administration are welcome. Staff also encourages the authorities to modernize the
regulatory frameworks and tariff structures in the electricity and water sectors.
31.
Plans to purchase minority stakes in two new gold mining ventures financed by a
sovereign bond issue increase fiscal risks, though future fiscal revenues would rise if gold
prices stay buoyant. Fiscal exposure to gold price fluctuations would increase considerably (the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SURINAME

share of gold in total revenues would rise significantly, and the value of the purchased asset would
also fluctuate with the gold price), while also reducing fiscal space given the size of the bond issue.
There are also risks of sharp increase in gross financing needs beyond the medium term when the
bond comes due. The portion of the sovereign debt issue that is onlent to the state oil company
does not appear to carry significant risk as the project appears sound, and the oil company is very
profitable and has been run in an arms-length fashion by professional managers.
32.
Monetary tightening should be deployed to safeguard the external position if fiscal
measures prove inadequate to contain demand pressures. In this context, the authorities should
consider the use of available monetary policy instruments, including reserve requirements, sales of
treasury bills, and intervention in the foreign exchange market to achieve this objective if needed.
Staff encourages the authorities to press ahead with plans to establish open market operations, thus
providing additional monetary policy tools to help maintain macroeconomic stability.
33.
The fixed exchange rate regime is broadly appropriate. Given the relatively thin foreign
exchange market and substantial capital flows, a fully flexible exchange rate would likely be subject
to considerable volatility, with corresponding sizable shocks to competitiveness and confidence that
would be difficult to manage given institutional capacity constraints. Thus, limiting exchange rate
volatility would serve the country well, but only if supported by an appropriate macro policy stance.
34.
Article VIII issues: Suriname is an Article VIII member and maintains two MCPs. Staff
does not recommend the approval of these MCPs as there is no clear timetable for their removal.
35.
The progress being made to upgrade financial sector resilience is welcome.
Commendably, a major overhaul of the banking sector legislative and regulatory framework is
nearing completion, while similar efforts are being contemplated in the insurance sector. Progress in
strengthening the AML/CFT regime is ongoing. A credit bureau and a deposit insurance scheme are
also being contemplated. Plans to substantially reduce state ownership in the banking sector are
laudable, and should be carefully designed and managed to ensure a smooth transition. In addition,
efforts to reduce dollarization should continue.
36.
Structural competitiveness should be reinforced. Efforts should focus on areas such as
starting a business, enforcing contracts, protecting investors, and registering property. Importantly,
the authorities have already made important steps in easing the impediments to starting a business,
and are committed to continuing in this direction. Also, labor market flexibility could be improved
by some relaxation of employment protection regulations, and plans for a minimum wage should
not compromise job creation for lower skilled persons.
37.
While there has been much improvement in macroeconomic data there are still
significant gaps, sometimes complicating diagnosis. Plans to upgrade the statistics law and
strengthen reporting requirements are welcome.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be conducted
on the standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Appendix I. Illustrative Debt Sustainability Analysis
A. Government Finances
Suriname’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase under the baseline debt scenario to
slightly above 40 percent of GDP, but begin to decline thereafter. Plans to issue a sovereign bond
to finance the purchase of minority stakes in two new gold mining ventures and the construction
of a refinery by the state-owned oil company (Staatsolie) will increase government debt by over
12 percent of GDP in 2013. It is assumed in staff projections that the bond will carry an interest
rate of 6.5 percent, similar to current rates for similarly rated sovereigns. About a third of the
proceeds of the planned bond issue will be passed on to Staatsolie which appears to be in a
comfortable position to service this debt.
The fiscal balance is assumed to remain in deficit through the medium-term. On the revenues
side, royalties and taxes from the gold sector are expected to decline as a result of a weaker gold
price. Rising gold production from 2015 onwards will however reverse this trend. Staatsolie’s
contribution to the budget is assumed to increase moderately over time as production is
expanded and construction of the refinery is completed. From 2014 onwards the introduction of
a revenue-enhancing VAT system is projected to increase indirect tax collection. On the
expenditure side, spending controls implemented by the government in recent months are
expected to remain in place to help reduce expenditure as a percent of GDP over time.
These projections are robust to growth and interest rate shocks, but more sensitive to shocks to
the exchange rate or contingent liabilities—though debt remains manageable even with the
latter shocks.
Public debt levels appear sustainable over the medium-term, but risks to the outlook have
increased. While the participation in new gold mining projects could increase future fiscal
revenues, it significantly increases fiscal exposure to gold price fluctuations. If gold prices were to
revert to historical averages the bond-financed equity stakes in mining projects could
substantially decline in value. Efforts to strengthen revenue collection and contain spending need
to continue to stabilize public debt. Rising gross financing needs over the medium term, and the
risk of a significant jump when the bond comes due point to growing liquidity risks.

B. External Sector
Plans to issue a sovereign bond will substantially increase Suriname’s external debt burden to
33½ percent of GDP. The bond is expected to mature in 10 years and to finance investments in
the gold and oil sectors. Other external borrowing from multilateral sources to support reform
and infrastructure projects is projected to decline over the medium-term. External debt is
expected to fall to 26½ percent of GDP at the end of the projection period.
Medium-term projections for the balance of payments depend crucially on the outlook for gold
prices. Gold’s share in exports is projected to increase from ⅔ to ¾ at the end of the projection

period as new gold mining projects are completed. With the current outlook for gold prices, the
current account is expected to revert to a surplus in 2017 following the completion of large goldrelated FDI projects and the completion of Staatsolie’s refinery. The refinery will substitute for a
significant portion of oil imports.
Suriname’s external sector debt ratio is robust to interest and growth shocks, but sensitive to
large and permanent current account and exchange rate shocks. The primary source of a large
current account shock would be falling gold prices. An exchange rate depreciation would also
raise external debt levels substantially. However, the additional risk from the planned bond
issuance stemming from a devaluation alone is limited, because the funds will finance projects
related to gold and oil, both of which generate U.S. dollar revenue streams.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities
Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced the Surinamese guilder in
January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD 1. The de jure exchange rate
arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree (Resolution
and Besluit of 1994), the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign
exchange. With the amendment in 2000 ("Wijzigingen Resolutie") the Central Bank of Suriname was
mandated to establish, at its discretion, maxima and minima rates. The exchange rate of the
Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20,
2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20 percent, to SRD 3.3 per U.S. dollar and set a
band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions
may take place. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized
arrangement. Suriname is an Article VIII member and maintains two multiple currency practices
(MCPs) arising from the spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and the selling rates in
the official market for government transactions and also from the possible spread of more than 2
percent between these official rates for government transactions and those in the commercial
markets that can take place within the established band.
Last Article IV consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 7, 2012 (IMF
Country Report No. 12/281). Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

In July 2004, the IMF officially announced Suriname’s formal participation in the General Data

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of April 30, 2013)
In 1980 Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the country’s largest
multilateral lender. As of May 2013, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IADB stood at US$230
million. The disbursement rate increased since 2011 due to improved absorptive capacity for
investments.
Through the IADB Country Strategy with Suriname 2011-2015, the government of Suriname
expanded its partnership for development. The strategy calls for a notable increase in lending, from
US$103 million (in the previous Country Strategy period, 2007-2010), to about US$300 million. The
main focus is on modernizing public governance structures, diversifying the economy, and
expanding social benefits. The priority areas include: (i) agriculture, (ii) energy, (iii) education,
(iv) financial sector development, (v) public investment management, (vi) social protection, and
(vii) transport. Dialogue will continue on other areas in need of strengthening: water and sanitation,
disaster risk management, tax administration, health, private sector development, and natural
resources and environmental management with a view to possible additional lending support. By
December 2012, IADB had already approved more than 50 percent of the programmed resources in
the country strategy.
The active investment loan portfolio, of which 40 percent is disbursed, consists of eight sovereign
guaranteed loans that total US$155 million. The median age of the loans in the entire portfolio is
1.8 years. The 2013 pipeline will support reforms in agriculture while collaboration in the
energy and financial sectors continues. The 2013 pipeline includes one investment loan for
US$20 million, and three programmatic PBLs for up to US$125 million.

The technical cooperation portfolio for Suriname comprises 14 operations (US$7.6 million), of which
36 percent has been disbursed. The IADB also approved an investment grant, funded by the Global
Environment Facility, for US$4.4 million during the first quarter of 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 15, 2013)
The World Bank Group recently re-engaged with the Surinamese authorities after a 30 years hiatus.
In September 2011, Suriname became the 183rd member of the IFC and 14th in the Latin America
Region. In October 2012 the Board of Directors also endorsed the Interim Strategy Report (ISN)
which will guide engagement in the country over the next two years. It has been agreed with the
government that initial World Bank support would focus primarily on providing knowledge services
for institutional strengthening and capacity building for the Government and the Central Bank. IFC
support focuses on advisory services for Public and Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Technical Assistance
Tariff Reform Impact Simulation Tool (TRIST): TRIST is an interactive Excel based tool designed
to simulate the short term impacts of tariff reform and to indicate which sectors of the domestic
economy are likely to be most affected. The model is has been developed and will be used, among
other things, as a tool in trade negotiations. Training and handover was done in May 2013.
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes – Accounting and Auditing (ROSC): Based
on findings of the ROSC completed in 2012, a $300,000 grant for the Development of Accounting
and Auditing Standards and Practices has been secured. The recipient of the grant is the Ministry of
Finance and the Central Bank of Suriname.
Other Activities
The Government and the Bank have been in discussions on widening the support base particularly in
the following two areas:
1) Development of a National Broadband Strategy: The objective of the Broadband Strategy is to
promote widespread access to high-speed broadband services throughout the country
(including the hinterland) as a significant driver for poverty alleviation, economic growth and job
creation. The strategy will also serve as a critical input to Government’s broader national
objective of building a knowledge-based economy.
2) Reform of the State-Owned Entities (SOEs) Sector in Suriname: The objective of the reform is to:
strengthen the public financial management capacity, strengthen corporate governance
practices and assist with the development of a SOE reform strategy. The reform of the sector is
intended to improve reporting, transparency service delivery through greater efficiency.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund has shortcomings, reflecting capacity constraints, but they
are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. Although timeliness remains an issue with some
reports, the authorities are making an effort to improve the quality and dissemination of
economic data, notably through the central bank’s website. In March 2012, the authorities
published newly rebased national accounts data.
National accounts: The lack of timely, reliable source data on price indices for tourism services,
transportation and communication adversely affect production-based GDP estimates.
Component weights of sub-indices within the CPI are not available.
The expenditure breakdown of national accounts is still limited, and there is also no
reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments, which hampers an
accurate evaluation of the savings and investment balance.
With extensive support from CARTAC, the General Bureau of Statistics concluded and released
its revision of the National Accounts Statistics, with 2007 as the new base year. This revision
improves substantially the coverage and quality of GDP data by sectors of production. Work is
ongoing on GDP estimates from the expenditure side.
Government finance statistics: Public finance statistics are limited to those for the central
government. Estimates for revenue and expenditure components often differ among the
Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Suriname, and the Central Paymaster data, increasing
the uncertainty about the true fiscal position. The improvement of the central bank data reports
on its website, including early estimates of the fiscal position on a monthly basis with 2–3
months lag, is a welcome development.
The institutional coverage of fiscal statistics needs to be broadened to the nonfinancial public
sector so as to better assess the fiscal risks associated with total public sector debt. The actual
number of public enterprises remains difficult to determine, and most of these enterprises do
not produce accounts on a timely basis. In 2012, the authorities commissioned the audit of the
five main nonfinancial public enterprises, which is expected to provide the basis for widening
the scope of fiscal analysis and policy action. Available public debt statistics cover only debt
contracted or guaranteed by the central government.

Monetary and financial statistics: The timeliness of monetary and financial statistics has been
improved to two weeks after the closing date for the central bank accounts and two months for
the accounts of other depository corporations. The quality of monetary and financial statistics
continues to improve, and the reporting to the IMF’s Statistics Department is regular.
The central bank has started to publish regularly monetary and financial data on its external
website.
External sector: The authorities are working with an external expert to improve the coverage
and accuracy of the balance of payments data. They have recently revised and significantly
improved the coverage of external data for 2010 and 2011. However, there still remain
significant shortcomings in the area of balance of payments statistics, particularly for earlier
years, such as weak data collection, under-coverage, misclassification, and deviations from the
balance of payments manuals. IT difficulties in customs are an obstacle for the accuracy of trade
data. Going forward, efforts should continue to enhance compilation of data on services and
private capital in- and outflows. Estimates of the components of the financial account
(especially private external debt) also need to be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Suriname participates in the GDDS.
III. Reporting to STA
Suriname currently does not report fiscal statistics for inclusion in either International Financial
Statistics, or the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Suriname
September 30, 2013
1.
This statement summarizes developments in Suriname since the issuance of the
staff report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
In line with the staff’s recommendations, monetary and fiscal policies are being
tightened.


The central bank tightened monetary policy on September 16. It raised reserve
requirements on both domestic and foreign currency deposits by 5 percentage points
to 30 percent and 50 percent, respectively, as part of efforts to constrain credit growth
and help strengthen macroeconomic stability.



Alongside, the authorities announced their intention to tighten fiscal policy. The
authorities have drawn up a menu of options for consolidation, and are finalizing
measures to be taken in next year’s budget. Further details will be provided in the
President’s Budget Speech on September 30, but so far the authorities have indicated
that options being considered include increasing environmental taxes, terminating
several customs duty exemptions, and reducing subsidies to public utilities, including
by adjusting tariff structures. The tax system is also to be simplified by discontinuing
several nuisance taxes and stamp duties. However, at this point, there is not enough
specificity to quantify the impact of these measures on the fiscal position.

3.
Plans to issue the sovereign bond have been delayed as a result of recent
unfavorable market trends. However, the authorities still intend to go ahead with the bond
issue later, as market conditions permit, and in the meantime they are exploring the
possibility of bridge financing to enable them meet their commitments in the gold sector,
while the state oil company also has alternative financing for the oil sector investment. If the
bond issuance were to be delayed into next year, it would defer somewhat the increase in
government debt resulting from this transaction in staff’s macro framework. At this point, no
major implications for near term gold or oil production of such a delay are forseen.

Press Release No. 13/409
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 18, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Suriname
On September 30, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Suriname.1
Suriname’s macroeconomic performance has strengthened markedly over the past decade. Since
2000, stronger policies and buoyant commodity prices, supported by political stability, have
helped improve macroeconomic performance, enabling Suriname to enjoy several recent
upgrades from major ratings agencies. At this juncture, however, with gold prices declining after
a long upswing, the main challenges are to strengthen institutions and adjust policies to avoid
the onset of a boom-bust cycle.
Growth remains robust while inflation has declined considerably. In 2012 Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew an estimated 4.75 percent; similar to 2011 and among the highest in the
region, supported by buoyant commodity prices particularly gold. However, while export
volumes for gold grew strongly, they were anemic for the other two main commodities—oil and
aluminum. Inflation has dropped sharply, and stood at 2.5 percent in May 2013.
Bank credit growth to the private sector has risen to a robust 17.25 percent (year on year) in
May 2013, led by trade and housing construction, with stable lending rates in both domestic and
foreign currency. Financial intermediation remains low, however, with private sector credit at
26 percent of GDP in 2012. Commercial banks remain profitable and liquid. Non-performing

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
loan (NPL) ratios are somewhat high, but declined from about 8 percent in 2011 to 7.1 percent
currently.
However, the fiscal position has weakened substantially. The overall fiscal balance fell by
5 percentage points to a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2012. Much of the deterioration was due
to a jump in current spending, including on subsidies. Fiscal pressures intensified further in the
first quarter of 2013 as a result of wage hikes and a pickup in capital spending. While measures
have been taken since March to contain spending, the overall deficit for 2013 is likely to be
around 3 percent of GDP. Public debt remains low at 22 percent of the GDP.
The external balance has also declined considerably. The current account surplus declined by
about 1.5 percentage points to an estimated 4.25 percent of GDP in 2012. In the first quarter of
2013, the weakening intensified and a current account deficit was recorded, as the usual
seasonal decline in receipts was accompanied by increased imports and declining commodity
export prices. International reserves dipped moderately but remain adequate at 4.25 months of
imports.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Suriname’s strong growth supported by sound policies and
buoyant commodity prices. They noted, however, that the country’s heavy reliance on
commodity exports has exposed fiscal and external vulnerabilities. Directors stressed the need to
build up buffers, promote fiscal sustainability, strengthen the financial sector, and enhance
competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. They recommended
targeting a moderate fiscal surplus over the medium term. Adjustment efforts should aim to
streamline expenditure on goods and services, moderate public wages, improve the targeting of
subsidies, and prioritize capital projects. It will also be important to ensure that the planned
social security scheme is fiscally sustainable.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors commended the authorities’ plans to strengthen the fiscal framework. The public
financial management law when completed would provide a sound basis for a fiscal anchor and
medium-term expenditure ceilings. Directors also lauded efforts to establish a sovereign wealth
fund and strengthen customs and tax administration, and recommended intensifying efforts to
implement a properly-designed value-added tax. Directors urged caution regarding the
authorities’ plans to purchase minority stakes in two gold mining ventures financed by a
sovereign bond issue.
Directors supported monetary tightening in case fiscal measures prove inadequate to contain
demand pressures. They urged the authorities to press ahead with plans to establish open market
operations. Directors underscored the importance of prudent macroeconomic policies to support
the fixed exchange rate. They encouraged the authorities to remove the remaining multiple
currency practices when the opportunity arises.
Directors noted that the financial sector appears relatively sound, but urged vigilance over the
rapid growth of credit. They welcomed the progress in overhauling the banking sector
regulatory framework and strengthening the Anti Money Laundering /Combating the Financing
of Terrorism regime. They looked forward to the authorities’ plans to upgrade the insurance
sector regulatory framework, establish a credit bureau and a deposit insurance scheme, and
reduce state ownership in the banking sector. They recommended continued efforts to reduce
dollarization.
Directors underscored the need to boost competitiveness through reinvigorated steps to
strengthen the business environment. They also recommended action to improve labor market
flexibility.
Directors looked forward to plans to upgrade the statistics law and strengthen reporting
requirements to help address data gaps.

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Suriname
and Mr. Oliveira Lima, Mr. Orie, and Mr. Gaurisankar
September 30, 2013
1.

The Surinamese authorities appreciate the continued open dialogue and frank

discussions with the staff mission, which reflect a now well-established close collaboration.
While noting the remarkable progress achieved in the last three years, the report highlights
the need for further strengthening the fiscal framework to maintain robust and stable growth
under very challenging external circumstances.

Recent Developments and Outlook
2.

The Surinamese economy recorded growth of 4.8 percent in 2012 driven by the

mining and construction sectors. Growth is continuing at the same pace in 2013 induced by
ongoing construction activities under the US$700 million expansion of the oil refinery and
increased credit-driven demand. Despite the negative impact of lower commodity prices on
the domestic demand for goods and services, the outlook for the medium term remains
favorable as a result of substantial foreign direct investment in gold mining and continued
investments by the state-owned oil company, Staatsolie.
3.

Two gold mining deals were approved by Parliament. The first one was signed with

the Canadian gold mining company Iamgold for the expansion of its existing gold mine in
Suriname. The second one awaits the official signing by the Surinamese government and the
American gold mining company Newmont for the construction of a new mine, involving an
investment of about US$1.1 billion or 22 percent of GDP. The government can opt for an
equity participation of up to 30 percent in the Iamgold deal and 25 percent in the Newmont
deal, amounting to an investment of approximately US$400 million if both options are fully
exercised. The authorities have examined the issue carefully and firmly believe that equity
participation would be in the best interest of the Surinamese population, as it will increase
fiscal income over the medium term and help expand the economic linkages of the mining
industry to the rest of the economy. While the resulting higher exposure to gold price
fluctuations is of concern, the authorities are setting up a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) that
will absorb a large part of the windfall income and most of the revenue fluctuations, while at

2
the same time discussing with capital markets the possibility of making use of appropriate
hedging instruments to reduce future income volatility. It is expected that the government
will access international capital markets to raise the necessary funds for these investments.
4.

Staatsolie is undertaking large investments in oil refining and ethanol production. The

expansion of the oil refinery is slated to be completed in late-2014 and will substantially
reduce exports of crude oil and imports of refined products, with a positive net effect on the
trade balance projected at around 2½ percent of GDP. The successful conclusion of a pilot
ethanol project led the company to approve a large scale sugarcane ethanol project that is
expected to have sizeable effects on employment and export diversification. Also, a new
local privately owned kaolin mining company has recently commenced operations in East
Suriname. This raw material is processed in the country by the cement industry, which is
experiencing rapid growth because of the construction boom.
5.

The Surinamese economy experienced continued low inflation despite acceleration in

domestic demand and some pressure on the exchange rate caused by the fall in international
gold prices. Inflation measured 2.5 percent in August 2013 on a year-over-year basis, mainly
because of stable international food and fuel prices. Aware of the downside risks posed by
the external environment and the rapid expansion of domestic demand, the authorities have
begun to tighten monetary and fiscal policies.
6.

Falling government revenue triggered by lower gold prices, public sector wage

increases, and increases in capital expenditure and purchases of goods and services widened
the fiscal deficit in late-2012. The fiscal deficit increased further in the first quarter of 2013,
again as a consequence of falling gold prices and higher spending. The authorities responded
by imposing cash management measures. Goods and services expenditure authorizations
have been reduced, while capital investment is slowing down. As a result, the government
recorded a small surplus in the second quarter of 2013. Further revenue measures are under
preparation and will be put in place gradually to ensure macroeconomic stability and
maintain the growth momentum of the economy. Additional revenue measures will be
announced in the President’s September 30 budget speech. Despite increased government

3
borrowing, public debt remained far below the statutory ceilings set out in the State Debt Act
(25 percent of GDP for domestic debt and 35 percent of GDP for external debt). The
projected increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2013 is entirely related to the intended
international bond issuance to finance the gold mining investments.
7.

In the first half of 2013, the current account balance shifted to a deficit after a

prolonged period of surpluses. This shift reflects lower international prices for gold and
alumina, a strong seasonal decline in exports, and a marked increase in imports of goods and
services. Higher imports resulted in turn primarily from the construction of the new refinery
and, to a smaller extent, from elevated domestic demand. As a consequence, international
reserves declined to US$874 million in August 2013.
8.

Monetary expansion in the first half of 2013 was primarily fueled by increased credit

demand associated to accelerated growth in the small-scale gold mining sector and
construction industries and higher government spending. The Central Bank has tightened
monetary policy to protect the stability of the economy. Specifically, the reserve requirement
ratios on domestic and foreign currency deposits were increased by 5 percentage points each,
while the discount rate was also raised. The Central Bank is closely monitoring developments
and will tighten monetary policy further in case fiscal and monetary policy measures prove
insufficient to correct the demand imbalance or if domestic inflationary pressures should
emerge.
9.

The banking system is adequately capitalized, liquid, and profitable. The main

challenge is the still high financial dollarization in the banking system. To reduce incentives
for dollarization, the Central Bank has been increasing reserve requirements on foreign
currency deposits compared to the reserve requirements on domestic currency. As a result,
deposit and credit dollarization have fallen gradually.
10.

The Central Bank is strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework of the

financial system, while also tightening AML/CFT reporting requirements. To safeguard
private sector deposits, the establishment of a Deposit Insurance Scheme is under

4
consideration drawing on technical assistance provided by the Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center (CARTAC).
Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
11.

The authorities are committed to containing the 2013 fiscal imbalance at below 3

percent of GDP. After a small fiscal surplus was recorded in Q2 2013, it is expected that the
additional fiscal revenue measures to be announced on September 30 and the continued
containment of current and capital expenditure will suffice to counter the reduction in mining
revenue and the increase in expenditures in late 2012 and early 2013.
12.

Over the medium-term, the government is committed to a series of important reform

measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, reduce reliance on volatile mining revenue, reduce
tax collection costs, increase reliance on consumption taxes as opposed to income taxes, and
increase the tax base. The introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT) has been delayed due to
problems related to its design, infrastructure, and ownership. With a new draft law being
prepared, it is expected that a revenue-positive VAT will be introduced in 2015.
Simultaneously to the introduction of the VAT, the government intends to simplify the direct
tax regime and reduce income tax rates. Preparations are underway and a new fiscal reform
project manager has been hired by the Ministry of Finance to oversee and put in place these
reforms.
13.

Budget execution and fiscal policy have been hampered by an outmoded budget

design and execution regime. With the support of the IDB, a new budget execution and
information management system is being implemented and is expected to be fully operational
in 2014. In parallel, a new public financial management law has been drafted with the
support of Fund technical assistance and is being discussed with stakeholders before
submission to Parliament. Significant improvements in statistical data collection and a new
financial programming framework are also contributing to enhance macroeconomic
policymaking.

5
14.

Production in the small-scale gold mining sector exceeds that of the large gold mines.

Yet, the government earns only minimal royalties from these gold producers. Efforts to
collect income tax and increase royalties from small gold miners are ongoing and a draft tax
law has been completed and sent to Parliament for discussion and approval. Meanwhile, the
Revenue Service is stepping-up efforts to expand tax collection from this sector based on the
existing tax law.
15.

A reform of the Customs Administration is being implemented with the help of a

specialized international firm. The main objective is to reduce the under-invoicing of
imports. Pre-shipment inspections are in the process of being introduced, pending
adjustments to minimize the impact of those inspections on the time required for import
handling.
16.

Appropriately designed fiscal rules can entrench stability and reduce the highly

disruptive impact of sharp fluctuations of mining-related revenue, the main source of fiscal
sector instability in Suriname. As a first step, the authorities have placed in the draft SWF
law fiscal rules that stabilize revenue stemming from oil and mining operations. Since SWFembedded rules can only affect revenue, a broader fiscal anchor may be necessary. Staff has
advocated a target for the non-mineral balance complemented by medium-term expenditure
ceilings. The authorities would appreciate further discussions with staff and technical
assistance from the Fund in this matter.
Structural Issues and Capacity Building
17.

The authorities have made significant progress in the establishment of a SWF for

revenue stabilization, savings, and inter-generational equity purposes. Parliamentary
discussions on the SWF are in the final stages. Staff cautioned the authorities on the
amendments to the original draft SWF law, particularly the temporary allocation of some
mineral windfall revenue to a domestic investment fund. The staff’s cautionary remarks are
understandable, but this is a typical case where garnering political support in the legislature
required amendments to an otherwise impeccable draft law. In any case, these amendments

6
do not affect the thrust of the legislation proposed by the government; they are only valid for
two years and the envisaged fiscal rules will apply fully after that.
18.

The authorities have already made important steps to create a more supportive

business environment that would enhance growth prospects. The licensing system has been
simplified and the time required to start a business has been reduced. In addition, the
authorities have established a financing fund for small and medium-sized enterprises with the
support of the IDB.
19.

The Central Bank continues to function as a catalyst for knowledge. It embarked on

an ambitious program to train young graduates in various areas of interest for the central
bank, such as financial sector supervision and surveillance, open market operations and
capital market development. In addition, the Bank established a financial literacy training
program for several target groups, such as financial institutions as well as small and mediumsized enterprises. In this regard, the Bank joined the OECD’s International Network on
Financial Education (INFE), which will be instrumental for its financial education programs.
