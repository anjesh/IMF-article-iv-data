EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Guatemala has pursued important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization since the 1996
Peace Accords. Fiscal discipline has anchored the policy framework; international reserves have
risen; and important banking reforms have been implemented. Following three years of slow
growth, activity improved somewhat in 2004, but inflation also rose, partly due to higher oil prices.
Nevertheless, the economic and social goals of the Peace Accords remain to be fully realized.
Efforts to increase tax revenues to fund higher social and investment spending have stalled in
recent years. Guatemala continues to suffer from widespread poverty; and, according to a 2002
World Bank survey, perceptions of corruption, and weak integrity of some public institutions pose
additional challenges.
The government that took office last year has included the 1996 Peace Accords in the
platform for its policy agenda. The Accords embody a broad national consensus on economic,
social, and security priorities. Reflecting this, the government’s economic program rests on three
main pillars: macroeconomic stability; financial sector restructuring; and structural reforms to
boost growth and reduce poverty.
A key objective of the program is to keep the fiscal deficit low. Within this framework, the
government is seeking to mobilize additional fiscal resources to finance a significant increase in
public investment and social spending.
Monetary policy is being geared to reducing inflation to the 4–6 percent range. The exchange
system is flexible, but the central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange over the past year to
limit the nominal appreciation of the quetzal against the U.S. dollar. In January 2005 a rules-based
mechanism for interventions was introduced.
The Guatemalan banking system has been strengthened in recent years. Prudential norms
have been tightened and offshore banks have been brought into the regulatory framework. The
reform process is continuing, and steps are being taken to address the persistent losses of the state
mortgage bank (CHN).
The government’s structural reform program, Vamos Guatemala, is focused on promoting
competitiveness, economic growth, and social progress. A key goal is to foster a business
climate characterized by transparency, the rule of law, and good governance; a Commissioner for
Competitiveness has been appointed; and implementation of CAFTA-DR is expected to underpin
the recovery. Social spending and the development effort are being stepped up, particularly in the
poorest municipalities.
Success of the program will hinge on the government’s ability to strengthen the revenue
effort, focus spending on priority needs, and improve transparency and governance. To this
end, the government has launched a national consultation process, engaging broad groups of
Guatemalan society in a dialogue to build consensus on national priorities and their funding.
With its record of overall fiscal discipline, low public debt, and a strengthened banking
system, Guatemala’s economic vulnerabilities are well contained. Nonetheless, the policy
framework is susceptible to erosion of public support, in part because of low domestic revenue and
the resulting constraints on the government’s capacity to address poverty and infrastructure
bottlenecks. The government’s program is designed to reduce this risk by mobilizing revenue,
prioritizing expenditures, and improving governance

I. BACKGROUND
A. A Brief Perspective
1.
The 1996 Peace Accords, which ended nearly 40 years of civil conflict, embodied
a broad national consensus on economic, social, and security priorities. The advent of
political stability gave rise to a significant peace dividend in the second half of the 1990s:
economic growth rose to 4 percent a year and nontraditional exports increased, helping to
diversify the economy. Growth slowed during 2001–03 amid falling coffee prices and
weaker external demand, but macro stability was maintained by policies anchored on a
strong fiscal stance, and a flexible exchange rate regime—resulting in low public debt
(18 percent of GDP) and a strong international reserves position. Progress was also made on
some important structural reforms (such as in the financial sector), but other reform goals of
the Peace Accords—particularly in the fiscal, social, and governance areas—were only
partially achieved.
2.
In particular, Guatemala continues
to face serious problems of poverty and
income distribution. Some social indicators
have improved, but Guatemala falls below the
Latin American average for all available
indicators. Governance also has been a
concern, and government effectiveness and
regulatory quality are perceived to have
slipped since the end of the 1990s.1

Successive governments have faced serious obstacles to raising additional
revenue and fund higher social spending. Powerful interest groups have opposed higher
taxes and often successfully challenged

Box 1. Legal Challenges and Instability of the Tax System
Legal challenges have been constant threats to the stability of the tax system. During 2001–03
the Constitutional Court (CC) received more than fifty appeals to eliminate, clarify, or reduce taxes.
Many of the appeals have been brought with reference to Article 243 in the constitution, which
establishes the principle that taxes should not exceed the payment capacity of the tax payer.
While most appeals have been rejected, the CC has ruled against the state in a number of
cases. This has created an unpredictable tax environment and eroded the tax base, and court rulings
threatened to reduce tax revenue by more than 1 percent of GDP in 2004. The most recent rulings
were in December 2003 when the CC eliminated the minimum corporate tax (IEMA), and in
December 2004 when an injunction was issued against the excise tax on fuel. The legal challenges
reflect an entrenched opposition to higher taxes in Guatemala, which have frustrated a number of
previous attempts to strengthen the revenue effort.

4.
The government that took office in January 2004 was elected on a platform of
market-oriented economic policies and the agenda of the Peace Accords. Its structural
reform program, Vamos Guatemala, aims to improve economic growth, competitiveness, and
social conditions. An assertive strategy to combat corruption and improve governance is also
central to the agenda. The government’s minority position in congress remains a significant
challenge.
B. Recent Economic Developments
Macroeconomic framework
5.
Economic growth has been sluggish in recent years, with only a modest recovery
in 2004. Real GDP grew by just over 2 percent per year during 2001–03, amid political
uncertainty, falling coffee prices, and a deteriorating business climate. Growth is estimated at
2¾ percent in 2004, supported by private investment and consumption. The latter has been
fueled, in part, by rising worker remittances.

Box 2. Social Expenditure
Following the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, the government outlined a comprehensive social program
with major initiatives in the areas of education, health, housing, and the justice and security systems.
The program embodied three overarching goals: (i) expanded access to services, especially for the poor and the
indigenous population; (ii) decentralization, with emphasis on community and private sector participation in
service delivery; and (iii) economic efficiency in the public sector through improved financial management,
outsourcing, and competitive procurement practices. The programs would be financed by external donors and by
an increase in the domestic tax effort to 12 percent of GDP (from 8 percent of GDP in 1995). While social
expenditures increased in the second half of the 1990s, they have declined since 2001. Likewise, the tax effort was
raised to 10.6 percent of GDP in 2002, but it has since declined.

Headline inflation rose to over 9 percent in 2004, well above the central bank’s
target range of 4–6 percent, but has declined somewhat in 2005. Higher oil prices and
relatively easy monetary conditions contributed to last year’s increase. Although the central
bank has raised its benchmark interest rate on several occasions since July 2003, the rate
remains negative in real terms, and commercial bank rates have continued to decline.

The balance of payments has strengthened in recent years, with international
reserves now covering 4½ months of imports. The current account deficit has narrowed to
about 4 percent of GDP, helped by a sharp rise in worker remittances, now at more than
9 percent of GDP. The rise in remittances, together with capital inflows and the global
weakening of the U.S. dollar, has put upward pressure on the quetzal. To stem the pressure,
the central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market for US$450 million last year,
limiting the appreciation to 3 percent against the dollar.2 The trade deficit has continued to
widen, however, to about 15 percent of GDP, as import demand has been fueled by
remittances and a steady real appreciation of the quetzal (by over 20 percent since 2000).

Net International Reserves

In January 2005, the central bank introduced a rules-based mechanism for intervention in the foreign
exchange market to “avoid an abrupt rise in the exchange rate of the quetzal.” The bank indicated
that, given the recent upward pressure on the quetzal, it would postpone defining a similar rule for
intervention to stem an abrupt fall. Under this mechanism, the central bank offers to purchase
US$10 million at a rate for the quetzal that is 0.5 percent more appreciated than its five-day moving
average. If the market sells the full US$10 million, the bank would also offer to buy additional
installments of US$10 million during the same day, successively, at a rate of 0.0025 per U.S. dollar
above the previous rate until the market closes. This mechanism has been subject to modification
since it was initially implemented, and is currently under review by the central bank.

While Guatemala’s overall export performance has lagged in recent years,
nontraditional exports have done quite well. Growth of traditional exports (coffee, sugar,
bananas, and cardamom) has been limited by adverse price developments, trade barriers in
key markets, and supply-side constraints. Nontraditional exports (textiles, light
manufactures, and specialty agriculture), on the other hand, have shown robust growth, in
part because of preferential access to the U.S. market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative
(CBI).

Fiscal policy
9.
Fiscal discipline has been broadly maintained despite the weak revenue base.
The fiscal deficit widened in 2003, mainly because of court-ordered tax reductions and
compensation payments to auxiliary soldiers for service in the civil conflict, but it fell to less
than ½ percent of GDP in 2004. Spending was reduced sharply in 2004 as the new
government faced additional tax reductions and legal problems that delayed execution of the
investment program. To offset the impact of the court rulings and raise tax collections toward
the 12 percent of GDP target, the government launched a tax plan soon after taking office last
year, comprising policy measures and a blueprint for strengthening tax administration and
tax enforcement.3 Although an initial tax package passed by congress in June 2004 fell short
of the government’s proposal, the tax administration plan generated more revenue than
expected, keeping tax collections at the level of 2003 (10.3 percent of GDP).

Access to external market financing improved last year. In 2003, a planned
Eurobond issue was reduced by nearly half, to US$300 million, because domestic investors
were reluctant to participate. By contrast, in September 2004 a 30-year US$330 million issue
was significantly oversubscribed, and with the lower fiscal deficit, the public sector turned
from sizeable net domestic borrowing in 2003 (1.2 percent of GDP) to a small net domestic
lending position in 2004.
The financial sector
11.
The reforms recommended in the 2001 FSSA have been pursued vigorously.
Financial sector legislation has been comprehensively modernized, and a tighter prudential
framework with strengthened onsite inspections has induced notable improvements in
solvency, asset quality, and liquidity. Offshore banks are now required to be part of licensed

adequacy ratios of both onshore and offshore banks are well above the statutory minimum of

Dollarization of the banking system has increased. Since 2001 when residents
were first permitted to hold foreign currency deposits in domestic banks, the share of such
deposits has risen to 15 percent, reflecting mainly the rapid growth in worker remittances.4
Credit in foreign currency, however, has grown more slowly.
Implementation of Fund policy advice
13.
The overall stance of macroeconomic policy and financial sector reforms have
been broadly in line with Fund advice in recent years, although there was less progress
on tax reform.
•

The pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies reflects a broad consensus in
Guatemala on the importance of sound fiscal and monetary polices and financial
stability. Conversely, the lack of progress after 2002 toward the tax objectives of the
Peace Accords is the result of strong opposition from powerful interest groups and
the perception that higher revenues would mainly lead to wasteful spending.

•

While many of the objectives of the 2003 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) were
achieved, the midterm review was not completed. The program was broadly
successful in maintaining macroeconomic stability and advancing some structural
reforms in 2003, an election year. However, slippages occurred, particularly toward
the end of the year: the ceilings on the fiscal deficit and short-term external debt were

exceeded, and structural performance criteria on exempting the purchase of bank
assets from VAT and conducting due diligence on the state mortgage bank (CHN)
were not observed. Hence, the precautionary arrangement expired in March 2004
without completion of the midterm review.
•

The authorities have made efforts at garnering support for additional revenue
measures to achieve the goals of the Peace Accords, although progress has been
slower than expected. They continue to work on implementing the tax plan, as
discussed below, and expressed interest in continuing the close policy dialogue with
the staff during this process.

•

Guatemala has received a considerable amount of technical assistance from the
Fund in recent years (Appendix I). The record of implementation has been good on
banking reforms, mixed on revenue mobilization (for lack of political support), and
constrained by institutional bottlenecks in the area of statistics.
C. Near-Term Outlook

14.
The economic recovery is expected to strengthen somewhat in 2005, although
there are downside risks. A favorable external environment, improvements in the business
climate, and early ratification of CAFTA-DR will support the recovery.5 The downside risks
include the impact of continued high oil prices, a further real appreciation of the quetzal, and
insufficient political support for the government’s agenda, particularly on revenue
mobilization and key structural reforms. Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.2 percent in
2005, with the external current account deficit remaining broadly unchanged. International
reserves accumulation would slow to the extent the central bank intervenes in the foreign
exchange market only to dampen exchange rate volatility, as capital inflows, including public
sector borrowing, are expected to moderate.

CAFTA-DR is the free trade agreement between Central America-Dominican Republic and the
United States.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The discussions focused on the near-term macro framework and economic
vulnerabilities, and on reforms to promote growth, competitiveness, and social
progress. The authorities and staff agreed that raising growth, reducing poverty, and
maintaining macroeconomic stability are the primary objectives of the policy framework.
Against this background, the discussions focused on growth-enhancing reforms; efforts to
raise revenue, reduce inflation, and advance financial sector reforms; and steps to improve
transparency and governance. The key elements of the policy framework are summarized in
Table 11.
16.
Overall, staff considered that the government’s economic strategy is well suited
to achieve its policy objectives, but recommended a somewhat faster pace of
implementation. The strong macroeconomic framework, trade opening, and improvements
in the business climate should help boost productivity, investment, and growth. The staff
noted that moving the reform agenda more rapidly than currently envisaged would hold out
prospects for a stronger recovery and earlier achievement of key social and economic goals.
In particular, the staff recommended that the authorities proceed quickly with actions to
mobilize additional fiscal resources, reduce inflation, and address the remaining financial
sector vulnerabilities.
17.
The authorities shared the staff’s assessment and recognized the potential
benefits of advancing the timetables for their reforms. They noted, however, that the pace
of implementation was constrained by the need to build support for key elements of their
agenda, a task made more difficult by the fragmented political landscape and the lingering
distrust in the integrity of some public institutions.

- 14 -

A. Medium-Term Outlook and Vulnerabilities
18.
The medium-term outlook is favorable under strong policies, although with
downside risks. Under a “baseline” scenario prepared by the staff based on the
government’s program, real GDP growth could rise to 3.5–4 percent. The external current
account would strengthen somewhat as a result of rising nontraditional exports, continued—
albeit somewhat slower—growth in remittances, and appropriately tight demand
management policies. Reliance on debt-creating capital inflows would be reduced as FDI
rises in response to improvements in the investment climate and the ratification of CAFTADR. The public debt would decline to 15 percent of GDP by 2010, from 18 percent in 2004,
while total external debt (public and private) would remain stable at around 28 percent of
GDP. All indicators of external vulnerability would remain sound.

19.
Guatemala’s external and public debt outlook is quite robust to alternative
assumptions for the underlying macroeconomic variables. Specifically, using 10-year
historical averages for the key assumptions does not significantly alter the medium-term
projection. Additional temporary negative shocks to key variables, such as interest rates, the
exchange rate, and GDP growth, would lead to some increase in the level of public and
external debt, but the ratios return to a declining path once conditions normalize.
20.
Nonetheless, vulnerabilities remain under the baseline scenario. The most serious
risk derives from political obstacles or legal actions that could delay or thwart
implementation of key fiscal and structural reforms and further delay achievement of the
Peace Accord objectives. The government faces significant obstacles to implementing its
program because of a highly fragmented political environment that reflects limited credibility
of some state institutions, related mainly to a history of weak management of public
resources, and deep distributional inequities that permeate much of the political discourse.
The congressional coalition supporting the government is fragile, and a number of pressure
groups with disparate agendas wield significant influence. Other sources of vulnerability
include:

2010

- 15 -

•

Terms of trade and dependence on the U.S. market. Although export diversification
has helped reduce trade-related vulnerabilities, one-third of Guatemala’s exports
remain commodity-based. Moreover, the United States absorbs 30 percent of nonmaquila exports, making them sensitive to changes in the U.S. market.

•

Productivity and real appreciation of the quetzal. Rising worker remittances and
capital inflows have contributed to a steady real appreciation of the quetzal in recent
years. Recognizing this challenge, the authorities emphasized that their policies have
been framed with a view to raising productivity and strengthening competitiveness.

•

Banking system. Notwithstanding the significant reforms, stress tests suggest that the
main risks to the nonperforming loan ratio (currently below 6 percent) come from
sharp reductions in economic activity and major increases in interest rates.6

21.
To illustrate some key risks, the staff prepared a weaker policy scenario where
tax revenue is not raised, inflation remains at current levels, and the momentum on
financial reform stalls. With tax collections remaining at around 10 percent of GDP,
budgetary expenditure would be reduced by about 1 percent of GDP relative to the baseline,
constraining social programs, while the fiscal deficit would rise by ½ percent of GDP. Under
such a scenario, the public debt would remain at 18 percent of GDP in 2010 instead of
declining; the ratio of public debt to tax revenue would still be the lowest in Central
America; and Guatemala’s protection against vulnerabilities would remain relatively strong.
However, higher inflation, stagnant revenue and social spending, and a halt to financial
sector reforms could affect the investment climate and market sentiment, and raise the cost of
borrowing. Real GDP growth would be lower and could negate the rise in per capita income
in prospect under the baseline scenario. There would also be a heightened risk of financial
sector problems, potentially leading to a more serious setback to growth.
B. Fiscal Policy
22.
The government’s fiscal strategy aims to raise revenue toward the target of the
Peace Accords, maintain a low budget deficit, and improve the quality of public
spending. Following the sharp compression of expenditure and the deficit in 2004, as
explained in paragraph 25, spending is set to recover in 2005 and 2006, temporarily widening
the deficit before it narrows again as the authorities continue to implement their tax plan.
23.
Staff expressed broad support for this strategy, stressing the key challenge of
raising tax revenue to the 12 percent of GDP target of the Peace Accords, now long

low-probability and extremely stressful macroeconomic shocks. They are used to distinguish between

overdue.7 To achieve this, staff recommended that a VAT increase be a central part of an
additional revenue effort and that the tax administration plan be underpinned with legislative
support, as needed. The authorities underscored their commitment to achieving the target, but
noted that resistance to a stronger tax effort remains considerable, and that more time would
likely be needed to mobilize sufficient domestic support. They expect tax collections to
increase to 10½ percent of GDP in 2005 and 11 percent in 2006, for a total effort of more
than 2 percent of GDP during 2004–06.8 9 The government’s tax plan includes three
elements:
•

A tax package approved in June 2004 that (i) reintroduced excises on alcoholic
beverages (revoked in 2003); (ii) introduced a turnover tax as an option under the
corporate income tax regime; (iii) established a presumptive minimum corporate
income tax (IETAAP) with a lower rate and different structure than the one revoked
in 2003; and (iv) provided for a small minimum corporate tax that will take effect
after the IETAAP is phased out by 2007.

•

A comprehensive plan launched last year to strengthen tax administration, following
FAD recommendations (Appendix II).

•

A second set of fiscal measures to be put in place in 2005 and to take effect in 2006,
with the measures still to be specified.

24.
The authorities underscored their commitment to tax administration reform and
a revenue package in 2005. They would introduce a package of efficient measures,
calibrated to take account of progress in collecting additional revenue under the tax
administration plan, so as to raise collections to at least 11 percent of GDP in 2006. The staff
noted that last year’s tax package had contained distortionary elements (such as an optional
corporate turnover tax), and urged the authorities to introduce a set of efficient measures this
year, and also take the opportunity to remove existing tax distortions and make the system
more buoyant. The government’s strategy to mobilize support for a new revenue package and
full implementation of the tax administration plan rests on engaging broad segments of
society in a public dialogue and education campaign to build consensus on national priorities,
7

The 1996 Peace Accords called for raising the tax/GDP ratio to 12 percent (originally to be achieved
in 2000) to fund much needed increases in social spending, restructure the security forces and the
judicial system, compensate the victims of the conflict, and finance a land purchase program.

8

Tax collections were set to fall to less than 9 percent of GDP following the tax reductions ordered
by the court in 2003. The congress has not yet approved a proposal to reinstate the excise tax on fuel,
requiring the government to extend a temporary tax on fuel imports.
9

An additional effort of about ½ percent of GDP will likely be needed to offset the mandated phasing
out of the minimum corporate income tax (IETAAP) by 2007, the effect of inflation on specific
excise taxes, the estimated first-year revenue loss under CAFTA-DR, and the implementation of
WTO valuation procedures.

- 17 -

including the Millennium Development Goals, and their funding. The campaign was
announced in February 2005, and a series of round-table discussions on health, education,
and security are being implemented. The authorities are also taking a leading role in efforts
to improve coordination of tax administration and tax policy at the regional level.10
Moreover, they expect that the track record being established on fighting corruption and
raising the quality of public spending will help allay long-standing concerns in the private
sector about misuse of public funds, and thereby build support for the stronger tax effort.11
25.
Raising public investment and social spending are key priorities under the
government’s program. The authorities explained that while spending was reduced last year
because of the prospective tax loss and the legal issues that delayed the investment program,
priority was nevertheless given to peace-related programs: the army was reduced by onethird (12,000 personnel) at a severance cost of 0.4 percent of GDP, and compensation
payments were made to auxiliary soldiers for service during the civil conflict.12 With rising
revenue, falling military outlays, and a moderately higher budget deficit, social spending and
public investment would rise significantly in 2005 and 2006, allowing further progress
towards the Peace Accords objectives and the Millennium Development Goals.
26.
Keeping the public debt low and improving its structure remain key objectives.
The maturity structure of external and domestic debt was extended in 2004, and the
authorities intend to increase the borrowing from multilateral institutions in 2005
(Appendices III and IV). In the past, the government had accumulated debt to domestic
suppliers (0.4 percent of GDP at end-2003) and to exporters as a result of delayed VAT
refunds (0.5 percent of GDP at end-2003). The former was reduced by half in 2004, and the
stock of overdue VAT refunds has also been lowered and is expected to be eliminated by the
middle of 2006.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
27.
The monetary framework was strained in 2004 by the weakening of the U.S.
dollar, strong inflows of private capital and remittances, and the cost-push from higher
oil prices. The authorities pointed to the increases in central bank interest rates over the past
10

Better coordination of taxes and fiscal incentives is seen as important as the region steps up its
efforts to attract foreign direct investment in the context of CAFTA-DR. In March 2005, Guatemala
hosted a regional conference on tax harmonization, supported by FAD, and the topic is on the agenda
of the summit meetings of the Central American presidents.
11

An FAD mission in January 2005 provided technical assistance on public expenditure management
and prepared the fiscal ROSC for Guatemala. Key recommendations of the mission were to address
poor budget coverage, execution, and control; unreported contingent liabilities; the risk of unreported
arrears; and inadequate controls on sub-national public debt.

The compensation payments were disbursed to a trust fund pending resolution of a constitutional
challenge to these payments.

- 18 -

year in their effort to contain any second-round effects from the oil price shock, and
explained that aggressive interest rate hikes to stem inflation would have risked encouraging
additional capital inflows and further appreciation of the quetzal. In this situation, they chose
a policy mix of moderate monetary tightening, tight fiscal policy, and central bank
intervention in the foreign exchange market to prevent excessive appreciation of the quetzal,
without pursuing an exchange rate target, noting that the interventions had been justified by
developments that were perceived to be temporary, such as the global pressures against the
U.S. dollar. They explained that the intervention rule introduced earlier this year was mainly
a tool for avoiding short-term volatility, and while the rule only refers to purchases of foreign
exchange, the central bank intends to pursue a broadly symmetrical intervention policy, also
dampening excessive depreciation, as needed. The authorities underscored that the central
bank had gained considerable credibility in recent years for its success in reducing inflation,
and that the lengthening of the yield curve for public debt last year pointed to improved
confidence.
28.
The staff recommended that the central bank focus on the goal of maintaining
low inflation. It welcomed the increases in interest rates implemented last year, but noted
that monetary conditions had nevertheless remained relatively lax, with currency emission
(the intermediate target) exceeding the limit set by the bank. The staff considered that
bringing inflation back to within the target range will require greater exchange rate flexibility
and adherence to a path for currency emission consistent with that objective. It noted that the
new foreign market intervention rule reduced discretion, but needed to be made symmetrical,
i.e., responding to both appreciation and depreciation pressures, and implemented
consistently and in a transparent manner. The staff encouraged the central bank to continue
its work, with the support of MFD, toward adopting an inflation targeting framework. The
authorities agreed with the staff about the appropriateness of moving toward such a
framework, and noted that inflationary pressures had abated in recent months, supporting
achievement of the end-year target for inflation of 4–6 percent.
D. Growth and Competitiveness
29.
Real appreciation of the quetzal, driven recently by a surge in worker
remittances and strong private capital inflows, has contributed to a widening trade
deficit and slow export growth since the end of the 1990s. Exports and economic growth
have also been constrained by supply-side factors; weakerExchange

(Box 3). There was also broad agreement that the challenge of competitiveness could not be
met on a sustained basis by targeting the exchange rate—hence the need for a strong and
comprehensive effort to strengthen the underlying determinants of competitiveness, notably
by actions to raise productivity, lessen infrastructure bottlenecks, and implement
appropriately tight fiscal policies. In this regard, the authorities noted that their program has
been framed to (i) strengthen the traded goods sector; (ii) foster a business climate
characterized by transparency, the rule of law, and good governance; and (iii) promote social
progress.
Box 3. Elimination of Textile and Clothing Quotas
Guatemala, like other Central American exporters of textiles and clothing, risk losing a sizeable part of their
exports to the United States following the January 1, 2005 elimination of quotas under the Agreement on Textiles
and Clothing. Net exports of textiles and clothing account for 6.1 percent of Guatemala’s current account receipts, and
the sector accounts for 2.6 percent of employment.
Rapid growth in Central America’s textile and clothing exports in the 1990s reflected country-specific import
quotas, mainly in the United States, and outsourcing of labor-intensive stages of production to other countries, such as
Guatemala. Under the quota arrangement, many Central American countries benefited from foreign direct investment,
often by Asian firms, designed to benefit from unused quotas in the region. Typically, Central American exporters
import cloth produced and cut in the United States, sew and warehouse the finished products, and export them to U.S.
retailers based upon daily sales data, replenishing retailer inventory weekly.
Staff simulations for the Spring 2005 WEO indicate that the elimination of quotas could reduce Central
American and Caribbean exports of these products by nearly half, the largest potential decline by any region.
The projected decline in exports would be equivalent, for Guatemala, to a reduction in current account receipts of
2.9 percent and a reduction in employment of 1.2 percent. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2005, released on
an expedited basis, show that U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from China increased by 65 percent and from India
by 29 percent. The growth rates of Chinese exports of knit shirts and blouses, cotton trousers, and underwear to the
United States were particularly high, at 1250, 1550, and 300 percent, respectively. However, preliminary U.S. import
data for the first quarter of 2005 indicate that Guatemala did not lose market share.
It should be noted that these estimates represent a worst-case scenario, ignoring a number of moderating
factors that are difficult to quantify: (1) the CAFTA-DR will ensure continued preferential access to the U.S.
market and will relax rules of origin to permit some use of non-U.S. inputs; (2) transportation costs and delivery times
for Central American countries are less than half of those for Asian suppliers; (3) having anticipated the lifting of
quotas, some exporters have sought market niches and have moved up the supply (and value-added) chain; and (4) the
United States has initiated safeguards proceedings under China’s WTO accession protocol in the three product
categories mentioned above, which could limit textile and clothing imports from China (but would not affect other
countries); certain other products are already subject to safeguards.

30.
To boost exports and help reduce the trade deficit, the government is pursuing a
three-pronged strategy to strengthen the competitive position of the traded goods
sector:
•

First, a robust macroeconomic framework has been adopted, with prudent fiscal and
monetary policies to support and complement productivity-enhancing reforms aimed
at strengthening the overall competitive position of the economy.

- 20 -

•

Second, trade liberalization is being pursued through the free-trade agreement with
the United States (CAFTA-DR) and efforts to complete a customs union in Central
America.14 In addition, Guatemala—as a member of the Central American Common
Market—is working toward trade agreements with the European Union and other
Latin American trade blocks. A commitment to liberalize trade at the multilateral
level in the context of the Doha Round remains an integral part of the government’s
trade policy.

•

Third, export and investment procedures are being simplified, and a Commissioner
for Competitiveness has been appointed. Barriers to trade, such as delays in rebating
VAT to exporters and cumbersome customs procedures, are being addressed. Also, as
investment incentives linked to exports are due to be eliminated by 2009 under the
WTO framework, the authorities plan to promote export diversification and growth
through “third-generation” incentives, including measures to support technological
innovation, enhance labor skills, and improve market intelligence.

31.
Policies to foster a better business climate and strengthen public institutions are
high on the government’s agenda.
•

Promoting fiscal transparency. To make public sector operations more transparent,
the government has drafted a fiscal transparency law (with assistance from the Fund)
that will be introduced in congress in 2005. Revisions to the organic budget law have
also been prepared.

•

Improving expenditure control. The Integrated Financial Management System
(SIAF) is being extended, and will cover nearly 100 additional municipalities and
decentralized agencies by the end of 2005. The on-line procurement system,
GuateCompras, is also being expanded.

•

Strengthening the legal system. In September 2004 the Supreme Court submitted to
congress a set of initiatives aimed at modernizing the legal system, and reforms are
being introduced to reduce delays in the judicial process.

•

Strengthening state institutions. A plan is being implemented to improve efficiency
and eliminate duplication of responsibilities through external management audits of
all ministries. Two key components of this effort are: (i) new civil service legislation
and (ii) strict enforcement of regulations for government procurement and
contracting.

•

Combating corruption. The government reaffirmed its commitment to fighting
corruption. A high-profile campaign against corruption is underway: a number of
former high-level officials are being prosecuted, stricter penalties are being
introduced, and a code of ethics for the civil service has been promulgated.

14

Guatemala ratified the CAFTA-DR agreement in March 2005.

- 21 -

•

Reviewing pension obligations. In 2005 the authorities will initiate a comprehensive
financial evaluation of the Social Security Institute (IGSS) and the government’s
other pension obligations. Although there is no indication of a near-term cash
problem, the authorities indicated that the review is important in order to ascertain the
longer-term viability of these obligations, an issue that has been brought into focus by
a recent court ruling that suspended an earlier decision to raise the retirement age
gradually from 60 to 65 years.

32.
Social programs are being expanded and made more efficient. The government
has restructured the budget to improve the targeting of expenditure on priority elements of its
multiyear program for growth, competitiveness, and social progress, Vamos Guatemala. The
program’s social component, GuateSolidaria, is designed to foster participatory socioeconomic development by focusing on education, health, housing, security, and justice, with
emphasis on projects to build productive capacity in the poorest municipalities. The plan
provides for partnerships with the private sector, particularly in the area of education, and the
authorities are enlisting support from the multilateral development agencies in the form of
expertise and financing.
E. Financial Sector Reforms
33.
Significant reforms have been introduced in the financial sector, but challenges
remain. Notably, provisions are low in offshore banks; four small private banks and the state
mortgage bank (CHN) remain weak; the level of related-party lending is high; and illegal
offshore banks have been operating in Guatemala (action to deal with them is under way).
The authorities indicated that they are fully committed to addressing these challenges, noting
also that a well-coordinated regional approach would be helpful, as cross-border lending and
financial integration is advancing rapidly. They therefore support efforts to improve
cooperation and convergence of banking regulations and prudential norms in Central
America.
34.

The main areas of ongoing financial sector reforms are as follows:

•

Bringing offshore banks into the regulatory framework. Registration of financial
conglomerates (including offshore banks)—a necessary legal step for them to operate
as conglomerates—began in July 2004 and will be completed by mid-2006.

•

The bank resolution framework. The new framework will be completed and made
operational. The Trust Fund for Bank Capitalization was funded at the end of 2004,
and the authorities are seeking to implement the central bank’s lender-of-last resort
facility in 2005.

•

Bank consolidation. To facilitate consolidation in the banking industry, legislation
will be introduced in 2005 to exempt the sale of bank assets from the VAT.

- 22 -

•

The public mortgage bank. A plan has been drawn up to address the persistent losses
of the public mortgage bank (CHN). The fiscal costs, which will be estimated as part
of a forthcoming due-diligence process, will be incorporated into future budgets.

•

Related lending and general provisions. The Bank Superintendency will continue to
supervise closely institutions with high levels of lending to related parties (Préstamos
vinculados). The authorities will review the need to tighten the statutory limits on
such lending this year, and will also consider requiring general provisions to further
improve the soundness of banks.

•

Central bank recapitalization. The bank will be recapitalized, compensating for
losses incurred mainly through its open market operations. Beginning in 2005, the
government will assume, year-by-year, the losses incurred after 2002, and it will seek
approval for the issuance of a long-term zero-coupon bond to cover the stock of past
losses.

•

The payments system is being modernized. A Matrix for Modernization of the
Payments System will be implemented in 2005, which calls for the introduction of
real-time gross settlements and upgrading the clearing house for bank settlements.
F. Statistics

35.
The authorities are intensifying their efforts to upgrade Guatemala’s economic
statistics (see Appendix V). Although the quality of data is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, weaknesses in the national accounts and balance of payments data constrain the
policy analysis. In October 2004, a ROSC mission from STA found significant shortcomings
in macroeconomic statistics. To improve the balance of payments statistics, the central bank
is in the process of designing a new reporting system, and work is underway to adopt the
1993 system of national accounts and bring the base-year from 1958 to 2001. Guatemala
joined the General Data Dissemination Standard at the end of 2004.
III.

STAFF APPRAISAL

36.
Guatemala’s economic performance in recent years has been mixed.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained, with economic vulnerabilities well contained,
but growth has been sluggish and poverty remains widespread. On the positive side, the
public debt is low, the overall external position has been strengthened, and the financial
system has been made more robust. At the same time, weak domestic consensus and legal
ambiguities have undermined efforts to increase taxes and fulfill the aspirations raised by the
Peace Accords. Indeed, social expenditure has declined, and Guatemala’s social indicators
are low.
37.
Against this backdrop, the government that took office in early 2004 has
included the Peace Accords in the platform for its policy agenda. The staff welcomes this
renewed commitment to the Accords and the goals for economic and social progress they

enshrine. The government has laid out a well-focused and ambitious policy agenda, although
it still needs to secure broad political support for some key elements.
38.
The government has put appropriate focus, right from the start, on the challenge
of curbing corruption and restoring trust in the integrity of public institutions. The staff
welcomes this approach, which has already been successful in promoting transparency and
fighting corruption. The government has also been efficient in targeting scarce resources
under the Vamos Guatemala plan, and innovative in seeking to build partnerships with the
private sector. These and other early steps have gained the government credibility and good
will that should be leveraged into broader support for its economic policy agenda.
39.
The government’s economic program rests on three pillars: structural reforms
to spur growth and reduce poverty; macroeconomic stability anchored on prudent
fiscal and monetary policies; and financial sector restructuring. The authorities consider
well-targeted social programs to be a prerequisite for strong economic growth over the
longer term. The staff shares this view, and also welcomes the programs designed to
encourage private investment and strengthen the competitive position of the traded goods
sector. To be successful, these programs must be appropriately funded, underscoring the need
for a strong revenue effort. Supported by strong fiscal policies, these structural reform
programs should help contain the impact on competitiveness of the growing flow of
remittances, which is expected to continue.
40.
A sustained improvement in the tax effort is critical to Guatemala’s
development prospects. The staff regrets the decline in the tax/GDP ratio after 2002, with
the threat of a further major decline in 2004 leading to a sharp compression of spending until
the new government’s tax strategy was in place. Unfortunately, last year’s tax package, an
integral part of the strategy, was reduced by congress, and its yield will decline over time.
This has left the government to rely on the tax administration plan while mobilizing support
for additional revenue measures. Although the plan is generating more revenue than
expected, a comprehensive and sustained reform of tax administration requires legislative
action, and thus congressional support.
41.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to introducing additional
measures in 2005 to help achieve the revenue goal of the Peace Accords. To marshal
support for this effort, which should be centered on high-quality tax measures and provide
for the elimination of existing distortions, the government has initiated a public dialogue and
education campaign designed to build consensus on national priorities and their funding. The
government is also taking a lead in efforts to enhance cooperation on tax issues at the
regional level, and is building a track record of more efficient public resource management
that should help broaden domestic support for a stronger revenue effort.
42.
The central bank is encouraged to focus on achieving low inflation. Relatively lax
monetary conditions contributed to the rise in inflation last year, and staff recommends that
conditions be kept appropriately tight to ensure achievement of the target for 2005. A
flexible exchange rate regime remains appropriate for Guatemala and staff urges the
authorities to allow the exchange rate of the quetzal to be determined by the market and limit

- 24 -

interventions to what is needed to avoid excessive short-term volatility. Finally, staff
supports ongoing work toward adopting inflation targeting as the framework for monetary
policy, which will further strengthen the credibility of the central bank and help keep
inflation low.
43.
The staff commends the authorities for the progress on financial sector reform.
Bringing the offshore banks into the regulatory framework is a significant accomplishment.
At the same time, it is important to address remaining vulnerabilities, notably by reducing
lending to related parties, building general provisions, and dealing with the persistent losses
of the state mortgage bank (CHN).
44.
The staff encourages the authorities to continue their work to strengthen
Guatemala’s macroeconomic statistics. In particular, the plan for updating the national
accounts should be implemented, information on external flows strengthened, and the
reporting of data by the non-budgetary fiscal sector upgraded. Staff recommends that the
authorities give priority to these issues, which will require additional resources and close
inter-agency collaboration.
45.
The medium-term economic outlook is favorable under strong policies, although
it is not without risks. The prospects for exports and growth depend crucially on
productivity-enhancing structural reforms, continued prudent fiscal policy, and trade
promotion. Remaining weaknesses in the banking sector, while not a systemic risk, also need
to be addressed. Nevertheless, Guatemala has considerable room for maneuver to deal with
shocks. The combination of low public debt, a strengthened banking system, a flexible
exchange rate regime, and adequate international reserves would make for a fairly resilient
policy framework. At the same time, it is important that the government muster sufficient
domestic consensus to carry its ambitious economic program forward.
46.

Staff proposes that Guatemala remain on a 12-month consultation cycle.

p/ Preliminary
1/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and
nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.
2/ Includes public and private sector external debt. Excludes debt owed by state-owned enterprise Corfina (amounting to US$531.5 million in 2003) which is under dispute
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
4/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
5/ For projection, line includes price and exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Bank of Guatemala (BANGUAT) was
subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved
on April 1, 2002 (Country Report No: 02/80). The assessment, which was completed on
August 09, 2002, identified certain weaknesses and made appropriate recommendations.

APPENDIX I

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement based on an interbank foreign
exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign exchange
at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign
exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses.
The exchange regime is classified as “Managed floating with no pre-announced path for
the exchange rate.” As of March 29, 2005 the reference exchange rate was Q 7.61 per
U.S. dollar.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on October 3,
2002. Staff proposed that Guatemala remain on a 24-month consultation cycle.

X.

FSAP Participation
An FSAP was conducted on July 3–7, 2000 and on September 11–23, 2000, and the
Financial System Stability Assessment was discussed by the Executive Board on
May 14, 2001 at the time of the 2001 Article IV consultation.

XI.

Technical Assistance
In June 2000 an STA mission assisted the authorities in developing a new CPI. In
October and December 2000, a joint World Bank-IMF mission visited Guatemala to help
prepare draft legislation on central bank, banking sector, and banking supervision. In
December 2000 and June 2002 MAE missions provided assistance on payments system
issues. In February 2001, MAE provided assistance on bank restructuring. FAD provided
assistance in May 2001 on tax policy and tax administration; in February 2002 on
expenditure management; in August 2003 and March 2004 on tax policy; and in April
and November 2004 on tax administration. A STA mission on balance of payments
statistics took place in March 2004. A STA mission visited Guatemala City in March
2004 to assist in completing General Data Dissemination System metadata for the
financial and external sectors. MFD missions on inflation targeting visited Guatemala in
September 2004 and March 2005. FAD missions on expenditure management and on tax
administration visited Guatemala in January-February 2005.

XII.

Resident Representative
Mr. Erik Offerdal opened the Resident Representative office in August 2003.

APPENDIX II

KEY STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM
Fund staff (FAD) has worked closely with the authorities over the past year to design a
comprehensive plan to strengthen tax administration and tax enforcement in Guatemala. The
staff’s main recommendations in this area have been:
Taxpayer segmentation (early 2005)
1.
The purpose of taxpayer segmentation is to focus tax control on specific taxpayers,
based on their tax significance. The criterion for selecting large taxpayers would include total
sales and the amount of tax paid. The Superintendency for Tax Administration (SAT) should:
•

Create a “Large Taxpayers Coordination” (CGC) unit, responsible for monitoring the
country’s 300 largest taxpayers; the existing Special Taxpayer Coordination (CCE)
unit would administer the subsequent 2,700 largest taxpayers.

•

“Account officers” should be appointed within the CGC and the CCE units to manage
taxpayer files. The account officers would be responsible for advising taxpayers and
taking action against those who do not file on time or are delinquent.

Incentives to file electronically (early 2005)
2.
Banks not complying with SAT Resolutions 610-2002 and 263-2002 should be
penalized. The purpose is to encourage the electronic filing of returns to prevent errors,
create reliable databases, and facilitate effective cross-checks of data. The SAT should:
•

Require all taxpayers managed by CGCs and CCEs to file and pay electronically.

•

Suspend banks that accept paper returns for taxes owed in excess of Q 10,000. These
banks would no longer be authorized to receive tax returns and payments.

Electronic recording of large taxpayers’ purchases and sales (AsisteLibros) (early 2005)
3.
The purpose of electronic recording is to identify large taxpayers’ suppliers, in order
to verify compliance with their tax obligations. The SAT should:
•

Require large taxpayers to use SAT’s AsisteLibros software.

Control of late filing and delinquent taxpayers (early 2005)
4.
The purpose is to immediately penalize noncompliance with deadlines by requiring
delinquent taxpayers to make payments based on previous returns. The SAT should:
•

Require delinquent taxpayers to make a partial payment based on previous returns, in
accordance with Articles 106, 107, and 109 of the Tax Code.

- 44 -

•

APPENDIX II

Allow taxpayers to file returns without paying in full the amount reported as due but
while immediately taking collection action to recover the resulting debt.

Customs control (mid-2005)
5.
To combat smuggling, the waybills of air and sea carriers should be electronically
linked to customs declarations, to assure consistency of the declared data. The SAT should:
•

Begin using the electronic air and sea waybill (done in April 2005).

•

Establish a new electronic customs declaration (declaración única de aduanas, DUA)
for operations carried out on or after June 1, 2005.

Legal changes to improve the tax administration (late 2005)
•

VAT withholding. Withholding helps curb evasion and generates immediate
revenue. Legislation should establish withholding systems with a rate of 3 percent
for: (a) imports, (b) large taxpayers’ purchases, (c) large exporters’ purchases, and (d)
credit card operations.

•

Simplified system for small taxpayers. A new VAT system for small taxpayers
should include monthly payments, eliminate the requirement of filing returns, and
prohibit the issuance of invoices that generate tax credits.

•

Means of payment for large transactions. Legislation should promote the use of
banks for commercial transactions in order to detect false VAT credits. The SAT
should require that invoices amounting to Q 10,000 or more be paid using bank
means of payment (checks, electronic transfers, credit and debit cards, etc.). Invoices
over Q 10,000 not paid using bank means would not generate tax credits for the VAT
and would not be accepted as a deductible expense on income tax returns.

•

Third-party information. Third-party information is essential for ascertaining the
real economic circumstances of taxpayers and determining their true ability to pay
taxes. The powers envisaged in Article 30 of the Tax Code (currently suspended)
should be reinstated to enable the SAT to obtain information from third parties.

•

Seizure of vehicles. Legislation should authorize SAT to seize vehicles found to be
transporting contraband.

•

Suspended taxpayers. Some taxpayers apply for registration for the sole purpose of
issuing invoices to document nonexistent transactions to generate false credits for
VAT or false expenditure on income tax returns. Legislation should authorize the
SAT to introduce a “suspended taxpayers” category for taxpayers with no tax activity
during a one-year period or who have failed to answer summonses. Suspended

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

taxpayers would not be eligible for automatic renewal of the their tax registration and
would not be allowed to print invoices to grant tax credits for VAT or to document
expenditure on income tax returns. Some applications from suspended taxpayers
should be denied (such as, authorization to print invoices, tax refunds request,
importers and customs agents licenses request, change of vehicle license plates
authorization, approval of books of accounts, authorization of branches, issuance of
government supplier certificates).
•

Invoicing control. Legislation should establish specific controls to detect the use of
false invoices, which reduces the base of the VAT and the income tax. The SAT
should have the power to determine the data requirements as well as the procedures to
control the printing of tax invoices and other fiscal documents.

APPENDIX III

GUATEMALA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of January 31, 2005)
1.
IBRD assistance to Guatemala intensified considerably after the signing of the Peace
Accords agreements, particularly during the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
implementation period (1998 to 2001). Eleven new projects were approved during this period
and assistance expanded in the areas of poverty reduction, policy analysis, civil society
engagements, decentralization, with a special focus on gender and indigenous issues. In order
to set forth Bank assistance plans during the interim period (2002–2004), a CAS Progress
Report was presented to the Board of Directors on May 31, 2002. The update to the strategy
does not differ significantly from the previous CAS, and highlights the importance of Bank
support of the reforms in the financial sector.
2.
As of January 31, 2005 the IBRD portfolio in Guatemala contained 12 projects for a
total commitment of US$526 million, of which US$251 million remains undisbursed. The
portfolio is relatively new (the average implementation period is approximately 3.5 years), as
all projects have become effective after December 1998. The last project approved by the
Bank’s Board was the Second Main and Rural Roads Project (US$47 million) supports the
government's initiative to build and repair rural, secondary, and main roads and bridges,
providing some 500,000 local people in an impoverished and isolated part of the country
better and quicker access to markets, schools, health clinics, and other key facilities. The
project recently was recently declared effective and began full implementation in November
2004.
3.
Future Assistance: In coordination with the new authorities, the World Bank will
develop a new CAS which is expected to be completed during the first half of 2005. The
central component of the Bank’s support for Guatemala would be a programmatic series of
quick-disbursing operations to support the Berger Administration’s program, Vamos
Guatemala! focusing especially on supporting the policy and institutional development
aspects of the government’s strategy for accelerating broad-based growth and improving
governance as key components of the effort to reduce poverty and improve social conditions.
These operations will be accompanied by selective investment lending in key areas such as
Education, Public Sector Management, Health and Nutrition, Judicial Systems and Land
Property Rights.

APPENDIX IV

GUATEMALA—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of February 2005)
A. Recent Projects and Objectives
1.
The Bank’s country strategy with Guatemala parallels the new 2004–2007 political
cycle in the country, which began when President Berger took office.
2.
The IDB strategy with Guatemala has the central objective of poverty reduction. To
achieve it, the program for the period 2004–2007 has established two interrelated strategic
objectives: (i) to improve the conditions for efficient production and incorporate excluded
sectors into the productive process; and (ii) to strengthen human capital with equity. Also,
the strategy includes improvements in the country’s institutions in support of better
governance as a cross-cutting issue, which is a necessity for progress in both areas. The Bank
seeks to support the government’s strategy, whose focus is the promotion of opportunities for
higher economic growth and job creation with broad participation by all sectors, which will
reduce poverty levels in a setting of macroeconomic stability.
3.
In 2003 the Bank approved loans to finance the national census (US$25 million),
investments in rural water and sanitation (US$50 million) and a project for electricity
interconnection with Mexico (US$37.5 million). In 2004 the Bank approved only one loan to
support social public expenditure reform (US$100 million). Also in the pipeline are projects
in the areas of citizen security, rural electricity. environment and indigenous population. The
Bank is supporting the authorities to define a strategy to reduce poverty. In addition, the
Bank has been supporting nonfinancial activities including the coordination of the
Consultative Group meetings in Guatemala and several sectoral studies (growth, governance,
etc).

APPENDIX V

GUATEMALA STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The authorities have made efforts to improve the macroeconomic statistics and are
very cooperative in providing data to the Fund. However, important deficiencies remain in
the areas of government finance, balance of payments, money and banking, and national
accounts and price statistics. As noted below, the authorities are beginning to address
problems with assistance from STA. Guatemala became a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2004.
2.
A data ROSC mission visited Guatemala City during October 14-28 2004. The
mission identified shortcomings mainly in national accounts and balance of payments. Main
recommendations were: (i) announce publication by early 2005 of the national accounts for
2001 that will serve as a benchmark in the preparation of a new series consistent with 1993
SNA; (ii) expand the coverage of the fiscal statistics to include social security agencies, local
governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises; (iii) widen the coverage of the monetary
statistics to include offshore banks and credit and savings cooperatives; (iv) prepare sectoral
breakdowns of depository corporations in accordance with the MFSM methodology; (v)
implement the conversion of balance of payments statistics according to BPM5
recommendations; and (vi) expand balance of payments data sources by implementing new
ITRS forms and conducting surveys.
National accounts statistics
3.
The national accounts are compiled by the Bank of Guatemala (BG) based on the
1953 U.N. System of National Accounts (1953 SNA) with 1958 as the base year. The
conceptual framework, methodology and base year of national accounts are seriously
outdated. Commendably, however, the BG is working intensely to implement the 1993 SNA
and produce a higher-quality series with 2001 as base year, with results expected shortly.
Paucity of source data is the key factor hindering the accuracy and reliability of the national
accounts. In particular, compilation of the traditional national accounts series relies on
administrative source data, with virtually no data obtained from surveys; therefore, the
coverage of national accounts is limited. GDP is compiled by the production approach at
constant (1958) prices only and by the expenditure approach at current and constant prices.
Data are published annually with preliminary estimates available with a lag of about three
months. Processes for assessment and validation of source, intermediate, and output data are
weak. STA provided technical assistance in August 1997 with follow-up missions in national
accounts in January 1998 and March 1999, and a June 2000 mission for the CPI.
4.
The National Institute of Statistics (NIS) introduced a new CPI based on weights
from a household expenditure survey conducted in 1998/1999, and publication of the new
CPI began in February 2001. However, there are some weaknesses in the compilation of the
CPI related to the treatment of missing prices, changes in product quality, and the inclusion
of new products. The data ROSC mission concluded that the independence of the NSI might
be seen as hindered by its lack of financial autonomy and a governing body comprising

- 51 -

APPENDIX V

representatives from ministries and industry associations. The head of the NIS is a member
of the NIS Board, but lacks the right to vote, which may undermine accountability. Fines for
nonreporting and misreporting are low, with no mechanism to preserve their real value,
which could complicate efforts to improve source data by the members of the National
Statistical System. Resources at the NIS are insufficient, including for compiling the CPI,
and the contribution of the NIS to the compilation of the national accounts is minimal. In
addition, a producer price index, basic input for compiling national accounts estimates in real
terms, is not compiled.
Monetary statistics
5.
Data on the BG, commercial banks, and other financial institutions are being
compiled on a monthly basis and sent regularly to the Fund for publication in the IFS.
However, data on offshore banks is not yet included. In 1998 a technical assistance mission
recommended to the BG measures to improve the data compilation of the financial system,
including: (i) compilation of monetary statistics for savings and credit cooperatives; (ii)
revision of the money and credit aggregates; (iii) classification of domestic institutional units
into central and local governments, no financial public enterprises, and the financial
corporations sub sector (central bank, depository corporations, and other financial
corporations), which will improve the coherence of monetary data with data from the balance
of payments, fiscal sector, and national accounts; and (iv) breakdown between residents and
nonresidents in the monetary accounts. A September 2001 monetary and financial statistics
mission advised BG to establish a work plan to undertake all of these recommendations. As
of end-2004, commercial banks were still unable to provide adequately sectorized data
(financial assets and liabilities not broken-down by counterpart sector). An August 2004
mission assisted the BG in developing an integrated monetary database to be used internally
by the BG, as well as by the WHD and STA.
Government finance statistics
6.
There are problems in reconciling the government public sector balance as measured
from above the line from that as measured from the financing flows (below the line). While
progress has been made in adopting the new accounting framework for the budget,
insufficient work has been conducted to improve statistics of the social security and public
enterprises. In fact overall public sector data are not compiled on a regular basis by the
ministry of finance.
Balance of payments
7.
The overall conceptual framework used to compile the balance of payments is in
broad conformity with the guidelines in BPM4, but plans are underway for a full transition to
BPM5. The BG compiles annual balance of payments and quarterly balance of payments
based on the BPM5 are prepared for IMF publication (IFS and BOPSY). As surveys are not
conducted, data sources are insufficient and not fully dependable for compilation. Data

- 52 -

APPENDIX V

collection is largely based on the International Reporting Transactions Reporting System
(ITRS) managed by banks.
8.
The data ROSC mission found shortcomings similar to those identified by the TA
mission of March 2004. Following these missions, BG is in the process of hiring an external
expert to support the implementation of recommendations. Main recommendations were: (i)
implement and publish the planned conversion of balance of payments statistics according to
BPM5 recommendations; (ii) expand data sources by implementing new foreign exchange
transactions forms (ITRS) and conducting surveys commencing with direct investment
enterprises; (iii) and modify as planned the new ITRS forms following BPM5 classification
and sectorization to ensure identification of transactions involving financial assets and
liabilities and the residency status of transactors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 27, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Guatemala
On May 16, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Guatemala.1
Background
Guatemala has pursued macroeconomic stabilization successfully since the 1996 Peace
Accords, although the goals of the Accords remain to be fully realized. Fiscal discipline has
anchored the policy framework; international reserves have risen; and the banking system has
been strengthened. Following three years of sluggish economic growth, activity improved
somewhat in 2004, with real GDP rising by 2¾ percent, but consumer price inflation drifted
upward to over 9 percent. Guatemala continues to suffer from widespread poverty; and,
according to a 2002 World Bank survey, perceptions of corruption and weak integrity of some
public institutions pose additional challenges.
The government that took office last year has adopted the Peace Accords as the platform for its
policy agenda. The Accords embody a broad national consensus on economic, social, and
security priorities. Reflecting this, the government’s economic program rests on three main
pillars: macroeconomic stability; financial sector restructuring; and structural reforms to boost
growth and reduce poverty.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2A key objective of the program is to keep the fiscal deficit below 2 percent of GDP. Within this
framework, the government is seeking to mobilize additional fiscal resources to finance a
significant increase in public investment and social spending.
Monetary policy is being geared to reducing inflation to the 4–6 percent range. The exchange
system is flexible, but the central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange over the past
year to contain the appreciation of the quetzal against the U.S. dollar. In January 2005 a rulesbased mechanism for interventions was introduced.
The Guatemalan banking system has been strengthened in recent years. Prudential norms
have been tightened and the offshore banks have been brought into the regulatory framework.
The government’s structural reform program, Vamos Guatemala, is focused on promoting
competitiveness, economic growth, and social progress. Steps have been taken to foster a
business climate characterized by transparency, the rule of law, and good governance; a
Commissioner for Competitiveness has been appointed; and implementation of Dominican
Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) is expected to help underpin
the recovery. Social spending will be increased, with a redoubling of the development effort in
municipalities with the highest incidence of poverty.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Guatemalan authorities’ efforts to maintain macroeconomic
stability and pursue structural reforms. The public debt has been kept low, international
reserves have been strengthened, and the financial system has been made more robust. At the
same time, economic growth has been sluggish, poverty remains widespread, and the
momentum in strengthening the tax effort has weakened, with consequent declines in social
spending. More generally, the economic and social objectives of the 1996 Peace Accords
remain to be achieved.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ renewed commitment to achieving
the objectives of the Peace Accords. The government has set forth a comprehensive and
ambitious reform agenda in the Vamos Guatemala plan. Directors considered that, to realize the
growth dividends of the reform agenda, fiscal reform measures should be supported by prudent
monetary policy to control inflation, while structural reforms should aim at increasing
competitiveness and enhancing the investment climate. They welcomed the envisaged efforts to
fight corruption and improve the transparency of government operations, which will help build
trust in public institutions and partnership with the private sector, and solidify public acceptance
and support for the reform agenda. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their
commendable efforts to promote a public dialogue and to garner the necessary ownership and
consensus for faster implementation of the government’s reform program.
Directors regretted the decline in the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio since 2002, which has set back
the achievement of the Peace Accord goal of raising tax revenue to 12 percent of GDP.
Additional revenues are needed to finance well-targeted social programs and pressing

-3investment needs that are crucial for achieving the country’s development priorities. Directors
supported the ongoing work to strengthen tax administration, and welcomed the progress
already evident in this area. However, they noted that strengthening tax revenues on a lasting
basis will require congressional action on tax policy as well as some key tax administration
measures. Directors underlined the importance of moving forward expeditiously with
specification of measures aimed at strengthening revenues and improving the quality of the tax
system, including by broadening the tax base and eliminating exemptions. They supported the
government’s active participation in efforts to strengthen cooperation on tax issues at the
regional level.
Directors noted that Guatemala continues to face serious problems of poverty and income
distribution, with most of its social indicators falling below the averages for Latin America.
They accordingly welcomed plans to increase spending on social sectors from 2005, with a view
to improving the quality of human capital, bolstering productivity growth, and alleviating social
inequalities. Directors also called attention to the importance of improving the quality of public
spending and strengthening public expenditure management. Key steps planned by the
authorities include extending coverage of the Integrated Financial Management System to lower
levels of government, and initiating a review of the long-term financial viability of the pension
system.
Directors encouraged the central bank to focus on the goal of achieving low inflation.
They agreed that the authorities should strengthen their flexible exchange rate regime, which
remains appropriate for Guatemala. They recommended that foreign exchange market
intervention be limited to smoothing excessive short-term volatility. Directors took note of the
authorities’ desire to prevent an abrupt appreciation of the quetzal, and welcomed the
authorities’ intention to pursue a broadly symmetrical intervention policy, also dampening
excessive depreciation, as needed. At the same time, Directors considered that a strengthening
of external competitiveness would be best achieved by actions to raise productivity, reduce
infrastructure bottlenecks, and maintain a prudent fiscal policy. They supported the ongoing
work aimed at adopting inflation targeting as the framework for monetary policy. Directors
looked forward to further analysis of the implications of the sizable flows of private capital and
remittances for monetary and exchange rate policies.
Directors welcomed the emphasis in the authorities’ program on policies to increase growth,
improve competitiveness, and foster a good business climate. This will require more open and
competitive markets, the rule of law, and good governance. Directors were particularly
encouraged by Guatemala’s early ratification of the free trade agreement with the United States
(CAFTA-DR), which will help Guatemala secure broad and stable market access to its main
trading partner and provide an anchor for the implementation of growth-oriented institutional
reforms. Such reforms should help attract new private investment and strengthen the position of
the traded goods sector as Guatemala faces growing international competition, including from
the recent expiry of quotas on world trade in textiles.
Directors were encouraged by the significant progress on financial sector reforms since the last
consultation, in particular the steps taken to bring the offshore banks into the regulatory

-4framework. They encouraged the authorities to address remaining vulnerabilities, including
through steps to reduce bank lending to related parties, build general provisions, and deal with
the persistent losses of the state mortgage bank (CHN), in line with the Financial Sector
Assessment Program recommendations. Directors urged the authorities to persevere with
implementation of anti-money laundering legislation and to update combatting-the-financing of
terrorism legislation. The authorities were also encouraged to monitor closely any risks
stemming from dollarization in the banking system.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to strengthen macroeconomic statistics,
including Guatemala’s recent accession to the General Data Dissemination System. Further
work is needed to address weaknesses in the national accounts, the balance of payments, and
the data on non-budgetary fiscal transactions.
Directors considered that Guatemala’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable under
strong policies, albeit not without risks. The combination of low public debt, a strengthened
banking system, a flexible exchange rate regime, and adequate international reserves provides
considerable room for maneuver in dealing with adverse shocks.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Guatemala
and Gerardo Peraza, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 16, 2005

On behalf of our Guatemalan authorities, we thank management and staff for the continued
support and advice to the country. Guatemala maintains a close dialogue with staff and
benefits from intensive technical cooperation in several key areas of the government agenda.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s appraisal.
Immediately after taking office in early 2004, the authorities made a priority to restore
credibility in public institutions, fiscal discipline and consequently market confidence. They
re-launched the 1996 Peace Accords and made them the cornerstone of the government’s
policy framework. In May 2004, the government launched a comprehensive plan to
strengthen tax administration and tax enforcement. A month later, despite facing a
fragmented congress, the government secured the passage of a tax reform to revert the impact
of court rulings that threatened to erode the tax base. The authorities are determined to raise
revenue collection as envisaged in the Accords to increase significantly the spending on
health, education, and justice and to put Guatemala on track to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals. The authorities have also made the fight against corruption and
promotion of transparency central themes in their policy agenda.
In 2005, the government seeks to maintain the momentum of the recovery by preserving the
macroeconomic stability—underpinned by fiscal consolidation, lowering inflation,
improving the business climate, and structural reforms focused on strengthening
competitiveness and maximizing the potential benefits of trade agreements. Clearly, the
economy is still vulnerable to external shocks but the authorities are confident that the
envisaged measures will make the country more resilient to those shocks while strengthening
its competitiveness.
Thus, 2004 marked a clear turnaround in economic performance. Real per capita GDP
stabilized after three years of consecutive decline. Real output growth accelerated to
2.7 percent despite the negative impact of higher oil prices and a sharp contraction in
government spending. Fostered by a stronger foreign demand and increased domestic
confidence, this recovery reflected mainly buoyant goods exports and a sharp rebound in
private investment. Rising family remittances also supported a solid growth in private
consumption and imports. Net international reserves climbed to US$3.5 billion (US$2.9
billion in 2003), about 5.1 months of imports or 5.2 times the external service on short-term
public debt. Inflation closed at 9.2 percent (5.8 percent in 2003) owing largely to high
international oil prices, a build up of excess liquidity since mid-2003, and uncertainty related
to the delays in the fiscal budget process. Thanks to a prudent policy mix of gradual
monetary tightening, and austere fiscal stance, the government eliminated excess liquidity
balances by the end of the year. Since then, inflation has started to fall reaching 8.9 percent
by end-April 2005.

The budget deficit was reduced sharply in 2004 to 0.3 percent of GDP, from 2.3 percent in
2003. This reduction reflected those actions to revert the impact of court-ordered tax
reductions and strict spending policies without affecting social spending allocations. The
June 2004 tax package included a temporary tax to support the peace agreement (IETAAP)1
and excises on alcoholic beverages, established a 5 percent turnover tax as an alternative to
the corporate income tax, and introduced a minimum tax provision in the corporate income
tax that will remain in effect after the IETAAP is phased out by 2007. The fiscal target for
2005 of 1.8 percent of GDP takes into account a sharp rebound in public investment, and an
increase in social spending by about ½ percent of GDP. To mobilize the necessary resources
the authorities will seek approval by Congress of a set of structurally sound revenue
measures that will raise tax collections to 12 percent. On the tax administration front, the
Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT) has drawn up a detailed strategic plan which
incorporates 106 points of action identified with technical advice from FAD.
The authorities share staff’s views of the potential benefit of advancing the timetable for their
reforms. However, they would like to reiterate that the pace of implementation is constrained
by the need to build support for key elements of their agenda, particularly those related to
revenue mobilization. In this context, the authorities have designed a well-focused strategy,
including a public education and consultation campaign, to link achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals and the Peace Accords objectives to the mobilization of
additional fiscal resources. The funding requirement and the accompanying measures that
will be identified in this process will be sent to Congress as soon as consensus is reached on
their implementation. The corresponding revenue measures will be calibrated to take account
of the resources being generated under the tax administration plan.
At 18 percent of GDP in 2004, Guatemala’s public debt is one of the lowest in the region.
Since taking office, the government has adopted a number of measures to guarantee that the
debt outlook continues to be robust. The authorities have lengthened the maturity structure of
its domestic and external debt and have begun to reduce the foreign currency component of
its domestic debt. In September 2004, a US$330 million 30-year Eurobond was placed at a
spread of 300 bps, the lowest spread and longest maturity of any Guatemalan sovereign debt
placement. By late-April 2005, the government had almost completed its financing
requirement for the year mostly through local placements of bonds in domestic currency in
maturities of 5 and 10 years at 9 percent for the longest maturity. The placement reflected not
only favorable global liquidity conditions but also renewed confidence in government
market-oriented policies.
Like other emerging economies suffering from global imbalances, Guatemala is facing
sizeable inflows of private capital and remittances that together with higher oil prices have
made more challenging the management of monetary and exchange rate policies. The
authorities plan to maintain their policy mix together with central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange market to prevent excessive appreciation of the quetzal. Since last year, the

central bank has increased its placement of open market paper and raised its benchmark
interest rate on several occasions—more recently in February 2005—to minimize the second
round effects derived from the high oil prices. The public sector has indeed provided an
important supporting role by maintaining larger than anticipated deposits at the central bank.
In addition, the central bank will continue intervening in the foreign exchange market only to
prevent excessive exchange volatility through the nondiscretionary rule introduced early this
year. The decline in inflation so far this year supports the view that the policy mix is
adequate and that in the absence of new shocks inflation will converge to the upper limit of
the central bank’s target range of 4-6 percent. The Bank of Guatemala will continue its
efforts to adopt inflation targeting as the framework for its policy, and it is thankful for the
valuable technical assistance received from the Fund’s MFD department.
On financial sector issues, the authorities remain committed to the implementation of the
plan launched in 2001 (in line with the recommendations in the FSSA) to strengthen the
financial system and ensure that it provides the basis for sound macroeconomic management
and support economic growth. A new legal and regulatory framework approved in 2002 has
strengthened supervision of the system and helped improve the performance and solvency of
banks. On average, Guatemalan banks remain well capitalized with NPL at record low and
stronger net open position. Looking forward, the authorities will focus on remaining
vulnerabilities such as: (i) addressing the persistent losses of the CHN; (ii) assessing the need
to tighten related party lending and the introduction of general provisions; (iii) recapitalizing
the central bank; and (iv) the payment system. In addition, given the importance of crossborder lending and financial integration in Central America, Guatemala will seek
convergence of banking regulations and prudential norms in the region and welcomes Fund’s
current work on this area.
The government is also committed to recapitalize and reinforce the central bank. The
approved budget for 2005 included a bond at market interest that will cover the central bank
losses for 2003 (about 0.5 percent of GDP). In addition, during the second half of the 2005,
the government will re-submit to Congress a request to approve the issuance of a long-term
zero-coupon bond equivalent to the stock of central bank losses that had been accumulated
up to end-2001. On the central bank’s lender-of-last resort facility, the government
introduced in March 2005 new regulations to complement and clarify the framework
contained in the 2002 Organic Law of the central bank.
The authorities will implement a program of structural reforms to strengthen Guatemala’s
competitive position and make the economy more resilient to shock. In 2004, the government
appointed a Commissioner for Competitiveness to promote exports and investment, focusing
on issues of infrastructure, administrative and regulatory impediments and other institutional
factors to enhance the investment climate. The government has been pursuing deeper
economic integration with Central America, and will seek harmonization of fiscal incentives
among the Central American countries as the region tries to attract FDI in the context of
CAFTA-DR. Guatemala will also benefit from the extension of the EU’s Generalized System
of Preferences (GSP).

-4-

The authorities are determined to address the structural obstacles that still hamper economic
growth and social progress in Guatemala, and will foster a business climate characterized by
transparency, good governance and the rule of law. In addition to the measures described in
paragraph 13 of the staff report, the authorities are seeking to adopt a judicial framework that
is fully consistent with the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. A number of
initiatives are already under way to prevent corruption practices, such as the revision of the
civil service law, stricter norms for contracts with states, and reforms to the penal code with
more severe sanctions for bribery and illicit enrichment.
Finally, the authorities have launched a program (Vamos Guatemala) focused on growth and
competitiveness with a special emphasis on social progress. They have restructured the
budget to ensure that public spending is targeted to the priorities of the program. Under the
social component (Guate Solidaria) for instance, the government will promote economic
development by focusing in municipalities with the highest incidence of poverty. These
objectives are designed to foster participatory socioeconomic development by focusing on
education, health, housing, and justice. This program has been initiated in 41 municipalities
with vulnerable population and unsatisfactory nutritional standards. Key components of the
program are based on partnership with the private sector, and the government is enlisting
support from the multilateral development agencies, including sector loans from the IDB and
the World Bank.
