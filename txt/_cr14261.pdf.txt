STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 30, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Sweden’s economy has re-gained speed, following supportive macroeconomic policies
and strong household demand. Employment has been rising, but the labor force
expanded even more, resulting in higher unemployment mostly among vulnerable
groups. Inflation remains very low, driven by external and domestic factors. At the same
time, financial stability risks are an increasing concern, reflecting high and rising
household debt, accelerating house prices, and Sweden’s very large banking system.
Addressing financial risks is the key policy priority. Policies are underway to further
strengthen banks’ capital, but directly containing mortgage demand is urgent now.
Longer term, this should include phasing-out tax incentives that delay mortgage
amortization and addressing housing supply constraints.
Monetary policy is balancing financial stability risks and concerns about low
inflation. Absent decisive action to reduce financial vulnerabilities, monetary policy may
have to “lean against the wind” and follow a less supportive policy course than
warranted by short-term macroeconomic conditions alone. The large policy rate cut in
July should help address low inflation, but adds to the urgency of quickly implementing
effective macroprudential measures.
Structural measures would help achieve more inclusive labor market outcomes and
reduce financial stability risks.


Additional labor market reforms can help accelerate and sustain the transition of
vulnerable groups into employment. Social partners should explore ways to both
increase wage flexibility at the firm level and, with the government, provide training
opportunities to help the vulnerable gain better-paid, higher-productivity jobs.



Alleviating housing constraints would address an important underlying factor behind
the rise in residential property prices especially in urban areas. This will require a
continued and strong effort to significantly expand the stock of affordable housing,
including additional reforms to zoning, permitting, and the rent-setting process.

It is time for fiscal consolidation. Given the strong growth outlook, fiscal consolidation
will preserve the prudent borrowing capacity adequate for a small open economy with
an aging population and significant contingent liabilities from a large financial sector.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments

2.
Unemployment has remained high,
reflecting largely structural factors. Despite solid
employment growth of around 1 percent in
2013, driven mostly by strong employment growth in
the services sector, an even stronger expansion of
the labor force resulted in the unemployment rate
remaining flat at around 8 percent, well above its
pre-crisis level of around 6½ percent. The increase in
the labor force reflected both past reforms and
Sweden’s growing immigrant population. The
increase in unemployment has been borne
disproportionately by the young, the low-skilled, and
the foreign-born. Combined with a reduced
responsiveness of unemployment with respect to
growth (i.e., Okun’s law), this suggests that much of
the increase in unemployment is structural.
3.
Despite accelerating domestic demand,
inflation has continued to decline. Headline
consumer price index (CPI) inflation averaged
0 percent in 2013 and declined slightly
to -0.2 percent in the first half of 2014.1 Core

Structural increase

1.
Sweden’s economy has re-gained speed.
Following a moderate slowdown in 2011–12, GDP
growth reached 1.6 percent in 2013, driven by
accelerating private consumption in the second half
of the year. This lifted real GDP at end-2013 to nearly
15 percent above its 2009 trough, compared to the
EU average of less than 4 percent. Consistent with
this robust performance, various methodologies
point to a narrowing output gap, estimated to
average about -¾ percent of potential GDP in 2013.

rates and excluding energy, averaged 1.1 percent in 2013 and 0.6 percent in the first half of 2014. In
part, low inflation reflected imported global price trends and the continuing strength of the krona, a
moderate depreciation during the second half of 2013 notwithstanding (see Box 1). Service sector
inflation in particular has slowed since early 2013, partly due to second-round effects of declining
fuel prices on transportation costs. Favorable unit labor cost (ULC) developments in services, with
productivity improvements roughly compensating for nominal wage growth of around 2 percent in
2013, also reduced pressure on prices (see Figure 2). While inflation expectations have drifted
downward, they remain relatively well-anchored at the policy horizon.

low interest payments on debt liabilities, as did net
trade in services, driven by an increase in merchanting trade. The moderate depreciation of the
krona exchange rate helped as well. Overall, staff estimates the krona to be broadly in equilibrium,
with Sweden’s strong external position reflecting mostly structural factors (see Box 1).
5.
Housing prices and household indebtedness have increased from already high levels.
Reflecting strong demand fueled by low interest rates, as well as structural factors such as ongoing
urbanization and insufficient housing supply, house price increases have picked up again, at about
7½ percent annual growth for single-family homes and nearly 13 percent for tenant-owned
apartments in the first half of 2014. Household credit growth remained equally strong, pushing
household indebtedness to almost 175 percent of disposable income in 2013, and over 190 percent

if debt from tenant-owned housing associations is included. Amortization rates are very low, with
about 40 percent of households having increased or failed to reduce their debt stock in 2013.
Recent data indicate that debt ratios are particularly high for indebted lower-income households
who are especially vulnerable to income, interest rate, and house price shocks.
6.
Economic policies have supported the recovery and strengthened the resilience of the
large banking sector. In particular:


Financial sector reforms continued. The authorities have rolled out Basel III measures ahead of
schedule, including implementing systemic risk buffers and plans to impose counter-cyclical
buffer and strengthen liquidity coverage

points in December 2013 and a further
50 basis points in July 2014, setting it at 0.25 percent, but highlighted the growing tension
between addressing low inflation and further fueling household borrowing.

2013

Fiscal policy remains expansionary for now. Net lending is projected to increase to -1.9 percent
of GDP in 2014, up from -1.3 percent in 2013, primarily on account of lower revenues. Given
strengthening growth, this implies—at least in hindsight—a procyclical structural expansion of
about ½ percent of potential GDP.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
The outlook is for accelerating growth. Real GDP growth is projected to strengthen
further, to about 2.6 percent in 2014 and about 2.8 percent in 2015. Exports are expected to pick up
along with euro area growth and global trade, but private consumption and investment should
provide most of the dynamics, while fiscal policy is set to consolidate. With the output gap fully
closing, staff expects inflation to gradually rise to around 1½ percent in 2015, as disinflationary
pressures from falling imported prices dissipate and wage growth picks up.
8.
Financial instability is a key downside risk. Household debt ratios have continued to rise
and remain particularly high among indebted lower-income households, and the share of new
mortgages with a variable rate has increased from over one half in 2012 to more than two thirds in
2013. While many households show large net asset positions, a significant share of assets is illiquid.
As a consequence, adverse shocks to interest rates, house prices, or income could quickly translate
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

into lower consumption, employment, and growth, and ultimately impact the banking system,
especially if these shocks occurred at a time of high global funding stress.2 Sweden’s large and
regionally connected banks are also vulnerable to a sudden increase in financial tensions in the
wider Nordic region or to surges in global financial market volatility. Conversely, financial instability
in Sweden would quickly spread to other Nordic and Baltic countries.3 (See also the Risk Assessment
Matrix, Box 3.)
9.
Low inflation and moderating global trade also pose risks. An extended period of very
low inflation could cause longer-run inflation expectations to fall significantly below the inflation
target. This, in turn, could act as a drag on growth if households and firms defer expenditures in
anticipation of lower prices in the future. At the same time, rising oil prices or a depreciation of the
krona could help lift Swedish inflation above the baseline. Geopolitical tensions could lead to lower
external demand.

The Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and the risks. They saw a
recovery driven by private domestic demand and a gradual increase of inflation to the Riksbank’s
target of 2 percent, with risks stemming from lower external demand and financial instability related
to high household debt. The authorities, however, also noted upside risks from stronger than
currently anticipated global growth.

POLICY AGENDA
11.
Sweden’s main challenge is to reduce financial risks, while additional structural
reforms will help lower unemployment.


Progress on the financial stability agenda is urgent. This will take measures targeted directly at
household credit demand and further strengthening banking resilience. More fundamentally, tax
reforms and improving housing supply will help arrest the rise in house prices and credit growth
in the medium to long term.



The Riksbank still has to balance financial stability and low-inflation concerns. Effective
macroprudential policy should be the first line of defense and would allow the Riksbank to
pursue its inflation target with less concern about financial risks.



Lowering unemployment requires structural reforms. With vulnerable groups experiencing
substantially higher unemployment rates than others, there is scope for improvement.
The time has come for fiscal consolidation. Fiscal policy has supported the recovery, but with

robust growth ahead, a steady consolidation path will help preserve fiscal buffers.

A. Financial Policies: Addressing Stability Risks
12.
A number of financial reforms are on the way. The authorities have announced plans to
further improve banks’ capital buffers, including raising minimum mortgage risk weights to
25 percent at the end of 2014 and introducing Basel III measures such as systemic risk and
countercyclical capital buffers. This should help to further improve the balance sheets of Swedish
banks. However, reflecting very low borrowing costs and strong expectations that house prices will
continue to increase, household credit has picked up again recently and, under current policies, is
projected by the Riksbank to continue rising in 2014 and 2015.

amortization plans. However, with no
sign of credit slowing down, real progress might require the gradual introduction of mandatory
amortization requirements. Such regulation has been enforced, for example, in Singapore in 2012,
where new mortgages have to be amortized within 35 years.
14.
A gradual introduction of a debt service-to-income (DSTI) limit, combined with a
lower binding loan-to-value (LTV) cap, would further help contain mortgage demand. The
LTV cap of 85 percent is relatively generous compared with that in many other advanced economies.
Nevertheless, in 2013, about 10 percent of households have taken on supplementary unsecured
loans that were in part used to help finance house purchases. In addition, given rising housing
values, even a more binding LTV cap might not keep debt-to-income ratios from rising. This
suggests that adding a DSTI limit to the Swedish macroprudential toolbox could help keep debt at
sustainable levels. It would tie households’ debt to their income level, independent of house values,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

and could work as an automatic stabilizer that helps contain excessive increases in credit (and asset
prices) relative to income, further reducing household vulnerabilities.
15.
Mortgage interest tax deductibility contributes to high household debt by providing an
incentive to accumulate debt and keep it at high levels.5 As a result, many Swedish households are
more leveraged and vulnerable to economic or financial shocks than they would otherwise be.
A gradual reduction in mortgage interest deductibility—as is, for example, being done in Finland—
would reduce this distortion.
16.
A longer-term solution to rising house prices and mortgage levels will require
alleviating housing supply constraints. Insufficient housing supply growth is a fundamental factor
behind the rise in residential property prices, especially in metropolitan areas, where ongoing
urbanization and immigration trends boost demand. This has resulted in higher housing prices,
driving up the size of mortgages. While some steps have been taken, containing house price
pressures will require a continuing effort to expand the stock of affordable housing and further
reforms to zoning, permitting, and the rent-setting process. Public infrastructure investments,
coordinated with municipalities, would also make private housing investments more attractive.
17.
Recent progress notwithstanding, there is scope for additional measures to increase
the resilience of Sweden’s banking system. This includes:


Capital. While the average core Tier I riskDevelopment of Major Swedish Banks' Core Tier

banking systems. A higher leverage ratio
requirement, such as the 5 percent minimum leverage ratio requirement proposed by the U.S.
Federal Reserve, would ensure a more substantial increase in shock-absorbers. Introducing the
countercyclical capital buffer at or close to 2½ percent—the maximum value subject to
international reciprocity—would also help.



Liquidity. Over half of Swedish bank funding comes from wholesale sources, consisting mostly of
relatively short-maturity covered bonds and certificates. According to the Riksbank’s measure of

5

Currently, mortgage interest costs up to 100,000 krona (in excess of capital income) can be deducted at a
30 percent income tax rate, with amounts over that deducted at a 21 percent rate.

SWEDEN

structural liquidity, the resulting maturity mismatch has improved only marginally in recent years
and remains low compared to other European banks. Rapid progress towards fulfilling the Basel
III Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement at 100 percent would help in this regard; and
introducing a minimum LCR requirement in Swedish krona could add to banks’ ability to
withstand a short-term krona liquidity squeeze.
18.
The size and regional orientation of Sweden’s banks makes cross border cooperation
essential. The coordinated Nordic approach to raising mortgage lending standards in Norway—with
the Swedish and Danish authorities ensuring the compliance of local bank branches—marks
important progress towards the necessary macroprudential cooperation in the highly integrated
regional banking market. The implementation of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
(BRRD) should allow the completion of the work of the Nordea Crisis Management Group (CMG)
and facilitate a binding ex-ante burden sharing agreement. Retaining the option of Sweden joining
the Banking Union would keep the door open to further improving the level of regulatory and
macroprudential cooperation and coordination across the Nordic-Baltic region.

The Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of financial vulnerabilities
and stressed that measures were under way to address them. They saw household indebtedness
as high both from a historical and international perspective. However, they also noted that the
ongoing push for higher capital and liquidity standards—often well in advance of the
Basel III timetable—should help contain emerging risks. There was also support for the call for
demand-side measures, with the Riksbank and the Ministry of Finance emphasizing the need to
make further progress on improving the amortization culture. The FSA argued that to assess
whether further policy action would be warranted, the effects of the already implemented measures,
such as increased risk weights and voluntary amortization plans, needed to be evaluated first.

B. Monetary Policy: Balancing Price and Financial Stability
20.
Inflation has been persistently below target, driven by a combination of external and
domestic factors. “Flight to safety” dynamics in financial markets, together with relatively higher
interest rates in Sweden, contributed to a strong appreciation of the krona and lowered import
prices. In 2013, even as krona appreciation eased, declines in global oil and food prices created
additional disinflationary pressures.6 Domestic inflation also slowed, in part reflecting the indirect
impact of lower energy prices on transportation services inflation. Moderate nominal wage growth
along with slightly stronger productivity growth, helped bring aggregate ULC growth down from
2.7 percent in 2012 to 1.4 percent in 2013, reducing cost-push pressures on inflation (see Figure 2).

Notes: Transportation inflation is on RHS scale to better illustrate the

21.
Staff analysis suggests that inflation will converge back to the two-percent target, but
there is uncertainty around the baseline. A Philips curve model confirms that the forces to lift
inflation from its current low level are in place, including dissipating external disinflationary
pressures and a pick-up in growth supported by very low interest rates (see Box 2). However, the
speed of convergence back to the target depends on the pace of domestic growth and external
developments, including in particular oil price and exchange rate dynamics.
22.
As long as inflation remains low, the
presence of increasing financial stability
risks forces monetary policy into a difficult
balancing act. A reduction in interest rates
tends to depreciate the krona and raise
domestic demand, which should increase
inflation. At the same time, lower policy rates
are associated with a reduction in mortgage
rates, higher overall mortgage credit growth,
and a shift from fixed to variable interest rate
mortgages. For example, a simple VAR exercise
suggests that, over a two-year period, a
50 basis point decrease in the policy rate
increases the ratio of debt to disposable
income by about 2 percentage points and the
share of variable rate mortgages in the total
mortgage stock by about 5 percentage points.
This increases financial stability risks,
particularly in an environment where buoyant
expectations in the housing market invite
speculative price dynamics.

financial stability can change. The policy rate

cuts in December 2013 and July 2014 have reaffirmed the Riksbank’s commitment to achieving its
inflation objective. However, while effective macroprudential policies must be the first line of
defense, a substantial rise in financial stability risks—such as a further acceleration in house price
increases and mortgage credit growth—might mean interest rates will have to rise sooner than
otherwise to help contain financial vulnerabilities.
24.
This only adds to the urgency of implementing a comprehensive set macroprudential
policy measures to contain rising household credit. While monetary policy can “lean against the
wind” to help subdue mortgage growth, higher interest rates than warranted by macroeconomic
conditions alone are an economically costly instrument, as the cost of credit would increase for all
borrowers, including firms. Instead, successfully addressing financial stability risks with
macroprudential measures would allow monetary policy to more freely pursue its inflation target.

The Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities agreed that low inflation and rising financial stability concerns are
pulling monetary policy in different directions. They welcomed further inquiries into the external
and domestic sources of low inflation, including the role played by monetary policy. At the same
time, they shared the view that the repo rate was not the first-best policy instrument to address
financial sector risks and that, to ensure financial stability, macroprudential and fiscal policies
required continued attention—especially given the recent reduction in policy rates.

C. Structural Reforms: Reducing Unemployment
26.
Recent reforms and relatively strong GDP growth have fostered employment—but
unemployment remains high especially among vulnerable groups. The introduction of an
Earned-Income Tax Credit (EITC), reforms to disability insurance, and enhanced Active Labor Market
Programs (ALMPs) have resulted in a substantial expansion of the labor force. Increased immigration
inflows have added to these dynamics. Despite solid employment growth overall, unemployment
rates have risen markedly among the low-skilled, especially youths, foreign-born, and older workers
while they have remained low among others, suggesting that much of the rise in unemployment is
structural.

Further reforms can help accelerate and sustain the transition of vulnerable groups
into employment. The Swedish wage formation process has contributed to creating one of the
most compressed wage distributions among OECD economies. While Sweden’s collective bargaining
institutions have, on average, delivered wage growth in line with productivity, a narrow wage range
can limit employment opportunities at the lower end where unemployment is most pronounced.
Here, social partners have an important role to play—for example, by exploring ways to increase
wage flexibility at the firm level. They, and the government, can also help the young and the
low-skilled add to their human capital. For example, developing vocational training programs that
are aligned with employers’ needs would allow these groups to gain better-paying, higherproductivity jobs. An expansion of training-based ALMPs can also help in this context.7
28.
Addressing structural housing market constraints will facilitate labor mobility and
improve financial stability. High urbanization rates and immigration flows have added to high and
rising demand for housing and boosted residential property prices.




Meeting this demand will require expanding
the supply of affordable housing, including by
tackling well-known problems with zoning
regulations and adjusting the rent setting
mechanism, which can prevent the efficient
allocation of the existing stock of properties
and, by keeping the average rent below
market levels, limits incentives for the
construction of rental properties.8 Exempting
new construction from rental regulations for
longer than is currently the case would help.
Tax reforms also have a role to play. The
capital gains tax acts as a deterrent to moving
and complicates the efficient allocation of the
existing stock of housing. A reform in this area
could be complemented by an increase in the
property tax on private residences. Property
taxation, reduced in 2008 to a municipal
property fee capped at 0.75 percent, is below
the values in many other advanced countries,
such as up to 4 percent in the U.S. and up to
3 percent in Denmark.

The Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities shared staff’s concern over high unemployment and housing market
rigidities. They were concerned over the high level of unemployment and how vulnerable groups
are affected. The authorities noted that the persistent recession, combined with an expansion of the
labor force, has contributed to the relatively high unemployment rate. However, there were differing
views among the authorities on whether the high level of unemployment is mainly cyclical or
structural. On housing, the authorities agreed with the need to address supply constraints and noted
several measures they had already taken and that over time are expected to increase housing
supply. However, in this context, they saw little scope for substantial tax reforms in the near term.

D. Fiscal Consolidation: Moving To Protect Buffers

from nearly 42 percent currently (see the DSA in the
Appendix). The Swedish fiscal framework requires a 1 percent surplus “over the cycle,” a target
chosen to build up sizable fiscal buffers. While the length of a “cycle” is open to interpretation,
under most definitions the target will not be met until later.
31.
The current fiscal framework serves Sweden well. While public debt is not high, prudent
policy requires maintaining a borrowing capacity at or below this level—in line with the potentially
large contingent government liabilities arising in a small open economy with an aging population
and a large financial sector.9 This means making clear progress towards the current net lending
target and keeping it in place for some time. In this context, there are synergies between fiscal
consolidation needs and efforts to rein in financial stability risks, including gradual reforms of
mortgage interest deductibility and the property tax to contain mortgage credit growth.

9

The 2013 Staff Report estimated the contingent liabilities from financial sector risks alone to be in the range of
17 to 90 percent of GDP, depending on the severity of the underlying event and the resolution approach.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWEDEN

The Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s fiscal assessment. They agreed
on the importance of adhering to the ambitious consolidation plan to retain the credibility of the
fiscal framework. They also saw the need to further strengthen fiscal buffers given the size of
Sweden’s banking sector and the associated risks, and to ensure the possibility for fiscal policy to
weather serious economic downturns without incurring large deficits. The authorities saw no
substantial need for modifications of the framework in the near future. The Ministry of Finance also
noted that it saw higher spare capacity than estimated by staff.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Sweden’s economy is doing well. Growth is gaining speed ahead of many European peers,
helped by buoyant household consumption and supportive macroeconomic policies. Employment
has been rising, but the labor force expanded even more. The resulting increase in unemployment is
largely structural, borne disproportionately by the young, the low-skilled, and the foreign-born.
Inflation is low, reflecting global commodity price trends and a still strong krona. Domestically, lower
imported energy prices and moderate nominal wage growth along with strong productivity gains
have reduced cost pressures. While Sweden’s external position is moderately stronger than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, structural factors, including
demographics and the large banking sector, explain much of Sweden’s high and persistent current
account surplus. This suggests that the krona is moderately undervalued or close to its equilibrium
level.
34.
However, financial stability risks are high and increasing. Sweden’s banking system is
large and wholesale-dependent, and household debt has grown to 190 percent of disposable
income on some measures while house prices are increasing rapidly. Behind this are very low
interest rates and structural factors, such as housing supply constraints and tax incentives that keep
amortization rates low. With indebtedness particularly high among lower-income households, their
vulnerability to income, interest rate, and house price shocks is high as well.
35.
Containing mortgage demand is urgent. Policies to further strengthen banks need to
continue, including higher mortgage risk weights and the introduction of many Basel III measures
ahead of schedule. However, there is little evidence that mortgage credit or house price growth is
slowing in the current low-interest rate environment. This will require macroprudential measures
directly targeting credit demand, including the gradual introduction of statutory amortization rates
if voluntary measures remain ineffective, lower LTV caps, and the introduction of DSTI limits to
improve households’ resilience to shocks. More fundamentally, gradually phasing-out the tax
deductibility of mortgage interest rates would reduce incentives to accumulate debt.
36.
Longer term, housing supply rigidities need to be addressed. A fundamental factor
behind the growth in Swedish housing prices and mortgage lending is insufficient housing supply
growth in the face of strong urbanization trends. A number of policies are available to expand the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SWEDEN

stock of affordable housing, including continuing reforms to zoning, permitting, and the rent-setting
process, and through public infrastructure investments. In addition, it will be important to improve
the allocation of the existing housing stock—for example through a tax reform that reduces capital
gains taxation while raising very low property tax rates.
37.
Monetary policy still has to balance price and financial stability risks. The outlook is for
a gradual increase in inflation, as external disinflationary forces dissipate and the output gap is set to
close on the back of strong GDP growth. However, while the policy rate cut to 0.25 percent in
July 2014 will help in this regard, very low interest rates are also likely to fuel household borrowing.
In the absence of effective macroprudential measures, a further acceleration in housing prices and
mortgage credit growth could mean that interest rates will have to rise sooner than otherwise to
help reduce the resulting financial stability risks. This will require careful consideration of the
trade-off between the possible impact on the recovery and the ultimate cost of rising financial
vulnerabilities. It also adds to the urgency of implementing a comprehensive set macroprudential
policy measures to contain household credit demand.
38.
Structural unemployment requires structural reforms. High unemployment is
concentrated among vulnerable groups where the gap between entry-level sectoral wages and
productivity can be large. Social partners have an important role to play, both by exploring ways to
increase wage flexibility at the firm level and, together with the government, to develop vocational
training programs that are aligned with employers’ needs. This would help the vulnerable add to
their human capital, which would allow them to gain better-paying, higher-productivity jobs.
39.
It is time for fiscal consolidation. Given the strong growth outlook, 2015 is the right time
to embark on a consolidation path towards the one-percent net lending surplus target over the
cycle. Doing so would help preserve the prudent borrowing capacity adequate for a small open
economy preparing for an aging population and facing potentially significant contingent liabilities
from a large financial sector.
40.
It is recommended that Sweden remains on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

Box 1. Current Account, External Assessment and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
Since its trough in early 2009, the krona has appreciated nearly 20 percent against the euro and in real effective
terms, partly driven by safe-haven flows reflecting Sweden’s relatively strong growth and solid fiscal position. 1
Despite this, the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology, using data up to June 2014, suggests
that the krona remains substantially undervalued relative to the value consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies. Similarly, the EBA approach estimates Sweden’s current account to have
exceeded the level implied by
fundamentals and policies in 2013 by

from Sweden’s large banking sector. The resulting Swedish net international investment position (IIP)
of -5.6 percent of GDP in 2013 is a substantial improvement from -12.7 percent in 2012, but the discrepancy
between the recorded net IIP and the balance implied by cumulative past current account balances has
widened over time. Valuation effects account for much of the difference. For example, if FDI was valued at
market prices, instead of the standard book value, the Swedish net IIP would be nearly 25 percentage points
higher in 2013.

A number of factors are important when evaluating the Swedish external position:
 The krona is freely floating and there are no significant policy gaps that would impact the current
account.
 Demographic factors tend to influence the current account but these can be difficult to capture fully in
a cross-country approach such as the EBA. Sweden’s high saving rate is not unusual for an aging
society, and has been reinforced by pension and other social protection reforms since the
mid 1990s, notably a phased shift to a defined contributions pension scheme and a progressive
shrinkage in transfers. High private savings tend to be associated with high capital exports and current
account surpluses (see also the text figure in ¶4).
 In addition, the EBA-estimated gap does not reflect important other structural factors shaping the
current account. Sweden operates as regional financial center for the Nordic region (with total assets
about four times GDP, Sweden’s banks are among the largest in Europe) and plays a significant role in
merchanting trade 2. Both characteristics have been shown to lead to persistently larger current

account balances, with merchanting trade in
particular having accounted for a substantial
share of the past decade’s current account
dynamics.
In staff’s view, this suggests that a significant part of
the Swedish current account surplus is structural in
nature and likely to persist into the medium term.
Staff assesses Sweden’s adjusted current account
norm to be around 2–6 percent of GDP and the
current account gap to be in the range of -½ to
+3½ percent of GDP in 2013. In line with this, the
REER gap is assessed to be in the range of -10 to +2.

A moderate nominal depreciation against the euro and the dollar since December 2013, in part reflecting reductions in
the repo rate, still leaves the krona in a position of relative strength.
Merchanting trade refers to transactions in which a resident purchases a good from a non-resident and subsequently
resells the good to another non-resident without the good entering the resident merchant’s economy. The difference
between the value of goods when acquired and when sold represents the value of merchanting services provided.

Box 2. Inflation Simulations Based on a Philips Curve Model
Swedish inflation is projected to reach the 2-percent target towards the end of 2016. However, with a
number of external and domestic factors at play, there is uncertainty in both directions. To allow for a more
structured discussion, a simple, small open economy Philips curve is estimated based on the following
equation:

 t  1   2 t 1  3 yt   4 tEA  5oilt  5 NEERt   t
where  is HICP inflation in Sweden and y is the
output gap estimated based on the Hodrick-Prescott
filter (with λ = 1,600). Euro area core inflation (  tEA ) is
used to capture imported inflation from Sweden’s
main trading partners, in addition to oil prices ( oilt )
and the nominal effective exchange rate ( NEERt ).1
The disturbance term  t can be seen as representing
supply (cost-push) shocks, and the lagged inflation
term represents adaptive inflation expectations. The
model is estimated by two-stage least-squares (2SLS)
using quarterly data during 1994Q1–2013Q4.
Alternative estimation approaches, including GMM
and system estimation, yield similar results.

Note: The model implied range refers to the simulated inflation paths (not
the WEO projections) generated using the same baseline assumptions but
with the three different models as explained in the box. This exercise
focuses on HICP which tends to be below Swedish CPI during periods of
increasing interest rates, as in the assumed baseline.

The estimated model allows the simulation of alternative scenarios of inflation going forward. While not an
inflation forecast, the exercise sheds light on some of the factors entering staffs’ projections. In a baseline
scenario, the output gap is assumed to close by early 2015, while the euro area recovery drives up euro area
core inflation, and the oil price continues to decline. In this scenario, simulations suggest that HICP inflation
will exceed 1½ percent in mid-2016 and converge to the 2-percent mark sometime between end-2016 and
mid-2017 (see the text chart above).2
Alternative assumptions about domestic growth, the euro area recovery, and energy price dynamics alter the
simulated inflation path. To illustrate possible deviations from the baseline simulation, four scenarios are
considered:
Scenario 1: External Downside Scenario. Euro area inflation reaches currently predicted levels only with a
two-year delay; imported oil prices fall by 20 percent by end of 2018; and the krona strengthens
by 1 percentage point a year over the simulation horizon.
Scenario 2: External Upside Scenario. Euro area inflation reaches 2 percent by end of 2016, two years earlier
than in the baseline projection; and the NEER depreciates moderately as safe haven flows
dissipate.
Scenario 3: Domestic Downside Scenario. The Swedish output gap closes by around end-2016, two years
later than in the baseline scenario.
Scenario 4: Domestic Upside Scenario. The Swedish output gap closes by end of 2014, and the Swedish
economy will be running a slightly larger (positive) output gap than in the baseline during 20162018.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 2. Inflation Simulations Based on a Philips Curve Model (concluded)
The simulation results show that under the
downside scenarios, the expected pick-up in

under the upside scenarios, inflation would reach

Euro area core inflation is used instead of the headline CPI to avoid potential endogeneity as oil is separately included
as an explanatory variable in the Philips curve model.
In the Riksbank’s July 2014 forecast, CPIF inflation (which is very similar to the HICP) reaches 2 percent in 2016, while
CPI inflation is projected to rise to around 3 percent reflecting the impact of forecast repo rate hikes.

1/ The calculations follow rules under Basel II, including transition rules as reported by the Riksbank. Without transition rules, the capital ratios
would currently be higher due to lower risk-weighted assets (the result of banks’ implementation of the IRB approach).
2/ On consolidated basis.
3/ From 2010 onward, exposures to credit institutions are included.
4/ Non consolidated bases, and parent banks only. Monetary financial institutions include banks and housing credit institutions.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.

2/ Based on available data.

3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.

4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year. Its relatively stable path reflects long debt maturities (> 5 years on average) and
a gradual projected increase in interest rates.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ The Baseline is constructed from historical data on debt maturity, currency denomination of debt, and other characteristics of outstanding government debt. Projections are based on financing
needs and other related variables from reports of the Swedish National Debt Office and the Ministry of Finance. In the Historical scenario, real GDP growth, the real interest rate, and the primary
balance are set to historical averages. In the Constant Primary Balance scenario, the primary balance projection is kept constant at the 2013 Baseline proejction level. The Contingent Liability Shock
scenario considers a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets. In turn, this results in adverse effects on real GDP growth, which is reduced by 2
standard deviations for 2 consecutive years. The revenue-to-GDP ratio remains unchanged relative to the baseline; the deterioration in the primary balance leads to an increase in the interst rate; and
the decline in growth results in lower inflation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 21, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The country has a full range of statistical
publications, many of which are on the internet. The quality and timeliness of the economic
database are generally very good.
National Accounts: Sweden will publish the national accounts according to the European System
of Accounts (ESA) 2010 in September 2014. As part of implementing the new ESA 2010 regulations
and standards, data sources will be reviewed. Explanations of the impact of the new regulations
and review of the data sources will be released with the data in September 2014. The following
data will be released on September 18, 2014: (i) annual national accounts for the period 19932012; and (ii) quarterly national accounts for the period Q1 1993 – Q2 2014. It has not yet been
determined when data for the period 1980-1992 will be revised to reflect ESA 2010.
Price Statistics: Sweden publishes consumer price index (CPI), producer and import price index,
and service producer price index regularly. Some changes were introduced to the calculation of CPI
and related measures from January 2014 publication in order to make index calculations more
efficient. Further, a new index called CPI-CT (CPI at constant taxes) is introduced and this index
could replace the current use of net price index in some cases. For the specific requirements of
Riksbank, Statistics Sweden also started compiling another CPI called CPIF-CT (CPI with fixed
interest rate and at constant taxes). The calculation of the CPI-CT and CPIF-CT follows the
methodology used in previous calculations of the constant tax index with some differences.
Government Finance Statistics: Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics
data will be based on ESA 2010 methodology which is likely to include revisions of the general
government deficit and debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised data series will be published in
October 2014.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics
are based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and reporting
monetary data.
External Sector Statistics: Sweden plans to publish external sector statistics in the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) format by December
2014.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May
31, 1996.
Has expressed interest in adhering to the
SDDS Plus

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Sweden
On August 28, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sweden.1
Sweden’s economy is gaining speed. Following a moderate slowdown in 2011–12, GDP
growth reached 1.6 percent in 2013 and is set to accelerate further, driven by robust
household consumption and strengthening private investment. The output gap is narrowing
and employment is growing solidly. However, with the labor force expanding even more
strongly—reflecting both past reforms and Sweden’s growing immigrant population—
unemployment has remained high and has been borne disproportionately by the young,
low-skilled and foreign-born. This suggests that much of the increase in unemployment is
structural. At the same time, inflation has remained very low, driven by external and
domestic factors. Financial stability is an increasing concern, against a background of high
and rising household debt and fast house price growth.
Financial instability is the key downside risk, especially in the context of Sweden’s large
banking system. Household debt has reached 190 percent of disposable income on some
measures, more than two thirds of new mortgages have variable rates, and a significant
share of household net-assets is illiquid. Against this background, adverse shocks to
interest rates, house prices, or income could quickly translate into lower consumption,
higher unemployment, and reduced growth, and ultimately impact the banking system,
especially if these shocks occurred at a time of high global funding stress. Sweden’s large
and regionally connected banks are also vulnerable to financial tensions in other Nordic

1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An

2
countries and the Baltics. Conversely, financial instability in Sweden would affect the rest
of the region.
An extended period of very low inflation or a drop in global trade triggered by rising
geopolitical tensions also pose risks. Lasting low inflation could cause longer-run inflation
expectations to fall significantly below the inflation target. This, in turn, could act as a
drag on growth if households and firms defer expenditures in anticipation of lower prices
in the future.
The policy framework is supporting the recovery and strengthening bank balance sheets.
Fiscal policy will remain expansionary through 2014, and the Riksbank has lowered its
policy rate to near zero. Minimum mortgage risk weights are set to rise to 25 percent at the
end of 2014, and the Basel III toolkit is being deployed mostly ahead of time. But even
though first steps have been taken to strengthen mortgage amortization and address
housing supply shortages, these measures are unlikely to stop household credit growth
against a background of record-low borrowing costs and strong expectations that house
prices will continue to increase.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Swedish economy’s strong economic performance,
which reflects supportive macroeconomic policies and strong household demand. However,
Directors noted that high and rising household debt and house prices pose financial
stability risks and complicate the conduct of monetary policy in the context of very low
inflation and high unemployment. They encouraged the authorities to persevere with their
prudent macroeconomic management while addressing emerging vulnerabilities.
Directors generally supported the authorities’ intention to embark on fiscal consolidation
soon, in light of the favorable growth outlook. They emphasized, however, the need to
calibrate the pace of adjustment so as not to hamper the economic recovery. Directors also
agreed that achieving the authorities’ medium-term surplus goal would help preserve the
policy room necessary to tackle rising demographic pressures.
Directors recognized that monetary policymakers face the challenge of balancing
macroeconomic concerns against financial stability risks. While the recent policy rate cut
should help keep inflation expectations well anchored, very low interest rates could further
fuel household borrowing, calling for an earlier policy reversal than warranted by price
stability concerns to contain financial stability risks. Accordingly, Directors considered that
additional steps will be needed to manage the associated tradeoffs through additional

macroprudential measures.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing initiatives to strengthen bank balance sheets,
but saw scope to further improve capital buffers and liquidity positions. Directors also
recommended introducing gradually macroprudential measures that target credit demand
directly, including statutory amortization rates, lower loan-to-value caps, and limits to debt
service-to-income ratios. Phasing-out the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments
would further reduce incentives to accumulate debt. Given the size and orientation of
Sweden’s banks, Directors also highlighted the importance of strong cross-border
cooperation among supervisors, and a number of Directors encouraged the authorities to
consider the potential benefits of joining the European banking union.
Directors agreed that housing supply rigidities need to be addressed to contain house price
pressures. In this context, they also saw scope for measures to improve the allocation of the
existing housing stock, for example, through tax reform and changes to the rent-setting
process.
Directors commended the authorities for the broad labor market reforms undertaken in
recent years. Nonetheless, they saw a need for further efforts to address more effectively
the high unemployment, particularly among vulnerable groups. They recommended
exploring ways to increase wage flexibility and developing vocational training programs
aligned with employers’ needs.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the value of the krona is broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals. They also took note of the staff’s assessment that
Sweden’s strong external position reflects mostly structural factors.

Statement by Pernilla Meyersson, Alternate Executive Director for Sweden
August 28, 2014
The Swedish authorities would like to thank the mission team for the report as well as for the
open and constructive policy discussions during the Article IV consultation with Sweden. The
authorities broadly agree with the conclusions and recommendations of the staff report.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Macroeconomic developments in Sweden have been relatively favorable in recent years,
given the situation in the world economy. The Swedish economy has recovered after the
financial crisis at a pace similar to that in the US and much faster than in the UK or the euro
area. Sweden is one of the few countries where GDP per capita is higher now than it was
prior to the crisis. Employment has been growing steadily by about 1 percent per year
since2010. Labor force participation is the highest in the EU. However, the unemployment
rate is still high due to increased labor supply and participation rates. Monetary and fiscal
policies have responded forcefully to the crisis. The need to support the economy by
economic policy measures will gradually decline as growth picks up and inflation increases.
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the economic developments and risks in
Sweden and internationally. According to recent data, however, GDP growth for the second
quarter was lower than expected and annual growth for 2014 will most likely be lower than
projected at the time the Article IV report was written. The recovery in the Euro area is
moving more slowly than anticipated. Nevertheless, the main scenario is that growth in the
Euro area increases in 2015 and that the international economic recovery takes hold. This,
together with a continued expansionary monetary policy, should lead to a higher growth in
the Swedish economy in 2015.
The growth in consumption and housing investment in the Swedish economy is relatively
strong and is expected to continue increasing at a good pace. As demand from abroad
strengthens, growth in the more export-dependent business sector will pick up. The labor
market has shown resilience and the outlook is stable. The labor force is expected to grow at
a slower pace going forward. And, as growth picks up, employment will rise faster and
unemployment will fall.
Due to the low inflation over the past years, a further cut in the repo rate was made in July.
The repo rate was cut by 0.5 basis points to 0.25 percent and the path indicates a slow
increase of the repo rate towards the end of 2015.

2
Financial stability, macroprudential policy and financial reforms
The authorities share the view that addressing financial risks is a key policy priority and that
it is important to make further progress on the financial stability agenda. The authorities see
household debt as a key downside risk to the economic development. Besides decreasing
growth and increasing unemployment, shocks to the economy in the high-debt environment
can affect financial stability in Sweden and the entire Nordic region given the high
interconnectedness in the Nordic (and Baltic) financial systems.
The authorities agree that measures are needed to address increases in house prices and
household debt. Several measures, such as a mortgage cap, increased capital requirements,
and higher risk weights for mortgages have already been implemented. Since many of the
implemented measures have focused on credit supply, further measures should focus on
credit demand. The government's efforts to strengthen financial stability have led to banks
voluntarily promoting stricter amortization regarding mortgages. However, the authorities
agree with staff that actions in order to further improve amortization are necessary and
should be a priority. Measures must be taken in a gradual manner to avoid jeopardizing the
economic recovery.
The authorities agree that further progress is needed to increase the resilience of the banking
system. The Riksbank shares staff’s view that imposing a leverage ratio requirement and a
countercyclical buffer of 2.5 percent, would be a desirable way to increase the shock
absorbing capacity of the banking system. The Riksbank has a recommendation to activate
the countercyclical buffer at 2.5 percent in its latest FSR. During the fall, the Financial
Stability Council will discuss further on non-risk-weighted capital (i.e. leverage ratio)
measures.
The Riksbank agrees with staff that further steps to reduce liquidity risks, through the banks
rapidly approaching a Basel III NSFR measure of 100 percent, and introducing an LCR
requirement in Swedish krona, would strengthen the banking system. The Riksbank also has
recommendations regarding these measures in its latest FSR.
Monetary policy
Staff points out that persistently low inflation in an environment of rapidly-increasing
housing prices and a related high growth in credit to households, implies a difficult balancing
act for monetary policy. This is a dilemma that Swedish monetary policy has struggled with
for some time. Since mid-2011, CPIF inflation has gradually been drifting below 2 percent,
which suggests that monetary policy could have been even more expansionary. On the other
hand, rapid increases in household debt and house prices create the risk of serious
macroeconomic consequences of the kind some other countries have experienced. The
Executive Board of the Riksbank therefore has seen a need to, to some extent, take such

3
longer-term risks into account when making the repo-rate decisions.
In this balancing act, the particularly low inflation outcomes since last autumn have
successively increased the need for monetary policy to put greater weight on the short-term
development of inflation. In doing so, there is less risk that long-term inflation expectations
will become de-anchored from the target. This will increase the likelihood of achieving the
inflation target within a reasonable time span. At the same time, the more expansionary
monetary policy now is associated with higher risks linked to household indebtedness and the
housing market. Several members of the Executive Board have therefore stressed the
importance of other authorities taking relevant actions.
The Riksbank would like to emphasize that, when it comes to monetary policy
considerations, the main concern has been the risks regarding financial imbalances and their
macroeconomic consequences - with depressed growth, higher unemployment and possibly
difficulties in achieving the inflation target - rather than risks to the stability of the financial
system. That being said, in a very negative scenario, financial imbalances may not only lead
to unfavorable macroeconomic outcomes, they can also pose risks to financial stability.
It is noteworthy that the Swedish economy has coped relatively well during the years since
the financial crisis. Sweden is one of the few countries where GDP per capita is higher now
than it was prior to the crisis and the share of the working-age population in employment has
also held up well. This reflects the fact that Sweden was not in the epicenter of the financial
crisis. Unlike many other countries, Sweden has not experienced a fall in housing prices and
difficult deleveraging processes in various parts of the economy. The different economic
situation in Sweden compared to the US and many European countries has called for a
different emphasis in monetary policy deliberations.
Fiscal stance
The Ministry of Finance broadly agrees with staff’s fiscal assessment even though the
Ministry’s assessment of the output gap and the structural balance in the near term is higher
than staff assesses. The Ministry agrees with staff that the need to support the economy
through fiscal policy measures is gradually declining as the growth outlook improves and
resource utilization picks up.
The Ministry of Finance agrees with staff that returning to surplus is vital in order to protect
jobs and welfare in a small, open economy like Sweden. Sustainable public finances will
provide scope for the automatic stabilizers to operate effectively and for active fiscal policy
in the next recession, if necessary. Since many other countries, due to problems in their
public finances, will have less capacity to tackle the next recession with fiscal policy, there
are strong arguments in favor of Sweden building up surpluses again and maintaining a low
level of debt.

4

In addition, as pointed out by staff, Sweden has a large financial sector and the latest crisis in
particular has shown that this is a potential risk for the economy and public finances.
However, earmarking fiscal surplus and buffers for the financial sector may lead to moral
hazard. The Ministry of Finance therefore emphasizes that strong financial market policy
measures are the first-best option to protect against such fiscal risks.
Output gap
Staff presents a more pessimistic picture of the potential of the Swedish economy than is
assessed by the Ministry of Finance (as well as the OECD and the European commission).
The differences between staff and the Ministry in assessing the size of the output gap are to a
large extent related to different assessments of the extent to which structural reforms have
lowered the equilibrium unemployment. The Ministry of Finance believes that the low wage
growth and the low inflation indicate a large output gap compared to staff’s assessment. In
addition, indicators on e.g. labor shortages are below average levels, which is in line with the
assessment that there is a low level of resource utilization on the labor market.
Structural balance
The staff forecast for the public sector net lending in Sweden is broadly in line with the
authorities’ forecasts for 2014–2016. However, staff makes a considerably more pessimistic
assessment of the structural balance than the Ministry of Finance, especially for the years
2014 and 2015. The different views on the structural balance are mainly explained by staff’s
assessment that resource utilization is more strained.
Staff assesses the government’s fiscal policy to be pro-cyclical in 2014. According to the
Ministry of Finance’s assessment a small deterioration of the structural balance in 2014 is,
however, appropriate considering the low resource utilization in the economy.
Structural issues
Labor market
The Swedish labor market is strong in an international comparison. Swedish labor force
participation is the highest in the EU and Sweden has managed to maintain high labor force
participation throughout the crisis. Partly as a consequence of Sweden’s generous policy
towards asylum-seeking refugees, Sweden has had a growing immigrant population. At the
same time, numerous reforms have been implemented to increase labor force participation.
Higher labor force participation implies less exclusion, but also that more vulnerable groups
enter the labor force. Higher labor force participation initially leads to higher unemployment.
In the long run, however, employment growth is determined by labor supply as most people

5
who enter the labor market eventually find jobs. Staff assesses that unemployment has
remained high much due to structural factors. According to the Ministry of Finance’s
assessment, however, today’s elevated unemployment level is due to a sharp rise in labor
force participation combined with lower demand for labor following the financial crisis.
As staff points out, the increase in unemployment from the pre-crisis level has been
disproportionally borne by vulnerable groups and, despite solid employment growth in 2013,
the unemployment rate remains flat. With regard to unemployment among young people, it is
worth mentioning that a large share of this group is studying full time.
Important steps have been taken to increase labor demand and improve education/training
opportunities to help individuals find a job, in particular those in vulnerable groups. Such
measures include improvements in the teaching of Swedish to immigrants, the introduction
of an entry recruitment incentive, increased resources to subsidize employment, and
increased income tax credit for people over 65. Nevertheless, further steps are necessary to
increase employment and reduce structural unemployment. One step in this direction is the
initiative by the government to engage in talks with the social partners about how to obtain a
more inclusive and flexible labor market. Within this framework, vocational introduction
agreements have already been signed between social partners in important sectors and
negotiations are ongoing in several other sectors. This will help young people establish
themselves in the labor market.
Taxation
Staff mentions the possible need for tax reforms. The government would like to emphasize
that as taxation-related measures overall may have a large economic impact, such measures
require broad, long-term political agreement, which does not exist at present.
Regarding property taxation, there are no plans to increase recurrent property taxes on
privately owned properties. The former property tax was criticized as being unfair and lacked
popular support and legitimacy.
The issue of mortgage deductibility is difficult. A too rapid phase-out of deductions for
interest payments can have negative effects on household consumption and the economic
recovery. A reduction in mortgage deductions would also disproportionately affect
households that are highly leveraged, e.g. younger households who just entered the market.
Any changes to the level of mortgage deductibility must be made on a long-term basis and
with broad political consensus, to reduce uncertainties.

6
Housing supply
In general, the observations and recommendations by staff are in line with the analysis and
policy objectives pursued by the Swedish government. Having said this, changes within these
areas take time and they will consequently be subject to reforms for an extended period of
time.
As to the need to reform regulations concerning zoning and permits, the government focused
its second term (2010-2014) especially on easing administrative and legal rules that slow
down and complicate the planning and building process. Among other things, an inquiry was
tasked by the government to review opportunities to streamline a judicial review of
municipal decisions that have been appealed against under the prevalent Planning and
Building Act. Work on improving how regulations concerning planning and building can be
made more efficient and conducive to housing production will continue.
As to the rent-setting process, it was, in conjunction with the regulation of the Municipal
Housing Companies, subject to reform in 2010 (the new rules being valid from January 1,
2011). Changes have been made in the special rules applying to new rental housing. For
example, the time period during which an exemption from the ordinary rent setting rules is
valid was prolonged from 10 to 15 years as late as from February 1, 2013.
As to public infrastructure investments as an available policy measure, the government
agrees with staff that such measures should be implemented. Accordingly, the government
recently presented a program that contains substantial long-term investments in housing,
public transport, and railways.
