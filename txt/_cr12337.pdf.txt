STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT, AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF AN
ASSESSMENT CRITERION
Context: After a tense campaign, President Sall was elected by a large majority and the
governing coalition secured a broad majority at the legislative elections in July 2012.
With a strong popular mandate, the government is now facing the challenge of
accelerating reforms and meeting people’s high expectations. Despite an uncertain
external environment, a moderate growth pick up is expected in 2012 and 2013.
Article IV discussions: Fiscal deficits have increased in recent years, constraining the
room for fiscal maneuver and raising sustainability concerns. The deficits need to be
kept under control in 2012 and reduced in 2013. Growth has been sluggish in the
recent past, with adverse implications for poverty reduction. The main medium-term
challenge is to move to higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The government has
an important role to play in raising the growth potential by providing critical
infrastructure, improving the business environment, and deepening the financial sector.
Exchange restrictions and regime: Senegal, a member of the WAEMU, accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement
as of June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s
exchange regime is a conventional peg to the euro.
Policy support instrument (PSI) implementation: The program remains on track.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for modification of an assessment criterion.
Main policy recommendations:


Ensure fiscal sustainability. Keep the 2012 fiscal deficit below 6 percent of GDP
and reduce it below 5 percent of GDP in 2013, and further in the medium term.



Improve public spending efficiency. Reconcile deficit reduction with addressing
the country’s social and development needs by reducing the cost of running the
government and improving the targeting and efficiency of public expenditure.



Improve public infrastructure. Finalize and promptly implement the strategy on
new energy investments and SENELEC restructuring, given its impact on growth
and the well-being of the population.



Focus on inclusiveness in growth strategy. Ensure that growth is broad-based
and sustainable, and its dividends are widely shared.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, THE OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Senegal's peaceful political transition has strengthened the country’s democratic
tradition. After a tense campaign, President Sall was elected in March 2012 with a large majority. In
July 2012 the governing coalition secured a broad majority at the legislative elections. The
government therefore has a strong popular mandate and now faces the challenge of meeting
people’s high expectations of better government, more jobs, better basic services, and a reduction
of the cost of living. Senegal so far has been moderately affected by regional instability, but the
situation in northern Mali is a source of concern.
2.
Senegal’s growth has been sluggish in recent years, with implications for poverty
reduction. Average growth was relatively strong in 1995–2005 (4.5 percent) and accompanied by a
large drop in poverty incidence (from 68 to 48 percent). Due partly to a series of exogenous shocks
(i.e., food and fuel global prices, global financial and economic crisis, and more recently, the
electricity sector crisis and drought in the Sahel), growth decreased to an average of 3.3 percent in
2006–2011. As a result, poverty incidence barely decreased during this period and still stood at
47 percent in 2011. Wide disparities exist between rural areas, where poverty incidence is higher
than the national average (at 57 percent), and urban areas (at 33 percent).
3.
The authorities’ policies since the last Article IV consultation have been broadly in line
with IMF recommendations. In successive PSIs, the authorities have pursued prudent
macroeconomic policies and implemented a number of structural reforms, including strengthening
public financial and debt management. However, because of a series of exogenous shocks and the
crisis in the energy sector, fiscal deficits in the past two years have been higher than projected.
4.
A moderate growth pick up is expected in 2012 and 2013. Economic activity in early
2012 was affected by the political tensions ahead of the presidential election and the crisis in Mali
and Guinea Bissau. A rebound in agriculture after last year’s drought would, however, boost real
GDP growth to 3.7 percent (from 2.6 percent in 2011). Growth would slightly increase in 2013 (to
4.3 percent) mostly owing to the completion of a number of large infrastructure and mining
projects. Inflation, which so far has not been significantly affected by higher international food
prices, would remain below 2 percent. The current account deficit would increase to 7.6 percent of
GDP in 2012, because of higher fuel and (drought-related) food imports, and the overall balance of
payments would record a small deficit.
5.
In the medium term, growth is expected to return gradually to about 5 percent a year,
i.e., close to the level recorded before the global financial crisis. The high fiscal deficit would be
gradually reduced to maintain debt sustainability and meet commitments made in the context of
the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). This would also allow a reduction of the
current account deficit. Inflation would remain moderate. This scenario assumes the full
implementation of the authorities’ ambitious plans to reform the state, address the energy sector
crisis, and improve the business environment.

6.
The economy remains exposed to substantial risks. Domestic risks include insufficient
fiscal consolidation, which could compromise debt sustainability; slow improvement in public
resource management, which could affect fiscal consolidation; and delays in the energy sector
reform, which could have a negative impact on growth and the budget. External risks include an
intensification of the crisis in Europe and a further slowdown in the world economy, food security
concerns related to higher international cereal prices and possible spillovers from political instability
in Mali.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Discussions focused on the policies required to move back to higher, sustainable, and
inclusive growth, while reducing vulnerabilities, and were grouped in three main themes: (i) fiscal
policies to reduce vulnerabilities and foster inclusiveness; (ii) policies to rekindle growth; and
(iii) strengthening the financial sector and external stability. There was broad agreement between
the authorities and staff on the issues facing Senegal and the policies to address them.

A. Fiscal Policy to Reduce Vulnerabilities and Foster Inclusiveness
8.
Fiscal deficits and debt ratios have increased in recent years. The fiscal deficit, which was
below 4 percent of GDP in 2007, stood at 6.7 percent of GDP in 2011. Higher deficits were justified
to a large extent by the response to successive shocks. Meanwhile, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has
increased continuously and is expected to exceed 45 percent in 2012.
9.
High deficits constrain fiscal policy and raise sustainability issues. Fiscal space has
decreased in recent years and this limits the authorities’ ability to conduct counter-cyclical policies.
In addition, the financing of deficits at the current level is challenging. An updated debt
sustainability analysis (DSA, Supplement 1) shows that current fiscal deficit levels are incompatible
with long-term sustainability. Vulnerabilities have increased, as illustrated by financing difficulties in
early 2012 ahead of the presidential election that led to delays in paying suppliers, which have since
been largely resolved. Senegal remains at a low risk of debt distress only under the assumption of
fiscal consolidation and further strengthening of debt management.
10.
The authorities are fully aware of these challenges and have taken action to keep the
fiscal deficit under control in 2012. Budget execution was prudent in the first half of the year.
Efforts to deliver on President Sall’s promise of a more modest, accountable,
MEFP ¶11-12
and efficient state are underway. The number of ministries was reduced
significantly, the senate and the vice-presidency were abolished, the rationalization of diplomatic
representation abroad has started, and a number of public agencies were closed or merged. Efforts
are also made more broadly to reduce the cost of running the government (e.g., use of telephone
lines, water, and vehicles). These measures, together with some delay in implementing certain
energy investments, are likely to keep the 2012 fiscal deficit below 6 percent of GDP, a welcome
development bucking earlier trends. However, such a deficit level still raises financing challenges,
which this year will be addressed through high recourse to the regional market and a large loan
from France.

11.
The authorities intend to keep reducing the fiscal deficit in 2013 and the medium
term, while addressing the country’s social and development needs. Their
MEFP ¶13-14
fiscal objective, supported by staff, is to reduce the deficit below 5 percent of
GDP in 13–142013 and below 4 percent by 2015. Reconciling these various
objectives will require a significant improvement in public spending efficiency. Staff noted that it
would take sustained efforts over several years to deliver lasting results and to make space for
critical new programs, such as the recently announced multi-year plan to address floods. This will
also require strong political leadership to overcome vested interests as well as good administrative
capacity. The authorities acknowledged this and have already taken action in a number of areas.
Efforts to reduce the cost of running the government will continue and produce their full impact in
2013 and beyond. A comprehensive streamlining of agencies starting in 2013 is also expected to
generate substantial savings in the medium term. Finally, the authorities are working on rationalizing
expenditure in key sectors such as education and health (with World Bank assistance) and on more
cost-effective support to the most vulnerable segments of the population. In this regard, energy
subsidies will be substantially reduced next year and in the medium term.
12.
Improving the efficiency of the social safety nets is another important objective. Social
safety nets remain very limited and as a result the authorities rely to a large
MEFP ¶15, 27-28
extent on food and fuel price subsidies.1 Staff recognized that these
subsidies are easy to implement but they have the major drawback of being poorly targeted, which
makes them very costly. Explicit subsidies to electricity consumption, as measured by the annual
budgetary transfer to the power utility SENELEC to compensate for the tariff gap, are expected to
amount to about CFAF 100 billion in 2012 (1.4 percent of GDP), as last year. Total losses in the
electricity sector, which eventually have to be borne by the budget, may even exceed significantly
this amount (Annex I). Electricity subsidies exceed public health spending and reduce the scope for
priority expenditures. They tend to benefit richer households; the poor, particularly in rural areas, are
indeed typically not connected to the electricity grid. For these reasons, the authorities intend to cap
electricity subsidies at CFAF 80 billion in 2013, which will require substantial savings based on
current projections (about CFAF 45 billion, or 0.6 percent of GDP). Part of the savings would come
from efficiency gains at the power utility SENELEC, which will be restructured operationally and
financially; there is indeed significant scope for such gains, given that power losses exceed 20
percent of supply. The envisaged savings would also require reconsidering the tariff if oil prices
remain high. In parallel, the authorities are working on broader and better-targeted social safety
nets to be introduced in 2013.
13.
Better public financial management (PFM) will improve government efficiency and
transparency. The authorities have almost completed the transposition into
MEFP ¶20–25
¶20-25
national law of the WAEMU directives on PFM and are now working on their
implementation. A comprehensive audit of agencies is ongoing, and its conclusions will be used to
1

concentrated in the Dakar area.

SENEGAL

design a restructuring plan in 2013. An audit of the civil service is also ongoing, which will help the
authorities control the government payroll. To improve expenditure efficiency, the authorities will
start using cost-benefit analysis for larger investment projects included in the 2014 budget, based
on the the project evaluation guide they expect to have by end-2012. The completion of the single
treasury account, expected by early 2013, will facilitate cash management. Finally, the authorities
intend to improve transparency in land operations.
14.
Strengthened debt management will also contribute to reducing vulnerabilities.
Progress was made last year in building capacity with the creation of a public debt
MEFP ¶16
directorate combining the two units that had previously managed domestic debt
and external debt separately. The new directorate prepared the authorities’ first medium-term debt
strategy, which recommends extending the maturity of the debt issued on the regional market–
which has a very short average maturity–to reduce rollover risks, as well as continued priority to
concessional financing to keep borrowing costs low. Occasional recourse to nonconcessional
borrowing would be considered when needed.

B. Moving to Higher, Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth
15.
Further poverty reduction requires sustained high growth. Developments in the past two
decades suggest that poverty reduction is highly sensitive to growth in Senegal (Annex II).
Substantial poverty reduction was achieved when growth was robust (1995–2005). Conversely, lower
growth in the recent period has not allowed for significant poverty reduction or increase in living
standards. A growth accounting exercise suggests that growth is mostly explained by factor
accumulation. Total factor productivity (TFP) has actually declined since 2006 (Annex III).
16.
Growth is hampered by a range of obstacles, as clearly shown in the authorities’ new
poverty reduction strategy. Among them infrastructure gaps (energy and transportation); access to
land and financing and protection of property rights; and inefficiencies in government operations.
This includes a range of issues, such as a complex and distortive tax system; the quality of public
expenditure; anti-competitive regulations and practices; and lack of transparency. Finally, some
sectors with large growth potential (e.g., agriculture, tourism) have performed poorly in recent years.
17.
The authorities and staff agreed that improving transport and energy infrastructure
was critical for growth prospects. Some of the related challenges are being
MEFP ¶26-28, 32
addressed through a number of large projects, such as the new international
airport, which is expected to be completed by 2014, and the toll highway
(whose section to Diamniadio is expected to be completed by the summer of 2013). They will help
deal with the excessive concentration of economic activity in the Dakar area. A comprehensive
reform of the power sector is also critical. With a lack of proper maintenance and delays in making
investments, the supply of electricity has become insufficient, unreliable, and costly. This situation
culminated in a major power crisis in 2010–11. An emergency plan (“Takkal”) was put in place in
2011, which has allowed a significant reduction of power outages but at a very high cost. Large
investments to restore power supply and increase generation capacity with more cost-effective

technologies would help lower the cost of doing business, especially in manufacturing.2 From this
perspective, the strategy on new investments and restructuring SENELEC, the power utility, needs to
be finalized and implemented as soon as possible.
18.
Addressing infrastructure gaps will raise challenges. Based on a general equilibrium
model developed by staff, the authorities and the mission discussed the possible impact of different
public investment and financing paths on growth and debt sustainability. The results confirm that
increased public investment would have a positive impact on growth, but also that the mode of
financing matters a lot. Relying exclusively on fiscal adjustment to finance higher public investment
looks unrealistic, while relying on nonconcessional borrowing could lead to permanently higher debt
ratios and debt sustainability problems. The best option from a growth and debt sustainability
perspective is therefore to rely on concessional resources. The model also illustrates the importance
of improving the public investment management process to improve investment efficiency
(Annex IV and Box 1). Raising TFP through reforms actually seems as high a priority as scaling up
public investment at the current juncture.
19.
There is significant scope for further improvement in the business climate. Despite the
progress made in a number of areas (e.g., creation of a one-stop shop for business registration,
easing of administration procedures for exports and imports), Senegal still ranks poorly in the 2013
Doing Business survey (166th out of 183 countries). Reform efforts are especially needed in the areas
where Senegal is still lagging well behind comparator countries, such as paying taxes, registering
properties, protecting investors, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits. A more
effective provision of business-friendly public services would contribute to private sector
development too.
20.
An ambitious reform of the tax and customs system will be a big step in the right
direction. A new tax code will enter into force in 2013. The reform aims at
MEFP ¶17-19
establishing a simpler, equitable and efficient tax system. A new customs code
will also be implemented in the course of 2013. This, together with ongoing reforms to improve tax
and customs administration, should go a long way towards reducing tax distortions and facilitating
the payment of taxes and importation by businesses.

The cost of electricity in Senegal is indeed among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa.

Box 1. Impact of Risks on Medium-Term Growth
An alternative scenario explores risks related to insufficient improvement in public expenditure
efficiency. Not all investment spending leads to effective capital accumulation. In the model-based
simulations described in Appendix V, it is assumed that one dollar in public investment spending increases
the capital stock by 70 cents on average, a relatively high ratio by LIC standards. To explore the risk that
public investment may not deliver expected growth because of capacity and/or governance problems, an
alternative scenario was developed which assumes a much lower ratio (25 cents to the dollar). This
assumption is based on the public investment management index, for which Senegal scores 0.94 out of 4.
This would reduce long-term annual growth by about one percentage point, i.e., it would correspond to no
TFP increase in the growth accounting framework. Such an outcome would make fiscal consolidation more
challenging.

Additional downside risks to growth are related to external factors. Exogenous shocks could affect
Senegal significantly, with trade, remittances, FDI, the terms of trade, and aid being the main channels of
transmission.
 Under a protracted lower global growth scenario (an annual average 1.6 percentage points below
the baseline in 2014–16, a 30 percent drop in oil prices after three years and 20 percent lower nonfuel
commodity prices), Senegal’s growth in 2015 would be lower by about ½ percentage point.
 Under a sharp downturn in global growth scenario (2 percentage points lower growth in 2013),
Senegal’s growth would be lower in 2013 by about 1 percentage point.

21.
Staff underscored that with an external environment less supportive than before the
global financial crisis, domestic engines of growth will be needed too. The focus of the new
development strategy (below) on inclusiveness is welcome and will be critical from this perspective,
to ensure that growth dividends are widely shared. Growth relying on capital-intensive natural
resource projects is unlikely to create a lot of jobs and benefit the rest of the economy, unless these
activities are adequately taxed. Conversely, growth relying on higher farm productivity and broader
rural job opportunities is likely to generate additional demand and to lead to faster poverty
reduction. Financial sector development should also be an important element of an inclusive growth
strategy (below).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

22.
The authorities’ new poverty reduction strategy addresses many of these points. The
National Strategy of Economic and Social Development (NSESD) was finalized in November 2012,
after extensive consultations with stakeholders.3 It builds on the experience with previous strategies
and articulates policies and reforms around three strategic pillars: (i) boosting economic growth,
productivity, and wealth creation; (ii) promoting human capital, social protection and
sustainable development; and (iii) strengthening governance, institutions, peace and security. It
underscores the importance of achieving development objectives within a stable macroeconomic
environment. The NSESD includes three macroeconomic scenarios and their costing, which provide
a framework for resources mobilization and expenditures prioritization. Preliminary IMF and World
Bank staff analysis suggests that the NSESD provides a good diagnostic of issues to be addressed
and constitutes a good framework for poverty reduction in Senegal. Staffs recommend the
development of more detailed programs in certain sectors, based where possible on existing
strategies, to translate the NSESD into specific action plans. Given the level of financing needs (and
the projected financing gaps under the various scenarios), staffs recommend that a particular
attention be given to the realism, sequencing, cost and financing of programs, including
opportunities for private sector participation. Staffs support the authorities’ plan to link priority
actions with the budgetary process and emphasize the need to strengthen budgetary planning
through development of a medium-term expenditure framework.

C. Strengthening the Financial Sector and External Stability
23.
The financial system in Senegal is dominated by the banking sector.4 It is composed of
19 commercial banks operating mostly in the three largest cities and representing about 90 percent
of the financial system. The banking sector is relatively concentrated, with foreign banks accounting
for a large part of the shareholder base. The five largest banks account for 66 percent of assets and
collect 79 percent of deposits. A large number of microfinance institutions (MFIs) supply limited
financial services targeting lower income households. While they cover both urban and rural regions,
about half of the sector’s activity is concentrated in greater Dakar. More people have accounts at
MFIs than at banks; this helps raise overall access to the financial system to about 20 percent of the
population. Insurance companies (25) account for most of the remainder of the domestic financial
system. The regional securities and equity market is a marginal source of funding, except for the
government. The interbank market remains underdeveloped.
24.
The banking system appears to be relatively robust, with concentration of lending and
quality of assets being the main risks. Stress-tests conducted in recent months by the authorities
and Fund staff found that liquidity risks and interest rate risks could be withstood, given that banks

An overview of Senegal’s financial system and issues was produced in the context of the pilot on strengthening
financial sector surveillance in LICs. More detailed analysis can be found in Supplement 2. Since many financial sector
policies rest with the regional authorities, the pilot will be completed with the next annual discussion with the
WAEMU authorities, scheduled for early 2013.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

are highly liquid and the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities is rather small. Only the
concentration of lending was found to be a major source of vulnerability, as loans are extended to a
few sectors and companies, and banks’ exposure to the public sector is large. These findings are
corroborated by the usual financial soundness indicators, which suggest that Senegalese banks are
on average well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, with asset quality being the main concern.5
25.
Financial depth has increased in recent years. The ratio of broad money to GDP increased
from 36 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011. Credit to the economy is currently almost 30 percent
of GDP, higher than in most WAEMU countries; it has increased strongly in recent years but remains
largely short-term and directed toward trade and food and fuel imports. A benchmarking exercise
suggested that Senegal’s financial system’s development and performance were broadly in line with
the country’s structural characteristics. However, a comparison with selected countries (Côte d’Ivoire,
Kenya, and Morocco) suggested substantial scope for further deepening. Kenya in particular has
overtaken Senegal on a number of indicators over the past five years.
26.
The still relatively shallow financial system constrains macroeconomic policies, as well
as growth and poverty reduction. Constraints on fiscal policy include, among others, rollover risks,
higher fiscal costs, and narrower scope for counter-cyclical policy. Shallowness also limits firms and
households’ access to financial services, making it difficult to deal with volatility and hampering
private investment. Finally, financing long-term public investment, which is crucial to build adequate
infrastructure, is difficult.
27.
Micro-prudential regulation of banks could be enhanced and supervision
strengthened. Some prudential ratios and rules are not in line with international best practices.
Banks’ compliance with prudential rules will also need to improve. Some prudential ratios are indeed
missed by a large number of banks. Low compliance may point to the need to reconsider certain
ratios, but also suggests a need to strengthen bank supervision. New challenges, such as the need
to monitor the rapid development of banking groups in Senegal and more generally the region, also
call for strengthened supervision. These issues will need to be addressed at the regional level.
28.
Staff also suggested that the authorities develop a holistic view of the financial system
and systemic risk. At present, no single entity within Senegal has a comprehensive view of the
entire financial system, the interconnection of its various components, and where the potential
pockets of systemic risk may lie. Such a function should be developed in Senegal as systemic risk is
likely to rise in the coming years, with increasing interconnectedness and diversification of the
financial system.

5

Only one bank was undercapitalized at the time of the mission, but because of small size and limited
interconnectedness, it does not raise a systemic risk, and it is being restructured. The ratio of gross nonperforming
loans (NPLs) to total loans is relatively high The ratio reflects to a large extent the portfolios of three banks with NPLs
in excess of 20 percent, while most other banks have NPLs below 5 percent. In addition, the relatively high level of
provisioning for NPLs mitigates risks.

There was a broad agreement between the authorities and staff on the main obstacles
to further financial development. Many of these obstacles which have been well identified in the
past few years are commonly found in low-income countries. They include:

Informational asymmetries. Lack of information on borrowers, due to the limited size of the
formal sector, the limited availability of audited company statements and the absence of credit
bureaus (and limited use of existing databases at the central bank), increases adverse selection
and moral hazard issues, and ultimately leads to credit rationing. Information asymmetries are
also an issue for the development of the interbank market.



Business and judicial environment. A key issue is the absence of formalized property rights in
large parts of the country, which increases the difficulty of using land as collateral in lending.
Moreover, the judicial process tends to be costly and slow.



Tax regime. Taxes and fees on banking and stock exchange operations are relatively high,
raising the cost of financial services.



Regulatory and supervision issues. Some regulatory ratios are perceived as excessively
constraining and curbing the development of medium and long-term credit. Also, some ratios
are not observed by a number of banks, which may affect the credibility of the regulatory and
supervisory framework. Another issue is whether the prudential framework is sufficiently
responsive to new needs that are likely to emerge first at the national level, but will eventually
need to be regulated at the regional level.



Skills. The lack of appropriate skills may explain why in recent years some MFIs that moved
from dealing with micro-enterprises to dealing with SMEs saw their profitability decrease. Banks
may face similar challenges moving from larger enterprises to SMEs. The lack of an ingrained
financial culture is also often blamed for the very limited recourse to the stock exchange.

30.
The authorities have a strategy to address a number of these issues, whose
implementation they intend to accelerate. The national consultation on credit took place in 2010
and led to an action plan with specific measures to improve access to credit for
MEFP ¶29–31
both households and firms (particularly SMEs). These measures are grouped in
broad categories covering among others: facilitating the use of guarantees; SME debt and equity
financing and general support to SMEs; availability of information; cost of credit; financial
intermediation and the judicial environment. Progress was made in some areas, such as registering
land titles and information provision. Actions to improve the efficiency of the judicial process, such
as the training of judges in economic affairs, are however behind schedule, and so are measures
aiming at streamlining and improving public support in favor of SMEs. Staff is of the view that this
action plan remains largely relevant and that its implementation should be accelerated. A number of
identified obstacles will however need to be addressed at the regional level. The regional authorities
are working on the development of the interbank market and the strengthening of the public debt
market, which they see as priorities. They also intend to review certain prudential rules. These issues
will be discussed in more detail during the next regional consultation in early 2013.
31.
An external stability assessment suggests that external sector risks are manageable
(Annex V). Senegal has recorded continuous current account deficits for nearly two decades. Low

savings relative to large investment needs imply continued deficits over the medium term, which
could become difficult to finance if aid was to decline. Although export performance has been
sluggish, inward FDI has picked up somewhat, and remittances have become an important source of
foreign exchange. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with economic fundamentals and
reserves are adequate. To reduce external vulnerabilities, Senegal needs to implement prudent fiscal
and borrowing policies, increase non-price competitiveness, and reduce further external
vulnerabilities.

PROGRAM ISSUES
32.
The program is on track. The end-June 2012 fiscal deficit target was met by a substantial
margin, reflecting expenditure restraint on goods and services and lower domestically financed
capital spending. All structural benchmarks were met, although some with delays reflecting the time
needed to build broad support for sensitive measures (electricity subsidies and tax reform; Text
Table 1). Preliminary data for end-September suggest that all indicative and structural targets have
been met, with the exception of the ceiling on budgetary float, which was missed by a small margin
(0.01 percent of GDP) because of continued weaknesses in expenditure controls (Appendix I, MEFP,
Table 1).

A number of changes are proposed in program monitoring. The end-2012 fiscal deficit
assessment criterion would be revised downward to 5.9 percent of GDP and new fiscal targets for
end-June 2013 and end-2013 are proposed. The structural benchmark on
MEFP ¶33-34
preparing a plan for restructuring agencies would be rescheduled from end2012 to end-July 2013 to reflect procurement delays. The program would also include new structural
benchmarks in the area of debt management, tax and customs reform, public investment appraisal,
and transparency (Text Table 2). The authorities are planning to use the remaining space for
nonconcessional borrowing (US$200 million), and it is proposed to broaden the scope of investment
expenditures which could be financed this way to road infrastructure (not only the highway), and
urban water and sanitation. Use of such financing would close the financing gap in 2013.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Despite a challenging external environment, a moderate growth pick up is expected in
2012 and 2013. A rebound in agriculture after last year’s drought would boost real GDP growth to
3.7 percent in 2012. Growth would slightly increase in 2013 to 4.3 percent mostly owing to the
completion of a number of large infrastructure and mining projects. Inflation would remain
moderate.
35.
The authorities’ determination to keep the fiscal deficit under control in 2012 and to
reduce it in 2013 is welcome. Fiscal deficits and debt ratios have increased in recent years,
reducing room for fiscal maneuver and raising sustainability issues. Restoring fiscal space and
keeping low the risk of debt distress require reducing deficits. The authorities’ objective of keeping
the fiscal deficit below 6 percent of GDP in 2012 and below 5 percent of GDP in 2013 is adequately
ambitious. Debt sustainability considerations call for further reduction of the fiscal deficit and
strengthening of debt management in the medium term.
36.
Reducing the fiscal deficit while addressing the country’s social and development
needs will require improving public spending efficiency. Beyond reducing the cost of running
the government and a further streamlining of agencies, a rationalization of expenditure and more
cost-effective support to the most vulnerable segments of the population will be needed. In this
regard, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to phase out costly and poorly targeted food and
fuel price subsidies and to broaden and improve social safety nets. Streamlining efforts will have to
be sustained over several years to deliver lasting results and to make space for critical new
programs. This will require strong political leadership to overcome vested interests, as well as good
administrative capacity.
37.
The main medium-term challenge for Senegal is to move to higher, sustainable, and
inclusive growth. Growth has been sluggish in recent years, with adverse implications for poverty
reduction. Growth is not hampered by one single major obstacle, but rather by a range of issues.
The government has an important role to play in raising the growth potential, for instance through
the provision of critical infrastructure and reforms to improve the business environment. In this
regard, staff urges the authorities to finalize and implement as soon as possible their strategy on
new energy investments and restructuring SENELEC. The focus of the new development strategy on
inclusiveness is welcome and will be critical to ensure that growth dividends are widely shared, jobs
are created in large numbers, and domestic demand is robust. Financial sector development should
also be an important element of an inclusive growth strategy, and staff urges the authorities to
accelerate the implementation of their strategy in this area.
38.
The economy will remain exposed to substantial risks. The main domestic ones would be
delays in reforming the energy sector and difficulties reforming the state, which would affect growth
and fiscal sustainability. External risks mostly reflect the current uncertainty about world economic
prospects. External vulnerabilities are manageable but could be reduced by implementing prudent
fiscal and borrowing policies and increasing non-price competitiveness.

39.
Staff recommends completion of the fourth PSI review. The program is on track and the
authorities’ policies for the coming period are fully consistent with the objectives of the program. It
is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 24–month cycle for
program countries.

ANNEX I. ELECTRICITY SUBSIDIES IN SENEGAL1
This note attempts to estimate the size of quasi-fiscal costs related to the power sector in Senegal. It
then discusses the distributional effects of tariff subsidies to electricity consumers. At current oil prices
and under current policies, the latter are expected to remain high until less costly technologies are
introduced. 1

POWER SECTOR: CURRENT CHALLENGES
1.
The Senegalese power sector faces tremendous challenges. The sector relies heavily on oil
imports for power generation; only about 10 percent of available electricity supply is purchased from
regional hydropower. Primarily as a result of increasing oil prices, tariffs set at levels well below full
cost recovery, lack of proper maintenance and delays in making investments in capacity to match an
increasing power demand, the supply of electricity has become insufficient and unreliable, and the
financial situation of the national utility company (SENELEC) has weakened significantly over time.
SENELEC has had a large structural operating deficit over recent years; despite significant budgetary
transfers, its net income has been negative since 2005 (except in 2009). This situation culminated in a
major power crisis in 2010–11, with regular power outages affecting the well-being of the population
and economic activity. An emergency plan (“Takkal”) was put in place in 2011 to address the
situation.

TARIFF GAP AND QUASI-FISCAL COSTS
2.
The setting of the tariff follows a well defined regulatory process. SENELEC’s customers
are billed based on the amount of kWh of electricity they consume. Prices are differentiated by
voltage, with users of higher voltages billed higher prices. A price differential also applies within the
same voltage band, with higher consumption priced at a higher tariff. Under the current regulatory
framework, changes in tariff levels and/or schedule must be authorized by the Power Sector
Regulatory Commission (CRSE in French) before taking effect. The regulatory framework includes
mainly four elements: (i) a formula to determine, under baseline tariff and economic conditions, the
maximum revenue the utility is allowed to collect to cover its operating and capital costs and make
reasonable profits; (ii) conditions that could trigger a tariff adjustment; (iii) a compensation
mechanism from the budget when tariff adjustments are not allowed by the government; and
(iv) periods for revising the formula, the tariff conditions and for paying tariff compensation if any.
3.
The tariff, in practice, has not been set to allow cost recovery; this has required
substantial compensation from the budget. Some tariff adjustments were authorized between
2007 and 2009, though not high enough to reduce the large spread between the average price and
the average cost per billed kWh.2 Because of a flawed compensation mechanism that relied on overly
optimistic assumptions about the future (e.g., when cost-effective technologies would become
available), the tariff compensation received by SENELEC was insufficient and led to losses. In July
2011, the tariff formula was revised and became more realistic. This led to a substantial upward
revision of the 2011 tariff compensation (from an initial estimate of CFAF 45 billion to about CFAF
96 billion). The tariff in 2011 was on average about 40 percent below the level suggested by the
CRSE formula. Despite this large tariff gap, electricity remains very costly in international comparison.
4.
The new tariff compensation system, while a major improvement, may not provide a
full picture of the losses in the electricity sector. This reflects a number of issues, such as
assumptions on the cost structure which are fixed for three years, or the existence technical and nontechnical losses not be entirely compensated for by the formula. While the collection of billed
electricity units has reportedly been close to 100 percent, the losses between production and billing
have been about 20 percent. This is way above usual technical losses (e.g., related to transportation
and transformation), which in efficient systems are contained below 10 percent. Total losses,
measured as the difference between the cost of units actually supplied to the power grid and the
amounts recovered, amounted in 2011 to an estimated CFAF 141 billion (2.1 percent of GDP). The
tariff gap, as measured by the formula, made up about two thirds of this amount. The rest
corresponds to “unaccounted” losses, basically reflecting SENELEC’s inefficiencies. What matters from
a public finance perspective is obviously total losses, given that SENELEC is government-owned. The
losses not compensated through the formula eventually have to be borne by the taxpayer one way
or another.

If oil prices remain high, electricity subsidies will remain large in 2012 and decline only
gradually. Absent any changes in the tariff and efficiency gains at SENELEC, the other main factors
affecting electricity subsidies are the level of international oil prices, electricity consumption, and
technology. With oil prices expected to remain high in the medium term and power consumption
likely to increase, only the introduction of more efficient production units (such as natural gas,
hydropower, or coal-fired plants, as envisaged by the authorities) could lead to a significant
reduction of electricity subsidies. It therefore makes it critical to finalize the energy sector strategy
and to implement expeditiously these investments in new production units, as it will take a few years
before they come on stream and contribute to much lower electricity costs.

DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRICITY SUBSIDIES
6.
Beyond being a drain on the budget, electricity subsidies are poorly targeted. Subsidies
are typically justified by the need to make power services affordable to low-income and vulnerable

households. However, empirical evidence on Senegal (and elsewhere) from the mid-2000s suggests
that tariff subsidies: 3



Are not necessarily benefiting the poor, primarily because most of them are not connected to
the power grid. This access factor reflects not only the unavailability of electricity in the areas
where poor households tend to live, but also poor households’ choice not to connect to the
power grid even when they can. Based on data from 2005–2006, a World Bank report shows
that all indicators on electricity consumption increase with household income. Households
with lower income are less connected, have less access, and even when they have access are
less likely to connect to the power grid because of connection fees. Connection and access
rates in rural areas were estimated at 15 percent and 39 percent, respectively.



Even if they were benefiting the poor in absolute terms, their distributional effects have been
regressive since electricity consumption is unevenly distributed across regions and income
groups. Using a simple measure of targeting, the World Bank’s analysis suggests that only
12.5 percent of the subsidies implicit to the tariff structure benefited the poor. Similarly, Fund
analysis (Senegal Selected issues, 2008) concluded that the increase in tariff (22 percent)
during 2005-2007 had a very limited effect on the welfare of poor households in rural areas.



Distort prices, and as such constitute an inefficient way of allocating resources within the
economy. A lower tariff gives an incentive to electricity customers (households and
businesses) to consume more electricity than they would otherwise do and thereby
exacerbates the burden on public finances.

ANNEX II: GROWTH INCLUSIVENESS IN SENEGAL1
This note examines Senegal’s recent growth performance from the perspective of its poverty-reducing
and distributional characteristics and discusses some policies that might be considered to make growth
more inclusive. The main findings are that poverty has fallen in the last two decades, although poverty
reduction has slowed significantly in recent years. Senegal has performed better than many regional
peers in terms of poverty reduction. Further poverty reduction will first and foremost require sustained
high growth. Public policies also have a role to play in the reduction of poverty and inequalities. Better
targeted policies would be more effective and less costly in reducing poverty. More attention to the
regional distribution of public expenditure also seems desirable. 4

POVERTY IN TIME AND REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES
1.
Poverty reduction in Senegal has slowed in recent years. Household surveys conducted in
1994–95, 2001–02, and 2005-06 show that the number of people living below Senegal’s poverty line
(the poverty rate) declined from 68 percent in 1994–95 to 48 percent in 2005-06. This drop coincided
with a period of robust growth (4.5 percent on average). However, a 2011 household survey indicates
that poverty decreased only modestly between 2006 and 2011, a period of slower growth
(3.3 percent on average). Poverty incidence therefore remains high in 2011, affecting about
47 percent of the population. In addition, there are wide disparities between rural areas, where
poverty incidence is higher than the national average (at 57 percent), and urban areas, where the
poverty rate is 33 percent.
2.
Progress achieved in poverty reduction has been more pronounced in Senegal than in
some regional peers. In 1994–2005, the share of the population living on less than US$1.25 a day
declined by about 20 percentage points, and by

WAEMU, particularly those affected by internal
conflicts or crises (e.g., Guinea-Bissau and Côte d’Ivoire in the 2000s), real per capita GDP growth in
Senegal was always positive during 1995-2011 and some years quite significant. In addition, the
elasticity of poverty reduction to per capita income growth has been large in Senegal in regional and
even international comparison. During 1995–2005, this elasticity was about 3.7 in Senegal (using the
US$1.25 poverty line), well above that of other fast-growing WAEMU countries (e.g., Burkina Faso

and Mali, where the elasticity was closer to 2). Thedifference is even larger when the US$2 poverty
line is used (Figure 2).

GROWTH AND INEQUALITY IN SENEGAL
4.
Dynamics of inequality can be analyzed using growth incidence curves. Growth
incidence curves identify the extent to which each decile of households ranged by their income level
benefits from growth. The part of the curve above zero points at the deciles whose consumption
increased with growth and the part below zero points at the deciles whose consumption decreased
with growth. A positively sloped growth incidence curve indicates that consumption of relatively
richer deciles of population increases faster than consumption of poorer deciles, which leads to
higher inequality. A negatively sloped incidence curve suggests that inequality declines as
consumption of poorer households grows faster than consumption of richer households.
5.
The growth incidence curve for Senegal between 2001 and 2005 suggests an increase
in inequality (Figure 3, left chart). Consumption increased for the groups of population from the
third to the eighth decile because the growth incidence curve is above zero, but somewhat faster in
the middle of the distribution. Therefore, the poorest three deciles of the population became poorer
in relative terms (and the poorest decile in absolute terms too) and the richest three deciles also lost
relative ground. The middle class improved their relative position.
6.
Preliminary results of the 2011 household survey do not allow identifying a clear trend
in inequality in recent years (Figure 3, right chart). The overall growth incidence curve is above zero
but broadly flat, suggesting no clear trend in inequality between 2005 and 2011, and that any trend
would be probably barely statistically significant. This overall result, however, may mask significant
differences between rural and urban areas.

ARE SENEGAL’S PUBLIC POLICIES SUPPORTIVE OF INCLUSIVE
GROWTH?
7.
Public policies may be considered supportive of inclusive growth if they help promote
growth and reduce poverty and inequality. Possible indicators include (i) the overall level of social
spending, because cross-country experience suggests that countries with relatively higher spending
on human capital, health care, pensions, and other aspects of the social safety net tend to have more
inclusive growth (World Bank 2012); (ii) measures specifically targeted at raising incomes of people in
the bottom deciles of income distribution relative to the average income; (iii) development of social
safety nets for the population in general and programs aimed at its poorest segments; and (iv) the
design of the tax system.
8.
The aggregate level of health and education expenditure in Senegal is comparable to
that of WAEMU countries, but the composition is different. Expenditure on education was higher
in Senegal than the WAEMU average, while the reverse is true for expenditure on health care, where
Senegal has lost ground since 2006 (Figure 4).

SENEGAL

9.
Public expenditure, including in the social sectors, is concentrated on Dakar, which
absorbs over a half of public resources. Other regions have lower access to public resources,
including in such critical areas as healthcare and education, which may also contribute to inequality
(Figure 5 a-b, based on World Bank analysis).

Senegal has used ad-hoc and untargeted measures to address the impact of shocks in
the recent past. During the 2007–2008 food and fuel crisis the authorities took several measures to
limit price increases on food and oil. They temporarily reduced the VAT and introduced excise tax
exemptions and subsidies for butane for all consumers. The fiscal cost of these measures amounted
to about 4½ percent of GDP during the 2-year period, with about a third stemming from a loss in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

SENEGAL

revenue. The 2008 poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) revealed that ad-hoc measures were in
general poorly targeted, because almost 55 percent of the benefits accrued to households in the top
40 percent of the welfare distribution. In February 2011, the government froze retail prices for six key
food items and temporarily limited price increases for petroleum products at the pump by reducing
the VAT base. Some of these measures were reversed later in the year. In early 2012 the authorities
introduced implicit subsidies for petroleum products.
11.
The scope and coverage of the existing social safety nets in Senegal is limited, and
most interventions are small and temporary. Senegal has two conditional cash transfer programs:
for orphaned children and those affected by HIV and children in the poorest households. Also,
Senegal has a noncontributory old-age pension, which in practice reaches only a very small and
rapidly declining number of beneficiaries.

POLICIES TO INCREASE INCLUSIVENESS OF GROWTH
12.
Sustained overall economic growth is a precondition for further poverty reduction. A
number of studies confirm that sustained growth is a key factor in enhancing inclusiveness. Berg and
Ostry (2011) argue that longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the
income distribution. Affandi and Peiris (2011) showed that growth is in general pro-poor as it leads
to significant declines in poverty across economies and time periods. Senegal’s experience seems
consistent with this cross-country evidence.
13.
Special attention needs to be paid to the distributional dimension of growth. An
increase in inequality may offset and even exceed the beneficial impact on poverty reduction of an
increase in income. Attention to inclusiveness when designing a growth strategy is therefore critical.
For instance, increasing farm productivity and broadening rural job opportunities is important to
address rural poverty.
14.
Well-designed public policies are also important for promoting inclusiveness. In this
regard, the recommendations of the 2008 Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) for Senegal
remain broadly valid. Poorer households could be protected against food and fuel price increases in
the short term at a lower budgetary cost and more effectively by redirecting resources to bettertargeted measures, including: targeting poor groups through measures such as school lunches and
public works programs; and better-targeting tariffs for small quantities of electricity to protect some
of the urban poor. In the medium term, a well-targeted and conditional cash transfer system is the
best option for assistance for the poorest. Experience of other countries in the region suggests that a
minimum social safety net can be provided more effectively at a relatively low cost. For example, in
Burkina Faso, the World Bank estimates that a basic social safety net could be set up at a cost of
around 1.5 percent of GDP.
15.
Improving access to financial services would also increase growth inclusiveness in
Senegal. A number of studies found that financial development generally increases incomes of the

38

SENEGAL

poorest households (Claessens, 2005), whereas unequal access to financial markets can reduce it by
impeding investments in human and physical capital.

ANNEX III: GROWTH PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK AND
CHALLENGES IN SENEGAL1
This note gives a brief overview of Senegal’s growth performance and its main drivers. While growth
was relatively strong during the 1995–2005, the more recent growth performance has been
disappointing. A number of structural obstacles will need to be addressed to put Senegal back on a
higher and sustainable growth path

GROWTH PERFORMANCE OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS
1.
Three growth periods can be identified over the past 20 years. Economic performance
was poor in the early 1990s, before the 1994 CFA franc devaluation. Senegal then recorded a period
of strong growth in 1995–2005, with growth averaging 4.5 percent. This average masks relatively
large fluctuations (although less than during the previous decades) reflecting volatility in agriculture
output, with growth approaching or exceeding 6 percent certain years or dropping below 3 percent.
Due to a series of exogenous shocks starting in 2006 (i.e., food and fuel global prices, global financial
and economic crisis, and more recently, the electricity sector crisis and drought in the Sahel), growth
decreased to an average of 3.3 percent in 2006–2011.

Senegal’s growth was less favorable than that of fast-growing sub-Saharan African
(SSA) countries. Although growth in Senegal since the mid-1990s has been better than in a number
of WAEMU countries and strong enough to ensure an increase in per capita income, it has fallen
short of the authorities’ target under successive poverty reduction strategies (PRS) and has been

Activity has increased faster in the tertiary sector. This has been particularly the case in
transport and telecommunication, which together have contributed by about one percentage point
to GDP growth (Table 2). While the share of the tertiary sector in GDP has increased significantly, the
share of the secondary sector has remained about constant and that of the primary sector (including
agriculture) has decreased. The observed productivity increase in agriculture and the structural shift
toward the services sector suggest that Senegal has experienced a pattern of economic
transformation quite typical in developing countries.

Growth has been driven mainly by public investment and remittances-fueled private
consumption (Table 3). Remittances grew by more than 20 percent per year between 1995 and
2005 and have become a major source of external financing for the economy. Public investment also
grew substantially between 2000 and 2005. The export sector, however, performed relatively poorly

Growth has been factor-intensive. A growth accounting exercise suggests that growth is
mostly explained by factor accumulation (Table 4).2 Total factor productivity (TFP) actually declined
before the mid-1990s, and again since 2006. It only grew modestly during the decade of robust
growth (1995–2005). A number of factors could explain this poor productivity performance. First, the
TFP decline in the past five years coincides with the deterioration of Senegal’s doing business and
governance indicators, which could have affected the productivity of both public and private
investment. Second, large and increasing remittances might have been invested in sectors less likely
to spur growth (such as housing and informal trade).

MEDIUM TERM GROWTH OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
6.
The medium-term growth projections in the program assume a return to positive TFP
growth. Growth is projected at 3.7 percent in 2012, 4.3 percent in 2013, and an average
5 percent per year over 2014–17. Given the demographic trends and the assumptions made on
investment, such a growth path implicitly assumes that ongoing and planned reforms will improve
economic efficiency and restore TFP growth to levels comparable to those observed in 1995–2005

Obstacles to higher and sustainable growth have been identified. The authorities are
finalizing their new growth strategy, which was not available at this writing. The previous one (the
Accelerated Growth Strategy, or AGS) focused on five priority sectors: agriculture and agribusiness,
fisheries, tourism, clothing and textiles, and telecommunication and ICT-enabled services. Some of
these sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, are

Agriculture and agribusiness. The authorities
and World Bank staff see important opportunities
for growth in horticulture for exports, and in rice
and other cash crops production and livestock
development, primarily for the domestic market.
A favorable climate for year-round fresh
vegetables and fruit and a relatively short
distance to the European market put Senegal in a

very good position. The potential for efficiency
gains in the agriculture sector is large, as illustrated by the relatively low cereal yields (Table 6).

This assumption is critical to medium-term growth prospects; without it, per capita income
would continue to increase only very slow.

However, this will require modernizing the sector, which is primarily composed of small, family
farming, and relies heavily on rainfall and the use of traditional production techniques. Obstacles
to access to land and credit, which limit potential involvement of private businesses, will need to
be addressed too.


Tourism. Given its natural endowment and cultural heritage, as well as its proximity to Europe,
the potential for the development of business and cultural tourism is substantial. Senegal scores
fairly well in terms of the number of tourist arrivals, but poorly regarding spending per tourist.
The sector has lost substantial market share in Africa over the last 15 years. This trend can
probably be reversed, but it will take a range of measures to improve the offer and market the
destination.

The development of a
dynamic private sector in Senegal is still hampered by a range of issues. Despite the progress made
in a number of areas (e.g., creation of a one-stop shop for business registration, easing of
administration procedures for exports and imports), Senegal’s still ranks only 154th out of 183
countries surveyed for the 2012 Doing Business report. Reform efforts are especially needed in the
areas where Senegal still lagging well behind comparator countries, such as paying taxes, registering
properties (see chart), protecting investors, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction
permits. More generally, a more effective provision of business-friendly public services would
contribute to private sector development.

ANNEX IV: IMPLICATIONS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT
SCALING UP IN SENEGAL1
This note looks at the impact of higher debt-financed public investment on growth and debt
sustainability, using an open-economy dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) model developed by
Buffie et al. (2012). Several scenarios are constructed by altering assumptions about the
composition of financing. The results of the model suggest that increased public investment would
have a positive impact on growth, but could lead to debt sustainability problems if financed mainly
by nonconcessional borrowing. This conclusion is consistent with latest debt sustainability analysis
for Senegal. 1

INTRODUCTION
1.
An ambitious investment policy has been central to Senegal’s development
strategy. Public investment as a share of GDP has doubled since 2000, rising from 5½ percent to
nearly 11 percent in 2011. With the support of donors, the authorities have focused investment
spending on expanding and modernizing transport infrastructure to facilitate access to markets.
Major infrastructure projects include the Blaise Diagne International Airport, the DakarDiamniadio toll road, other road projects, and the modernization of the port of Dakar. These
projects are intended to spur private sector development, diversify economic activity away from
Dakar, and support poverty reduction.
2.
This note explores the impact of a higher public investment path in the next few
years. The public investment ratio is expected to remain relatively high in the program’s
macroeconomic framework for 2012–17. This note assumes a further scaling up of public
investment to 15 percent of GDP in 2013 and a subsequent gradual decrease back to levels
assumed in the program. The spike in the next few years, while not the program’s central
scenario, is based on the pipeline of current and future investment projects maintained by the
authorities; it is therefore plausible, and implicitly corresponds to an early implementation of
major investments in the energy and transport sectors.

MODEL CALIBRATION
3.
The model’s parameters were calibrated to match data for the Senegalese
economy. Table 1 summarizes the calibration of the main parameters. In those instances where
Senegal-specific estimates were not available, the parameters were set to fit a “generic” lowincome country (LIC), as described by Buffie et al. Key parameters affecting debt dynamics are
absorptive capacity, the return on infrastructure investment, investment efficiency, and user fees.

4.
Absorptive capacity constraints are significant in Senegal. When absorptive capacity
is limited, high investment rates lead to large cost overruns, usually due to coordination
problems or supply bottlenecks during the implementation phase of public investment projects.
The assumption for Senegal is that, on average, public investment projects incur costs overruns
equal to 74 percent of the size of the initial investment. This estimate is based on data provided
by the authorities on initial estimates and final costs of large infrastructure projects in Senegal.
To arrive at costs overruns equal to 74 percent of initial investment, taking into account the
projected path of investment, the parameter that controls absorptive capacity constraints was set
to 11.
5.
The gross return on infrastructure investment is assumed to be 31.3 percent.
Estimates of the return on infrastructure investment vary significantly. Foster and BriceñoGarmendia (2010) found returns ranging from 17 to 24 percent on electricity, water and
sanitation, irrigation, and road projects. Estimates by Dalgaard and Hansen (2005) cluster
between 15 percent and 30 percent. Buffie et al. assume a 30 percent return on infrastructure
investment for a generic LIC. The assumption of a 31.3 percent return in Senegal is taken from

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

SENEGAL

work by Dessus and Herrera (1996) on the impact of public investment on growth in developing
countries.
6.
Not all investment spending is assumed to contribute to capital accumulation. The
investment efficiency parameter captures the idea that some investment spending may be
wasted or spent on poor projects. The assumption here is that each dollar of public investment in
Senegal increases the stock of productive infrastructure by 70 cents. This assumption is based on
Briceño-Garmendia et al. (2011) and compares with a benchmark value of 0.60 used by Buffie et
al. for sub-Saharan Africa.2
7.
User fees allow governments to recoup a significant share of recurrent costs
associated with the use of public capital. Even if investment has a high rate of return, it may
not pay for itself from a fiscal perspective if user fees are low and the benefits of investment
accrue mainly to the private sector. The estimate of 0.83 for Senegal is based on BriceñoGarmendia et al. (2011) and IMF staff estimates. According to Briceño-Garmendia et al. (2011),
tariffs in the power and water sectors cover 72 and 91 percent of recurrent costs. Estimates of
tolls collected on the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road point to 85 percent of recurrent costs covered
by the collection of user fees. The estimate of 83 percent for Senegal compares to a sub-Saharan
African benchmark value of 0.50 used by Buffie et al.
8.
Steady-state ratios and other parameters were set to either their average over the
past 10 years or the level at end-2011. The model generates results by comparing the
projected values of certain variables with their steady state values. For example, the steady state
value for investment spending was set to 9.5 percent of GDP, equal to the average level of public
investment to GDP over the last ten years. The model then assesses the impact of a projected
increase in investment spending from the steady state level.

BASELINE SCENARIO
9.
Higher public investment, financed through a combination of concessional and
nonconcessional external borrowing and domestic borrowing, would increase permanently
per capita income but also raise significantly the debt ratio over the medium term. This
scenario most closely resembles the current financing mix in Senegal, where the government
finances public investment through a combination of external and domestic sources.3 The supply
of concessional financing is assumed here to be finite and decreasing over time, while
nonconcessional financing gradually increases (both variables are exogenous). Domestic
financing is generated endogenously by the model to cover the remaining gap. Public debt rises
to 60 percent by the 10th year of the projection period before starting to decline (Figure 1). The
2

According to Briceño-Garmendia et al., 70 percent of public investment spending goes to capital expenditures
and the rest goes to operations and maintenance. Based on the concept of efficiency of public investment in the
model, this translates into a value of 0.70 for the efficiency parameter.

Domestic borrowing in this case also includes borrowing from investors in the WAEMU area.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
10.
Relying exclusively on fiscal adjustment to finance higher public investment looks
unrealistic. In this first alternative scenario, the government is assumed to finance public
investment by increasing consumption taxes as necessary while avoiding any recourse to
borrowing. The results suggest that economic growth would accelerate and the ratio of public
debt to GDP would decrease marginally, but the consumption tax rate would need to jump from
18 percent to 33 percent and remain at elevated levels over the medium term, which does not
seem feasible (Figure 2).
11.
Financing higher public investment with concessional borrowing, without any fiscal
adjustment, appears to be the best option from a growth and debt sustainability
perspective. If the government is assumed to have unlimited access to external concessional
financing to cover all planned investment spending, the results would be generally favorable.
Public debt to GDP would initially rise, reaching 57 percent by the eighth year of the projection
period, but trend downward thereafter (Figure 3). The boost to growth would be even greater
than in the fiscal adjustment and baseline scenarios, since consumption and private investment
would not be impacted by higher taxes or domestic borrowing. The question, though, is whether
unlimited access to external concessional financing is a realistic assumption. Recent history

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

SENEGAL

suggests that concessional resources are limited and will need to be supplemented by other
types of financing.

Relying exclusively on nonconcessional external borrowing would lead to a
permanently higher debt ratio, raising debt sustainability concerns. Similar to the previous
scenario, external borrowing without any fiscal adjustment would have a positive impact on
growth, due to higher levels of public investment, private investment, and consumption (Figure
4). However, the higher cost of borrowing would result in a rapid and continuous increase in the
debt, with the ratio of public debt to GDP reaching 68 percent by the end of the projection
period.4

CONCLUSION
13.
The results of the model suggest that a modest scaling up of public investment
would benefit growth without jeopardizing debt sustainability, provided it was not
financed exclusively through nonconcessional borrowing. Financing public investment
through concessional borrowing would yield even more favorable results, assuming such
financing was available. It should be noted that the outcome depends critically on key structural
conditions, such as absorptive capacity, the return on infrastructure investment, investment
efficiency, and user fees. By improving the structural environment for public investment, Senegal
could arguably pursue a more ambitious investment program without threatening debt

4

Nonconcessional borrowing is assumed to carry a real interest rate of 6.5 percent, equal to a nominal rate of
9 percent (close to the initial yield on the 2011 Eurobond) minus a 2.5 percent world inflation rate.

sustainability. Conversely, a worsening of the structural environment would call for a more
cautious approach.

ANNEX V: EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT AND
MATRIX
This note assesses external stability in the Senegalese economy. Senegal has recorded continuous
current account deficits over the past decade, financed mainly by official flows, including aid. The
export sector has not gained market share, inward FDI has picked up somewhat, and remittances have
become an important source of foreign exchange. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, and reserves are adequate. To enhance competitiveness, Senegal needs to
implement structural measures to improve the business environment.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
1.
Over the past decade, Senegal has recorded continuous current account deficits,
financed mainly by official flows, including aid. Since 2000, current account deficits have
averaged about 8 percent of GDP (Table 1). These deficits have been financed mainly by grants and
government borrowing (particularly project loans and, more recently, nonconcessional commercial
borrowing). Senegal is therefore exposed to shifting donor and market sentiment. The estimated
2011 current account deficit of 6.1 percent of GDP is in line with the estimated current account
“norm” for Senegal of about 6 percent (see below).

Despite a favorable enabling environment
for exports, Senegal’s export sector has not gained
market share. Senegal’s share of world exports has
been relatively flat over the past decade (Figure 1). This
outcome is somewhat surprising considering that
Senegal enjoys a strategic geographic position and a
relatively competitive framework for exports, including
the absence of taxes on exports and low shipping
costs.1

Foreign direct investment in Senegal has
increased somewhat in recent years, but remains
low compared to comparator Sub-Saharan
African countries. Inward FDI averaged about
2 ercent of GDP from 2000-2005 before spiking in
2006 (Figure 2). For the last three years, FDI has
averaged about 3 percent of GDP, compared to
over 7 percent of GDP on average in other lowermiddle-income Sub-Saharan African (LWI SSA)
countries, as classified by the World Bank.2
4.
Workers’ remittances are an important
and relatively stable source of foreign exchange.
Remittances have grown every year since 2000,
with the exception of 2009, when they fell 6 percent
following the onset of the global financial crisis
(Figure 3). In 2011, remittances were equal to
13 percent of GDP, equal to nearly half of exports
of goods and services and more than four times FDI
inflows.

EXCHANGE RATE
5.
The real exchange rate has depreciated
6½ percent over the last year, reaching its
lowest level in over a decade. Both the real and
nominal effective exchange rates (REER and NEER)
appreciated about 10 percent from 2006 to 2009,
contributing to an erosion of price competitiveness.
During the first half of 2010, however, the REER and
NEER fell sharply due to weakness of the euro.
Following a brief period of appreciation, the
weakening trend has resumed over the past year.

summarized in Table 2, show no conclusive evidence that the real exchange rate is overvalued or
undervalued. This finding is consistent with the exchange rate assessment made for the WAEMU as
a whole in 2012.
Macroeconomic balance approach
7.
The macroeconomic balance approach calculates the difference between the current
account balance projected over the medium term (the “underlying” current account) and an
estimated current account “norm” based on projected values of medium-term economic
fundamentals. The exchange rate adjustment that would eliminate this difference over the medium
term is then calculated using an estimated elasticity of the current account with respect to the real
exchange rate. Senegal’s current account norm is calculated to be between -5.6 and -6.5 percent of
GDP, based on coefficients estimated by Vitek (2012) and Lee et al. (2008) (Table 3). Assuming a
trade balance elasticity of -0.71 for small countries, the difference between the underlying current
account and the current account norm indicates an REER misalignment between -1.2 percent and
0.0 percent.3
Equilibrium real exchange rate approach
8.
The equilibrium real exchange rate
approach directly estimates an equilibrium
exchange rate as a function of medium-term
fundamentals. The exchange rate adjustment
needed to restore equilibrium over the medium
term is then calculated as the difference between
the estimated equilibrium real exchange rate and
its current value. In the case of Senegal, the REER at
end-2011 was 8.5 percent below its estimated
equilibrium value (Figure 5).
External sustainability approach
9.
The external sustainability approach calculates the difference between the underlying
current account balance and the balance that would stabilize net foreign assets (NFA) at some
benchmark level. Using the same elasticity as in the macroeconomic balance approach, the
exchange rate misalignment is equal to the adjustment necessary to bring the underlying current
account in line with its NFA-stabilizing level. The current account balance necessary to stabilize
Senegal’s NFA-to-GDP ratio at its 2010 level (-48 percent) is estimated to be -3.4 percent compared
to an underlying current account of 6.0 percent. Applying a trade balance elasticity of -0.71 implies a
3.2 percent REER overvaluation.

STRUCTURAL COMPETITIVENESS
10.
Senegal’s competitiveness depends critically on improving the business environment.
Although Senegal has taken steps in recent years to improve the business environment, a number of
competitiveness indicators suggest that much more needs to be done. According to various surveys,
the business environment is notably hampered by poor investor protection, cumbersome
procedures for paying taxes and registering property, inadequate supply of infrastructure, difficulty
accessing financing, and corruption.




In the 2013 edition of the World Bank’s Doing
Business report, Senegal ranks 166 out of 185
countries. Its worst ranking (180) is in the getting
electricity category. Other categories where
Senegal scores poorly include paying taxes (178),
registering property (173), and protecting
investors (169). Senegal ranks below most other
lower- and upper-middle-income Sub-Saharan
countries (Figure 6).
The World Economic Forum ranks Senegal 111
out of 142 countries in its 2011-2012 Global
Competitiveness Report (Figure 7). Weaknesses
identified by the report include infrastructure
(122), health and primary education (119), and
higher education and training (110). The highest
rankings are for business sophistication (86) and
innovation (53).

Senegal’s government effectiveness, as measured by

below average compared to lower- and upper-middle-income Sub-Saharan countries and has been
trending downward over the past decade (Figure 8).

factor for doing business in Senegal.

Background. The domestic saving rate is low, while investment
needs are high. Despite large remittances, this generates high
current account deficits, which are covered to a large extent by aid.
The deficit has increased significantly in the past two years,
reflecting a number of exogenous factors (e.g., oil prices, drought)
and higher fiscal deficits.
Assessment. The current account deficit needs to decrease in the
next few years to remain financeable and reduce dependency on aid,
which may be reduced with fiscal consolidation in advanced
economies; fiscal consolidation will play an important role to achieve
this.
Background. Senegal is part of the WAEMU. The CFA franc is
pegged to the euro, which depreciated significantly in recent
months.
Assessment. The three CGER methods do not suggest a significant
misalignment (with results based on end-2011 data ranging from -8
to +4 percent). These findings are in line with those for the WAEMU.
While the level of the real exchange rate is not an issue,
competitiveness could increase through structural reforms to
improve the business environment
Background. Official flows (both program and project) have
accounted for a significant share of financing in recent years. FDI
and portfolio investment are less significant. The overall balance of
payments recorded a deficit last year, and is expected to record
another one this year.
Assessment. The sustainability of capital account flows depends
mainly on donor and market sentiment toward Senegal’s
government, which depends on forceful fiscal consolidation and
implementation of structural reforms to boost growth.
Background. At the WAEMU level reserves amount to over 6
months of imports, 60 percent of broad money, and 100 percent of
short-term debt. Common reserves can be used to finance the
needs of individual WAEMU countries.
Assessment. The level of foreign exchange reserves of the WAEMU
is adequate.
Background. Gross external debt is relatively low (at 30 percent of
GDP) but has increased substantially in the past few years. It consists
mainly of concessional loans from official creditors.
Assessment. The net IIP position at -30 percent of GDP in 2012
currently presents limited risk, but the DSA shows that fiscal
consolidation is required to stabilize it.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Overall assessment. The
external position has
weakened recently, and is
weaker than desirable, even
though risks appear
manageable at this juncture.
Low savings relative to
substantial investment needs
imply substantial current
account deficits. External
liabilities are significant and
growing.
Potential policy responses
Fiscal consolidation and
prudent borrowing should
help reduce external
vulnerabilities. The real
exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals, but structural
reforms would boost
growth, increase
competitiveness, and reduce
further external
vulnerabilities.

ANNEX VI. LETTER OF INTENT
Dakar, Senegal
November 22, 2012
Mrs. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20431
USA

Madame Managing Director,
1.

The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews the

implementation at end-June 2012 of the government’s three-year macroeconomic and structural
program (2010–2013) supported under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The memorandum also
sets out the macroeconomic objectives for the remainder of 2012 and for 2013 and updates the
structural reforms monitored under the program.
2.

The government is satisfied with progress made in the implementation of the program and

requests completion of the fourth review. All of the program’s quantitative assessment criteria for
end-June 2012 have been met. As a result of efforts to control public spending, the fiscal deficit at
end-June 2012 was met by a substantial margin. All the structural benchmarks were met, although
some of them needed more time than expected. Significant progress has also been made in
implementing structural reforms.
3.

The government is strongly committed to pursuing its efforts to control public spending

with aim of reducing the fiscal deficit to levels consistent with debt sustainability. In this context, and
taking into account recent fiscal developments, we are targeting a fiscal deficit of below 6 percent of
GDP in 2012 and suggest modifying the relevant assessment criterion accordingly. The budget
proposal submitted to Parliament for 2013 sets the deficit at 4.9 percent of GDP. The efforts to
control the fiscal deficit will be pursued over the medium term. Reconciling this objective with the
development needs of the country will require greater efficiency in public spending, a major
undertaking we fully embrace.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

4.

More generally, reforms will be pursued to improve transparency, public governance and

promote private sector development. In this context, the government proposes to reprogram the
structural benchmark on action plan for the restructuring of government agencies from end-2012 to
end-July 2013.
5.

The government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are

appropriate to achieve the objectives of the PSI-supported program. Given its commitment to
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, the government will promptly take any additional
measures needed to achieve the objectives of the program. The government will consult with the
IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests such a
consultation—before the adoption of any such measures or in the event of changes to the policies
contained in the attached MEFP. Moreover, the government will provide the IMF with such
information as the IMF may request in connection with the progress made in implementing the
economic and financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program.
6.

The government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached MEFP, and the Staff

Report relating to the current review.

Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT I: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES
Dakar, November 22, 2012
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The government is pleased to have met its commitments in challenging circumstances
and remains determined to pursue the program objectives. The government has: (i) provided
support for the rural environment, affected by the consequences of a poor crop year 2011/2012;
(ii) worked to reduce prices for essential food staples (rice, oil, and sugar); (iii) taken steps to reduce
the cost of running the government and streamline public expenditure; and (iv) continued the
reforms in the energy sector. Furthermore, the government is pressing ahead with implementation
of the program supported by the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) and broadly shares its objectives.
2.
This memorandum updates the PSI program over the period 2012–13.1The four main
objectives of the program are as follows: (i) conduct a cautious policy in the area of public finance
and borrowing to preserve macroeconomic stability; (ii) raise revenue to generate more fiscal space
to finance priority spending; (iii) further strengthen PFM and governance; and (iv) promote private
sector development through structural reforms. The MEFP includes three sections. The first covers
recent economic developments and program performance. The second section focuses on
macroeconomic objectives for the remainder of 2012, 2013, and the medium term, as well as
macroeconomic policy and structural reforms. The final section summarizes proposed changes in
program monitoring.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM
IMPLEMENTATION
Recent macroeconomic developments have been broadly in line with program assumptions.
The year 2012 was characterized by a challenging pre-election environment in the country, sluggish
economic activity in the first quarter exacerbated by sociopolitical tensions in Mali and GuineaBissau, social demands resulting from the poor harvest, and high prices for essential food items.
However, economic activity in the non-agricultural sector, as measured by the general activity index,
recorded an upturn of 2.3 percent year-on- year during the first half of 2012. Overall, the projected
increase in real GDP in 2012 was revised slightly downward, from 3.9 percent to 3.7 percent, after
2.6 percent in 2011. Inflation turned out at 1.5 percent over the first six months of 2012, driven by
rising prices of nonalcoholic beverages and foodstuffs, in particular unprocessed cereals. External
merchandise trade was characterized over the first half of the year by a substantial increase in
imports (approximately 34 percent, mainly foodstuffs and petroleum products), as well as by a slight
downturn in exports. Credit to the economy grew sharply over one year (almost 17 percent), while
the money supply expanded by just 5 percent.

The content of this program was set out in the initial MEFP of November 10, 2010, and in the MEFPs of
May 19, 2011, December 2, 2011, and June 22, 2012.

3.
Program implementation has been satisfactory. All quantitative assessment criteria and
indicative targets for the program at end-June 2012 were met, including the target for the budget
deficit owing to efforts to curb government expenditure. The implementation of all structural
reforms is also making significant headway:
(i) An action plan on subsidies for electricity consumers was prepared and adopted in
October 2012;
(ii) An operational and financial restructuring plan for SENELEC was prepared and adopted in
November 2012 with a view to its immediate implementation;
(iii) A medium-term debt management strategy was prepared and finalized by September
30, 2012;
(iv) The new general tax code was finalized and submitted to parliament in November 2012;
(v) The draft law on transparency was adopted at a meeting of the Council of Ministers and
submitted to parliament, and the decree on the transposition of the WAEMU directive on budget
nomenclature has been signed.
4.
The government has continued its efforts to reduce the cost of running the government and
streamline public institutions; the abolition of the upper chamber of parliament (the Senate) reflects
this policy and illustrates our commitment to reform.

III. MACROECONOMIC POLICY AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS
FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2012, 2013, AND THE MEDIUM
TERM
A. Medium-term Objectives
5.
Senegal’s development strategy is designed to ensure that Senegal becomes an
emerging economy, committed to the values of solidarity and self-respect, respect for others
and the commonwealth, justice, fairness, and a sense of duty. The new National Strategy for
Economic and Social Development (NSESD) was completed in November 2012.

B. Macroeconomic Context for 2013
6.
Unfortunately, the external environment is expected to remain not very supportive.
Despite the modest upturn in the global economy expected in 2013, high oil and cereal prices, as
well as social and political tensions within the subregion (in Mali and Guinea-Bissau), will continue to
have an adverse effect on economic activity, external accounts, and public finances in Senegal.
7.
Notwithstanding the sluggish international environment, GDP growth is expected to
tick up to 4.3 percent in 2013. This upturn would be supported primarily by the coming on-stream
of major projects in the electricity, road and highway sectors, the improvement of electric power
distribution, the continued recovery of the agricultural sector, the implementation of the Grande
Côte heavy ores project (zircon) and the Golouma and Massawa gold mine projects, the launching
of projects funded by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), as well as the execution of projects

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

in the social sectors. Inflation is expected to remain moderate at around 2 percent in 2013. The
current account deficit of the balance of payments, although declining, is expected to remain high
because of imports related to investment in the energy and mining sectors. The overall balance of
the balance of payments is expected to record a slight deficit.
8.
The risks remain mainly on the downside. A resurgence of the euro zone crisis and global
stagnation are primary downside risks for the Senegalese economy. Other downside risks are rising
oil prices, food security (rising international prices of cereals and the threat of locusts), as well as
spreading instability from Mali. Domestically, the main risks are related to flooding driven by poor
sanitation, delays in implementation of energy sector reforms, and possible resistance to
government reform or to improvements in the quality of public expenditure, which could adversely
affect the objective of keeping public finances under control.
9.
The progress recorded and new challenges in implementing the main measures under the
program are presented in the remainder of this section, grouped in accordance with the four main
objectives of the program.

C. Pursue Prudent Public Finance and Debt Policies to Safeguard
Macroeconomic Stability
10.
The objective of controlling the budget deficit for 2012 remains unchanged. This is a
key commitment for the new government, which intends to proceed along the lines set during the
third program review, in spite of challenging circumstances. Recent developments in international oil
prices point to smaller than anticipated revenue losses associated with the stabilization of domestic
oil prices; we intend to earmark these savings for reducing the budget deficit. Delays in
implementation of certain investments in the energy sector partly explain why the deficit will be
lower than the target of 6.4 percent of GDP. This reduction in the deficit will also make it possible to
reduce reliance on borrowing in the regional market, which is quite costly.
11.
Substantial efforts to reduce the cost of running the government are in progress. The
commitment to reducing the cost of running the government is reflected in a smaller cabinet, the
abolition of agencies, and the streamlining of diplomatic services. Additional savings are expected
from the abolition of the Senate and the office of the Vice-President. For permanent expenditures,
all mobile telephone lines—apart from certain lines used by the defense, security, and justice
services—were suspended on May 1, 2012, with new subscriptions established on a case-by-case
basis involving restrictions on the number of beneficiaries and usage ceilings. A physical audit of
landlines, conducted by the General Inspectorate of Finance, is in progress. The hundred largest
water consumers in government have been identified and monitored closely with a view to
achieving significant savings in the central government’s water bill. Efforts to enhance the accuracy
of records have also been made and strengthened for water and electricity, and focal points for the
monitoring of permanent expenditures have been appointed by ministers.
12.
These efforts will continue in 2013 and will contribute to the reduction of the budget
deficit. In accordance with the commitments undertaken by the new government to ensure fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

SENEGAL

sustainability, the budget deficit will be reduced to less than 5 percent of GDP in 2013. As indicated
in the general policy statement of the Prime Minister to the National Assembly, the government
intends to carry out its actions from a medium-term perspective and to conduct a budget policy
designed to meet the country’s development needs, while limiting the increase in public debt.
Reconciling these objectives will require greater efficiency in public expenditure.
13.
In the context of efforts to streamline government expenditure and gain long-term
control over the budget deficit, several actions have been carried out, and others are planned,
in particular:

64



In the education sector, a performance-based university financing project designed to
improve management in higher education is currently being finalized. Of the five
performance contracts envisaged between the government and universities, three have
already been signed and two others will be signed shortly. Specific actions have been
identified—in particular, the approval of a financial framework for universities, the proposal
for which has already been prepared, as well as efforts to achieve budgetary equilibrium for
universities based on information derived from planned audits of their resources,
expenditures, and procedures. The flows of extrabudgetary resources generated by
universities and their management will undergo more effective regulatory supervision. These
rationalization efforts will continue with support from the World Bank, and their findings are
expected by end-December 2012. Temporarily, with respect to scholarships and education
allowances, negotiations are in progress—on the basis of actions already identified—with a
view to ensuring that the relevant budget outlays can be kept within manageable bounds
during the period 2013–2014. The more extensive access to banking services has already
allowed for more effective management of data on scholarship holders. On the basis of the
findings of the scholarship audit planned with World Bank financing, discussions are in
progress to identify measures to rationalize the distribution of scholarships, as well as to
monitor and supervise them.



In the health sector, efforts to improve the efficiency of hospitals will be supported by the
gradual introduction and more widespread use of performance contracts between these
autonomous public entities, the health ministry, and the finance ministry by end-2014.
Grand Yoff General Hospital will be the priority for the year 2012.



A physical and biometric audit of government employees is in progress and will be
completed by end-June 2013. The wage bill should be automatically integrated into SIGFIP
upon the effective implementation of the new payroll management software, scheduled for
end-August 2013, after a period of a parallel use with the existing system.

14.
Work is in progress to extend the social safety net, guarantee a minimum income for
the most vulnerable families, and phase out generalized subsidies for energy and food prices.
Results achieved in foreign countries, such as Brazil, show that it is possible to target the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of population on the basis of simple criteria. Senegal’s own
experience, acquired in conjunction with the World Bank, focused on the 2008 implementation of
the Nutrition Enhancement Program (NEP), followed by the introduction of the project for “rapid
intervention for nutritional security and money transfers or NETS)”. The government will accordingly
create a viable and sustainable mechanism to support the most disadvantaged families; this
mechanism’s feasibility will have been proven in advance. Allowances will be granted to such
families in the form of a direct food subsidy and/or a family subsidy allowance. The targeting
process will pay particularly close attention to rural and suburban households. With the decrease in
household taxation, this mechanism will help to reduce gradually generalized subsidies for the
prices of energy and food products, which constitute ineffective and more costly methods of
supporting communities. At the same time, a mechanism for extending the social protection
system—specifically, health insurance—will be established for informal sector workers. The
Autonomous Fund for Universal Social Protection, to be implemented as of 2013, will help finance
this initiative, as well as the Universal Health Coverage initiative.
15.
The initial medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) was recently prepared by the new
public debt directorate, in collaboration with the full range of entities involved in debt issues. On
the basis of an in-depth diagnostic assessment, the strategy recommends reprofiling the debt, while
gradually reducing the proportion of short-term instruments in domestic debt. The government
intends to pursue this course of action carefully, based on regional market circumstances. Reliance
on concessional borrowing will have priority, in accordance with the recommendations set forth in
the borrowing strategy. However, in light of financing constraints, the government intends in 2013
to use the remainder of the program envelope for nonconcessional borrowing ($200 million), as well
as the envelope for semiconcessional borrowing, to finance infrastructure investment. The debt
database will be completely centralized by end-2012.

D. Raise Revenue to Create More Fiscal Space for Financing Priority
Spending
16.
The new tax code has been submitted to Parliament and is expected to enter into
force on January 1, 2013. Tax reforms have been carried out transparently in a fully participatory
approach. This inclusive approach began with requests for input, culminating in recent calls for
comment on the provisional version of the draft of the new code; private sector and labor union
representatives contributed to the technical work. As a result of these reforms, Senegal will have a
tax system that is more simple, more equitable, and more efficient. A more favorable general regime
will be put in place instead of the existing system, including inter alia a substantial rollback of tax
exemption regimes, almost all of which will be incorporated into the new framework. With respect to
the VAT, the new code is designed to make the system more neutral and more efficient. There are
also plans to phase out the prepayment system in accordance with a three-step timetable; as of
January 1, 2013 for taxpayers enrolled in the large enterprises center (CGE), as of January 1, 2014 for
taxpayers listed at the medium enterprises center (CME), and as of January 1, 2014 for those

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

SENEGAL

taxpayers covered by other tax service centers. At the same time, the system for refunding VAT
credits is being reformed in order to enhance its flexibility (shorter processing times for “citizen”
enterprises, those engaging primarily in exports or those carrying out externally-funded contracts or
other agreements), and their practical details (refund by check or bank transfer). Finally, the taxation
system for individuals will be reformed and simplified.
17.
Implementation of the tax administration modernization plan is continuing and is
being regularly monitored by the General Directorate of Taxes and Government Property (DGID).
The CME became operational in July 2012. Further structural reforms will be introduced, with the
reorganization of the field offices of the DGID in order to institutionalize the distinction between
functional and operational directorates (interregional directorates). A steering committee has been
set up to put these measures into practice, and the DGID is on track to create the planned services
in December 2012. Furthermore, computerization of the DGID will gather momentum inasmuch as
e-filing and e-payment will be in operation at the future large enterprises directorate in June 2013,
at other Dakar centers in December 2013, and in regions outside Dakar by December 2014.
18.
The General Directorate of Customs (DGD) is continuing to implement the reforms
included in the 2011-2013 Strategic Plan and defined in the form of commitments in the
performance contract signed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (see the MEFP of June 22,
2012). Cooperation between the DGID and DGD has been strengthened, with the August 29, 2012
signing of a memorandum of understanding on exchange of information which complements the
obligation, already in effect, to use NINEA (national registration number for enterprises and
associations) in customs operations. In the context of efforts to improve the DGD’s contribution to
domestic budget resources, an action plan for the mobilization, collection, and support of customs
revenues generated by current imports has been implemented. This plan focuses inter alia on
collection of suspended VAT, compliance with the periods of time which goods are stored in
bonded warehouses, and the control of economic regimes. Furthermore, in the context of efforts to
streamline tax expenditures, the proposed reform Decree 83–504 of May 17, 1983 on the conditions
for applying duty-free entry has made progress and has been incorporated into the reform of the
Customs Code, whose technical finalization is scheduled for December 2012 and which is expected
to be submitted to parliament by end-June 2013 (new structural benchmark). On this point, the
procedure joint with the DGID included in the General Tax Code is expected to result in a reduction
of the revenue losses associated with exemptions.

E. Strengthen Public Financial Management and Governance
19.
Senegal has made considerable progress in transposing the new WAEMU directives on
government finance. The process is expected to be completed by end-December 2012 with the
adoption of the draft law related to the code of transparency in fiscal management. An order
adopted by the Prime Minister, announced in Decree 2012–673 of July 4, 2012 establishing
government budget nomenclature, will set forth the annex pertaining to ministries’ programs and
allocations for constitutional institutions. To initiate the entry into force of the new regulatory
framework resulting from this transposition, prior actions will include a learning period during which
certain operations will be performed on a test basis with no legal impact, while assessing the
complex innovations to precisely identify the various required changes to ensure a successful

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

outcome. Accordingly, in 2013, in addition to the official documents associated with the budget law
for the year, the authorities, in the interest of guidance and learning, will develop draft program
budgets and multiyear expenditure programming documents for the ministries in charge of ecology
and justice, as well as a 2013–2015 Multiyear Budgetary and Economic Programming Paper. The
proposed World Bank project in support of fiscal reforms has already taken into account the need
for the main studies, and included them among its activities scheduled for 2012. These include:
(i) the diagnostic assessment of the institutional and legal changes arising from the new WAEMU
directives on government finance; (ii) studies on the feasibility of decentralizing the expenditure
authorization process and the evolving role played by supervision over government financial
operations; (iii) communication and outreach efforts relating to the new public management and its
implications for policymakers; (iv) training for financial and sectoral authorities, and nonstate actors
regarding the strengthening of citizen control of public affairs; and (v) customization of IT
applications in the areas of budget management (SIGFIP) and accounting (ASTER).
20.
Efforts to improve PFM are continuing in other areas. With respect to the certification of
public accounts, the draft budget execution law for 2011 will be submitted to the National Assembly
during the first regular session that began in October 2012. With regard to the delays encountered
in the review of the budget execution statements of public accountants, the Audit Court will address
the delays dating back to 2002. The Audit Court will also ensure that executing agencies and other
similar entities governed by the rules and regulations on public accounting regularly file their
financial statements, or will be subject to applicable penalties. Finally, the government has submitted
to the National Assembly the new draft organic law on the Audit Court.
21.
Significant progress has been recorded in supervising the financial management of
agencies. Transfers were centralized in 2011 with deposit accounts opened on the books of the
Public Treasury. A financial and accounting framework has been set up, government accounting
officers have been appointed, and the provision of subsidies is contingent on quarterly cash-flow
plans; efforts in these areas will continue. In regard to the rationalization of agencies and other
government entities, the assessment commission started it activities by conducting, at the first
stage, a comprehensive survey of agencies and similar entities. On that basis, an initial decision to
abolish 8 agencies was taken in 2012 and is currently being carried out. The sector will be
streamlined more thoroughly on the basis of the recommendations made in the in-depth
assessment study conducted by the national commission with assistance from the World Bank. As
the launch was somewhat delayed, the study may not be completed until June 2013, when it will be
shared with Fund staff. The government’s action plan will be adopted by end-July 2013. In order to
achieve immediate reductions in agency operating costs, the government intends to cap the
remuneration of general directors. The financial supervision and governance of the parastatal sector
by the Ministry of Economy and Finance will be strengthened.
22.
The process of enhancing transparency in real estate transactions and advertising sales
and transfers of holdings of the government’s land is continuing. By end-January 2013, the
government will publish on a website accessible for the public all information relating to the number
of files involving final property sales and transfers from government holdings, indicating the land
areas sold, the geographic location of the land, and the corresponding revenue received. The
restructuring of the real estate holdings is already under way after a thorough diagnostic
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

SENEGAL

assessment, and will lead to the creation of the Directorate of Land and Government Property Affairs
as of December 2012. The Urban Property Management Support Project (PAGEF) is primarily
designed to computerize government property management. The DGID (i) is to embark upon and
correctly carry out the comprehensive real estate management computerization process.
Accordingly, an action plan will be put in place and implemented beginning in January 2013; (ii) it
will record and track all government property revenues in SIGTAS as of June 2013; (iii) it will conduct
an inventory of government property, with a view to preparing the general table of government
property holdings to achieve greater transparency, by December 2013.
23.
Cost-benefit analysis will be used more systematically in the draft budget law for
2014. The evaluation guide is currently being prepared, and will start to be used in early 2013. All
investment projects exceeding CFAF 10 billion to be included in the draft budget for 2014 will
undergo ex ante cost-benefit assessment using the guide. These assessments will be shared with
Fund staff upon request.
24.
The implementation of the single treasury account is continuing, despite certain
difficulties. Only six banks responded to the circular from the Ministry of Economy and Finance
requesting information on bank accounts. The following resolutions have been adopted to gather
the necessary information and comply with the commitment to finalize the Single Treasury Account
in February 2013: (i) ensure that accounting personnel at agencies transmit information on bank
accounts to which they have access; (ii) make direct contact with the management of banks, with
assistance from the Directorate of Money and Credit. A report on the status of implementation will
be produced by the Parastatal Sector Directorate by end-November 2012

F. Private Sector Development
Energy sector
25.
Execution of investments under the emergency plan for restructuring and reviving the
energy sector has been delayed. Because of this the introduction of more efficient units that are
intended to replace the leased units has also been delayed. The component pertaining to aggressive
demand management has likewise fallen behind schedule. Nonetheless, implementation of the
updated investment plan is continuing with the power plant rehabilitation program, and envisages
installing more efficient heavy fuel power plants, accelerating the coal-fired power station projects
(375 MW between 2014 and 2017), and introducing natural gas and renewable sources of energy
(solar and wind power plants) into the energy mix.
26.
A plan for the operational and financial restructuring of SENELEC has been prepared.
On the basis of the financial evaluation of SENELEC, prepared on the basis of provisional financial
statements for 2011, a financial restructuring plan has been adopted. The plan first envisages
strengthening equity, in particular through the settlement of cross-debts (and conversion of net
debt into equity) involving SENELEC, the government, and the Deposits and Consignations Fund, in
addition to registering in accounts investments made by the government as investment subsidies.
Efforts will be made to obtain debt relief for SENELEC, including through rescheduling negotiations
with creditors and suppliers. With respect to operational restructuring, the performance indicators
used to achieve sustainable increases in operation are the optimization of the various power plants,
68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

reduction of grid losses, reduction of operating costs, efforts to combat fraud, improvements in
billing, and reduction of payment delays. In addition, a 2013–2015 performance contract between
the government and SENELEC based on this restructuring plan is currently being finalized and is
scheduled to take effect as of January 1, 2013.
27.
The government’s short-term objective is to ensure the quality of electricity supply
while limiting subsidies that weigh heavily on public finances and impede efforts to finance
other priority actions. The government intends to limit the electricity consumption subsidy to CFAF
80 billion in 2013. At current international oil prices, capping this subsidy will assume savings of
approximately CFAF 45 billion which will require not only considerable efforts to control costs of the
SENELEC, but will also make it necessary to revise the electricity tariff. Accordingly, tariff adjustments
are under consideration for certain categories of consumers, while having in mind the need to
protect low-income households and safeguard the competitiveness of the economy. In the medium
term, the introduction of more efficient production units will make it possible to lower costs, which
will be beneficial for all consumers.

Financial sector
28.
The financial system has continued to deepen in recent years with no major negative
impact on the system’s stability. Micro-finance institutions (decentralized financial systems) have
improved access to financial services for households and SMEs. The microfinance sector, which has
developed very rapidly, has undergone in-depth restructuring in recent years. Capacity constraints
and weak supervisory mechanisms at certain decentralized financial systems, as well as the high
degree of market concentration, call for careful monitoring by supervisors. Banks are increasingly
diversifying their customer base by offering more affordable basic services to the middle class and
to SMEs, as a result of the entry of new banks and heightened competition on the market. This
development poses no risk for bank stability at present. The main risk for banks is that their
portfolios are concentrated among a handful of borrowers, including the government. Certain risks
emanating from the growing interconnection of financial institutions (banks and insurance, banks
and decentralized financial systems) should be evaluated, and strengthened surveillance may be
required.
29.
Most impediments to greater financial deepening have been clearly identified. In
particular, these constraints include the legal environment, as well as the problems pertaining to
information on the operating risks facing SMEs, which have been explicitly recognized in the
national dialogue on SME access to credit. The ensuing action plan has focused on facilitating the
use of collateral, the need to enhance the availability of information on customers, while lowering
certain taxes to reduce the cost of credit, and improving the legal environment to streamline
disputes. The implementation of the plan has been delayed, in spite of a number of important
achievements such as the adoption of the law on leasing. The constraints identified at the national
level are being monitored by the National Committee in charge of the action plan. Assessment of all
the recommendations pertaining to banking regulation and, if necessary, their implementation may
be accelerated by the WAMU authorities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

SENEGAL

30.
Reforms in the financial sector will be accelerated to deepen further the financial
sector and facilitate access to the financial sector by SMEs and households.


Implementation of a regulatory framework conducive to the creation of private credit registers.
The preferred course of action is a regional approach based on the work already begun by
Senegal. The BCEAO will prepare a WAEMU-wide draft text to regulate the activities of credit
bureaus.



Development of financial leasing. The new general tax code will correct the tax distortions
adversely affecting leasing activity in Senegal.



Diversification of financial products. After the reform of financial leasing, the government will
pursue its policy of diversifying financing instruments by promoting alternative products,
particularly factoring. In this respect, there are plans to conduct a study to identify and
overcome all of the obstacles impeding the development of factoring in Senegal.

Other Prerequisites for Improving the Business Climate, Governance, and
Competitiveness
31.
Stronger growth will require increased private sector competitiveness and further
improvement of the business climate. Numerous reforms have been introduced in recent years
but have not yet been fully implemented. Efforts will accordingly be made to educate and train the
relevant authorities. The simplification of administrative procedures will continue. Emphasis will be
placed on: (i) lowering production costs, and in particular on ensuring easier and more affordable
access to land; (ii) reforms focusing on the status of the “entrepreneur” specified by the new OHADA
Uniform Act, entailing gradual reforms of the informal sector and the emergence of a range of SMEs
engaged in the production of goods and services; and (iii) the computerization of the construction
permit procedure or TELEDAC in an effort to achieve simplified and more transparent procedures in
this area, along with faster processing times. Quantitative targets will be set on the basis of the
indicators included in the Doing Business survey, with a view to boosting the score in the years
ahead.

III.

PROGRAM MONITORING

32.
The budget trends described above led to the downward revision of the budget deficit
target for 2012 (from 6.4 percent to 5.9 percent of GDP) and we suggest modifying the
relevant assessment criterion accordingly. Quantitative assessment criteria for end-June 2013 and
indicative targets for end-March 2013, end-September 2013, and end-December 2013 have been
proposed. The same applies to the structural benchmarks shown in Table 2 of the MEFP. It is
proposed to reschedule the benchmark on the action plan for agency restructuring from end-2012
to end-July 2013. It is proposed to broaden the scope of investment expenditures which could be
financed through nonconcessional borrowing to road infrastructure (not only the highway) and
urban water and sanitation. The fifth review of the PSI should normally be completed by end-June
2013 and the sixth review by end-December 2013.

ATTACHMENT II: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
Dakar, November 22, 2012
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative assessment
criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of which the implementation of
the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) will be monitored in 2011–
2013. The TMU also establishes the terms and time frame for transmitting the data that will enable
Fund staff to monitor program implementation.

I.

PROGRAM CONDITIONALITY

2.
The quantitative assessment criteria for end-December 2012, end-June 2013 and the
quantitative targets for end-September 2012 and for end-March, end-September, and endDecember 2013, are shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP, respectively. The prior actions and
structural benchmarks established under the program are presented in Table 3.

II.

DEFINITIONS, ADJUSTERS, AND DATA REPORTING

A. The Government
3.
Unless otherwise indicated, “government” means the central administration of the Republic
of Senegal and does not include any local administration, the central bank, or any other public or
government-owned entity with autonomous legal personality not included in the government flowof-funds table (TOFE).

B. Overall Fiscal Balance (Program Definition)
Definition
4.
The overall fiscal balance including grants (program definition) is the difference between the
government’s total revenue (revenue and grants) and total expenditure and net lending. The
operations of the Energy Sector Support Fund (FSE) are integrated in the government flow-of-funds
table (TOFE). The revenues exclude privatization receipts and sales of mobile phone licenses or of
any other state-owned assets. Government expenditure is defined on the basis of payment orders
accepted by the Treasury (dépenses ordonnancées prises en charge par le Trésor) and expenditures
executed with external resources. This assessment criterion is set as a floor on the overall fiscal
balance including grants as of the beginning of the year.

Example

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

SENEGAL

5.
The floor on the overall fiscal balance including grants (program definition) as of December
31, 2012, is minus CFAF 425.4 billion. It is calculated as the difference between total government
revenue (CFAF 1,723.2 billion) and total expenditure and net lending (CFAF 2,148.7 billion).

Adjustment
6.
The overall fiscal balance including grants is adjusted downward by the amount that budget
grants fall short of program projections up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion at current exchange
rates (see MEFP Tables 1and 2).
7.
The overall fiscal balance including grants is adjusted downward/upward by the amount that
concessional loans exceed/fall short of their programmed amount, up to a maximum of CFAF
50 billion at current exchange rates (see MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). For the purposes of this assessment
criterion, concessional loans denominated in CFAF and in foreign currency are taken into account.

Reporting requirements
8.
During the program period, the authorities will report provisional data on the overall fiscal
balance (program definition) and its components monthly to Fund staff with a lag of no more than
30 days. Data on revenues and expenditure that are included in the calculation of the overall fiscal
balance, and on expenditure financed with HIPC- and MDRI- related resources, will be drawn from
preliminary Treasury account balances. Final data will be provided as soon as the final balances of
the Treasury accounts are available, but not later than two months after the reporting of the
provisional data.

C. Social Expenditure
Definition
9.
Social spending is defined as spending on health, education, the environment, the judicial
system, social safety nets, sanitation, and rural water supply. This criterion is set as a floor in percent
relative to total spending (including the FSE) excluding capital expenditure related to the extension
of the autoroute and the investment projects of the power sector reform plan.

Reporting requirements
10.
The authorities will report semiannual data to Fund staff within two months following the end of
each period.

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

D. Budgetary Float
Definition
11.
The budgetary float (instances de paiement) is defined as the outstanding stock of
government expenditure for which bills have been received and validated but not yet paid by the
Treasury (the difference between dépenses liquidées and dépenses payées). The assessment
criterion is set as a ceiling on the budgetary float, monitored at the end of the quarter.

Reporting requirements
12.
The authorities will transmit to Fund staff on a weekly basis (i.e., at the end of each week),
and at the end of each month, a table from the expenditure tracking system (SIGFIP) showing all
committed expenditures (dépenses engagées), all certified expenditures that have not yet been
cleared for payment (dépenses liquidées non encore ordonnancées), all payment orders (dépenses
ordonnancées), all payment orders accepted by the Treasury (dépenses prises en charge par le
Trésor), and all payments made by the Treasury (dépenses payées). The SIGFIP table will exclude
delegations for regions and embassies. The SIGFIP table will also list any payments that do not have
a cash impact on the Treasury accounts.

E. Spending Undertaken Outside Simplified and Normal Procedures
13.
This assessment criterion is applied on a continuous basis to any procedure other than the
normal and simplified procedures to execute spending. It excludes only spending undertaken on the
basis of a supplemental appropriation order (décret d’avance) in cases of absolute urgency and
need in the national interest, in application of Article 12 of the Organic Budget Law. Such spending
requires the signatures of the President of the Republic and Prime Minister.
14.
The authorities will report any such procedure, together with the SIGFIP table defined in
paragraph 12, to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a maximum delay of 30 days.

F. Government External Payments Arrears
Definition
15.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments owed and not paid on the
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. The definition of external debt given in
paragraph 18 is applicable here. The assessment criterion on external payments arrears will be
monitored on a continuous basis.

G. Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional External Debt by
the Government
17.
Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the definition of
debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009
(Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
a)

The term “debt” will be understood to mean a direct, i.e., non-contingent, liability created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, according to a given
repayment schedule; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:
i.
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required
to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
ii.
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided;
and
iii.
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception
of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of
the property.

b)

Under the definition of debt above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages
arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes
debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

18.
Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the guarantee of a
debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service a debt in the event of
nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind).

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

19.
Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, a debt is
considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent;1 the grant element is
the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a
percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is
calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt.2 The
discount rates used for this purpose are the currency-specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs), published by OECD.3 For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average
CIRR is used to calculate the PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of
less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR is used. The margins for differing repayment periods
(0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent
for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more) are added to the ten-year and six-month
CIRR averages.
20.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, external debt is defined
as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition also applies to
debt among WAEMU countries.
21.
Debt-related assessment criteria. The relevant assessment criteria apply to the contracting
and guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the government, local governments,
SENELEC, the Energy Sector Support Fund (FSE), and any other public or government-owned entity.
The criteria apply to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet
been received. The criteria also apply to private debt for which official guarantees have been
extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the government. The assessment
criteria are measured on a cumulative basis from the time of approval of the PSI by the Executive
Board. ACs will be monitored on a continuous basis. No adjuster will be applied to these criteria.
22.

Special provisions:
a)
The assessment criteria do not apply to: (i) debt rescheduling transactions of debt
existing at the time of the approval of the PSI; (ii) debt contracted by the airport project
company (AIBD) to finance construction of the new Dakar Airport; and (iii) short-term
external debt (maturity of less than one year) contracted by SENELEC to finance the
purchase of petroleum products.
b)
A total ceiling of US$500 million applies over the period 2011–13 for
nonconcessional external debt financing to be used for investment projects discussed with

The following reference on the IMF website creates a link to a tool that allows for the calculation of the grant
element of a broad range of financing packages: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator.
2

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the debt agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.
3

For debts in foreign currencies for which the OECD does not calculate a CIRR, calculation of the grant element
should be based on the composite CIRR (weighted average) of the currencies in the SDR basket.

Fund staff in road infrastructure, the energy sector, and urban water and sanitation. The
nonconcessional funds obtained in this way will be deposited in a special account. The
authorities will report regularly to Fund staff on the balance of this account and the use of
funds. Following the issuance of a US$500 million Eurobond in May 2011, with an exchange
offer for the outstanding 2009 Eurobond, the remaining ceiling for non-concessional
borrowing for 2011–13 is US$ 200 million (equivalent to the amount of the 2009 bonds
actually redeemed or exchanged in 2011).
c)
A separate ceiling equivalent to CFAF 44 billion in 2011–13 applies for untied
nonconcessional external debt financing with a grant element of at least 15 percent. Projects
financed in this way would be expected to meet the same economic and social profitability
criteria as other capital spending. The government will inform Fund staff in a timely manner
before contracting any debt of this type and will provide sufficient information ahead of
time to verify the degree of concessionality. It will also provide a brief summary of the
projects to be financed and their profitability, including an evaluation by the lender or the
government. The government will report the use of funds and project implementation in
subsequent MEFPs.

Reporting requirements
23.
The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as soon
as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government, but no later than within two weeks
of such external debt being contracted or guaranteed.

H. Public Sector Contracts Signed by Single Tender
Definition
24.
Public sector contracts are administrative contracts, drawn up and entered into by the
government or any entity subject to the procurement code, for the procurement of supplies,
delivery of services, or execution of work. Public sector contracts are considered “single-tender”
contracts when the contracting agent signs the contract with the chosen contractor without
competitive tender. The quarterly indicative target will apply to total public sector contracts entered
into by the government or any entity subject to the procurement code. The ceiling on contracts
executed by single tender will exclude fuel purchases by SENELEC for electricity production. This
exclusion reflects new regulation, which requires SENELEC to buy fuel directly from SAR based on
the existing price structure.

Reporting requirements
25.
The government will report quarterly to Fund staff, with a lag of no more than one month
from the end of the observation period, the total value of public sector contracts and the total value
of all single-tender public sector contracts.

FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT, AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF AN
ASSESSMENT CRITERION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS

Approved By
Roger Nord and Peter
Allum (IMF) and
Marcelo Giugale and
Jeffrey Lewis (World
Bank)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
and the International Development Association

Since the last debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was published in May 2011, Senegal’s debt
outlook has deteriorated. Growth in 2012 was slower than expected, due to the drought in the
Sahel, and fiscal consolidation has been somewhat less than expected, reflecting the impact of
exogenous shocks, the higher cost of electricity subsidies, and measures taken by the authorities
to stabilize petroleum product prices. On balance, Senegal continues to face a low risk of debt
distress, but risks have increased. Overall, the analysis highlights the importance of reducing
fiscal deficits, improving debt management, approaching nonconcessional borrowing with
caution, and further developing domestic debt markets.1

The DSA presented in this document is based on the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income
countries (LICs). See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries—Proposal for an Operational Framework
and Policy Implications” and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries—Further Considerations on an
Operational Framework and Policy Implications.”

BACKGROUND
1.
Senegal’s public debt has
increased steadily in recent years.2
The ratio of public debt to GDP is
projected to reach 46 percent in 2012,
close to levels that prevailed when
Senegal benefited from debt relief
under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) in 2006. The bulk of
public debt is external (i.e., owed to
non-residents of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union,
WAEMU), although the share of
domestic debt has increased.3

Most of Senegal’s public external debt is on concessional terms. Two-thirds of the debt is
owed to multilateral creditors—primarily the World Bank, the IMF, and the African Development Bank. The
largest bilateral creditors are France, Kuwait, China, Saudi Arabia, and India.

Domestic debt includes debt issued in the WAEMU financial market.

3.
Public domestic debt remains
relatively low but has grown quickly
in recent years. At end-2011, domestic
debt was equal to 11 percent of GDP,
slightly above the average in WAEMU
countries but below the average across
all low-income countries. Domestic
debt is denominated in local currency
and mostly held by WAEMU banks.
Domestic debt as a share of total public
debt has increased from 7 percent in
2005 to 28 percent in 2011, reflecting
the development of the WAEMU
market and external debt relief.
4.
Senegal has started relying on nonconcessional borrowing to finance infrastructure projects.
In December 2009, the government issued its first Eurobond. The 5-year, US$200 million bond had a
coupon of 8.75 percent and was priced to yield 9.25 percent. The proceeds of the issuance helped finance
the Dakar-Diamniadio toll road. In May 2011, the government issued a 10-year, US$500 million Eurobond,
with a coupon of 8.75 percent and priced to yield 9.125 percent. Of the US$500 million raised,
US$200 million was used to retire the 2009 Eurobond; the remainder has been earmarked for the toll road
and for investments in the energy sector.
5.
Private sector exposure is relatively limited, and contingent liabilities contained. Private
external debt has averaged about 20 percent of GDP over the last decade and was equal to 24 percent of
GDP at end-2010.4 Half of this debt was in the form of trade credits and bank deposits; the rest consisted of
debt securities, loans, and other liabilities. This exposure was partially offset by private external assets
amounting to 8 percent of GDP. Preliminary estimates of contingent liabilities suggest that they amount to
less than 10 percent of GDP.5 There are no explicit government guarantees of enterprises’ external and
internal debt since the settlement of the ICS chemical company crisis in 2007.
6.
The authorities have taken steps to improve debt management. A new public debt directorate
has been created by combining the two units that had previously managed domestic debt and external
debt separately. The new directorate recently prepared Senegal’s first medium-term debt strategy, which
recommends extending the maturity of debt issued on the regional market and continuing to prioritize
concessional external borrowing.

4

Estimates of private sector external debt are based on BCEAO data on the international investment position.

5

The fiscal risk posed by these entities is approximated by the standardized stress test that simulates a 10-percentof-GDP increase in other debt creating flows.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
7.
This DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the staff report for
the Fourth Review under the Policy Support Instrument. The baseline scenario assumes the
implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, leading to an increase in economic
growth and a narrowing of fiscal deficits over the long term (Box 1). Notable revisions compared to the
May 2011 DSA include:


Real GDP growth is expected to be a bit lower over the next few years and the long term
compared to previous projections, partly owing to a less favorable external environment.



The 2012 fiscal deficit has been revised upward, in line with the program. Projected fiscal deficits
over the medium and long term are somewhat lower compared to the previous DSA, to be more
in line with the authorities’ commitment to meet the key WAEMU convergence criterion on the
fiscal deficit.6



The current account deficit in 2012 is expected to be smaller than previously projected following
a better-than-expected outturn in 2011. Long-term current account deficit projections have
been revised lower in line with the downward revision to long-run fiscal deficits.

The convergence criterion calls for the basic fiscal balance, in percent of GDP, to be greater than or equal to zero.
Senegal’s basic fiscal balance is assumed to move from a deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2012 to a deficit of 0.5
percent by the end of the projection period. (The basic fiscal balance is defined as total revenue, plus budget support
grants, plus the counterpart of HIPC/MDRI-related spending, minus current expenditures and domestically-financed
capital expenditure.)

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2012–2031
Real GDP growth: After a substantial slowdown in 2011 because of the drought in the Sahel, real GDP
growth is expected to rebound to 3.7 percent in 2012, driven by higher public investment in
infrastructure and a recovery in agricultural production. Growth is expected to accelerate over the next
few years, reaching 5.2 percent by 2017, as the authorities implement their structural reform agenda,
including further investments in the energy sector, comprehensive tax reform, and improvements to
the business climate and governance. In the long term, the resolution of energy sector problems is
expected to eliminate a major constraint on growth. Real GDP growth is projected to average 5.2 over
2017–2031, compared to an average of 5.1 percent in the five years prior to the outbreak of the global
financing crisis.
Public investment: The authorities are expected to maintain public investment at relatively high levels,
with the ratio of public capital expenditure to GDP projected to reach 12.1 percent in 2012 before
gradually declining to 11.2 percent by the end of the projection period. This compares to levels
between 6 and 11 percent over the past decade.
Current account deficit: The current account deficit is projected to widen in 2012 as a result of higher
imports of food (related to last year’s drought, which led to a poor harvest) and weak export demand
(linked to the crisis in Mali). Over the medium and long term, the current account deficit is expected to
narrow in line with anticipated fiscal consolidation.
Inflation: Inflation is expected to remain moderate at about 2.5 percent.
Fiscal deficit: The fiscal deficit in 2012 is expected to fall to 5.9 percent of GDP, mostly due to delays in
energy investments. In line with the program’s objective to reduce the fiscal deficit to maintain debt
sustainability, the authorities are targeting a deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP in 2013. Over the medium
and long term, the fiscal deficit is projected to narrow gradually to 2.8 percent, reflecting the
authorities’ commitment to deliver fiscal consolidation consistent with the WAEMU convergence
criterion on the basic fiscal balance.
Financing: The authorities are expected to rely increasingly on external nonconcessional borrowing to
finance infrastructure projects. In 2013, the authorities are assumed to use the remaining space
($200 million) for nonconcessional borrowing in the program. Thereafter, Senegal is expected to
borrow 0.5 percent of GDP per year on nonconcessional terms. The net US$500 million in
nonconcessional borrowing in 2011 and 2013 are assumed to be rolled over at maturity. Over the
period 2012–2014, the authorities are expected to contract CFAF 42 billion (about US$79 million) in
external debt with a grant element between 15 and 35 percent, consistent with the program. The
average grant element of new external borrowing is projected to fall from 30 percent to 9 percent over
the projection period, as Senegal gradually moves away from concessional borrowing, mainly from
multilateral creditors, toward nonconcessional borrowing from bilateral and commercial creditors.
Meanwhile, the share of domestic financing is expected to gradually increase over the long term as the
WAEMU market develops.

8.
Another change compared to the previous DSA is the value of the discount rate in the DSA
template used to calculate the present value (PV) of external debt. The discount rate, which follows
the long-term U.S. dollar commercial interest reference rate (CIRR), was recently adjusted from 4.0 percent
to 3.0 percent.7 Holding other variables steady, a change in the discount rate from 4 percent to 3 percent
raises the present value of debt.
9.
Stress tests lead to breaches of three thresholds (Figure 1a, Table 1a, and Table 1b). Three debt
burden indicators—the PV of debt to GDP, the PV of debt to exports, and debt service to revenue—breach
their indicative thresholds under certain standardized stress tests. Under current DSA guidelines, such
breaches could be interpreted to suggest that Senegal’s risk of debt distress has increased from low to
moderate. The breach of the debt-to-GDP threshold is relatively minor (less than 2 percentage points) but
protracted, and occurs under a stress test simulating a one-time 30-percent depreciation of the exchange
rate.8 The debt-to-exports threshold is breached by a wider margin in a scenario where borrowing terms
are less favorable than under the baseline scenario, which underscores the importance of approaching
further nonconcessional borrowing with caution. The debt service-to-revenue threshold is breached by a
very small margin in 2021 under the one-time 30-percent depreciation shock. Under the historical scenario,
in which key variables are projected to remain fixed at their 10-year historical average, the PV of debt to
GDP and the PV of debt to exports approach, but do not breach, their respective thresholds. The more
favorable outcome under the baseline scenario compared to the historical scenario reflects projected
improvements in real GDP growth and the current account deficit, as discussed above.
10.
Taking remittances into consideration, however, a more favorable assessment emerges.
Debt burden indicators remain well below their thresholds in the baseline scenario, while stress tests lead to
minor breaches of two thresholds (Figure 1b and Table 3b).9 The inclusion of remittances in the analysis is
justified by the fact that remittances have become an important and reliable source of foreign exchange in
Senegal, a pattern that is expected to continue. Remittances have grown every year since 2000, with the
exception of 2009, when they fell 6 percent. In 2011, remittances were equal to 13 percent of GDP. The PV
of debt to GDP plus remittances peaks at 37 percent, compared to a threshold of 36 percent, under a onetime 30-percent depreciation of the exchange rate, while the ratio of debt service to revenue (which is not
affected by remittances) once again breaches its threshold by a very small margin in 2021 under the onetime 30-percent depreciation shock. The PV of debt to exports plus remittances approaches, but does not
breach, the threshold in the historical scenario.

7

The rules of the DSF require the discount rate to be changed when the U.S. dollar CIRR (six-month average)
diverges from the discount rate by at least 100 basis points for a continuous period of at least six months. When this
occurs, the magnitude of the change in the discount rate is required to be 100 basis points. See “A Review of Some
Aspects of the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework.”
8

The exchange rate shock is arguably overstated in the case of Senegal in light of the peg to the euro, which is
guaranteed by the French Treasury. At end-2011, 8 percent of Senegal’s public external debt stock was denominated
in euro, and another 42 percent was denominated in SDR (which is partially linked to the euro).
9

The previous DSA did not discuss remittances, since the low risk rating was justified even without including
remittances.

PUBLIC DSA
11.
Indicators of overall public debt (external plus domestic) and debt service do not point to
significant vulnerabilities related to the level of domestic debt (Figure 2 and Table 2a). In the baseline
scenario, the PV of total public debt to GDP and the PV of total public debt to revenue remain relatively flat
over the projection period, despite the fact that the share of domestic debt is projected to increase over
time as the WAEMU market develops. The PV of public debt to GDP peaks at 42 percent, well below the
benchmark level of 56 percent associated with heightened public debt vulnerabilities for medium
performers. The short average maturity of domestic debt (slightly over one year) is, however, a source of
vulnerability, as it exposes the government to significant rollover and interest rate risks. In 2013, public debt
service is expected to spike, owing mainly to a sharp increase in amortization payments on domestic debt.
12.
Stress tests, however, indicate that the path of public debt would become explosive in the
absence of fiscal consolidation (Table 2b). In a scenario that assumes an unchanged primary deficit (as a
percent of GDP) over the entire projection period, starting with the level projected in 2012, the PV of public
debt to GDP grows rapidly, breaching the 56 percent benchmark level in 2021. The benchmark level is also
breached in the “historical” scenario (holding real GDP growth and the primary deficit constant at their
historical levels) and in a growth shock scenario. These stress tests, which produce similar results for the PV
of public debt-to-revenue indicator, highlight the importance of reducing fiscal deficits and raising
potential output growth.

CONCLUSION
13.
In staff’s view, Senegal continues to face a low risk of debt distress. Stress tests in the external
DSA result in breaches of three thresholds, but the inclusion of remittances produces a better picture, with
only marginal breaches. This justifies keeping a low risk rating for now under the assumption of fiscal
consolidation and strengthened debt management.
14.
Vulnerabilities have increased over recent years, and new risks have emerged. Since Senegal
benefited from comprehensive debt relief under HIPC and MDRI, public debt has grown steadily. The 2011
Eurobond, while addressing medium-term rollover risks, has exposed Senegal to longer term rollover risk,
underscoring the importance of improving debt management. While Senegal is expected to gradually shift
to nonconcessional external borrowing as it moves toward emerging market status, it should approach
such borrowing with caution given current debt levels and the sensitivity of debt indicators to less favorable
borrowing terms. Relatively low levels of domestic debt suggest that there is scope to further develop
domestic debt markets to decrease reliance on external financing; reliance on the regional debt market
should however increase gradually, taking into account the cost and maturities of such borrowing. At the
same time, it will be critical to reduce fiscal deficits from levels seen in recent years to maintain debt
sustainability.
15.
The authorities generally agreed with the assessment, stressed their fiscal consolidation
efforts, and questioned the impact of the change in the discount rate. They acknowledged that fiscal
consolidation and a cautious approach to nonconcessional borrowing were critical for safeguarding debt

sustainability. They pointed out that they have taken action since taking office to keep the fiscal deficit
under control in 2012. Efforts made to reduce the cost of running the government will help keep the 2012
fiscal deficit below 6 percent of GDP, a development bucking earlier trends. The authorities also intend to
keep reducing the fiscal deficit in 2013 and the medium term, while addressing the country’s social and
development needs. Their fiscal objective is to reduce the deficit below 5 percent of GDP in 2013 and
below 4 percent by 2015. Reconciling these various objectives will require a significant improvement in
public spending efficiency. Efforts to reduce the cost of running the government will continue and produce
their full impact in 2013 and beyond. A comprehensive streamlining of agencies in 2013 is also expected to
generate substantial savings in the medium term. Finally, the authorities are working on rationalizing
expenditure in key sectors such as education and health (with World Bank assistance) and on more costeffective support to the most vulnerable segments of the population. In this regard, energy subsidies will
be substantially reduced next year and in the medium term. The authorities challenged staff to explain why
a mechanical change in the discount rate should translate into a deterioration of the debt outlook. Staff
explained that the change in the discount rate applied to all countries, not just Senegal, and was consistent
with the Fund’s longstanding methodology for calculating present values.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT
INSTRUMENT, AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF AN
ASSESSMENT CRITERION—FINANCIAL DEPTH AND
MACRO-STABILITY
This enhanced review of Senegal’s financial sector is one of several pilot reviews called for by
the Executive Board in May 2012. The purpose of the reviews is to go beyond the traditional
surveillance focus on banking system soundness and solvency by analyzing in more depth the
interplay between financial development, macroeconomic and financial stability, and
effectiveness of macroeconomic policies in low-income countries. Senegal is a member of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); a number of key macroeconomic and
financial policies are designed and implemented at the union level. This study focuses on
Senegal-specific issues. Another pilot study, to be prepared in the context of the next annual
consultation on regional policies in early 2013, will focus on union-wide issues.
The financial system in Senegal, like in many other low-income countries (LICs), is dominated
by the banking sector, with commercial banks representing about 90 percent of the financial
system. A large number of microfinance institutions (MFIs) supply limited financial services
targeting lower income households. They help raise overall access to the financial system to
about 20 percent of the population. Insurance companies account for most of the remainder
of the domestic financial system. The regional securities and equity market is a marginal
source of funding, except for the government. The interbank market remains underdeveloped.
The banking system appears to be relatively robust, with lending concentration and asset
quality being the main risks. Financial soundness indicators suggest that banks are on
average adequately capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Micro-prudential regulation of banks
needs to be enhanced and supervision strengthened further. The authorities are encouraged
to develop a holistic view of the financial system and systemic risk.
Financial depth has increased in recent years and is broadly in line with the country’s
structural characteristics. However, a comparison with selected countries suggests substantial
scope for further deepening, which would facilitate the conduct of fiscal policy, make it easier
for agents to deal with volatility, and foster investment and growth.

SENEGAL

There is broad agreement that the main obstacles to further financial development include:
large informational asymmetries, a poor business and judicial environment, an inadequate
tax regime, regulatory and supervision issues, and inadequate skills. The authorities have a
strategy to address a number of these issues, whose implementation they intend to accelerate.
The regional authorities are working on the development of the interbank market and the
strengthening of the public debt market, which they see as priorities.

SENEGAL’S FINANCIAL SYSTEM: STRUCTURE, PERFORMANCE, AND RISKS
A. Overview of the Structure of the Financial System
1.
The financial system in Senegal is dominated by the banking sector. It is composed of
19 commercial banks concentrated in the three largest cities. Banks make up about 90 percent of the
financial system (Table 1). The five largest banks account for 66 percent of assets and collect 79 percent
of deposits. A large number of microfinance institutions (MFIs; 234 establishments) supply limited
financial services targeting lower income households. While they cover both urban and rural regions,
about half of the sector’s activity is concentrated in greater Dakar. Insurance companies (25) account for
most of the remainder of the domestic financial system. The regional securities and equity market is a
marginal source of funding, except for the government.1

2.
The banking sector is dominated by subsidiaries of French, Nigerian, Moroccan and panAfrican banks (regional banking groups that are originally African). Nonresidents also have stakes in
banks majority-owned by residents. The government has minority stakes (ranging from about 10 to
25 percent of equity) in a number of banks. One bank provides Islamic banking services. Only about
7 percent of the population holds a bank account, though this may be overstated as some individuals
may hold multiple accounts. Bank deposits amount to about 40 percent of GDP. The interbank market is

1

In addition, there is a public pension fund (“social security fund”). Employees of the formal sector (but not civil servants) contribute to it.
Given Senegal’s very young population, the fund is well capitalized. It manages assets of CFAF 175 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) and invests
predominantly in long term deposits in banks and in real estate.

underdeveloped, with only a limited amount of liquidity traded among banks. There is no explicit deposit
insurance scheme. More detailed analysis on the banking system is available in Section I.B.
3.
MFIs represent a small, though rising share of the Senegalese financial sector. MFIs focus on
basic services such as savings accounts and micro-credit. More people have accounts at MFIs than at
banks, which helps raise overall access to the financial system to about 20 percent of the population.
MFIs’ loans amount to about 10 percent of bank credit. Most MFIs are operated as mutuals or by NGOs,
and have a social mandate, e.g., to lend to farmers in remote regions. The 18 largest MFIs (with assets or
deposits above CFAF 2 billion) make up 90 percent of the MFI sector. More detailed analysis on MFIs is
available in Section I.C.
4.
The insurance industry, while still in its infancy, is growing. Non-life insurance development
has been fostered by the growth of credit markets, with banks requesting their clients to take insurance
on assets (e.g., houses) purchased through loans, and the development of the formal sector. Life
insurance expanded by 20 percent in 2011. Insurance companies are required to hold a minimum of cash
deposits (11 percent of their assets) for liquidity purposes. Their assets are invested in term deposits with
commercial banks (47 percent); securities, in particular government paper, and equity (18 percent); and
real estate (12 percent). Large foreign insurance companies are present, though mostly in the form of
domestic partnerships.
5.
The regional capital markets remain a marginal source of funding except for the
government. 2 The regional stock exchange based in Abidjan (known as BRVM, its French acronym), has
only one listed Senegalese company, Sonatel. Sonatel, a telecom company with subsidiaries in three
other countries in West Africa is the largest Senegalese company and has the highest capitalization at
BRVM. Only very few private and public companies have issued debt in the regional market, unlike
WAEMU sovereigns, which have significantly increased their recourse to regional financing. Sovereign
debt can be issued either at BRVM or through the central bank on the regional money market. This latter
segment has been the most active in recent years. Senegal has been able to tap the regional market for
increasingly large amounts, with gross issuance likely to exceed CFAF 500 billion (about 7 percent of
GDP) in 2012, but at short maturities (average maturity was 1.2 year at end-2011). The regional
government debt market is increasingly integrated, with more than half of the debt issued by the
Senegalese government bought by WAEMU investors outside Senegal. In addition, Senegal issued a 5year eurobond ($200 million) in 2009 and a 10-year eurobond ($500 million) in 2011, which was partly
used to retire the 2009 issue. No company has yet issued securities in international security markets.

The banking sector has expanded significantly in recent years. In 2011 bank credit to the
economy increased by 19 percent (to 29 percent of GDP), the number of bank branches by 11 percent

2

There is a growing consensus in the literature that the degree of bank based versus market-based system does not matter much for
economic growth. It is less important what the particular institutional arrangements that provide financial services to the economy are;
what matters is the overall financial development.

All data on individual banks were obtained from the BCEAO. The labeling of banks 1-19 differs across graphs, and therefore a particular
number does not necessarily correspond to the same bank.

and the number of bank accounts by 44 percent.4 Preliminary numbers for 2012 suggest a similar pace of
development, taking overall bank credit to the economy at more than 30 percent of GDP. Credit to the
service sector has been particularly buoyant, while credit to households, especially longer-term credit, has
also increased (see Figure 1). Most banks’ core business consists in collecting deposits, lending to bigger
firms including subsidiaries of multinationals, and holding and dealing in government securities. The
entry of three new banks (mostly regional African banking groups) combined with growing competition
from MFIs have recently pushed existing banks to diversify away from their high-end clients by offering
basic, cheaper services to the middle class, including students and young professionals.
7.
The banking system appears to be relatively robust, with concentration of lending and
credit quality being the main risks. Both the authorities and Fund staff have conducted stress-tests in
recent months (with the authorities doing this on a quarterly basis). The stress tests calibrated various
large but plausible shocks (applied to individual banks) in line with the economic structure of Senegal.
The system was shocked for (i) sectoral risk, including default by the largest individual exposure and a
shock to the three largest borrowing industrial sectors; (ii) overall credit risk comprising a downgrade of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) by one category and an increase in total NPLs by 50 percent; and (iii) credit
risk related to default of a public entity, or default on credit to the government and to public enterprises.
The stress-tests found that liquidity risks and interest rate risks could be withstood, given that banks are
highly liquid and the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities is rather small. Only the
concentration of lending was found to be a major source of vulnerability, as loans are concentrated in a
few sectors and companies, and exposure to the public sector is large.
8.
The findings of the stress-tests are corroborated by the usual financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). With the usual caveat in mind–FSIs are backward looking and procyclical in nature, only
provide averages that may hide important variations, and assuming that the data are accurate–Box 1 and
Table 1 provide an overview of the soundness of the Senegalese banking system. Based on these
indicators, Senegalese banks appear on average well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, with asset quality
being the main concern. Also the international financial crisis and the ongoing crisis in Europe did not
seem to have large repercussions on Senegalese banks, even though indirect effects may have been
significant.5

4

The large increase in the number of bank accounts reflects to a large extent the recent obligation for civil servants to have a bank
account to receive their salary by bank transfer, and a similar decision for the payment of monthly grants to university students.
5

The direct impact has been limited because banks (including subsidiaries of foreign banks) are locally funded. An indirect effect has
reportedly been felt through: (i) lower remittances; (ii) some local clients, who export and were paid with delays from overseas, requested
extensions of credit lines by local banks; (iii) corresponding banks in Europe imposed tougher restrictions on Senegalese banks, and
tightened credit lines; (iv) subsidiaries of international banking groups were requested by their headquarters to tighten their rules on risktaking. Note that African banking groups appear to have taken the opportunity to expand in the region, counterbalancing some of the
negative effect.

Box 1: Banking System Soundness
Capitalization: FSIs show that the banking sector is overall at an adequate level of capitalization. While the
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) decreased to 16 percent at end-2011, it is still largely above the regulatory
minimum of 8 percent, and increased further through June 2012. 6 Part of the explanation for this high level is
large holdings of sovereign paper, which carries zero risk-weighting. As illustrated during the euro area crisis,
this treatment of soverei–gn risk may be problematic. The recent crises in the WAEMU (Côte d’Ivoire and Mali)
also suggest that this risk cannot be considered nil; an increase in the risk-weighting of sovereign papers
would reduce CARs significantly. Only one bank is currently undercapitalized, but because of small size and
limited interconnectedness, it does not raise a systemic risk, and it is being restructured.
Asset Quality: At first glance, the quality of assets appears to be a cause for some concern, and may require
further investigation and analysis. The ratio of gross nonperforming loans (NPLs)7 to total loans was
16.2 percent at end-2011, and increased further in early 2012. However, there are factors qualifying the risk
from such high NPL numbers. The latter reflect to a large extent the portfolios of three banks with NPLs in
excess of 20 percent, while most other banks have NPLs below 5 percent. In addition, the relatively high level
of provisioning for NPLs mitigates risks. A reason for high NPLs reported during discussions with bankers is
that NPLs tend to be kept on banks’ books longer than is typically the case in other countries, in part because
of the long time needed to exercise guarantees through the judicial system. Nonetheless, legacy NPLs do not
explain completely the situation, as new NPLs are still relatively high, hinting at limited risk-management
capabilities, particularly for some of the smaller banks. In addition, a relatively high concentration risk (below)
suggests that the quality of assets can deteriorate rapidly if only a few debtors get into trouble.
Profitability: The profitability of the banking sector is high. The return on assets was 1.8 percent as of mid2012 for the sector, with the return on equity being above 17 percent. The profitability of banks is boosted by
the fact that they have access to ample and cheap deposits from households with which they can purchase
government paper. The interest margin on these nominally risk-free operations is substantial.
Liquidity: Liquidity risks are low for the banking sector as a whole, though three smaller banks do not meet
the minimum liquidity requirements. Structural factors explaining high liquidity include the limited number of
bankable projects, but also regulatory rules that require banks to finance medium and long-term assets to a
large extent with medium and long-term resources; as the latter are scarce; banks tend to keep their funds in
liquid assets. In addition, subsidiaries of international banking groups are constrained by intra group
regulations and treat debt issued by WAEMU sovereigns as risky, and as result limit their exposure to these
sovereigns. This restricts the investment universe of banks further, and constraints the amounts of lending
activities of these subsidiary banks, thereby keeping liquidity levels higher than they would be otherwise.
Finally, the lack of a developed interbank market tends to increase the accumulation of liquidity by the
banking system, as liquidity is not significantly traded.

6

One could admittedly question whether the 8 percent ratio is adequate given the environment of Senegal, but this is beyond the scope
of this paper.
7

The accounting convention followed by the banking system for NPLs and provisioning is not in line with best
international practices. For instance, a claim becomes nonperforming after 6 (not 3) months of missed payments.

C. Microfinance
9.
After a period of consolidation spearheaded by the authorities, the microfinance sector has
continued its rapid expansion. A regulatory reform initiated in 2008-09 led to a reorganization of
supervisory responsibilities, with the larger institutions holding assets and/or deposits of more than
CFAF 2 billion now supervised by the banking commission, while smaller institutions are supervised by
the Ministry of Finance. Following the reform, 118 entities were closed down, though credit (and
deposits) continued to rise, from CFAF 81 billion in 2005 to CFAF 219 billion in July 2012 (about 3 percent
of GDP). Consolidation has led to the emergence of 18 larger entities which together represent
90 percent of the market, with one institution alone making up 60 percent of the market. Credit is mostly
allocated to micro businesses in trade, services such as catering, agriculture, and transportation. Larger
MFIs cooperate with various commercial institutions in transferring money and increasingly use banks to
finance operations as they do not have access to BCEAO refinancing.
10.
The larger MFIs are increasingly competing with banks. In 2012, the asset holdings of the
largest MFI make it as big as the seventh largest bank. Four MFIs have been transformed into
corporations (“sociétés anonymes”) and are capitalized, often with the support of donors; one MFI has
even set up its own bank. Larger MFIs enjoy certain advantages that may improve their competitive
position relative to commercial banks:


Most MFIs are structured as cooperatives, benefitting from tax exemptions which were originally
justified by their social mandate and not-for-profit motive;



The cap on interest charged for loans is 27 percent for MFIs but 18 percent for banks;



MFIs often benefit from public and/or donor support via (i) direct or indirect funds which
constitute cheap financing; (ii) guarantees; and (iii) training of staff.

11.
Although the MFI sector is profitable overall, the situation varies greatly depending on the
size of the institutions. In 2011, the 18 larger entities generated cumulative profits of CFAF 4.5 billion
while the other institutions had cumulative losses of about CFAF 0.5 billion. One reason for smaller MFIs‘
poor profitability might be that the rapid expansion of the sector has shrunk the pool of “lower-risk”
clients, and forced MFIs to grant credits to “higher risk” borrowers, while entering new areas or offering
new products in which they may lack expertise. Also, smaller networks tend to be in rather remote areas
with a high share of credit to agriculture, which is highly volatile and prone to shocks.

mutual structure may also raise collective action problems–particularly for institutions with a large
number of members–potentially raising governance and accountability issues. Governance problems
were indeed experienced by the largest MFI in recent years but were addressed forcefully by the
authorities.

D. Systemic Risk in Senegal
13.
Systemic risk is defined as any threat of disruption to financial services that is caused by an
impairment of all or parts of the financial system and that has the potential to have serious
negative consequences for the real economy. It is a form of negative externality that occurs when a
bank failure, market seizure, or breakdown of the infrastructure can have serious adverse implications for
market participants. Systemic risk can be decomposed into time-series and cross sectional risk. In the
time-series dimension, the build-up of risk over time interacts with the macroeconomic cycle. Financial
institutions and borrowers may take on excessive amounts of leverage in the upswing of an economic
cycle only to become overly risk-averse in a downswing. This amplifies the boom and bust cycle in the
supply of credit and liquidity—and by extension in asset prices—which can be damaging to the real
economy. In the cross-sectional dimension, the growing size and complexity of the financial system is
raising interconnectedness and common exposures which may increase contagion when problems arise.
As a result, the failure of one institution—particularly, one of significant size or with strong
interconnections—can threaten the system as a whole.

8

Performance vis-à-vis profitability benchmarks is as follows: return on equity (5 percent vs. a target of 15 percent); return
on assets (2 percent vs. a target of 3 percent); profit margin (13 percent vs. a target of 20 percent); and cost income ratio
(81 percent vs. a target ranging between 40 and 60 percent).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SENEGAL

14.
At this juncture systemic risk is likely to be limited in Senegal, as no sector seems highly
leveraged (Box 2). Banks in Senegal finance mostly prime borrowers with short-term credit such as trade
finance, implying that risks to the financial system, besides from exogenous shocks, are likely to be low.
15.
Time-series systemic risk has been low so far. The correlation between credit growth and GDP
growth has been very limited so far (at about 0.1). This reflects low financial depth—which means that
even a large increase in credit to the economy remains relatively small relative to GDP—and leverage
which does not fluctuate much over the business cycle. In addition, Senegal has not been subject to large
capital in- and outflows that often constitute the source of time-series volatility in emerging markets (see
Figure 4).
Box 2: Leverage in Senegal
Leverage levels in Senegal are low to moderate. The mirror image of a relatively low credit to GDP ratio is
low leverage levels in the economy. Government debt, while on a rising trend, remains manageable; corporate,
banking and household leverage levels are low to non-existent.
A. The government has in recent years accessed the international capital market, but it borrows abroad
largely from donors on concessional terms. Domestically, borrowing takes place largely through the regional
bond market. Domestic debt has increased rapidly in recent years, but remains at manageable levels (about 10
percent of GDP).
B. Banks finance themselves largely out of deposits, with limited debt issuance, keeping leverage in check. In
addition, banks generally are highly liquid.
C. As bank lending takes place against guarantees rather than future cash flows, only households with
significant assets are in a position to borrow, but even they tend to have low gearing ratios. Most other
households are credit-constrained, and hence unable to leverage up, at least in the formal market. In rural
areas, there may be pockets of households that are overleveraged from having borrowed from MFIs, though
no data is available on that.
D. The corporate sector, similar to the household sector, is dual in nature. One part is composed of a few,
large companies with strong balance sheets that largely borrow short-term to finance working capital, but
have low leverage levels; the other part is the SME sector that is largely credit constrained and hence unable to
leverage.

16.
Most common forms of cross-section systemic risk are not a major concern at the moment,
although some developments need to be closely monitored. Interconnection among banks is limited
(Figure 4). This reflects, in particular, the underdevelopment of money market. Risks arising from
common exposure seem limited too, although there is high lending concentration in most banks.9 This is
because the top borrowers tend to differ across banks. The main exception is the government, as many
banks hold government debt. With the planned development of the interbank and government debt
market, bank interconnectedness could increase quickly and will need to be monitored.
9

Related party lending rules, while less stringent than in other jurisdictions, do not seem to be a major factor behind the
high lending concentration.
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

17.
Interconnection between banks and the rest of the financial system is significant and needs
to be monitored too. Insurance companies use bank deposits as an investment vehicle, rather than
simply for liquidity purposes. Insurance companies also buy regional bank bonds and have equity
participation in some of the banks. In addition, microfinance institutions also place their money in banks,
with one MFI even owning a bank. Lack of detailed data did not allow further analysis of the importance
of these linkages, but such a risk mapping warrants further investigation by the authorities.
18.
None of the Senegalese banks fits the definition of being too big to fail, suggesting that this
form of cross-section systemic risk is contained.10 A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is an
institution whose eventual demise would create havoc for the rest of the financial system because of its
size, interconnectedness, complexity, international linkages and/or the lack of available substitutes for the
service it provides. Société Générale and BNP Paribas, which have subsidiaries in Senegal, have been
designed as SIFIs by the Financial Stability Board. This is not the case of the parents of other foreignowned subsidiaries, or any domestically-owned bank.

10

The focus on too big to fail banks does not mean that the failure of a smaller bank is not an important issue; such a
failure needs to be handled well to avoid raising concerns about the health of the remaining banks.

BENCHMARKING SENEGAL’S FINANCIAL SECTOR: WHAT DO
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS TELL US?
A. Methodology of the Benchmarking Exercise
19.
The benchmarking exercise allows an assessment of Senegal’s financial sector performance
with respect to depth, breadth, access, and efficiency.11 For each key financial sector indicator, a
structural benchmark is estimated based on the country’s economic and structural characteristics.12 The
difference between the observed value and the benchmark then needs to be interpreted. A negative
difference suggests scope for policy action, while a positive difference could reflect successful reforms.
The analysis was carried out using data from 1995 onwards, where available, and the tool developed by
the World Bank for this purpose.

11

This exercise only considers the banking market, debt and equity markets as well as some non-bank financial institutions. Due to
limitations in the dataset, microfinance could not be benchmarked.
12

The structural benchmarks are calculated based on Al-Hussainy et al. (2010) and FinStats from the World Bank. Using a large dataset of
countries, each financial indicator was regressed on a set of structural characteristics, such as GDP per capita and its square, population
size and density, the age dependency ratio and country-specific dummies and year fixed effects. These regressions are expected to be
updated regularly.

20.
Comparisons are also made with a few selected countries, namely Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and
Morocco. Côte d’Ivoire was chosen because it is a member of the WAEMU and it shares a number of
characteristics with Senegal. Kenya is an example of a sub-Saharan African economy with a rapidly
developing financial sector. Finally, Morocco is a country that many Senegalese observers view as a
potential model for financial development, and is used as an emerging market comparator.

B. A Financial Performance Broadly in Line with Structural Characteristics
Depth. Senegal outperforms the benchmarks for banking and insurance, but underperforms for debt and
equity markets (Figure 6):


Senegal’s banking sector has deepened significantly in recent years with the ratios of credit and
deposits to GDP now significantly above their benchmarks. Bank intermediation, measured by the
credit to deposit ratio, is in line with the structural benchmark.



Although low in absolute terms, the ratios of insurance sector assets and insurance premiums to
GDP are significantly above their benchmarks.



Debt markets are deepening but they remain below potential, particularly as a source of private
sector financing.



Taking into account its regional nature and the limited recourse to it by the private sector, the
equity market looks underdeveloped, at least from a Senegalese perspective.

Breadth. The picture is more mixed with regard to the range of products, markets and providers
(Figure 7).


The level of competition in the banking system—proxied by the asset concentration of the three
largest banks or the interest rate margin—is close to the benchmark. More recent data (for 2011 and
2012) suggest that competition may have increased.



The ratio of credit to the public sector to GDP is in line with its benchmark. This ratio has increased in
recent years likely reflecting the development of the government debt market.



The insurance sector outperforms the benchmark, in particular in life insurance.



There is underperformance in the area of long-term financing, including from the regional stock
market, where only one Senegalese company is listed against a predicted value of 30 companies.

Access. Access to banks is mostly in line the benchmarks, In particular, the number of bank branches
relative to the population significantly outperforms the benchmark, and the gap has increased.
Efficiency and profitability. These are both broadly in line with structural characteristics for the banking
sector. One exception is NPLs, which are significantly higher (and provisioning lower) than their
benchmark.

C.

But with Still Substantial Scope for Deepening

21.
While statistical benchmarking shows that Senegal is not lagging in terms of financial
sector development, direct comparison to selected peer countries suggests substantial scope for
further deepening. Even for indicators for which Senegal outperforms the benchmarks, there is still
some distance to peer countries. Policy action may be warranted to catch up with them, in particular
Kenya which has overtaken Senegal on various indicators over the past five years, despite having started
at similar levels.


Depth. Kenya’s deposits and credit to GDP ratios are about 10 percentage points higher than
Senegal’s while Morocco’s are more than twice as high. Even though Senegal’s insurance market
performs very well compared to the structural benchmarks, the share of insurers’ assets to GDP in
Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya and Morocco is significantly larger. Stock market capitalization to GDP has
picked up markedly in Kenya since 2002.



Breadth. Kenya has been able to reduce bank asset concentration since 2003, starting from the
same level as Senegal then. Life insurance premiums have increased much faster in both Kenya
and Côte d’Ivoire than in Senegal throughout the past decade. Also, there is a big difference in
the development of the equity market, with 50 listed companies in Kenya and more than 70 in
Morocco, but only one in Senegal.



Access. Although broadly in line with other peers including Kenya, access is significantly lower
than in Morocco for firms as well as for households. However, the indicators may not reflect the
impact of mobile banking on access. Mobile banking has developed very quickly in Kenya, but
not in Senegal.

GAINS FROM FURTHER FINANCIAL DEEPENING 13
A. Impact on the Private Sector: Dealing with Volatility and Financing Growth
22.
Shallow financial markets make it more difficult for firms and households to access
financial services, leading to:


Higher volatility: One of the key functions of banks—to enable agents, including households, to
smooth consumption over time—is not performed by an underdeveloped banking system.
Shocks have to be fully absorbed by a household’s existing assets, and should they be
insufficient, adjustment has to be instantaneous, leading in extreme cases to destitution or worse.
Shallow banking systems tend to create pro-cyclical financing conditions, providing the private
sector with credit in good times, but cutting it back in bad times, accentuating volatility. Financial
sector development can help alleviate these liquidity constraints, thereby ultimately reducing
volatility.

13

The Article IV consultation with Senegal only focused on the fiscal implications of a shallow financial system, as monetary policy is set at
the regional level. The consequences on the latter one will be analyzed during the regional consultation to be held in early 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SENEGAL

Lower growth: Financial development affects economic growth by facilitating the mobilization of
savings to finance investment and by contributing to a better allocation of resources. Rioja and
Valev (2004a) find that finance boosts growth in rich countries primarily by raising productivity
growth, while finance encourages growth in poorer countries primarily by increasing capital
accumulation. Furthermore, Rioja and Valev (2004b) find that the impact may be nonlinear:
Countries with very low levels of financial development experience little growth acceleration from
a marginal increase in financial development, while the effect is larger for rich countries and
particularly large for middle-income countries.

B. Impact on the Public sector: Removing Constraints on Fiscal Policy
23.
The constraints on fiscal policy stemming from a shallow financial system are multiple,
though not always visible:
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL



Liquidity (and interest rate) risk: With a large part of domestic debt issued at relatively short
maturities, liquidity risks faced by the government are significant. Should regional liquidity dry up,
the government would be in a difficult position to roll over its debt, and may have to finance
itself through undesirable means such as arrears, turning a fiscal issue into a financial stability risk
(if arrears to banks) or a risk to private sector development (if arrears to suppliers). This situation
was experienced to some extent by Senegal in early 2012. Difficulties in raising financing ahead of
the presidential election led to significant payments delays to suppliers. Short maturities also
expose to significant interest rate risks.



Fiscal cost: A deeper financial market, by creating more liquidity and allowing for economies of
scale—reducing average cost of issuance by utilizing the same infrastructure— in debt issuance,
may reduce the marginal cost of borrowing to the sovereign. These costs tend to be high
presently in Senegal, particularly for longer maturities. For instance, the yield at issuance for
bonds with maturities of three to five years was in the 7-9 percent range in the first half of 2012,
while average inflation was around 2 percent.



Scope for counter-cyclical policy: Senegal’s economy is susceptible to shocks. This puts a
premium on fiscal flexibility, particularly since monetary policy is set at the regional level and
therefore cannot address the impact of asymmetric shocks. A deeper financial system would give
the government more scope to run counter-cyclical policies in the event of a shock, potentially
reducing the need for large fiscal adjustment which would particularly affect the part of the
population that lives close to the subsistence level and has itself limited access to credit. It would
also help keeping the pace of execution of investment projects, which if delayed would generally
results in higher fiscal costs (beyond lost output in the medium term).



Diversified investor base. An investor base that is homogenous and narrow, by carrying similar
risk preference and time-horizons, is a concern. It creates a market that may be easily disrupted.
In the case of Senegal, the liquidity of the debt market is highly dependent on the liquidity
situation of banks, which are the main investors.



Financing public investment. A shallow financial system limits the ability of the government to
finance long-term investment with large economic and/or social rates of return. This is
particularly pertinent for Senegal, given the need for timely infrastructure investments in energy
and transportation.

FURTHER DEEPENING WITH STABILITY: OBSTACLES AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
24.
The development of the financial system should be pursued forcefully in a way that
preserves financial stability. Financial systems play a crucial role in facilitating growth and helping
reduce vulnerability and poverty. From this perspective, there is no doubt that further financial
development is highly desirable in a low-income country like Senegal. However, financial system can also
be a source of volatility and crisis, particularly when they become large and/or highly interconnected.
There is large body of evidence that financial crises are usually preceded by rapid growth in financial
aggregates. As discussed earlier, Senegal’s financial system remains relatively small and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SENEGAL

interconnectedness is limited, and therefore these risks are presently lower than in more developed
countries. While this suggests that further development should be the priority in Senegal when designing
a strategy for the financial sector, the implications for financial stability should also be analyzed and
addressed. Section IV.A analyzes the main obstacles to financial development, while Section IV.B
discusses ways to improve the present and future stability of the financial system. The main
recommendations are summarized in Table 2.

A. Obstacles to Further Financial Development
25.

There is a broad agreement between the authorities and the Fund on the main obstacles to

further financial development.14 Many of these obstacles which have been well identified in the past
few years are commonly found in low-income countries. They include:


Informational asymmetries. Lack of information on borrowers, including due to the limited size
of the formal sector, the limited availability of audited company statements and the absence of
credit bureaus (and limited use of existing databases at the central bank), increases adverse
selection and moral hazard issues, and ultimately leads to credit rationing (Figure 9). This
problem also affects the larger MFIs, which tend to lend to some of the banks’ customers too.
Information asymmetries are also an issue for the development of the interbank market.



Business and judicial environment. A key issue is the absence of formalized property rights in
large parts of the country, which increases the difficulty of using land as collateral in lending.
Moreover, the judicial process tends to be costly and slow, with some recent judgments viewed
by lenders as motivated by social considerations rather than legal merit. This inability to recoup
losses at a reasonable cost, through collateral initially pledged, discourages lending further,
particular to new segments.



Tax regime. Taxes and fees on banking and stock exchange operations are relatively high. This
raises the cost of financial services and reduce demand for them.



Regulatory and supervision issues. Some regulatory ratios, such as the transformation ratio, are
perceived as excessively constraining and curbing the development of medium and long-term
credit. This ratio, as well as a few others (see below), are not observed by a number of banks. This
situation can affect the credibility of the banking system regulatory and supervisory framework
and exacerbates the informational problems mentioned above. Another issue is whether the
prudential framework is sufficiently responsive to new needs that are likely to emerge first at the
national level, but will eventually need to be regulated at the regional level. When a country is at
the forefront of financial sector reform, which seems the case of Senegal on certain issues (e.g.,
credit bureaus, Islamic banking), the need to develop or amend regulations at the regional level
may slow the reform process. It should however be recognized that by pushing for reforms to
develop their national financial sectors, countries closer to the reform frontier create positive
spillovers for the entire region.

14

These issues were discussed in the Senegal FSAP (2004) and the WAEMU FSAP (2008), and many analyses and
recommendations made at the time remain valid.
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SENEGAL

Skills. The quality of human capital is critical for banks and MFIs, as it provides the necessary riskmanagement expertise and the ability to design and sell the products that customers need. The
lack of appropriate skills may explain why in recent years some MFIs that moved from dealing
with micro-enterprises to dealing with SMEs saw their profitability decrease. Banks may face
similar challenges moving from larger enterprises to SMEs. The lack of financial culture is also
often blamed for the very limited recourse to the stock exchange.

26.
The authorities have a strategy to address a number of these issues whose implementation
needs to be accelerated. The national consultation on credit took place in 2010. It identified clearly the
main obstacles and led to an action plan with specific measures to improve access to credit for both
households and firms, particularly SMEs. These measures are grouped in 11 different categories,
including among others: facilitating the use of guarantees; SME debt and equity financing and general
support to SMEs; availability of information; cost of credit; financial intermediation and the judicial
environment. Progress was made in some areas, such as registering land titles and information provision
(although the introduction of credit bureaus, for instance, was delayed to allow for a regional approach
to the issue). While measures on the mobilization of resources are generally behind schedule, the study
to determine the share of stable resources among bank deposits has been completed by the Senegalese
banking association. This study is a pre-requisite for the regional regulator to the reconsideration of the
transformation ratio which banks view an impediment to the availability of longer-term credit. Actions to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

SENEGAL

improve the efficiency of the judicial process, such as the training of judges in economic affairs, are
generally behind schedule, and so are measures aiming at streamlining and improving public support in
favor of SMEs. Staff is of the view that this action plan remains largely relevant and that its
implementation should be accelerated.
27.
A number of obstacles will however need to be addressed at the regional level. As
mentioned above, prudential regulation is a regional responsibility and so is the development of regional
financial markets. As detailed in the latest report on WAEMU policies, the regional authorities are working
on the development of the interbank market and the strengthening of the public debt market, which they
see as priorities. They also intend to review certain prudential rules. These issues will be discussed in
more details during the next regional consultation in early 2013.

B. Enhancing Financial Stability
28.
Micro-prudential regulation of banks could be enhanced and supervision strengthened. As
discussed in the 2012 report on regional policies, some prudential ratios and rules are not in line with
international best practices. Banks’ compliance with prudential rules will also need to improve (Figure 10).
For instance, the transformation ratio is met by only 11 Senegalese banks, while no bank meets the
portfolio structure ratio, which requires that at least 60 percent of a bank’s credit portfolio be composed
of rated assets. In these specific cases, low compliance may reflect the perception by banks that certain
rules are inadequate. Low compliance, however, also suggests a need to strengthen bank supervision and
the enforcement of corrective measures.15 New challenges, such as the need to monitor the rapid
development of banking groups in Senegal and more generally the region, also call for strengthened
supervision. These issues will be discussed during the next regional consultation in early 2013.

The portfolio structure ratio, which requires that at least 60 percent of a bank’s credit portfolio be composed of rated
assets, is problematic in an environment where few rated entities exist with the requisite characteristics.

29.
With the financial system growing and getting more interconnected, systemic risk issues
will be more likely to arise in the future and will need to be mitigated. Financial regulation in the
WAEMU region, like in many countries or regions abroad, is mostly based on the microprudential
paradigm that assumes that by making each financial institution safe, the system as a whole is safer. A
macroprudential approach to regulation instead considers the systemic implications of the collective
behavior of financial institutions—e.g., what would happen in the WAEMU if suddenly all banks decided
to stop buying sovereign debt? The recently established Financial Stability Council, which comprises all
the key regulators at the regional level, is there to monitor the emergence and limit the consequences of
systemic risk. Its activity and effectiveness will be discussed in the context of the next regional mission.
30.
With the increasing interconnectedness and breadth of its financial system, Senegal may
need to develop a more holistic view of the system and of systemic risk at the national level. At
present, it seems that no single entity within Senegal has a detailed view of the whole financial system,
the interconnection of its various components, and where the potential pockets of systemic risk may lie.
Such a function should be developed in Senegal, preferably under the purview of the Ministry of Finance,
and in close collaboration with the other regulators and supervisors, particularly the BCEAO. The
institution responsible for this function would also be well placed to reflect on the scope for national
macroprudential regulation to address country specific systemic risk.16 Such a reflection should obviously
be conducted in concerted fashion with the regional authorities and regulators.

16

This approach has been followed in the Euro area. European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was established in December
2010, charged with providing macro-prudential oversight of the EU the financial system as a whole. In addition, in January
2011, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational
Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) were replaced by European
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) to create a new European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS). The ESRB, tasked with
monitoring, identifying, and predicting potential systemic risks and issuing recommendations. At the same time, the ESRB
collaborates with ESAs, providing them with the necessary macro-prudential input to assist them in carrying out their
supervisory functions. One of the ESRB’s first decisions was to recommend the establishment of an efficient macroprudential policy framework in each EU Member States. The recommendation was for each member state to designate an
authority in national legislation to conduct macro-prudential policy. Cooperation between the national macro-prudential
authorities and the ESRB would be warranted, particularly to enable the timely identification and subsequent discussion of
relevant cross-border issues.

Box 3: Bank Supervision and Resolution in Senegal: Division of Labor Between the National and
the Regional Authorities
The architecture of the supervisory system is based on a clear division of labor between the
national and regional level (see Figure 11). Banks and other large deposit-taking institutions (including
MFIs) are supervised at the regional level by the BCEAO and the WAEMU Banking Commission. Smaller
microfinance operators are supervised at the national level by the Ministry of Finance. Capital market
activity is supervised regionally under the supervision of the Regional Council for Public Savings and
Financial Markets (CREPMF, as per its french acronym). The Ministry of Finance, in conjunction with the
supra-regional insurance sector regulator CIMA (“Conférence Interafricaine des Marchés d' Assurances”),
supervises insurance companies. The 2010 cenral bank reform created the Financial Stability Council,
charged with macroprudential supervision and guaranteeing the stability of the overall financial system
at the regional level.
The resolution framework similarly depends on a sharing of responsibilities between national and
regional bodies. The national directorate of the BCEAO – which is regularly collecting data on various
financial indicators and carries out offsite supervision–is typically the first body to detect difficulties at a
financial institution. It flags potential operational and stability concerns to the banking commission, with
the concerned national authority kept informed. The banking commission is reponsible for on-site
supervision. When concerns arise, joint inspections comprising members of both the banking
commission and the BCEAO national directorate intensify the supervision of the institution. Evidence
from on-site and off-site inspections guides the banking commission’s decision on possible prompt
corrective actions or possible sanctions. In case of solvency concerns, the banking commission can
recommend the closing of an institution. The banking commission informs the Ministry of Finance, which
is the body that has to formally rescind the banking license. The Minister of Finance, however, has the
possibility of appealing to the council of ministers, where a simple majority could overrule the banking
commission’s decision.

Another area for further work is the financial crisis prevention and resolution framework.
The fact that technically insolvent banks have been allowed to continue operations in some WAEMU
countries may reflect weaknesses in the bank resolution framework (Box 3). As shown by the euro-area
experience, having a good framework in place will be increasingly important with the deepening of the
financial system and further regional integration. Developing the financial crisis prevention system is also
an important task. Work is ongoing in this area, for instance on the creation of a regional financial
stability fund and the establishment of a deposit insurance scheme. These are areas that will require close
cooperation between the national and the regional authorities.

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the countries of the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The most recent safeguards assessment of
the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update assessment found that the BCEAO
continues to have controls in place at the operational level. The overall governance framework
needed nonetheless to be strengthened by the addition of an audit committee to ensure that the
Board of Directors exercises appropriate oversight over the control structure, including the audit
mechanisms and financial statements. Such committee was established after the completion of the
assessment following the Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO. Efforts to implement
fully the International Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework should also be pursued.

Exchange System:

Senegal is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The exchange
system, common to all members of the union, is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The union's common currency, the CFA franc, had
been pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA
franc was devalued and the new parity set at CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective December 31, 1998, the
parity was switched to the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = €1.
The authorities confirmed that Senegal had not imposed measures that could give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. They will inform the Fund, if any such measure is
introduced.
Aspects of the exchange system were also discussed in the report “WAEMU: Common Policies of
Member Countries" (Country Report No. 12/59 of March 12, 2012).
XI.

Article IV Consultations:

The latest Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on May 24, 2010 (Country
Report No.10/165). In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed
the broadly satisfactory implementation of the Senegalese authorities’ economic program
supported under the PSI and the ESF. While Senegal’s risk of debt distress is low, Directors
underscored the need to gradually withdraw the temporary fiscal stimulus and reduce the budget
deficit to a level consistent with debt sustainability. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to further
strengthen revenue collection and stressed that spending pressures had to be contained to
preserve macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability and meet the WAEMU convergence
criteria, while safeguarding priority spending. Directors supported efforts to reform public financial
management and emphasized the need to maintain the reform momentum. They encouraged the
authorities to improve their liquidity and debt management to complement the increasing integrity
of their budget framework and expressed concern about program slippages that indicate that
closer attention needs to be paid to spending procedures and control mechanism. Directors saw
room for further strengthening the authorities’ investment planning and evaluation with a view to
ensuring high productivity of government spending. They underscored the need to overcome the
weak export performance and to improve competitiveness through a more supportive business
climate and better governance that would stimulate private-sector growth. Directors underlined
that other complementary policies need to be put in place to regain Senegal’s growth momentum
and return to previous growth trajectories. Sustained efforts are required to enhance the financial
sector’s contribution to the economy. Directors also encouraged the authorities to implement their
energy sector reform plan to limit supply bottlenecks and fiscal risks.

XII. Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) Participation:
A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund conducted a mission under
the FSAP program in 2000 and 2001. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued
in 2001 (IMF Country Report No. 01/189). An FSAP update was undertaken in 2004, focusing on
development issues (in particular nationwide supply of basic financial services and access of SMEs
to credit), in line with the priorities defined in the PRSP (IMF Country Report No. 05/126). A regional
FSAP for the WAEMU was undertaken in 2007. A ROSC on the data module was published in 2002.
An FAD mission conducted a ROSC on the fiscal transparency module in 2005.

Anti Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism

The onsite visit for Senegal's AML/CFT evaluation took place in July/August 2007 in the context of
ECOWAS’s Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA).
The report was adopted in early May 2008 by the GIABA Plenary held in Accra, Ghana. The report
highlighted several areas of weaknesses in the AML/CFT system, confirmed by a score of 12 noncompliant and 16 partially compliant ratings out of the 40+9 FATF AML/CFT recommendations. In
May 2009 Senegal joined the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs). The FIU publishes
on its website statistics on suspicious transaction reports received, the number of cases transmitted
to the judiciary, and the number of convictions. Senegal’s Fourth Follow-Up Report was discussed
at GIABA’s May 2012 Plenary. It acknowledged the progress achieved and encouraged Senegal to
continue making improvements. At the same time, it was agreed that Senegal will submit its Fifth
Follow-Up Report to the May 2013 Plenary.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Senegal – Statistical Issues Appendix
As of October 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. There are weaknesses in data on national accounts, production, and social indicators. The
authorities are committed to improving the quality and availability of economic, financial, and social
indicators, partially relying on technical assistance from the Fund and other international organizations
and donors.
National accounts: The compilation of the national accounts generally follows the System of National
Accounts, 1993. Despite staff’s professionalism, the lack of adequate financial resources has
constrained efforts to collect and process data. Data sources are deficient in some areas, particularly
the informal sector. Because of financial constraints, surveys of business and households are not
conducted regularly. However, efforts continue to be made to improve data collection procedures,
strengthen the coordination among statistical agencies, and reduce delays in data dissemination. The
Regional Technical Assistance Center for West Africa (West AFRITAC) has been assisting Senegal with
the improvement of their real sector statistics, in particular annual and quarterly national accounts
(QNA).
Government finance statistics (GFS): GFS are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and Finance
from customs, tax, and treasury directorate sources, and quarterly disseminated as government
financial operations tables (TOFE) in the ministry's publications. Following Fund’s TA, TOFE
presentations were improved and aligned with the extended WAEMU TOFE. Remaining step is to
implement the recent WAEMU fiscal directives. A regional advisor in GFS has been conducting
technical assistance missions aimed at improving the consistency of fiscal reporting and migrating to
the methodologies of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The regional advisor also
supported efforts to resume reporting of annual and higher frequency data for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and electronic dissemination of the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics: Preliminary monetary data are compiled by the national agency of
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and officially released (including to the IMF) by
BCEAO headquarters. The authorities report monetary data to STA on a regular basis, with a lag of
about three months. There has been an improvement in the timeliness of reporting interest rate and
main depository corporation data (central bank and commercial). An area-wide page for the WAEMU
zone was introduced in the January 2003 issue of IFS. As part of the continuing efforts to help the
authorities implement the statistical methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual, a STA TA mission visited Dakar in 2011 to assist the BCEAO National agency in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SENEGAL

migration of MFS to the standardized report form (SRF) framework. The mission was undertaken as a
pilot within the context of a multi-annual project for improving the relevance and timeliness of MFS
compiled by the BCEAO.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the Senegalese national
agency of the BCEAO. With STA support, several steps have been taken to address certain
shortcomings, including: (i) implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition;
(ii) modification and simplification of related surveys for companies and banks; (iii) improvement in the
computerization of procedures; and (iv) significant strengthening of training. Nevertheless, further
steps could be taken to enhance the quality and coverage of the balance of payments statistics.
Although definitive balance of payments statistics can now be provided with a delay of less than one
year, there are significant delays in reporting the data to STA.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has begun the process of regional harmonization of statistical methodologies within the
framework of the WAEMU. It participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in 2001. In 2006, the
authorities expressed their commitment to work toward subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and appointed a national SDDS coordinator. The 2008 SDDS
assessment mission evaluated dissemination practices against SDDS requirements for coverage,
periodicity and timeliness and, in cooperation with the authorities, developed an action plan to
address identified gaps. A Data ROSC was published on the IMF website in 2002.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Senegal

On December 10, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Senegal.1
Background
Senegal’s growth has been sluggish in recent years, with implications for poverty reduction.
Average growth was relatively strong in 1995–2005 (4.5 percent) and accompanied by a large
drop in poverty incidence (from 68 to 48 percent). Due partly to a series of exogenous shocks
(i.e., food and fuel global prices, global financial and economic crisis, and more recently, the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

electricity sector crisis and drought in the Sahel), growth decreased to an average of
3.3 percent in 2006–2011. As a result, poverty incidence barely decreased during this period
and still stood at 47 percent in 2011. Wide disparities exist between rural areas, where poverty
incidence is higher than the national average (at 57 percent), and urban areas (at 33 percent).
Fiscal deficits and debt ratios have increased in recent years. The fiscal deficit, which was
below 4 percent of GDP in 2007, stood at 6.7 percent of GDP in 2011. Higher deficits were
justified to a large extent by the response to successive shocks. Meanwhile, the public debt-toGDP ratio has increased continuously and is expected to exceed 45 percent in 2012.
After a tense campaign, President Sall was elected by a large majority and the governing
coalition secured a broad majority at the legislative elections in July 2012. With a strong
popular mandate, the government is now facing the challenge of accelerating reforms and
meeting people’s high expectations.
The authorities are addressing Senegal’s macroeconomic challenges in the context of an
economic program supported by the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI) approved in
December 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/469). The key objectives of the program are:
(i) pursuing a prudent fiscal and debt policy and improving expenditure quality so as to
maintain macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for higher, sustainab;e growth;
(ii) raising revenue to create more fiscal space for priority spending, including additional
infrastructure investment; (iii) further strengthening public financial management and
governance to enhance fiscal transparency, budget planning and execution, improve the
productivity of public expenditure, and reduce budgetary risks; and (iv) stimulating private
sector development through structural reforms, particularly in the energy and financial sectors,
and other reforms related to the business climate.
Executive Board Assessment
They commended Senegal’s satisfactory program implementation despite the challenging
internal and external environments. Although a moderate pickup in growth is expected in the
near term, the economy remains exposed to substantial risks. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ continued commitment to their program to ensure macroeconomic stability,

3
strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks, foster higher and sustainable growth, and
reduce poverty.
Directors noted that, while Senegal still faces a low risk of debt distress, high fiscal deficits and
rising debt ratios need to be addressed. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to keep
the deficit under 6 percent in 2012 and their determination to reduce the deficit further in the
medium term to levels that are consistent with fiscal and debt sustainability. Directors also
highlighted the importance of stronger debt management. They welcomed the recently
finalized medium-term debt strategy, and encouraged the authorities to rely primarily on
concessional financing.
Directors underscored the need to improve public financial management and government
spending efficiency and transparency. They commended ongoing efforts to reduce the cost of
running government, streamline public agencies, and rationalize expenditure in key sectors.
Directors stressed that phasing out the costly and poorly targeted energy price subsidies while
strengthening social safety nets is a priority. Sustained progress in all these areas will be
necessary to meet the country’s fiscal objectives and make room for critical social and
development needs.
Directors noted that the financial sector is generally robust. However, the rising level of NPLs
and concentration of lending need to be closely monitored.
To move Senegal to a path of higher, sustainable, and inclusive growth, Directors stressed the
need to address infrastructure gaps, remove inefficiencies in government operations, and
improve the business climate. They welcomed the tax and customs reforms that are underway
and called for timely implementation of the new energy investments and restructuring of
SENELEC, the national power utility. Directors also encouraged the authorities to deepen and
strengthen the financial system to support their growth strategy.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 10, 2012

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Senegal
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fourth
review of Senegal’s performance under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The program is
on track and all end-June 2012 assessment criteria were met. The Board also concluded the
2012 Article IV consultation with Senegal. A Public Information Notice will be issued in due
course.
The PSI was approved by the Executive Board on December 3, 2010 (see Press Release
No. 10/469). The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may
not need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and
endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven (see Public Information
Notice No. 05/145).
Following the Executive Board’s decision, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“ Senegal’s economic growth has been sluggish in recent years, with implication for poverty
reduction. Despite the still challenging external environment, a moderate growth pick up is
projected in 2012 and 2013, owing to a rebound in agriculture and the completion of a
number of large infrastructure and mining projects. With full implementation of the
authorities’ ambitious reform program, supported under the Fund’s Policy Support
Instrument, growth should gradually return in the medium term to the level recorded before
the global financial crisis. Inflation would remain moderate.
“The authorities’ plan to further reduce the fiscal deficit below 6 percent of GDP in 2012 and
5 percent of GDP in 2013 will help maintain debt sustainability. At the same time, they need
to make space for growth-supporting public investments and other priority spending. To
achieve this objective, they are committed to reducing the cost of running the government,
streamlining public agencies, rationalizing expenditure in key sectors, and phasing out the

2

costly and poorly targeted subsidies while strengthening social safety nets. It will be critical
to sustain these efforts over the medium term to achieve a lasting improvement of public
spending efficiency and reduction of the fiscal deficit.
“The main medium-term challenge for Senegal is to move to higher, sustainable, and
inclusive growth. The authorities’ new development strategy and its focus on inclusiveness
are therefore welcome. The government has an important role to play in raising the growth
potential, for instance through the provision of critical infrastructure and reforms to improve
the business environment. Accelerating the implementation of the new energy investments
and the restructuring of SENELEC, the national power utility, is a priority in the short term,”
Mr. Zhu added.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for
Senegal
December 10, 2012
1.
My Senegalese authorities are appreciative of the close collaboration between
Senegal and the Fund. They consider the recent Management visit in Dakar as a testimony of
this productive working relationship and they highly value the fruitful policy dialogue they
had with Management on that occasion.
2.
The authorities also attach high importance to the policy advice provided by staff
during the 2012 Article IV consultation; key among which is the need to ensure stricter
control over the fiscal deficits in the near term and foster stronger and more inclusive growth
over the medium term. Consistent with this advice, a strong focus is already being placed by
the authorities on lower deficits and stronger growth, as reflected in the 2013 budget which
was approved by the parliament and the recently-validated National Strategy for Economic
and Social Development spanning the period 2013–17. Moreover, the main recommendations
set forth in the comprehensive set of informative staff papers—for which we are thankful—
are generally in line with the authorities’ policy and reform agenda and key commitments
under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). These include the need to preserve fiscal
sustainability, further improve public financial and debt management, fiscal transparency and
governance, and promote further financial deepening.
Preserving fiscal sustainability
3.
The authorities put a high premium on maintaining fiscal deficits at levels that are
consistent with fiscal and debt sustainability. Reflecting this policy stance, the government
took several actions in recent months, including the streamlining of public agencies, the
downsizing of the Cabinet, the elimination of some high-level political positions and
institutions, and measures aimed at generating efficiency gains and savings in government
spending. As a result of these consolidation efforts and the delayed execution of some energy
projects, the deficit for 2012 is expected to be contained below 6 percent of GDP—well
below the original program target.
4.
Going forward, the authorities have restated their commitment to further reduce the
deficit. For 2013 in particular, the approved budget is in line with the authorities’ fiscal
objective of bringing the deficit below 5 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, the
downward trend in fiscal deficit is expected to continue. Achievement of fiscal targets will be
facilitated by the implementation of the new tax code which is scheduled to begin early next
year. Subsequently, the new customs code which is expected to be finalized and submitted to
the parliament during the first half of 2013 will add a significant contribution once it takes
effect. Along with these decisive steps, the continuation of ongoing efforts to modernize tax
administration will enable timely progress toward fiscal objectives.
5.
Concomitant to their work on boosting revenue, the authorities will continue to
strengthen their efforts to contain public spending. A key element of their plans to keep

2
expenditure under control will consist in capping electricity consumption subsidies to CFAF
80 billion in 2013. In order to generate the potentially large savings required by the
introduction of this cap, all possible options are under consideration. These include, among
others, taking cost-cutting initiatives for the electricity company SENELEC and making
electricity tariff adjustments while sparing vulnerable households.
Further Improving Public Financial and Debt Management, Fiscal Transparency and
Governance
6.
The authorities are mindful of the importance of making inroads in further
strengthening public financial management and fiscal transparency and governance. In this
regard steps were recently taken, that include the signing of the decree on the transposition of
the WAEMU’s directive on budget classification and the submission to parliament of a draft
law on fiscal transparency. Moreover, opportunities for further improvements in governance
will be provided by ongoing comprehensive audits of the civil service and agencies and
efforts to establish the single treasury account. Similarly, public governance will benefit from
the work underway to ensure greater transparency in land transactions involving the State,
notably through the publication of these transactions.
7.
The authorities value their fruitful collaboration with staff in the process of assessing
the implications of higher debt-financed public investment for growth and debt sustainability
yin Senegal. The results of this exercise generally confirm the view that increased public
investment typically fosters growth in the country but it may undermine debt sustainability if
exclusively financed by nonconcessional resources. Beyond the high sensitivity of the latter
result to the model assumption of exclusive reliance on nonconcessional external borrowing
to finance investment scaling-up, it is noteworthy that the baseline scenario, which reflects
more realistically the composition of financing in Senegal, implies a more positive debt
outlook over the long run.
8.
Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate that my Senegalese authorities take long-term
fiscal and debt sustainability very seriously. Their unfailing determination to preserve it will
be served by the renewed emphasis they have put on improving public debt management.
Indeed, implementation of their recently-finalized medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) will
not only help improve the debt outlook, but also contribute to improved prospects for deficit
reduction. This positive outcome will also be helped by the increased reliance on longer
maturity bond issuance, and preferential recourse to concessional financing, as recommended
by the MTDS. Moreover, the project evaluation guide which is being finalized will help
conduct systematically cost-benefit analyses for large investment projects, thereby ensuring
that only those with adequate rates of return are retained.
Promoting Further Financial Development in a Stable Macro-financial Environment
9.
Financial sector soundness indicators remain strong in Senegal. The latest stress-test
exercises conducted by the authorities and staff have reconfirmed that the banking system
remains sound with adequate levels of liquidity, profitability, and capitalization although a

3
few banks may need to improve their asset quality and credit continues to be highly
concentrated.
10.
The in-depth focus of Article IV consultation on the financial sector was a welcome
opportunity for the staff to explore avenues for further enhancing financial stability and
overcoming impediments to further financial development. We thus view the paper on
financial depth and macro-stability in Senegal as an appropriate follow-up of the Executive
Board’s recent call for better integrating the interaction between financial deepening and
macro-financial stability into financial sector surveillance in low-income countries. The
paper provides evidence about the limited systemic risk facing Senegal’s financial sector. It
also reveals a number of areas in which the country outperforms or underperforms selected
peer countries in terms of financial sector depth and breadth and access to banking services.
11.
However, the staff paper identifies some impediments to further financial
development and maintain financial stability and formulates a number of useful
recommendations to overcome them. The recommendations include in particular, the need to
strengthen micro-prudential regulation, enhance banking supervision, and develop the
interbank market. On issues related to financial sector development and stability, it is worth
noting that a number of responsibilities fall outside the purview of the country authorities and
belong to regional authorities, as Senegal belongs to a monetary union with a common
regional central bank, as explained by staff. Still, the competent country and regional
authorities have endeavored to establish a continuous dialogue with a view to addressing
such issues. In other areas under their sole responsibility, the Senegalese authorities are
determined to pursue their reform efforts, notably by improving the business and judicial
environment, and strengthen the tax regime. In this endeavor, they will be guided by the
action plan they have previously developed on the basis of previous consultations with
domestic and external stakeholders.
12.
In conclusion, the PSI program is on track and performance under the program
continues to be strong. On the quantitative front, all end-June 2012 assessment criteria and
indicative targets were met, reflecting notably the authorities’ efforts to keep the deficit under
control and further strengthen public finance and debt management. At the same time,
implementation of the structural reform agenda proceeded satisfactorily. More specifically,
steps were taken in line with program commitments to finalize an operational and financial
restructuring plan for SENELEC, a medium-term debt management strategy, a draft law on
fiscal transparency, an action plan for the reduction of electricity consumption subsidies, and
a new tax code.
13.
In light of Senegal’s satisfactory program performance and continued commitment to
the program objectives, I would appreciate Directors’ support for the completion of the
fourth PSI review and the authorities’ request for modification of the assessment criterion on
the fiscal deficit.
