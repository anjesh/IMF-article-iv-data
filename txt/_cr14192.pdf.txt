STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 20, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Spain has turned the corner. Growth has resumed, labor market trends are
improving, the current account is in surplus, banks are healthier, and sovereign yields
are at record lows. But unemployment is unacceptably high, incomes have fallen,
trend productivity growth is low, and the deleveraging of high debt burdens—public
and private—is weighing on growth.
Policies. Spain’s overarching policy priority must be to ensure the recovery is strong,
long-lasting, and most pressingly, job-rich. This requires:


Reducing the drag on domestic demand from private sector deleveraging with a
more comprehensive, coordinated, approach to corporate debt restructuring, and
by introducing a personal insolvency framework.



Bolstering banks’ ability to support the recovery by continuing to raise capital
levels over time, including by limiting cash dividends and bonuses.



Creating jobs for the low skilled by sharply cutting the fiscal cost of employing
them, compensated by higher indirect revenues.



Making the labor market more inclusive and responsive to economic conditions
by striking a better balance between highly-protected/permanent and
precarious/temporary contracts, and further helping firms adapt working
conditions (wages, hours) to their specific circumstances.



Helping the unemployed improve their skills and enhancing the support they
receive to find a job.



Removing regulatory barriers that prevent firms from growing, hiring, and
becoming more productive, especially at the regional level.



Gradually, but steadily, reducing the fiscal deficit to keep debt on a sustainable
path, and making the tax system more growth and job friendly.



Policies by Spain’s European partners, in particular, sufficient monetary easing by
the ECB to achieve its inflation targets.

CONTEXT: EMERGING FROM THE CRISIS
Spain is emerging from a deep double-dip recession…
1.
After nine quarters of negative growth and a sharp increase in unemployment, growth
returned in the second half of 2013 (Figure 1).


Exports are performing well. Exporters are gaining market share and the current account is in
surplus for the first time since 1986. Tourism is booming and competitiveness indicators are up.



Financial conditions have improved sharply. Sovereign yields are at record lows and the stock
market is up sharply, fuelled by growing international investor confidence in Spanish assets.
Banks have halved their reliance on ECB funding as their borrowing costs fell.



Domestic demand is rebounding. Business investment is picking up strongly, supported by
foreign demand and higher business confidence. Private consumption has also started to
recover due to improved employment prospects, rising confidence, and pent-up demand for
consumer durables.



The labor market is turning around. Unemployment and employment are both improving,
despite the as-yet modest recovery in growth.



Fiscal consolidation continues. The structural primary balance strengthened by 1½ percent of
GDP in 2013, despite output falling, and the overall balance came in broadly on target.

…supported by strong reforms…


By Spain: As described in Figure 2, fiscal reforms continued (e.g. enhancing the sustainability of
the pension system and establishing the fiscal council), and the financial sector reform program
was successfully completed. Reforms of product and service markets, as well as active
employment policies, are progressing and the insolvency framework has been improved.



And by Europe: Policies have been supportive, including, monetary easing, progress on banking
union, and flexibility on fiscal targets.

…but the legacy of the boom/bust cycle persists
2.
Unemployment, at 26 percent and little changed from last year’s consultation, remains
the most pernicious legacy of the crisis (Figure 3). The majority of the unemployed have been
without a job for at least a year—about 3½ million people (15 percent of the labor force). And with
unemployment particularly high among the young (55 percent) and low skilled, there is a high risk
of permanent skill destruction. The labor market also remains highly fragmented with a large share
of workers dependent on temporary and involuntarily part-time jobs. The labor force is declining
sharply (partly via net emigration).
3.
Livings standards have fallen
significantly since the start of the crisis.
Reflecting the large increase in unemployment,
median income has fallen, and income
inequality and the risk of poverty and social
exclusion have increased. The approximately
four million who became unemployed since
2007 suffered large falls in income (about half
on average), whereas the median income of
those employed increased in nominal terms.
GDP per capita has also fallen below the
European average.
4.

And the economy is heavily indebted.



Public debt is high and rising. Despite important progress, at 6½ percent of GDP in 2013, the
fiscal deficit was among the largest in the Euro area and public debt jumped from 36 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 94 percent of GDP in 2013.



Private debt is even larger, though falling. Corporate debt is well over historical and international
averages. Households’ net wealth has fallen by about 124 percent of GDP (about one fifth) since
end-2007, while debt as share of disposable income remains close to historical highs.



As a result, Spain is heavily indebted to the rest of the world. The net international investment
position (NIIP), one of the most negative in the Euro area, deteriorated further in 2013 (due to
valuation losses) to reach almost 100 percent of GDP (Box 1).

SPAIN

Box 1. The Current Account Has Improved Significantly, but Vulnerabilities Remain High
Spain has managed a remarkable improvement in its
current account. During the last 5 years it improved by
11 percent of GDP, from a deficit of 10 percent in 2007 to
a 1 percent surplus in 2013. Only one other advanced
large non-commodity exporting country has had a similar
current account improvement: South Korea in 1997–98.
Germany had a similar current account improvement
during the early 2000s, but it took 7 years and it
benefitted from a vibrant world economy.
Spain’s current account improvement is particularly
notable given that it was achieved without nominal
depreciation. South Korea’s adjustment was facilitated by
a large nominal exchange rate depreciation, an option
that was not available to Spain. While Spain’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) did depreciate significantly based on
unit labor costs, it largely reflected labor shedding. The
CPI-based REER has not depreciated much.
But important external vulnerabilities remain. With a
still very negative net international investment position
(IIP), the external position appears significantly weaker
than that consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
Achieving both a sufficiently improving net IIP and much
lower unemployment will likely require a substantially
weaker REER and several years of larger current account
surpluses.



Model-based and historical REER analysis suggests the real effective exchange rate is some 5–
15 percent above the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. However,
achieving significantly lower unemployment rates closer to international peers in the medium term may
require an even larger adjustment in the exchange rate.



In a similar vein, staff assesses that the 2013 cyclically-adjusted current account balance was 1–3 percent
of GDP weaker than desirable. Staff projections envisage the current account surplus will rise by close to
this amount over the medium term; such surpluses will need to be maintained until the external position
is stronger.

OUTLOOK: A CONTINUING RECOVERY AMID RISKS
5.
Growth is likely to continue to strengthen, reflecting reforms and the closing of the
large output gap as demand recovers. The outlook has improved significantly compared to last
year’s consultation, mainly due to: (1) much stronger euro area financial market conditions and
confidence; (2) improving labor market trends, helped by the 2012 labor reform (3) firms (driven by
exporters) investing despite the deleveraging and (4) a more gradual projected path of fiscal
consolidation. Higher growth also reflects the closing of the larger output gap (as reflected by the
lack of inflationary pressure). Specifically:


Building on the momentum that started in late 2013, growth is expected to increase to around
1¼ percent in 2014 and progressively further over the medium term. Business investment will
likely play a leading role as firms take advantage of rising exports and large operating margins
to invest and hire. Private consumption is likely to rebound from depressed levels, supported by
the strengthening labor market.



The contribution from net exports will likely be more subdued in the near term due to an
increase in imports (reflecting the stronger domestic demand), keeping the current account
surplus from rising further. But, over time, continued reform efforts should further improve the
contribution from net exports.

6.
However, headwinds will likely impede a repeat of past, stronger, recoveries. Over the
medium term, growth is expected to remain around 1½–2 percent and unemployment to decline
significantly, but to remain above



Household finances remaining constrained by their high debt and low savings rate, as well as by
high unemployment and modest wage growth.



The housing sector being unlikely to contribute much to growth for some time. While the pace
of house price falls has slowed significantly, the stock of vacant new houses is still high and
transactions are few.



The inevitable fiscal consolidation continuing to weigh on growth.

7.
Longer-term potential growth prospects also appear weaker than in the boom years.
Growth during 1995–2007 was sustained by large accumulation of capital (the credit-fuelled housing
boom) and labor (immigration and rising participation rates) hiding a substantial decline in
productivity growth. Demographic trends have now turned negative (emigration and the ageing
population) and capital accumulation will likely be lower (given the large rise during the boom and
falling population). Spain will also need to tackle the negative effects of very high structural
unemployment. In this context, potential growth may only be around 1 percent over the medium
term (see Selected Issues).
8.
With risks broadly balanced, the outlook is heavily dependent on policies. While staff’s
baseline scenario envisages a gradual recovery, this depends on policies. Strong reforms to increase
productivity (TFP) growth, say to levels similar to Ireland or Sweden in 2000–07, could more than
double potential growth. Key risks:


Upside: The nascent recovery could be stronger than expected, reflecting higher consumer and
business confidence, lower savings rates, stronger financial conditions, and a resumption of
credit growth and house price stabilization. The government’s reform efforts could gain more
traction, boosting potential growth and competitiveness. A credible and successful European
asset quality review and stress test (Comprehensive Assessment), coupled with ECB monetary
easing (for example, the recently announced targeted credit easing “TLTROs”), could also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SPAIN

improve confidence in the European banking system, reduce financial fragmentation, and
catalyze credit growth especially for SMEs.


Downside: Protracted private sector deleveraging, very low (or even negative) inflation, and
fiscal adjustment could prove a more substantial drag on growth. Weaker emerging market
growth could dent exports, as would slow growth in Europe. The current account may
deteriorate if import substitution does not pick up. Re-emergence of financial stress in the Euro
area (possibly linked to global tensions around UMP exit) could weaken confidence and
financing conditions, and the Comprehensive Assessment may not restore confidence in the
European banking system. The reform momentum may weaken with the recovery and the onset
of elections in 2015 and regional tensions. Social support for reform could be undermined by
persistently high unemployment.

Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities expect a stronger pick-up in growth in the medium term. The
authorities saw the output gap, contentious by nature, as larger and the benefits of the reforms not
adequately taken into account by staff, leading to higher growth and a faster decline in
unemployment. The authorities broadly agreed with staff on near-term prospects and the balanced
risk assessment, but stressed the commitment to continue the reform process and the strengthening
of the banking system to withstand potential risks. While they agreed on the need to further
strengthen the current account in light of the high negative net IIP, they noted that (1) Spain has
already significantly regained competitiveness based on indicators such as unit labor costs; (2) the
negative net IIP mainly reflects a relatively low volume of claims rather than a high volume of shortterm liabilities to non-residents; and (3) they considered the REER overvaluation range estimated by
staff to be imprecise and not sufficiently taking into account the very large improvement in the
current account, now in surplus.

THE POLICY AGENDA: GROWTH AND JOBS
A. Strategy
10.
Spain’s overarching macro policy
priority is to ensure the recovery is strong
and long-lasting. Critically, the recovery also
has to be inclusive, especially so that the
unemployed benefit from more job
opportunities. This means:


Helping firms expand, hire, and invest.
Firms have been under incessant pressure
to reduce costs, including by cutting jobs.
The necessary process of reducing firms’
debt could help growth and job creation if
more of it were to come from creditors
restructuring the excessive debt of operationally-viable firms. Efforts should also continue to
bolster banks’ ability to support the economy.



Lowering regulatory barriers. Lowering regulatory barriers that constrain Spain’s businesses
would help them become more efficient and increase employment. Together with continued
wage moderation, this would help ensure the recovery translates into more jobs for the
unemployed, greater job security for the employed, and lower costs of living. To ensure that the
low-skilled unemployed are hired, these actions should be accompanied by more ambitious
policies to improve their skills, but also to reduce the high tax cost of employing them.



Pursuing growth- and job-friendly fiscal consolidation. Spain has made strong progress in
cutting its deficit in the last two years in highly challenging conditions. But the deficit is still very
large, and debt is rapidly approaching 100 percent of GDP. Getting debt to trend down is vital to
ensure the recovery is long-lasting and will require further efforts to reduce the deficit. These
efforts need to be gradual and well-designed to minimize the drag on growth and employment.
They also need to be complemented by reforms that boost growth and employment, which will
ease the consolidation process.

More support from Europe. Action to address low inflation and financial fragmentation in the
Euro area would help the recovery in both the Euro area and in Spain.

A comprehensive, multi-year, approach. Implementing these reforms should make the
recovery much stronger and more job-rich. But the gains may not be enough to generate the high
and sustained growth rates that Spain needs to reduce unemployment to international norms and
to catch up with its higher income peers in Europe. This can be done—Sweden in the 1990s,
Australia in the 1980s point the way. But it may require more fundamental and wide-ranging

reforms beyond those laid out in this report, including in areas like education, institutions, barriers
keeping firms small, and a cross-party determination to carry them out over many years. Clear and
ambitious goals (e.g. getting to the Top 10 in the Doing Business Indicators) could help define such
a roadmap and build national consensus for the more difficult reforms.

B. Private Debt—Reducing Debt Overhang
Context
12.
Private sector debt, while falling, remains very high (Figure 4). Firms have been reducing
their debt faster than households, mainly via a sharp fall in net borrowing. This reflected sharply
lower investment and rising profit margins, the latter partly via a reduction in employment. The
decline in debt, investment, and employment has been more acute in those sectors that were more
leveraged before the crisis: the construction/real estate sector and SMEs.
13.
The steadily-rising share of firms under financial distress undermines the strength of
the overall recovery. Some of these firms may not be operationally viable. But others may be viable
and would invest, hire, and grow were it not for their excessive debt burden. By reducing these
firms’ financial stress and allowing them to grow, all parties could gain. The government has recently
introduced measures to facilitate out-of-court debt restructuring for viable firms under financial
stress (see Selected Issues). These include a mediation process for smaller firms and, for larger firms,
legal and regulatory incentives for debt-to-equity swaps. Further, the government recently
announced plans to: (1) strengthen the in-court debt restructuring process along the lines of the
recent enhancements in out-of-court mechanisms (2) foster liquidation as a going concern (i.e.,
transferring the business as a whole) instead of piecemeal liquidation (3) introduce a code of good
practice to facilitate debt restructuring for SMEs and the self-employed and (4) create an interministerial committee to monitor the debt restructuring process.

Staff views
14.
A more comprehensive, pro-active, strategy would help address private, especially
SME, debt overhang. The recent measures go in the right direction, but more measures are likely
necessary to accelerate the corporate restructuring process for viable debtors and assist the
recovery. In court restructuring options are too limited, and processes are too expensive and slow.
Public creditors (tax agency, social security) have little flexibility for out-of-court debt restructuring
and are not brought to the negotiating table with other creditors, which is particularly problematic
for SMEs. A comprehensive and voluntary strategy, catalyzed by the official sector and aligning the
incentives of all stakeholders, could “fast-forward” the restructuring and enhance growth prospects
(for example, Korea in the late 1990s). An oversight body, with both public and private participation,
could usefully oversee, coordinate, and drive the overall process, including by reporting qualitative
and quantitative debt restructuring statistics.
15.
The authorities could usefully evaluate “all the tools of the trade” to support
corporate restructuring. Based on international experience, these include: (1) further increasing the

effectiveness of in court and out of court workouts by providing more tools to public creditors to
fully engage in the process (to maximize tax collection from a forward-looking perspective),
facilitating going concern sales, speeding up procedures, and introducing a personal insolvency
regime to help individual entrepreneurs; (2) for larger firms, issuing centralized guidelines for
voluntary out of court workouts, coupled with independent mediation by a centralized body ; and (3)
for SMEs, developing a menu of standardized voluntary workouts for operationally viable firms,
including harmonized restructuring terms, and indicative targets for financial institutions to
offer/agree to restructurings. In this regard, the recently-announced plans to continue improving the
corporate debt restructuring process are thus highly welcome.

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities were open to further measures to grease the corporate restructuring
machinery. While they viewed recent measures as having addressed the most important issues and
the restructuring process as proceeding at an appropriate pace, they saw merit in the idea of a
coordinating body to oversee the process. The authorities also saw a possible role for a code of
good practices, similar to the one for individuals.
17.
The authorities stressed that recent reforms to the insolvency regime are significant,
and further reforms should be examined with caution. The recent reforms introduced to facilitate
out of court restructuring are promising and time is needed to assess their effectiveness. However,
they are considering further reforms to (1) increase the scope and flexibility of in court restructuring
options; (2) speed up in court procedures; and (3) harmonize out of court mechanisms, including
those for SMEs. The authorities were skeptical about involving public creditors more fully in
restructuring processes (recognizing actions already in force that are poorly known by the public,
and the need to analyze the effective share of public credit in the total debt of these companies) and
were concerned that introducing it at the current juncture could undermine Spain’s strong payment
culture and jeopardize financial stability. In their view, introducing a personal insolvency framework
with a possibility of a fresh start may warrant consideration in the medium term, but should be
carefully studied.

C. Banks—Encouraging Lending
Context
18.
The ESM-supported program was
successfully completed in January 2014 (see
staff’s final monitoring report). The efforts
helped make the system stronger, safer, and
better able to support the recovery.


16

Capital has been bolstered. The Core Tier
1 ratio reached 11.8 percent at end-2013,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

compared with 9.6 percent at the start of the financial sector program, due to injections of public
capital, equity issuance, bail-in, constraints on dividends, and shrinking risk-weighted assets (the
result of deleveraging and the transfer of risky assets out of banks’ balance sheets).


Provisioning has increased. The coverage
ratio (specific reserves to NPLs) rose to
46 percent at end-2013, up from
36 percent at the start of the program.



Funding has become cheaper and more
stable. Deposit and wholesale funding
rates fell substantially during the program.
Deposits volumes also stabilized with fewer
non-resident deposits; reliance on debt
issuance and ECB borrowing fell.



Market confidence has returned. Banks’
equity prices have risen strongly—price to
book ratios are above unity for the system
and above European peers. Bank risk
premia (CDS spreads) are much lower.
Correspondingly, there has been some
upside surprise in the sale prices of some
public stakes in state-intervened
institutions, and banks have been able to
sell some problem loan portfolios to
foreign investors.

But the system still faces important
challenges.


Credit is contracting rapidly. This
outcome reflects a variety of factors,
including weak credit demand, elevated
default risk, and the necessary deleveraging
of an overleveraged private sector. That
said, the pace of credit contraction, with
bank credit to firms declining by about
11 percent in March, is one of the fastest
amongst advanced economies and only
marginally reflects the contraction of the
real estate sector. To the degree that credit
contraction comes at the cost of less
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SPAIN

aggregate demand, the rapid pace of contraction may be faster than optimal, given the wide
output gap and high unemployment.


Lower funding costs for banks have not translated into significantly lower corporate
lending rates. While deposit rates have declined by nearly 160 bps since 2012, and the cost of
market funding has come down, lending rates for firms have only fallen by around 40 bps.



Core profitability remains weak. Revenue in 2013 was supported by gains on financial assets
and liabilities. Net pre-provision income from core banking activities fell compared to 2012,
reflecting lower margins on variable-rate loans and lower loan volumes. Public ownership
remains significant, and the NPL ratio is high at 13½ percent, though it has started falling slightly
in recent months.



Core capital remains below average for
advanced Europe (though leverage
ratios fare better). At end-2013, the
average core Tier 1 ratio for the largest
150 European banks (excluding the
11 Spanish banks) was 14.2 percent of riskweighted assets; whereas for the largest
11 Spanish banks it was 11.9 percent.
However, Spanish banks are less levered.

Staff views
19.
Building on the financial sector reform achievements, policies should focus on
supporting the recovery. While banks should continue their efforts to raise capital ratios over the
medium term, it should be more by increasing nominal capital rather than contracting credit. Actions
that will promote these ends include restraining cash dividends (the recent guidance from the Bank
of Spain is welcome) and bonuses, issuing equity (or similar instruments), and disposing
of/restructuring distressed assets, and continuing to reduce costs and improve efficiency (see
Selected Issues).
20.
Reforms have helped prepare the system for the Comprehensive Assessment. In
particular, the system recently underwent a similar independent asset quality review and stress test,
and subsequent macroeconomic and banking sector developments have been broadly positive. That
said, there are uncertainties―for example, unlike the exercise under the financial sector program, the
Comprehensive Assessment applies haircuts to sovereign bonds and reviews samples of banks’
foreign loan portfolios.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the banking sector’s
achievements and challenges. While they recognized the challenges for banks’ profitability, they

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

expected improvement in margins due to (1) deposits rolling over at lower rates (2) the efforts to
reduce operating costs and (3) lower provisioning needs. The authorities also viewed the system as
well-prepared for the Comprehensive Assessment.

D. Labor Market—Spurring Employment
Context
22.
The labor reform is gaining traction,
helping improve employment dynamics
early in the recovery. The 2012 reform
(together with agreement by social partners on
wages) appears to be moderating wage
increases and creating jobs, suggesting the
reform may have lowered the growth
threshold for generating positive net
employment (previously the economy needed
to grow close to 2 percent). Evidence from
surveys of firms also suggests that firms with
more wage moderation are most likely to
maintain or expand employment.
23.
The government has also taken additional steps to help foster employment. It
introduced a temporary reduction in employer’s social security contributions for new (net) hiring on
permanent contracts in 2014. A reform of active labor market policies was launched in 2013 with
greater focus on results. There is also a new initiative for youth employment to improve
training/subsidies, quality of jobs, and promote entrepreneurship.
24.
But more measures appear necessary to tackle the enormous employment challenge.
The prospects for reducing unemployment over the medium term to levels close to Spain’s
European peers are dim. Structural unemployment is estimated at very high levels by OECD and EC
(above 20 percent). Even the government’s projections envisage unemployment above 19 percent by
2017. This reflects limited progress in addressing some of the structural labor market weaknesses.


Over the six years of the crisis, wages have
been slow to respond, putting the burden of
adjustment on employment. The constraints
at the firm level to adjust labor conditions to
the crisis also contributed to the exceptionally
large job losses and to the closing of firms.
The greater flexibility for firm-level agreements
is beginning to be used, mainly by large firms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SPAIN



The high degree of labor market duality
is part of the problem. As the OECD review
(2013) notes, the Spanish labor market is
segmented between well-protected
“insiders” on permanent contracts and
precarious “outsiders”, who cycle between
temporary jobs and unemployment. This
institutional set up encourages rigidity in
wage demands by insiders, since it places
the burden of adjustment on outsiders (who
have the same wages but lower firing costs).
It also hurts productivity, as there is less
investment in temporary workers and long
spells in unemployment reduce human capital.



The low representativeness of collective
bargaining, together with duality, may
exacerbate unemployment cycles. Labor
unions represent only a fraction of workers
(typically those with most job protection),
but collective agreements cover almost all
workers (due to the automatic legal
extension of agreements to entire sectors).
This may generate an institutional bias
towards protecting the interest of the
“insiders” at a cost to the unemployed and
temporary worker “outsiders”.

Staff views
25.
While much has been done to improve the labor market, more action is needed to
further boost employment and reduce duality. Lowering the fiscal and regulatory cost of
employing people, especially on permanent contracts and the low skilled, would boost employment,
as would allowing firms to better tailor their working conditions to their specific circumstances. This
suggests:


20

Further decentralizing wage setting.To enhance job protection and creation, consideration
could be given to further enhancing the ability of individual firms to adapt working conditions
(especially wages and hours) to their specific conditions. This would better align productivity to
wages, help struggling firms stay in business, and encourage new firms to start up. Options in
this regard include further facilitating opt-outs by firms, similarly to what Germany did in the
1990s. It could also include extending collective agreements only to sectors only where
unions/business associations signing the agreement represent a majority of workers and/or

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

increasing the number of employees for a firm to be automatically covered (e.g. Finland, Italy),
thus assisting SMEs.


Cutting employer social security contributions for the low paid. These taxes are among the
highest in Europe and could be a major constraint on labor demand, especially for the low
skilled. The fiscal cost could be offset by broader tax reform (see Section F).



Reducing duality by making hiring on permanent contracts more attractive. This can be
achieved, for example, by increasing dismissal costs for new permanent contracts gradually with
tenure and from a lower initial level (severance payments for permanent contracts remain above
the OECD average). It would also be less costly to the budget than subsidizing permanent
contracts.



Improving active labor market policies to improve the skills of the unemployed and to help
them find work. To a large extent this means implementing aggressively the new employment
strategy (including for youth unemployment), especially by regions. For example, implementing
plans to more widely use private job placement agencies, improving training services, including
by opening them up to competition, and establishing a single portal for job vacancies
throughout Spain.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities noted the increasing success of the labor reform and argued the focus
should be on implementation, especially of active labor market policies. The 2012 labor reform
has helped achieve wage moderation, greater internal flexibility for firms, and create jobs early in the
recovery. The focus is now on active employment policies, especially implementing the new strategy
based on results and public-private partnerships. The authorities saw some merit in principle with
staff’s proposal to reduce social security contributions for the low skilled, but stressed the similar
benefits from the recent flat rate for permanent contracts that needed to be assessed before
considering changes, and the fiscal cost of staff’s proposal.

E. Improving the Business Environment
Context
27.
Spain will need to significantly raise productivity to sustain high growth. Despite strong
growth performance in the pre-crisis period, this was entirely due to large accumulation of capital
(partly the construction boom) and labor (large-scale immigration and rising participation rates).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SPAIN



Total factor productivity (TFP) growth
has been on a declining trend since the
1990s. Spain and Italy had the worst
productivity performance among OECD
economies in the years preceding the crisis.
While it rebounded somewhat recently, the
improvement partially reflects temporary
factors (e.g. large labor shedding in the
construction sector), and TFP growth
remains low (see Selected Issues).



While reforms have been introduced or
are in the pipeline, actual progress in
improving the business environment has been modest. In part this reflects the complex,
duplicated, and burdensome regulatory framework divided among the different levels of
government. Spain’s ranking on the World Bank’s “Doing Business” indicator has deteriorated
somewhat and it remains far from best performers, especially in areas such as protecting
investors, getting credit, and paying taxes. Spain also ranks low in starting a business and
dealing with construction permits. Indicators of education outcomes also remain less strong
than among many of its European peers.

Staff views
28.
A concerted national effort is needed to continue to press ahead with a reform agenda
to promote a new growth model. Reducing structural unemployment and substantially raising
productivity should be top priorities. Appointing an independent agency on growth and jobs could
help establish priorities and garner public support, as well as monitor progress.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN



Labor market reform should be accompanied by product and service market liberalization
to maximize the gains to growth and jobs. The reforms would improve competition, helping
lower mark-ups and increase the purchasing power of households. Lower entry barriers in
services industries would also enhance productivity and job creation. For example, OECD

analysis suggests that Spain could raise yearly growth by about ½ percentage point were it to
improve its index of product market regulation to that of the best performers.


While there is encouraging progress, especially the important market unity law (Box 2),
there should be no slippage on the planned reforms. For example, it will be important to
move ahead with an ambitious liberalization of professional services, improve training for the
unemployed, and fully implement an energy reform that eliminates the electricity tariff deficit
and contains costs, while promoting a stable business environment and appropriate levels of
investment. Given the many regulations at all levels of governments, regions have a critical role
to play in improving the business environment—the planned introduction of regional World
Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators is a positive initiative.

Authorities’ views
29.
The government is committed to advancing the national reform plan. The authorities
stressed they are making progress on many fronts, but it will take some time to see all the effects,
including on the competitiveness indices. Efforts continue with other levels of government to reduce
regulatory burdens and facilitate internal trade. There is important progress with the market unity
law, which would help create a better business environment and prevent excessive regulations in the
future. The energy reform (electricity, gas) is also well advanced. The World Bank will also monitor
business conditions at regional level, which should spur reforms over time.

Box 2. Reducing Regulatory Barriers to Trade Across Spain: The Market Unity Reform
Spain is undertaking a major reform aimed at reducing barriers to trade across Spain’s different
regions. Firms operating in Spain face at least three different, and sometimes overlapping, layers of
regulations (central, regional, and local). The Market Unity program, approved by the Spanish government in
2012, is intended to reduce the fragmentation of the domestic market by rationalizing the regulatory
framework for economic activities, reinforcing cooperation among administrations, and by encouraging a
new culture based on smart regulation.
The law on the Market Unity is the cornerstone of the program. It defines the principles, operational
framework, appeal process, resolution procedures, and cooperation and supervision networks. Under the
law, an ambitious screening process is being carried at all levels of government—about 2,700 regulatory
barriers have already been identified (mainly at the subnational level) and, as such, are in contradiction to
the new law—the next step is to eliminate them.
The reform introduced a new, expeditious, appeal process for companies. As an alternative to
administrative appeals, firms can enter into an expeditious appeal process when the public action (e.g.
regulations, licensing requirements) is in contradiction to market unity and creates barriers to business or
trade across regions. The appeal process is done through the Secretary of Market Unity—an agency that
assists the Council of Market Unity. While the process is still in its infancy, there have already been already a
few successful cases (e.g. barriers to sell agricultural and pharmaceutical products across different regions).
The success of the reform will require strong commitment, and cooperation, by both central and
subnational governments. Existing regulations need to be swiftly aligned to the new legal framework. New
legislation/regulation will also need to be compliant. Adequate resources need to be available to ensure the
appeal process, a crucial feature of the reform, is effective.

F. Fiscal Policy—Minimizing the Drag on Growth
Context
30.
Fiscal consolidation continued in 2013, but public debt is still rising (Figure 5). Even as
the authorities sought to minimize the negative impulse to demand through a gradual adjustment,
Spain still achieved a remarkable reduction of the fiscal deficit during 2012–13 in the middle of a
recession. But the overall deficit is still very large, and debt, already above the Euro area average, is
rapidly approaching 100 percent of GDP. Putting debt onto a firmly-declining path to reduce
vulnerabilities, consistent with EU rules, requires maintaining a primary surplus of at least 2 percent
of GDP. This entails improving the primary balance by some 6 percent of GDP compared with 2013,
about the same as the improvement since 2009 (though macroeconomic conditions will likely be
much more favorable).
31.
The quality of fiscal consolidation is improving. While fiscal consolidation has at times
relied on across-the-board spending measures, compression of public investment, and ad hoc tax
increases, policy is shifting towards more efficient ways to spend and raise revenues. In particular:


24

A strong pension reform was passed that is designed to ensure the sustainability of the system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN



A public administration reform (CORA) to reduce wasteful spending by eliminating duplication
and overlapping functions within and across different government levels is ongoing.



The recently-created fiscal council (AIReF) should improve the credibility and design of the fiscal
consolidation process, including by monitoring and evaluating policies at all government levels.



The planned tax reform is also an
opportunity for a comprehensive
improvement of the tax system, with
recommendations received from an
independent tax reform committee (see
Appendix). The government has already
indicated that the reform will likely include
(1) unifying the corporate income tax rate
at 25 percent (currently 20/25/30 percent
depending on turnover) and (2) lowering
the number of personal income tax
brackets, increasing the threshold for the
lowest rate and reducing the top rate. The
government has also indicated that
preferential treatments under the VAT
would not be altered.

improvement of 0.6 % of GDP in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.

32.
The government’s strategy envisages reducing the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP
by 2016, mainly by containing spending. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain broadly
constant around 39 percent of GDP in the medium term, with the bulk of the adjustment coming
from a planned substantial decline in public consumption (3 percent of GDP), and public investment
remaining low. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio in 2015–16 is expected to increase, despite envisaged
tax cuts, as tax bases expand. The debt-to-GDP ratio would peak in 2015 and decline thereafter. In
staff’s projections, the debt ratio would stabilize around 2017 and decline thereafter, but debt
dynamics would remain highly vulnerable to slippages in fiscal adjustment, contingent liabilities, and
weaker macroeconomic conditions (see Figure 5 and the DSA appendix).

Staff views
33.
Fiscal consolidation should continue at a gradual, but steady, pace. Spain needs to strike
the right balance between consolidating too fast, which will hurt growth in the short-term, and too
slowly, which could eventually lead to a disorderly and more costly adjustment. A pace of structural
consolidation of about ½-¾ percent a year would strike the right balance.
34.
The government’s medium-term strategy broadly strikes this balance, but could be
more fully fleshed out and may need to be revised if growth disappoints. The 2014 fiscal deficit
target is feasible and any revenue over-performance should be saved. However, the targets for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

SPAIN

CORRECTED: 7/2/14

2015–17 may need to be relaxed if nominal GDP growth disappoints (while maintaining the
underlying improvement), and vice versa if nominal GDP growth exceeds projections. A more
detailed specification of the projected fiscal measures, especially after 2015, and more conservative
assumptions on the impact of tax reform, would add to credibility and reduce uncertainty.
35.
While there is further scope for improving spending efficiency, there is a case for
revenue to play a larger role.


The public administration reform (CORA) is a welcome initiative. It could usefully be
complemented by a public expenditure review (as in the UK and Italy) across all levels of
government of key functions. Improving the targeting of social spending could increase the
protection of the most vulnerable and generate efficiency savings.



Given the size of the adjustment still
required, Spain’s relatively low revenue
ratio compared to its Euro area peers, and
the possibly increasingly limited scope for
high-quality spending reductions, there is
a case for relying more on revenue to
achieve the consolidation goals.

36.

The forthcoming tax reform is thus
a critical opportunity to support the
fiscal consolidation goals with a more
growth and job friendly tax system. The
main elements should include:



Enhancing the overall revenue ratio by
relying more on indirect taxes. Raising
excise duties and environmental levies,
and gradually reducing preferential
treatments in the VAT, would bring Spain’s
collection effort more into line with its
European peers. It will be critical to
explicitly protect the most vulnerable by
increasing the support for them via the
transfer and tax system―possible options
could include income tax credits for the
low paid and enhancing regional
minimum income programs.



Sharply cutting taxes on employing the low paid. The overriding need to generate jobs,
especially for those with the lowest skills, argues for sharply and permanently cutting social

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

security contributions paid by employers on the low paid. International experience indicates that
such measures are more likely to deliver a strong and durable impact on employment than
those of a more temporary and less well-targeted nature (see Selected Issues). To protect the
social security system, reductions in social security contributions should be in the form of tax
credits financed by transfers from the budget.


Broadening the base of direct taxes by cutting exemptions and special treatments. To
promote growth, encourage firms to become larger, and to avoid losing competitiveness, the
base of corporate taxes should be broadened. This would give scope to reduce the top rate to
25 percent as planned, while still maintaining the effective rate (and thus revenue). The scope to
significantly cut top personal income tax rates is limited, given the need to protect revenue and
progressivity. Revenue and progressivity could also be enhanced by other measures, such as
lowering the threshold for the top personal income tax rate and more fully using recurrent
property and inheritance taxes, and reducing tax fraud.

Authorities’ views
37.
While agreeing the fiscal targets over the next years are ambitious, the authorities are
confident that they will be met, notably in the context of the envisaged strong recovery. The
authorities underscored that the fiscal effort in recent years was among the highest in advanced
economies, showing the deep commitment to preserve the sustainability of public finances. They
also highlighted evidence on the high procyclicality of tax revenue bases, which explains why tax
revenue-to-GDP ratios and the cyclical balance are likely to increase more in a context of a sustained
recovery based on domestic demand.
38.
The authorities concurred that a growth and job friendly fiscal consolidation would
need to rely both on revenues and high quality spending. They saw more scope for additional
spending savings, for instance, through the implementation of measures aimed at streamlining
public administration at different government levels. The authorities saw scope for broadening the
bases of income taxes, reducing tax evasion, and stressed the importance of ensuring income taxes
incentivized economic activity. While agreeing in principle that there may be scope for increasing
reliance on indirect taxes in the medium term, they did not see merit in increasing preferential VAT
rates, especially as it could stifle the recovery. The authorities expect that the public debt-to-GDP
ratio will start declining after 2015.

G. Europe—Easing and Transmitting ECB policy
Context
39.
Decisive action by Spain’s European
partners has supported Spain’s recovery. In
particular, the ECB’s LTROs and the OMTs have
greatly contributed to the critically-important
improvement in sovereign yields. Important
progress has also been made in enhancing the
banking union. However, Euro area inflation
remains very low and could remain well below
target for a protracted period. While the ECB
has lowered its policy rate since 2011, it has
not transmitted into lower lending rates for
Spanish SMEs (which account for almost two
thirds of total employment). On June 5, the
ECB announced a further wide range of actions, including (1) lower policy rates; (2) targeted credit
easing (TLTROs); and (3) extension of fixed rate full allotment.

Staff views
40.
As described in Box 3, Euro Area policies could help the recovery in Spain. In particular,
it could do so by lowering the borrowing costs of Spanish firms and households, reducing the risk of
protracted very low, even negative, inflation, and by increasing demand across the Euro area and
hence for Spanish exports. Staff has been recommending more monetary easing by the ECB to
achieve the ECB’s price stability objective, and support Euro area demand while reducing financial
fragmentation. Financial fragmentation would also be reduced by completing the banking union,
including a common fiscal backstop, and a sound and credible Comprehensive Assessment. Recent
ECB actions should help address insufficient demand (as evidenced by low inflation) and financial
fragmentation in Spain, in particular, by providing term funding for bank credit to SMEs. But if Euro
area inflation remains too low, the ECB should consider a more substantial balance sheet expansion,
including through asset purchases.

Authorities’ views
41.
While much has been achieved, the authorities agreed that further European actions
are warranted. They noted that the monetary transmission mechanism remains impaired, and that
financial fragmentation is a key driver for higher Spanish borrowing rates for SMEs (compared with
European peer countries). They agreed that the recent actions by the ECB towards achieving its
inflation target and repairing the transmission mechanism are warranted, and would also help
Europe’s recovery. They also considered that a weaker Euro and stronger domestic demand by other
Euro area countries would contribute towards rebalancing within the Euro area. The authorities
emphasized their support for the recent banking union agreement.

Box 3. How Policies in the Euro Area Could Help Spain’s Ongoing Adjustment
Supportive monetary policy to achieve inflation targets
Inflation rates consistent with the ECB target would further support Spain’s recovery. Higher Euro area
inflation would allow Spain either to (1) achieve greater competitiveness gains for a given level of Spanish
inflation or (2) allow Spain to gain the same amount of competitiveness, but with a higher level of Spanish
inflation, which would help Spain’s recovery through three
main channels:


Lowering real labor costs would become easier given
nominal wage rigidity, supporting employment
growth



Lowering the real burden of Spain’s high private debt
and lending rates



Easing fiscal consolidation efforts—higher inflation
increases the real gain from nominal primary
expenditure restraint, lowers the real cost of interest
payments, and lowers the debt ratio.

Reducing fragmentation to improve monetary policy transmission
The ECB’s policy rate, which is already too tight for Spain, is not being fully transmitted into lower lending
rates for Spanish firms, especially SMEs. While this reflects domestic factors, it also likely reflects the
fragmentation of the European banking system. For example, European banks reduced their exposure to
Spain by about half since 2007. Staff estimates suggest that substantially reducing the spread compared to
Germany of the Spanish sovereign and banks could narrow, by up to 40 percent, the gap between Spanish
and German short-term interest rates on lending to small firms.

H. Some Questions and Answers on Staff Analysis
The question and answer format of this section is intended to probe further into the reasoning behind
staff recommendations.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

42.
Question: On the call for wage
moderation, won’t lower wages exacerbate
aggregate demand weakness and lead to
higher profits and not more jobs? Lower
wages would mean less income for
households and thus less spending, which in
turn would weaken the recovery and make
unemployment worse. Wages have already
fallen in real terms and competitiveness has
been sufficiently regained, as the current
account surplus demonstrates. In any case,
lower wages would just result in even higher
profit margins for firms and not more jobs.
43.
Answer: Staff’s advice should be seen
in the context of a package of measures to
address the job crisis. The reality is that real
wages are still above 2007 levels, despite the
unprecedented loss of jobs. This is a key
reason why staff suggests, among other
measures, continued wage moderation. By
that we do not mean economy-wide nominal
wage cuts, but nominal wage increases that
gradually reduce the real cost of employing
people until unemployment is at a more
acceptable level. This would likely lead to
more unemployed being hired and greater job
security for those in work, both of which would lead to more private consumption. Businesses would
also be more likely to invest and net exports would boost demand. Excessive profit margins in some
protected nontradeable sectors argues for increasing efforts to open them up to competition—as
staff also argue in the report.
44.
Question: Is staff underestimating the role of demand side policies by underestimating
the output gap? Output is still much lower than before the crisis, there is no inflationary pressure,
and unemployment is very high. Showing only a small gap argues for less supportive fiscal and
monetary policies, which would make matters worse.
45.
Answer: It is certainly possible that the output gap is being underestimated. Estimates of the
output gap are especially uncertain in the current context. During the Article IV consultations, staff
increased its estimate of the negative output gap relative to the April WEO reflecting historical
revisions to the employment data and a range of model estimates (including models that take into
account the role of credit cycles, which have a high correlation with unemployment cycles in Spain).
Two further observations:
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

SPAIN



Even if one were to assume a higher output gap, it does not follow that unemployment will fall
much further in the next five years. The reality is that unemployment in Spain has a large
structural component that, in the absence of stronger structural reforms, is expected to persist
for a very long time. Indeed, even the authorities’ projections, which assume a much higher
output gap, still has unemployment around 20 percent by 2017.



Assuming a larger output gap (and

quickly) could also give rise to

misleading policy implications. It

potentially leading to delays on
needed adjustments and constraining long-term growth potential. It would also cast doubt on
how sustainable the turnaround in the current account really is—a large output gap would
suggest the improvement is more cyclical and that external vulnerabilities are higher.

46.
Question: With regard to the insolvency framework, wouldn’t the introduction of a
“fresh start” undermine Spain’s strong payment culture? This could lead to losses for banks and
thus make future credit more expensive. Spain’s particular circumstances, especially the widespread
use of mortgages, argue for caution.
47.
Answer: Many EU countries have
introduced a fresh start without undermining
payment culture, increasing the cost of credit,
or jeopardizing financial stability (e.g.
Germany). The proposed fresh start would
only benefit debtors after a period of good
faith (and monitored) efforts whereby they
repay as much as they reasonably can from
their income after having given up their nonexempt assets (e.g., their house). The number
of years after which the fresh start would be
granted could be initially set at the point
where expected payments (net of collection
costs) are nil for creditors, hence allowing for a win-win situation whereby both the debtor and
creditor benefit. In Germany, for example, the fresh start was initially granted after 7 years. A fresh
start would be in the interest of society as a whole because it would encourage: (1) entrepreneurship
(who would be more willing to start businesses as they know they can try again even after a failure);
(2) preservation of human capital (the productive capacity of insolvent individuals is maintained);
and (3) participation in the formal economy (insolvent debtors will have less incentive to hide their

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

income from perpetual capture by creditors). And while the high reliance on mortgages argues for
caution, it also argues for action to ensure the bankruptcy regime is sound.
48.
Question: On the outlook, why isn’t there more focus on deflation risks in Spain?
Inflation has been very close to zero, even negative in some months, and prices are already falling
for a third of the items in the CPI basket.
49.
Answer: This needs to be seen in the
Euro area context. Spain needs lower inflation
than its Euro area partners to gain
competitiveness. Thus low, or even slightly
negative, inflation in Spain is welcome (see Box
3). But a protracted period of very low or
negative inflation in the Euro area would
eliminate the gains from Spanish disinflation.
This, or another exogenous shock (eg if import
prices continue to fall), could push Spanish
inflation into significant, and possibly selfreinforcing, persistent deflation—which would
be especially detrimental for Spain given high
levels of public, corporate, and household
indebtedness. That said, there are currently
some factors that should limit this risk:


There has been only one month of
negative core inflation since mid-2010. Part
of the observed fall in CPI inflation reflects
the effect of declining import prices, which
should reverse.



The share of the CPI basket with negative
inflation has declined recently.



Private consumption is rebounding (after a large fall) and wage growth trends remain positive
(although low), which should prevent a sustained fall in prices.



The ECB is acting to address the risk of persistent undershooting of region-wide inflation.

50.
Question: On tax reform, won’t raising VAT on items like food, restaurants, and
hotels hurt the poor and tourism, which is a major source of growth and jobs?
51.
Answer: Those who would pay the most from gradually reducing preferential VAT rates are
those who consume the most of those items, in particular, higher-income households and foreign
tourists. However, raising VAT on food would, by itself, indeed affect the poor and most vulnerable
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

SPAIN

in society. And that is why it is critical that they be compensated to ensure they are at least as well
off as before. This could be done, for example, by increasing the social transfers or tax credits they
receive, financed by the some of the extra VAT revenue paid by better off consumers. Raising VAT
on restaurants and hotels would affect the tourism industry. But the sector would benefit from lower
wage costs if social security contributions are cut for the low paid, financed by the higher VAT
revenue. Like for the impact on the poor, the advice should be seen in combination with other
measures, not in isolation.

Spain has turned the corner. The recovery is clearly underway and, critically, labor market
trends are improving. Growth is expected to continue to strengthen over the medium term. This
recovery reflects the collective efforts of Spanish society. In particular, decisive policy actions on
many fronts (e.g. fiscal, banks, labor market), together with support from Europe, are now beginning
to bear fruit.
53.
But the economy and living standards are still suffering from the legacy of the crisis.
Most importantly, 5.9 million people are unemployed, more than half of them for more than a year.
As a result, average household income remains below pre-crisis levels. Households, firms, and the
government still face heavy debt burdens.
54.
Thus all these efforts need to continue to ensure the recovery is strong and longlasting. Most importantly, the recovery also has to be inclusive so that the unemployed benefit from
more job opportunities. Strong, long-lasting, and job-rich, growth will also ease the process of
reducing high private and public debt burdens.
55.
Reducing financial stress of operationally-viable firms would help them expand, invest
and hire. A comprehensive, coordinated, strategy could help “fast-forward” this process. Given the
broader public interest in unleashing the growth potential in such firms, the government should also

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

participate. This process would also be helped by a personal insolvency framework that allows an
eventual fresh start while preserving the payment culture.
56.
Efforts should continue to bolster banks’ ability to support the economy. While the
banking system is now much stronger and safer and lending conditions are starting to ease, credit is
still contracting faster than desirable. Thus banks should continue to raise capital levels over time,
including by limiting cash dividends and bonuses, and reducing costs.
57.
Lowering regulatory barriers would help businesses become more efficient and
increase employment. This requires many specific actions across a wide range of fronts. In
particular, by implementing the Market Unity law and opening up professional services.
58.
Further efforts would make Spain’s labor market more inclusive and responsive to
economic conditions. More needs to be done to help the unemployed improve their skills and find
work. Striking a better balance between highly-protected permanent contracts and precarious
temporary contracts would increase hiring on permanent contracts. Further enhancing the ability of
individual firms to adapt remuneration to their specific conditions would better align productivity to
wages and help struggling firms stay in business. These changes would help ensure any future
downturns result in fewer job losses.
59.
Getting debt to trend down is vital to ensure the recovery is long-lasting and will
require further efforts to reduce the deficit. In particular, the forthcoming tax reform is a critical
opportunity to protect public services by raising revenues, create jobs for the low skilled by cutting
the social security contributions firms pay when employing them, and promote inclusive growth by
broadening the base of income taxes while preserving progressivity.
60.
These policy efforts would also reduce Spain’s important external vulnerabilities. In
particular, enhancing productivity and firms’ ability to contain costs would increase Spain’s
competitiveness. Coupled with continued fiscal consolidation, this would help ensure the current
account surplus continues to strengthen and is maintained for many years, as is needed to bring
Spain’s highly negative international investment position to safer levels.
61.
Stronger policies by Spain’s European partners would help the recovery in both the
Euro area and Spain. It would do so by lowering the borrowing costs of Spanish firms and
households, reducing the risk of protracted very low, even negative, Euro area inflation, and
increasing demand across the Euro area.
62.

It is proposed that Spain remain on the regular 12-month Article IV cycle.

Appendix I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain significant although mitigated by strong policy
commitment and favorable market sentiment. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is
projected to peak at 102 percent of GDP before declining to 100 percent in 2019 as the fiscal
imbalances are reduced and economic recovery gains traction. Gross financing needs are
expected to remain around 17 percent of GDP during the medium term which is above early
warning benchmarks. Debt dynamics is highly vulnerable to fiscal adjustment, growth, and
contingent liabilities shocks.
Background


Public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt in hands of the General
Government.



The General Government includes the Central Government, Regional Governments, Local
Government, and Social Security Funds. It does not include public enterprises.



EDP debt is a subset of General Government consolidated debt (i.e., it does not include
trade credits and other accounts payable) and the stocks are recorded at their nominal
value.



The public debt-to-GPP ratio increased from 36 percent of GDP in 2007 to 94 percent in
2013, driven by large fiscal deficits.



The composition of public debt is tilted towards long-term debt (89 percent of the total),
similar to the pre-crisis ratio. The fraction of public debt in hands of domestic residents
increased from 52 percent in 2007 to 64 in 2013.

Baseline


Debt is projected to continue increasing and peak at 102 percent of GDP in 2017, before
declining to 100 percent by 2019.



The main assumptions underlying the baseline are: i) a gradual and steady fiscal
consolidation until the fiscal deficit is below 3 percent of GDP; and ii) gradual
acceleration in real GDP growth over the medium term.



Assuming a gradual and steady fiscal consolidation could be seen as optimistic given the
historical track record of primary balance forecasts. However, staff believes that this is the
most likely scenario for the following reasons: i) the authorities have shown strong
commitment to fiscal consolidation by substantially reducing the primary deficit during
2012–13, in the middle of a recession; ii) the Stability Program Update 2014–17 envisages
such a fiscal consolidation plan; iii) the Spanish Constitution was amended in 2011 to

include the limits to fiscal deficits and public debt set in the Stability and Growth Pact; iv)
the fiscal framework was strengthened further with the new Budget Stability Law
approved in 2012, including new tools to enforce fiscal discipline and an explicit target of
structural fiscal balance by 2020; v) fiscal transparency was significantly enhanced with
monthly reporting of fiscal outturns for the General Government except Local
Governments; vi) there is broad consensus on the need to reduce fiscal imbalances and
contain fiscal vulnerabilities.


Growth outcomes in Spain have tended to be worse than projected during the financial
crisis. However, the current near-term growth projections are somewhat below consensus
and staff believes that risks are broadly balanced.

Stress tests


Primary balance shock. The primary balance in 2015–16 is hit by a shock equal to
2.7 percent of GDP (50 percent of the 10-year historical standard deviation of the primary
balance-to-GDP ratio). This shock results in a debt-to-GDP ratio about 6 percentage
points higher than the baseline by 2019.



Growth shock. Real GDP growth rates are 1.3 percent lower in 2015–16. The debt-toGDP ratio reaches 111 percent by 2019 (11 percentage points higher than the baseline).



Interest rate shock. Nominal interest rates increase by 200 basis points during 2015–19.
The effective interest rate increases to 4.5 percent by 2019 compared to 3.7 percent in
the baseline. The debt-to-GDP ratio stays reaches 102 percent in 2019 (2 percentage
points higher than the baseline).



Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would result
in an increasing debt-to-GDP ratio that reaches 115 percent in 2019 (15 percentage
points higher than the baseline).



Contingent liability shock. A one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent
in 2015 to 10% of GDP (e.g., via private debt migrating to public debt) combined with
lower growth and lower inflation in 2015–16 (i.e., growth is reduced by 1 standard
deviation) results in an increasing debt-to-GDP ratio that reaches 119 percent in 2019
(19 percentage points higher than the baseline).

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP

Appendix II. Key Recommendations—Independent Tax Reform Committee1
Strategy: broaden bases, shift from taxing labor to consumption, revenue neutrality


Revenue-neutral shift from direct taxes (PIT, CIT, and wealth taxes, social contributions) to indirect
taxes (VAT, excise duties and environmental levies) to support growth and efficiency



Additional cut in employer’s social security contribution for the low-paid (fiscal devaluation), with
timing left open



Broaden the tax base by eliminating non-justified tax exemptions, allowances, and reducing
statutory rates to simplify the tax system and improve its fairness



Achieve greater neutrality, in particular by removing “debt bias”



Reduce tax fraud

Personal Income Taxes (PIT): Reduce progressivity, equalize tax treatment of assets
 Reduce number of brackets to four, cap top rate at 50 percent, and reduce bottom and top rates


Harmonize tax treatment of capital income with respect to maturity, inflation-adjustment, gainloss symmetry



Tax property income under savings base not subject to progressive rates, as done with movable
capital



Modify the property income tax base to include inputted rent and, retroactively, mortgage interest
payments



Eliminate a number of partial exemptions, including on dividends and profit-sharing, employers’
fringe benefits

Corporate Income Taxes (CIT): bring legal and effective rates closer, remove debt bias
 Cut the top corporate income tax rate first to 25 percent, then to 20 percent; broaden the base
and unify the rates


Reduce the debt bias by replacing current earning stripping rule with a standard thin
capitalization rule



Introduce a 10 percent levy on the (currently exempt) foreign sourced income of Spanish
multinationals



Remove tax credits on R&D, re-investment earnings, job creation for specific groups,
environmental investments

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

Social Security Contributions: modernize then cut
 Transform social security contributions into a payroll tax (harmonize labor income base under
PIT)…


…merge social security administration into general tax administration…



only then reduce employer social security contributions



Restrict rebates (wage subsidies) to vulnerable groups not reachable by active labor market
policies

Property and wealth Taxes: simplify and streamline
 Eliminate wealth, transfer and stamp taxes


Reduce exemptions under the inheritance and gift tax

Value-Added Taxes (VAT): mobilize revenues by broadening base of standard rate
 Increase reduced rates to standard for all items except housing, transportation, and tourism


Increase tourism rates subject to fiscal devaluation; increase super-reduced rates subject to
compensation for the poor.



Remove exemptions (e.g. postal services) not dependent on EC regulations.

Excise and Environmental Taxes: align with EU practices and directives
 Increase excises in alcohol and tobacco to EU averages


Split tax on hydrocarbons into taxes on energy and carbon emissions; increase rate on diesel
towards gasoline first



Switch electricity tax from ad-valorem to specific (kilowatt-hours)



Eliminate environmental taxes imposed by regions

Tax Decentralization: harmonize and devolve
 Empower the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council to set common nationwide limits on devolved
taxes.

Allow regions to establish co-payment schemes for public services under their remit.
Tax Fraud: reduce scope for abuse


Eliminate (simplified and beneficial) regimes (e.g. under VAT, PIT) for small taxpayers

as limited progress on monetary easing
could be the trigger
The AQR/ stress test does not restore
confidence in the European banking system



ECB policy actions could help reduce
financial market volatility



Increase reforms that support investor
confidence (e.g. credible medium-term

council

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks
listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent,
and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Ranjit Teja and Mark Flanagan

This supplement updates the staff report and the staff appraisal.

Context
1.
On June 20, the government announced a tax reform proposal. The
proposal aims to boost growth and employment mainly through reductions in personal
and corporate income tax rates. After a public consultation, a revised draft will be
submitted to the Council of Ministers by mid-July. A draft law needs to be submitted
and approved by Parliament by end-November to be effective for 2015. A full
quantification of the proposal is not yet available but, according to the authorities, the
fiscal cost through 2016 is 0.9 percent of GDP (0.6 percent of GDP after factoring in
significant second-round effects). Key measures:
Personal Income Taxes (PIT)


Phased reductions in all marginal tax rates. Number of brackets reduced.



Preferential tax treatment for SMEs strengthened: 10 percent reduction of their tax base up to
€1 million (in addition to other benefits under the existing special SME regime)

Other


Increase VAT rates for certain healthcare products in line with EU law



Restrict eligibility to participate in the presumptive method of estimating income to activities
with turnover and expenditure less than €150,000 (from €450,000/300,000, respectively)

Staff Appraisal
2.
While a full assessment will require further details and analysis, the thrust of the
proposal is generally more growth-friendly. Such measures include the lowering of PIT and CIT
rates, combined with some broadening of their bases. The cuts in the top rates of CIT and PIT would
bring them closer to EU peers, and the gradual application is prudent. The overall growth impact will
depend on how the loss of revenue is compensated.
3.
However, the proposed reform does not address some key issues cited in the staff
appraisal, which should be addressed in future. In particular,


The proposed reform is revenue-losing rather than revenue-neutral (the independent tax reform
committee’s recommendation) or revenue-enhancing (staff’s recommendation). While broadly
as envisaged in Spain’s Stability Program, the reform will require offsetting measures to achieve
the envisaged consolidation path. As per the staff report, staff recommends raising excise duties
and environmental levies, and gradually reducing preferential VAT treatments.



The strategy to boost employment could be better targeted. The proposed reform aims to boost
employment through PIT and CIT rate cuts rather than a targeted cut in employer’s social
security contributions. The latter is likely to be more effective in boosting employment for the
less skilled when the constraint is labor demand, rather than labor supply, as is the case in Spain.



The net impact on base broadening is not clear. On one hand, the proposal would eliminate/limit
a number of unwarranted tax deductions and allowances, on the other, it would create new
ones. This seems to be particularly the case for the base of corporate taxes, where special SME
regimes have been strengthened. Thus additional base broadening would be warranted.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Spain

On July 7, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2014 Article IV consultation1 with Spain.
After a protracted double-dip recession, Spain has turned the corner. Growth has resumed, and
unemployment is falling. Exporters are gaining market share and the current account is in surplus
for the first time in decades. Financial conditions have improved sharply, with sovereign yields
at record lows. Business investment is rebounding strongly and private consumption has also
started to recover due to improved employment prospects and rising confidence.
But the legacy of the crisis persists. Unemployment, at 26 percent, remains unacceptably high,
with the majority of the unemployed without a job for at least a year. The labor market remains
highly fragmented with a large share of workers dependent on temporary and involuntarily parttime jobs. Livings standards have fallen, trend productivity growth is low, and the deleveraging
of high debt burdens—public and private—is weighing on growth.
The outlook has improved significantly compared to last year’s consultation. Several factors are
helping the recovery, including much stronger euro area financial market conditions and
confidence; improving labor market trends, helped by the 2012 labor reform; and business
investment rebounding, driven by robust exports. The contribution to growth from net exports
will likely be more subdued in the near term due to an increase in imports (reflecting the stronger
domestic demand), but, over time, continued reform efforts should further improve the
contribution from net exports.
The reform agenda is progressing on several fronts, which is critical for a strong, long-lasting
and job-rich recovery. Fiscal reforms have continued (e.g. pension reform and establishing the

fiscal council) and a tax reform has been announced. The financial sector reform program was
successfully completed, helping make the system stronger, safer and better able to support the
recovery. There is a concerted effort aimed at reducing barriers to trade across Spain’s different
regions, with the Law on Market Unity as the cornerstone. The government also plans to further
liberalize professional services, and to push ahead with implementation of new active
employment policies and the electricity reform. Measures were introduced to facilitate corporate
debt restructuring, including by facilitating out-of-court debt restructuring for viable firms under
financial stress, and additional measures in this area have recently been announced. European
policies have also been supportive, including, monetary easing, progress on banking union, and
flexibility on fiscal targets.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improving Spanish economy, thanks to strong policy actions
by the authorities and policies at the European level. However, the legacy of the crisis persists, as
unemployment remains high and public and private debt levels are elevated. Directors stressed
that continued decisive policy action, with support from European partners, will be critical to
ensure a sustainable, strong, and job-rich growth.
Directors welcomed the recent measures to improve the corporate debt restructuring process.
They encouraged the authorities to make further efforts to reduce the private sector’s debt
overhang, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Directors generally encouraged
consideration of a personal insolvency framework that allows an eventual fresh start while
preserving the payment culture.
Directors welcomed the positive signs in the labor market, which reflect the 2012 labor reform
and recent wage moderation. However, noting that high unemployment remains a pressing
challenge, they encouraged additional reforms aimed at improving the skills of the unemployed,
further decentralizing wage setting mechanisms, and reducing labor market duality between
temporary and permanent contracts. Directors also highlighted that additional steps toward
flexible wage setting at the firm and sector level would make the labor market more inclusive
and responsive to economic conditions.
Directors stressed that labor market reform should be accompanied by product and service
market liberalization to maximize the gains to growth and jobs. These include implementing the
ambitious efforts to reduce barriers to business across Spain’s regions, such as the Market Unity
Law, and to open up professional services. Directors underscored the need to continue the

aggressive reform agenda in order to continue achieving productivity gains and reduce Spain’s
external vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. The envisaged steady
and growth-friendly consolidation path strikes the right balance between protecting growth in the
short term and putting debt on a declining trend. Given the large adjustment still needed over the
medium term and Spain’s relatively low revenue and spending ratios, Directors recommended
further improvements to spending efficiency, and enhancing the proposed tax reform to boost
employment through cuts in social security contributions and increasing indirect tax revenue
while protecting the most vulnerable.
Directors commended the authorities for the successfully-completed ESM-supported financial
sector program, which helped make the financial system stronger, safer, and better able to
support the recovery. Continued progress in raising capital levels over time, including by
limiting cash dividends and bonuses, would further strengthen the system and foster credit.
Directors considered that stronger policies by European partners to help lower borrowing costs in
Spain would support the recovery in both the euro area and in Spain.

Statement by Mr. Varela, Alternate Executive Director for Spain,
Ms. Garrido, Government-Provided Advisor, and Ms. Navarro, Advisor to the
Executive Director
July 7, 2014
Thanks to the efforts of the Spanish people, the decisive policy actions by the
Government and the improvement in market conditions and policies at the EU level, the
Spanish economy has made a clear turn around entering into an expansionary phase since
last year’s Article IV Consultations. After three quarters of growth, the recovery is
gathering momentum and the significant correction of major imbalances continues.
Building on the progress achieved so far, the overarching objective now is to cement the
recovery making it as strong and sustainable as possible and to reduce the still too high
unemployment rate. The authorities are well aware that the demanding task ahead leaves
no room for complacency and remain firmly committed to maintaining the reform drive
to ensure a sustainable job-rich growth for the Spanish economy.
We thank staff for the intensive and candid dialogue during the thorough mission held in
Spain and the balanced report and SIPs that contain many constructive and useful
recommendations, which are in line with the authorities’ goals. The authorities broadly
agree with the overall strategy to address the current challenges.
Recent developments and outlook
The recovery started in the second half of 2013 and now is gaining strength driven by an
improvement in confidence, better labor market performance and more conducive
financial conditions. Both government and staff are forecasting a 1.2 percent growth rate
in 2014, amply surpassing the expectations of a year ago (0.5 percent by the Spanish
authorities, 0.0 by IMF staff). Going forward, growth is expected to gradually pick up.
For 2015, the authorities estimate a 1.8 percent GDP increase in 2015, only slightly
higher than staff’s 1.6 percent.
In Q1 2014, GDP accelerated to 0.4 percent qoq (0.5 yoy, 1.5 annualized) from 0.2 in Q4
2013, linking three quarters of positive growth, due to a substantial increase of domestic
demand caused by a rise of private consumption and a strong expansion of equipment
investment.
Even with the modest growth rates experienced so far, labor markets are starting to
improve responding to the reforms introduced in 2012 and the recovery of activity. The
seasonally adjusted unemployment recorded in March 2014 its largest decrease since Q3
2005, dropping 1 percent yoy, with a reduction of 354,000 people. Still, total
unemployment rate continues to be unacceptably high at 25.3 percent.

2
Inflation reached a minimum in March 2014, as the HIPC annual rate hit -0.2, but it has
since returned to moderate positive values. In June, it stood at 0.1 (0.5 percent in the euro
area average). In this context, wages and labor costs continue moderate while
productivity goes on increasing, albeit at a more subdued rate than in recent years. Both
trends will likely persist in light of the restructuring of factors of production, the
existence of idle capacity and resources, as well as changes in incentives thanks to recent
deep structural reforms, thus leading to a further decline in Unit Labor Costs and
improved competitiveness.
Market sentiment has significantly improved, reflecting an increased confidence in the
Spanish economy and improved euro area outlook. Risk premia have remarkably
declined, with spreads dropping to pre-crisis levels. Also, foreign direct investment has
increased by 52 percent in 2013, for a total of almost 40 billion US dollars, making Spain
the ninth recipient country of FDI in the world and the first in Europe.
The current account adjustment has been remarkable from a peak of 10 percent deficit in
2007 to a 0.8 surplus in 2013, with exports gaining quota share and tourism hitting new
records. It is expected that this trend will continue, albeit at a moderate rate due to the
gradual strengthening of domestic demand, while the net IIP, which was affected by
negative valuation effects despite the current account surplus, enters into a declining path
this year.
On medium-term growth prospects, the authorities agree with staff’s assessment of risks
and the main headwinds affecting recovery. However they have more confidence on the
effects of both far-reaching structural reforms already implemented and current
macroeconomic policies. Furthermore, there is a significant amount of underutilized
resources in the Spanish economy that give potential for sustained growth, as they are
gradually reallocated to new sectors. Monetary conditions in the euro area will be
important to make progress on internal devaluation deleveraging and improving financial
conditions. The steps taken by the ECB go undoubtedly in the right direction.
Fiscal policy
The substantial efforts taken to improve public finances have continued. The deficit of
the General Government was reduced from 10.6 to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2013 (6.6
percent of GDP, net of the one-off financial support for the recapitalization of banks).
The primary deficit was reduced from 8.0 to 4.1 percent of GDP. Against the backdrop of
a severe recession, the structural effort has been remarkable, 1.2 percent of GDP
according to staff, while the structural primary balance was positive for the first time
since 2007 with a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP. This adds to the substantial efforts in
2012 when Spain recorded the second highest structural effort among advanced
economies.

3

Far-reaching fiscal-structural reforms have also been implemented since 2012 to
contribute to a lasting improvement of public finances. The fiscal framework has been
strengthened. An independent fiscal institution (AIReF) has been created and the last
steps to make it fully operational are being completed. Commercial arrears to public
sector suppliers have been addressed and cleared. Mechanisms to prevent and combat tax
fraud have been significantly enhanced. A comprehensive review of expenditure bases at
the Central Government level has been undertaken to streamline and increase efficiency
(CORA), while Regions and Local governments can adhere to these efforts. This has
been complemented with significant reforms in public administration, healthcare,
education and local administration, all resulting in significant structural savings.
The authorities remain firmly committed to fiscal consolidation. In view of the significant
deficit reduction targeted for 2015 and to further ensure the credibility of the adjustment,
the deficit reduction in 2014 has been accelerated to 5.5 percent of GDP (instead of the
previous 5.8 percent). Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation will further advance in
line with EU arrangements. The fiscal strategy set up in the Stability Program aims at
bringing down the fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2016 and reaching the
medium-term objective (MTO) of a balanced budgetary position in structural terms in
2017, which is more stringent than required by the Stability and Growth Pact. The fiscal
consolidation plan has been designed to minimize the drag on growth and facilitate job
creation, while also focusing on the protection of vulnerable groups.
On the expenditure side, priority will continue to be given to expenditure restraint,
focusing especially on the resizing of public administration and other current
expenditures to pay due attention to the composition of the adjustment. It must also be
noted that a wide range of reforms adopted during the last two years have entailed a
comprehensive review of many expenditure items (pensions, healthcare, public
administration, local administration, etc.) and will continue creating savings. Special
attention will continue to be paid to boosting public expenditure efficiency. In this regard,
a revision of public expenditures at the regional level has been recently initiated to
rationalise and increase efficiency. Important steps have also been taken to reduce
contingent liabilities and the electricity tariff deficit has been addressed and (as of 2014)
eliminated.
As staff recognizes, the December 2013 pension reform has been an important milestone
for underpinning the sustainability of the pension system. According to the latest
projections, public pension expenditure is expected to decline from 10 percent of GDP in
2010 (which is below the EU average) to 9.6 percent in 2060 (EU average estimated at
12.9 percent of GDP), compared with a projected 13.7 percent of GDP in 2060 before the
reform.

4
On the revenue side, progress has been made in the last years in the rebalancing of direct
and indirect taxation in the direction of a fiscal devaluation. In 2010 and 2012, indirect
taxation was significantly strengthened. The 2012 reform in VAT was implemented to
increase the standard and reduced rates broadening the tax base and reducing goods
subject to preferential treatment. New environmental taxes were introduced and some
excise taxes increased. Reductions in social security contributions have also been
introduced in 2013 and 2014, including through the temporary €100 flat rate contribution.
A substantial tax reform is currently under preparation and is envisaged to be in effect in
2015. Following the report for tax reform commissioned to a Committee of Experts, the
planned reform on direct taxes was unveiled on June 20, 2014 aiming at boosting
economic activity, corporate competitiveness and job creation. The reform envisages,
among other changes, gradual reductions in rates and a broadening of the bases for
Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income Tax and further strengthening tools to fight
against fraud, which is warranted to increase the revenue-GDP ratio. The planned reform
also included some increases in VAT rates in line with EU legislation. The fiscal effects
of the reform were already incorporated into the Stability Program, so no significant
additional fiscal costs can be expected. The authorities also envisage additional reforms
to certain indirect and environmental taxation in the near term.
Financial sector and credit
The financial sector program was successfully completed in January 2014. Thanks to
extensive reforms and policy actions, with the support of the Euro Area partners, capital,
liquidity and efficiency levels of the financial system have been bolstered and the
framework of governance, regulation and supervision has been enhanced. The financial
sector now has also a more efficient size and structure after undergoing a remarkable
downsizing.
After the recapitalisation of parts of the banking sector, a deep cleaning up of troubled
assets compounded with very demanding provisioning requirements and an accurate
classification of refinanced/restructured loans, balance sheets are now sounder. Banks’
solvency position remains comfortable, with Core Tier 1 ratio reaching 11.8 percent at
the end of 2013. The quality of instruments composing the capital of most banks has also
improved with Tier 2 and additional Tier 1 capital instruments decreasing. The forwardlooking evaluation of the solvency of Spanish Banks conducted in November 2013 by the
Bank of Spain in application of a new supervisory tool confirmed the fairly comfortable
solvency position of banks at an aggregated level under different macroeconomic
scenarios considered.
Profitability has also improved. The Spanish banks recorded positive results in 2013
(more than €11 bn in profits), not only as a result of lower provisioning needs after the
extraordinary efforts made in 2012 to meet the additional requirements imposed, but also

5
due to the efficiency gains achieved (operating costs are now 24 percent the pre-crisis
levels) and earnings resilience resulting from banks’ geographically diversified business
models.
While credit to the private sector has been falling steadily since the onset of the crisis, a
change in this trend is now being seen. Recent data shows that the contraction of credit to
the private sector is decelerating and the flow of new credit has been growing yoy both
for SMEs and households for eight and five months, respectively. However, credit
recovery remains a challenge, in particular for SMEs. Against this backdrop, measures
have been taken to facilitate SMEs access to finance including the development of nonbanking financing alternatives. MARF, the alternative bond market for SMEs, is now
operational. The volume of ICO´s (State Finance Agency) lending program for SMEs has
substantially increased. A comprehensive package is currently in the pipeline with
additional measures to further ease financing to SMEs and non-financial corporations.
Ongoing progress in addressing financial fragmentation in the euro area will also be
helpful.
Mindful of the remaining challenges, the authorities have continued promoting measures
to cement and further improve the resilience of the banking sector. Recent actions by
Bank of Spain are noteworthy, notably its guidance to ensure the reclassification of
doubtful credit under uniform criteria, the recommendation of a conservative dividend
policy to foster capital increases, and a new supervisory tool to assess the sensitivity of
Spanish banks’ solvency to shocks. These achievements and progress, together with the
improved the economic outlook in Spain and the euro area, have been acknowledged by
markets, as shown by the reduction of systemic risk indicators for Spain and in the gross
recourse to the Eurosystem by Spanish banks, as well as by the high and rising Spanish
banks’ price-to-book values compared to that of European peers. The authorities are thus
confident that the Spanish financial system is well prepared for the ECB’s comprehensive
assessment and to contribute to a strong economic recovery.
Corporate and personal debt management
Aware of the need to continue the deleveraging process of corporate and households, the
authorities have been adopting measures to facilitate it while preserving financial stability
and growth.
Recent data confirms that private deleveraging is progressing at a good pace. According
to the ECB, corporate and household debt in Spain dropped 4.6 and 4.4 percentage points
respectively from 2012 Q4 to 2013 Q4. In both cases, it has been the largest decline
among the five largest European economies.

6
Following significant steps taken to reinforce the personal insolvency framework in 2013,
the Government approved and implemented in 2014 a set of major changes enhancing
corporate debt restructuring and insolvency frameworks. A Royal Decree Law approved
in March 2014 introduced new tools to foster the restructuring process, including new
types of in and out-of-court refinancing agreements and debt for equity swaps that can be
used by any type of companies, including SMEs. The law on entrepreneurship of
September 2013 also included specific measures to facilitate out-of-court insolvency
agreements and promote a second chance.
Further to that, the authorities—in line with staff recommendations during the mission—
have decided to further reinforce the corporate debt restructuring framework. The main
steps, recently announced, include a rebalancing of the in-court debt restructuring
process, fostering liquidation as a going concern, expanding restructuring options for
SMEs, setting up a Code of Good Practices for SMEs and self-employed and creating an
inter-ministerial commission to monitor debt restructuring processes and to foster
institutional coordination. Once these measures are in place, it is expected that the
remaining specific recommendations mentioned in the staff report, both for large firms
and SMEs, will also be addressed.
Regarding a deeper involvement of public creditors in the debt restructuring process and
the establishment of a new personal insolvency framework that provides for a full
discharge of debts, the authorities have different views from staff on the scope and timing
to implement them. They think more study is warranted on the fiscal and financial impact
of those measures and on the strong payment culture that prevails in Spain (with
household NPL at relatively low levels), in a context where NPLs are starting to contract
and the recovery is still at an early stage.
Structural reforms
The labor market reform is proving successful so far. Labor market flexibility has
substantially increased, allowing firms to better adapt wages and labor conditions to their
real needs, wages are moderating and, importantly, the reform has substantially reduced
the job-creating GDP growth threshold. In an unprecedented development, even with
growth rates under 1 percent, employment is now being created.
The authorities remain vigilant and ready to take additional measures, if needed, but
believe that the reform will continue to unfold to its full potential as past practices are
transformed and inertia is overcome.
The authorities also consider that the current context calls for decisive action on
activation policies. In this vein, a new Activation for Employment Strategy 2014–16 has
been recently launched in close coordination with the Youth Guarantee Implementation

7
Plan. This new strategy will include a common framework with the regions (given that
execution and management is carried out at the regional level) setting common priorities,
evaluations and monitoring of policies in a result-oriented manner. Other measures
include a deep reform of the vocational training system, close coordination with private
job placement agencies, and the creation of a Single Portal with all job vacancies at the
national level. These measures are fully in line with staff’s recommendations.
The labor reform has significantly contributed to reduce duality and, at the same time, has
had a positive impact on increasing permanent contracts, as recognized by the OCDE.
Since 2007 to 2013 temporary employment has dropped from 31.5 percent to 23.1
percent, an 8.4 percent less.
Concerning social security contributions, reductions were introduced in 2013 for hiring
young people and a temporary €100 flat rate contribution has been created in 2014 for
new permanent contracts to support employment. As noted before, these measures go in
the same direction as the fiscal devaluation suggestions made by staff. The later will
imply savings of 75 percent in the tax wedge for firms and it will help creating more jobs,
also among low-skilled workers. The Corporate Income Tax cuts contemplated in the tax
reform will also help fostering investment and creating employment across the board.
The authorities have continued advancing with the implementation of their ambitious
product and services structural reform agenda to foster long-term growth and
competitiveness. A great number of critical measures have been adopted to enhance
competition, increase productivity, improve the business environment and remove
barriers to the growth of firms, in line with staff’s recommendations.
The law on the guarantee of market unity adopted in December 2013 is a major effort to
improve the business environment and reduce administrative burdens. This reform
tackles the fragmentation of the domestic market arising from different layers of
regulation in more than 30 sectors and is expected to have significant impact on
productivity and growth. The new framework also creates an open-ended process to
address possible regulatory barriers that could emerge going forward. A “regional doing
business indicator” prepared in collaboration with the World Bank will help monitoring
and promoting good regulation across regions.
Measures have also been put in place under the law on entrepreneurship of September
2013 to reduce the cost and time of creation of companies, support their growth and
internationalization, and simplify administrative burdens.
The reform of professional services and associations is in progress. A draft bill containing
far-reaching liberalization measures (including strict limits on registration requirements
and revision of membership fees) is expected to be adopted this year. By reinforcing

8
competition and efficiency, this reform will result in important gains in productivity,
competitiveness, growth and job potential.
In addition, the rental market reform adopted in 2013 will increase efficiency in this
market and reduce the home-ownership bias, which is expected to have positive effects
on labor mobility. Significant reforms have also been adopted to enhance the R&I
framework, as well as in the retail market, transport, energy and telecommunications
sectors.
