EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The global crisis brought an end to a long period of high, but unsustainable
growth. The sharp contraction in exports, remittances, and FDI, and the postponement of an
exchange rate devaluation led to a crisis of confidence in Armenia and an enormous drop in
output. A strong policy response from the authorities, supported by the international
community, including the IMF, helped to soften the impact of the crisis and recover confidence,
albeit at the cost of a substantial rise in public debt. Economic activity is now picking up, but
the pace of recovery remains slow.
Policy challenges: Armenia’s principal policy challenges center on the need to maintain fiscal
and debt sustainability, adjust to the uncertain external environment, and achieve sustainable
medium-term growth and poverty reduction.
Key recommendations:


Implement a fiscal exit strategy to address medium-term fiscal and debt vulnerabilities. To
this end, the deficit should be reduced to below 4 percent in 2011, and to about 2½ percent
of GDP by 2013. This would put debt back on a downward trend reaching 36 percent of
GDP by 2015.



Continue to target a pre-announced inflation rate, preventing temporary price increases
from becoming entrenched, and enhance tools for making monetary policy more effective.



Adhere to a flexible exchange rate regime, intervening in the foreign exchange market only
to smooth market volatility and safeguard foreign exchange reserves.



Continue implementing prudential measures to preserve financial stability, maintain
banking sector soundness, and deepen financial markets.



Continue structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness and strengthen competition
in the economy. Key areas include tax administration and tax policy reform, strengthening
the business environment, and addressing corruption.



Expand well-targeted social assistance programs to reduce poverty.

I. BACKGROUND 1
A. End of a Boom
1.
Armenia experienced one of the
highest growth rates in the world prior
to the global crisis. Real GDP growth
averaged 12 percent per year during 2000–
07, leading to a sharp increase in per capita
income and a fall in poverty. This growth
depended on remittances, however, which
were funneled, in particular, to
construction. The share of construction in
real GDP peaked at 26 percent in 2008.2

devaluation led to a crisis of confidence in
Armenia and an enormous drop in output.
A strong policy response from the authorities, paired with substantial support from the
international community, including the IMF, helped to soften the impact of the crisis and
recover confidence, albeit at the cost of a substantial rise in public debt. The crisis
underscored that a growth strategy predicated on private remittance inflows into nontradables
is not sustainable and exposes the country’s vulnerabilities to external shocks.
3.
At the time of the last Article IV discussions in November 2008, the IMF Board
encouraged the authorities to pursue prudent monetary and fiscal policies, enhance their
inflation targeting framework, strengthen the financial system, and implement far-reaching
structural reforms. The authorities’ policy response was broadly in line with Fund advice.
While fiscal and monetary policies shifted to a countercyclical mode during the crisis, all
major reforms are on-track except for some delays in tax policy and business environment
reforms.

This report is based on discussions held in Yerevan during September 9−24, 2010. The staff team comprised
R. Sahay (Head), V. Bacalu, A. Bordon, A. Weber (all MCD), A. El-Ganainy (FAD), E. Gemayel (SPR),
D. Saeju (MCM), and G. Tolosa (Resident Representative). A. Manookian and A. Ghazaryan of the resident
representative office, and G. Sargsyan (OED) also participated in the meetings. The mission met with the Prime
Minister, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Economy, as well as
with private and financial sector representatives, NGOs, and parliamentarians.
2

The authorities’ efforts to improve the national accounts data are outlined in Box 1.

4
Box 1. Armenia: Revisions of National Accounts Estimates
The National Statistical Service (NSS) of Armenia is undertaking a revision of
the annual and quarterly GDP data series since 2008. The annual estimates of
GDP at constant prices will be revised to include improved statistical techniques for
deriving volume measures of GDP. The quarterly NSS GDP data at current and at
constant prices will also be revised, in accordance with the System of National
Accounts. Quarterly GDP estimates at current prices will be compiled from discrete
data sources only, since the NSS has successfully redesigned its data collection
program to collect source data on a discrete basis rather than a cumulative one. The
quarterly GDP estimates at constant prices will be compiled as chain volume
measures. The NSS plans to disseminate these revised annual and quarterly GDP
estimates for 2008−Q1-2011 in June 2011.
As of January 2011, the NSS will discontinue monthly GDP compilation, and
will start compiling a monthly indicator of economic activity (IEA), following
international best practices. The monthly IEA is not a measure of value added
(GDP), but an aggregated measure of production. The IEA will be disseminated on an
aggregated level only—for the total economy. The presentation will include monthto-month growth rates and month-to-corresponding month of the previous year
growth rates. Time series of chain-linked IEA will also be published. The index will
be reconstructed back to January 2000.
4.
The political situation remains broadly unchanged, and hoped-for improvements
in relations with neighbors have not materialized. Steps toward the opening of the land
border with Turkey have not progressed, and tensions remain with Azerbaijan on the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. Armenia’s closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan pose a
heavy economic cost, as it is a land-locked country. A reopening of the land border with
Turkey would greatly benefit the Armenian economy (Box3, Country Report No. 09/316).
B. A Fragile Recovery is Proceeding
5.
Economic activity is recovering
from the sharp downturn last year, but the
pace of the recovery remains slow. Real
GDP growth was 3.1 percent through the first
eight months of the year, driven by a
recovery in services and industry. Compared
to the 6½ percent rate observed in the first
half of 2010, the pace of growth has slowed,
reflecting unfavorable weather conditions
and an unprecedented decline in agricultural
output. The fiscal stimulus—financed by a

inflation is expected to revert to the central bank’s target of 4±1½ percent during the second
half of 2011.
7.
Current account deficits are large, although public debt remains manageable
and private debt is negligible. The current account deficit was about 16 percent of GDP in
2009 and is projected to narrow to 14.6 percent of GDP in 2010. It has been financed mainly
through donor assistance and foreign direct investment. Gross international reserves are
expected to decline marginally to about 5 months of imports by year-end. Public debt is
projected to increase sharply from 16 percent in 2008 to about 50 percent in 2012, but is set
to decline steadily thereafter.

The nominal exchange rate has
appreciated this year after
depreciating by close to 35 percent
between early 2009 and early 2010. The
recent appreciation of about 10 percent
reflects seasonal trends of real flows
(e.g., lower food imports, higher tourism
receipts), as well as some external
borrowing from parent banks by domestic
subsidiaries. Consistent with their
intervention guidelines, the authorities

Fiscal performance has improved markedly with the modest economic recovery
this year. Year-over-year tax collection increased by 20 percent in the first eight months and
the fiscal deficit is expected to fall by more than three percentage points of GDP this year.
II. FACING A SOBERING OUTLOOK: MEDIUM-TERM POLICY CHALLENGES
11.
While the economic and financial situation is improving, important
vulnerabilities have emerged or have become more evident. An undiversified economy
marked by pervasive monopolies and closed borders, were well-known issues before the
crisis, but were masked by the high growth rates. While the authorities’ policy response and
financial support from the international community have helped mitigate the crisis, public
debt and current account deficits have risen sharply.
12.
Armenia now faces a much
more challenging outlook compared
to the pre-crisis period. External
demand is likely to remain weak. In
particular, growth in Russia, Armenia’s
main trading partner and source of
remittances and FDI, has moderated
compared to previous years. Armenia is
also vulnerable to developments in
Europe, primarily due to lower demand
for its commodity exports as well as the
recent depreciation of the euro.

However, over the medium term, both exports and imports are expected to pick up with large
investment projects and trade enhancing reforms (¶ 29 and 30). In the short term, growth
should pick up to 4.6 percent in 2011,

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Securing Sound Public Finances
14.
In response to the crisis, the authorities appropriately injected a large fiscal
stimulus in 2009. Both the authorities and staff considered that the extent of the output
contraction last year and the need to mitigate the impact of crisis on the poor warranted a
sizable widening of the deficit. This helped sustain demand and ensure the provision of
essential services. To the authorities’ credit, most of the stimulus did not involve new
recurrent expenditures or permanent tax reductions.
15.
However, with the recovery of
output and the rapid increase in
public debt, fiscal consolidation is
needed in the coming years. Public
external debt, which was only
13.6 percent of GDP at end-2008, has
since tripled and is expected to peak at
about 42 percent of GDP in 2011. In
addition, Armenia has a bunching of
debt service obligations that rise to more
than 20 percent of export receipts in
2013. The authorities are already

consolidating their fiscal accounts, with the deficit targeted to come down to 4.8 percent of
GDP in 2010 from 8 percent in 2009. This implies an adjustment of more than 2 percentage

borrow when public debt reaches 50 percent
of GDP. Therefore, they intend to continue on a path of debt reduction, with the fiscal deficit
slated to fall to about 2½ percent of GDP by 2013. With this consolidation, Armenia’s
external debt will remain at a low risk of distress (Appendix I). Staff underscored that
financing gaps will need to rely as much as possible on concessional financing to avoid a
worsening of the debt dynamics.
17.
In addition to their wide-ranging tax reform agenda (described below),
strengthening public expenditure and debt management will be critical to achieving
fiscal policy goals. The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was re-introduced
in August after having been suspended during the crisis. The updated MTEF is geared toward
promoting growth, while placing public debt on a downward path and shifting spending
toward social programs and investment in key sectors. To help identify areas for efficiency
gains and savings, the authorities are looking forward to the IMF’s technical assistance on
expenditure rationalization in early 2011. Likewise, the authorities are strengthening their
debt monitoring and planning capacity, and

on the importance of protecting social

to the Family Benefits Program—Armenia’s social safety net—will be raised by 15 percent
in nominal terms in 2011 compared to 2010. The authorities have also agreed to gradually
increase allocations for health spending and education, which, at 4 percent of GDP, remain
low for Armenia’s income level. Furthermore, the government will continue to provide
support to the poor through other programs, including unemployment benefits and paid
public works.3

estimated to be overvalued by
about 10–12 percent (Appendix II). Therefore, while the increased flexibility of the exchange
rate and the fiscal retrenchment expected over the medium term are steps in the right
direction, in staff’s view, additional structural reform measures are needed to raise external
competitiveness (Appendix IV, ¶29 and 30) and bring the current account deficit to
sustainable levels.
20.
The authorities agreed that competitiveness needs to be raised, but did not see
the exchange rate channel as the main avenue for achieving this goal. While they
acknowledged that the real exchange rate was somewhat overvalued at present, they were
concerned that a depreciation could lead to higher inflation. The authorities underscored that
the exchange rate has been responding to market forces, and official interventions have been
aimed at smoothing volatility in both directions and safeguarding reserves. Staff welcomed
these two-way interventions, and stressed the importance of not resisting fundamental trends.
Both staff and the authorities agreed that clear and transparent communication would be
important in this regard (LOI ¶11).
3

After a sharp rise in outlays on these allowances in 2009 in connection with the crisis, increases in 2010 and
beyond will be more moderate, with spending on allowances and pensions more generally declining in percent
of GDP as the recovery proceeds, but remaining well above pre-crisis levels.

10
21.
Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability under the inflation
targeting framework. In light of early signs of recovery, the authorities increased the policy
rate by 225 basis points to 7¼ percent from January through May. As the pace of recovery
slowed in the second half of this year, the rate has been kept unchanged. While the current
price pressures present a challenge, the authorities stressed—and staff agreed—that they are
due to supply shocks to the agricultural sector and imported wheat prices, which are expected
to recede gradually. So far, there has been little sign of a pass-through of price increases to
wages, and staff agreed that demand pressures will remain low in the near term, given the
fragile recovery and the negative output gap. Core inflation has also been on a declining
trend since end-2009. In view of these considerations, a tightening of monetary policy is not
warranted at this time. Nonetheless, staff recommended that the authorities remain vigilant
and to stand ready to raise policy rates further if there is evidence of demand pressures or to
prevent the entrenchment of second-round effects of temporary supply shocks on inflation.

urged the authorities to manage
liquidity actively to keep market
interest rates close to the policy rate. To enhance further the interest rate channel, the
authorities are pursuing initiatives to develop the market for dram instruments, including
standardizing the pricing and settlement of treasury bills in line with international practice
and setting the legal groundwork for insurance and private investment funds to develop (LOI
¶12).
23.
Measures to encourage dedollarization have helped at the
margin, but a significant impact will
ultimately hinge on a strong track
record of macroeconomic policies and
financial stability. The authorities
noted that an increase, in several steps,
in bank reserves on foreign currency
deposits to be maintained in drams has
widened interest rate spreads between
dram and foreign currency deposits

(LOI ¶13). Indeed the deposit dollarization rate has fallen slightly, although the recent
appreciation of the exchange rate may have also played a role. Staff urged caution with
introducing new reserve requirement norms, bearing in mind the trade-offs between
prudential objectives and dedollarization. Ultimately, the credibility of monetary and
exchange rate policies will be key to dedollarization.
C. Creating a More Dynamic Economy
24.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to raise economic growth rates and
reduce poverty in the medium term. To this end, a range of reforms to enhance stability
and boost the competitiveness of the economy are envisaged.

reported by the private sector, undercuts
the ability of firms to function efficiently. As outlined in the LOI (¶17), a number of steps
have been implemented to boost oversight of the tax and customs agency, the SRC, including
establishment of a board of appeals outside the purview of the SRC. Looking forward (LOI
¶18 and 19), improving VAT refund processing, expanding the large taxpayer unit,
streamlining tax reporting requirements, and developing tax audit manuals should all go in
the direction of lessening the burden of tax administration, reducing corruption and evasion,
encouraging greater voluntary compliance, and enhancing revenue over the longer term.
26.
Regarding tax policy, efforts are underway to simplify the system and reduce
distortions. The authorities will (i) abolish the presumptive taxation regime for petroleum
products and move these goods to the regular taxation regime starting January 2011;
(ii) harmonize excise tax rates for alcoholic beverages between domestic and imported
products starting in 2011, and (iii) increase the presumptive payments on tobacco products
starting in 2011, while gradually harmonizing taxation between domestic and imported
tobacco and moving these goods from the presumptive to the regular taxation regime by 2014
(LOI ¶20).

12
Strengthening the financial sector
27.
The banking sector remains stable, and the authorities are working toward
reducing remaining vulnerabilities. The sector has been resilient to the strains of the last
18 months (as discussed in Appendix C of Country Report No. 10/97), and updated stress
tests indicate that it is resilient to moderate interest rate, exchange rate, liquidity, and credit
shocks. The authorities are continuing to enhance their risk management and supervisory
frameworks, as well as crisis preparedness and contingency planning (LOI ¶15 and 16).
28.
Deepening financial intermediation, which remains low in Armenia, will be
needed to support private sector growth and raise the traction of monetary policy.
While private sector credit as a share of GDP has increased over the last decade, it stands at
just over 20 percent of GDP. The authorities have requested a full FSAP update, given the
importance of both the stability and development objectives.

Several impediments inhibit
Armenia’s growth potential. As noted,
Armenia’s two closed borders clearly
present a handicap, as does the
oligopolistic structure of the private
sector (Appendix IV). Furthermore, a
majority of businesses indicate that
corruption, access to finance, as well as
crime, theft, and disorder have recently
emerged as major concerns.

The authorities outlined a number of steps they are taking to improve the
business climate. These involve introducing a legal restriction on public officials from
engaging in commercial activities, strengthening the competition commission, and further
reducing barriers to entry for new businesses, including a recent cabinet decree to create a
one-stop shop for business registration.
31.
Trade reform will also be critical, and a number of reforms are planned under
the umbrella of the recently-launched negotiations for an EU Association Agreement
with Armenia. Key steps include revised regulations and practices regarding
standardization, certification, intellectual property rights, competition rules, and public
procurement procedures. It is crucially important to reverse the recent decline in share of
Armenian exports and the deteriorating role of the export sector.

Poverty reduction
32.
Despite impressive gains over the last
decade, the poverty rate remains high.
While the targeting of social assistance
programs has improved noticeably, coverage
remains uneven with currently only 36 percent
of the poor covered by the Family Benefits
Program, a key element of social protection in
Armenia. Although this represents an
improvement over the coverage rate before the
crisis, the authorities recognize that
simplifying certification requirements and
increasing outreach efforts could help achieve
higher coverage.

33.
The authorities will introduce an integrated system for the provision of social
protection services, in cooperation with the World Bank (LOI ¶25). They are also in the
process of updating their Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The authorities have continued
the progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as indicated by lower
maternal mortality rates, as well as an increase in life expectancy.
IV. THE EFF/ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM REMAINS ON TRACK
34.
Performance under the EFF/ECF-supported program has been strong. The
program is on track, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for endJune 2010 and all but one structural benchmarks observed on time. The benchmark on
establishing a tax appeals board was met with delay, in October, instead of September.
35.
The authorities have requested minor modifications to the program. In particular,
they have requested a modification of the end-December performance criteria for net

600

14
international reserves, net domestic assets, and the program fiscal balance, largely to preserve
the strong performance of net international reserves thus far this year and the postponement
of some external budget financing to 2011. In addition, they have requested the establishment
of performance criteria for end-June 2011.
36.
While risks to the program exist, they are mitigated by several factors.
Policymakers face several challenges, particularly the need to unwind external imbalances,
put fiscal and debt policies on sustainable path, move ahead with tax administration
measures, and ensure sustainable growth and lower poverty. These risks are mitigated by the
authorities’ strong commitment, already demonstrated in managing the crisis well and in
formulating a cohesive post-crisis reform program, a pre-crisis track record of sound
macroeconomic management, and the resources made available to Armenia through the
EFF/ECF arrangement.
37.
Armenia’s debt is expected to be sustainable in the medium term and its
repayment capacity is good. Fund exposure is projected to peak at about 10 percent of GDP
in 2011. Total debt service to the Fund would reach 14 percent of total exports in 2013, or
about 3 percent of GDP.
38.
The recently completed safeguards assessment found that the CBA continues to
maintain a sound safeguards framework. Financial statements continue to be prepared and
audited in accordance with international standards and published on a timely basis. A
framework agreement between the CBA and the ministry of finance is in place on servicing
budget support-related obligations to the Fund. The safeguards framework could be further
improved by appointing external auditors for the CBA to a multi-year term, and
strengthening its oversight arrangements by the inclusion of independent members on the
Board and on the Audit Committee.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Armenian economy suffered a major setback during the global crisis with
output contracting by more than 14 percent in 2009. The swift policy response of the
authorities, with the assistance of the international community, rightly shifted to a
countercyclical mode, dampening the impact of the crisis, especially on the most vulnerable
segments of the population.
40.
Armenia is on the right trajectory as it exits the crisis. Recent macroeconomic
developments are encouraging, despite some—largely supply driven—inflationary pressures.
Fiscal consolidation is moving forward, while the monetary policy stance remains neutral.
Structural reforms have also progressed, but need to proceed faster to raise the growth
potential of the economy.
41.
Over the medium term, Armenia faces several challenges precipitated by the
crisis. The external environment is difficult, and external imbalances must to be tackled

15
expeditiously to avoid a disorderly adjustment. Decisive fiscal consolidation is needed to
preserve debt sustainability and support medium-term external adjustment. Broader reforms
are essential to promote growth and poverty reduction, namely, to address significant
weaknesses in tax administration and the business environment, strengthen financial stability,
and deepen financial intermediation.
42.
The government’s fiscal policy strategy appropriately addresses the mediumterm fiscal and debt vulnerabilities. With the economy gradually recovering, the fiscal
stimulus is being gradually withdrawn. The budget deficit is projected to decline by 3 percent
of GDP in 2010 and by a further 1 percent of GDP in 2011. The focus of consolidation is
appropriately on enhancing revenue collection, rather than expenditure compression that
could hurt spending on important sectors—education and health—as well as the poor. With
these policies, the fiscal deficit is projected to fall to about 2 percent of GDP in the medium
term, which will ensure that public debt remains sustainable. The MTEF and the new debt
management strategy should substantially contribute to sound public finances.
43.
The CBA’s monetary policy response since the crisis has been appropriate. The
move to a more flexible exchange rate, the gradual lowering of the policy rate during the
crisis, and its gradual increase as the recovery started were steps in the right direction. In the
near term, monetary policy should continue to remain vigilant, increasing the policy rate if
demand pressures or second-round effects from food price shocks arise. The CBA should
continue to improve its communications to ensure that inflation expectations remain
anchored around the inflation target. Planned dedollarization efforts could facilitate the
monetary transmission mechanism, but sustained and sound macroeconomic policies are
essential to reduce dollarization.
44.
The increased flexibility of the exchange rate is serving Armenia well. The
authorities’ commitment to maintaining a flexible exchange rate is welcome. The CBA
intervention policy should continue to aim at only smoothing sharp fluctuations in the
market, while guarding foreign exchange reserves and ensuring that the economy remains
competitive. Any appreciation bias in the interventions will further contribute to a
misalignment of the exchange rate with the equilibrium rate and delay external adjustment.
45.
Armenia’s banking sector remains sound and proved resilient to the global
shocks. After rising in the first half of 2009, NPLs came down and have remained at low
levels throughout 2010. Staff is encouraged by the recent pick up in lending to the private
sector. It is essential that the authorities continue to implement measures to preserve financial
stability, including strengthening the supervision framework, tightening foreign exchangerelated prudential regulations, and improving crisis preparedness and contingency planning.
46.
Further improvements in tax administration will be needed to support fiscal
consolidation and achieve stronger growth. While the government’s commitment to
reforming the tax administration is welcome, efforts to strengthen tax administration and

16
advance tax policy reforms have had mixed success, in part reflecting political economy
constraints. The recent actions are a step in the right direction, but decisive implementation in
line with international best practices will be crucial to realize gains.
47.
Structural reforms will be essential if Armenia is to enhance its competitiveness
and raise its growth potential. Bolder and deeper reforms are needed to improve
governance, enhance competition, diminish monopolistic behavior, diversify exports, and
more generally, modernize the economy. Measures to address conflicts of interest of public
officials, strengthen the competition framework, and reduce barriers to entry by firms are
welcome and should be followed by further trade reforms.
48.
Policies under the program remain on track. All quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2010 as well as all indicative targets for which
data are available for end-September 2010 were observed. The structural benchmarks were
also met on time, except for the benchmark on the establishment of tax appeals board, which
was met with a one-month delay. With this strong performance, staff recommends
completion of the first review under the EFF/ECF, approval of the request for modification
of end-December 2010 performance criteria for net international reserves, net domestic
assets, and the program fiscal balance, and the establishment of new performance criteria for
end-June 2011.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with the
September 28, 2010 decision on consultation cycles.

Appendix I. Armenia: Debt Sustainability Analysis
This appendix, jointly drafted by the Fund and Bank staffs, presents joint IMF-World Bank
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Armenia using the Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries (LIC).1 Based on the external LIC DSA, Armenia is assessed to be at
a low risk of debt distress, with all debt indicators below the relevant country-specific
thresholds, including when subject to stress tests.2 The public sector DSA suggests that
Armenia’s overall public sector debt is sustainable, although the debt-to-GDP ratio
increased from 16 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in 2009, and is projected to reach about
50 percent in 2012 before gradually decreasing. Following a significant increase in debt, a
fiscal consolidation—recently agreed in the context of the EFF/ECF arrangement, as well as
the series of World Bank Development Policy Operations—is key to preserve debt and fiscal
sustainability over the long term. Implementation of structural reforms would also be critical
to boost competitiveness and exports as well as to sustain growth.
I.

Background

Armenia’s total public and private external debt increased during 2005–08, from
$1.45 billion to $2.25 billion. At end-2005, public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt was
$1.1 billion; this increased to $1.6 billion by end 2008 (Table 1). From the equivalent of
$100 million in 2005, domestic public debt increased to $300 million in 2008. The share of
short-term domestic public debt increased from 13 percent of total public domestic debt in
2005 to 33 percent in 2008, before contracting during the crisis and stabilizing at about
30 percent in 2010. The text table shows that during 2005–10, on average, 85 percent of
Armenia’s PPG resulted from government borrowing with the remaining 15 percent coming
from central bank borrowing. The latter has been mainly related to the IMF and the German
KfW, with the IBRD also contributing a small share during the crisis.

1

The debt data underlying this analysis were provided by the Armenian authorities and donor partners. Data
beyond end-2009 are staffs’ and authorities’ projections.
Armenia is classified as a strong performer based on its three-year average score of 4.32 on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which measures the country’s strength of its policies and
institutions. For a strong performer (defined as those with three-year average CPIA ratings above 3.75), the
indicative thresholds (for a country where remittance inflows are high) for external debt sustainability are PV of
debt-to-GDP + remittances ratio of 45 percent, PV of debt-to-exports + remittances ratio of 180 percent, PV of
debt-to-revenue ratio of 300 percent, debt service-to-exports + remittances ratio of 22.5 percent, and debt
service-to-revenue ratio of 35 percent.

The large fiscal deficit in 2009—8 percent of GDP—contributed to an increase in the stock
of public external borrowing to nearly $3 billion. This, combined with a sharp drop of output,
left the ratio of total public debt to GDP at 41 percent, up from 16 percent in 2008. The
public debt ratio is projected to increase further to 44 percent in 2010. Before the crisis, IDA
credits were providing the bulk of government borrowing. During the crisis, the IMF and the
ADB scaled up their government financing to 9 percent of the 2009 total debt stock, and
13 percent of the 2010 total debt stock. IBRD contribution also increased, reaching 2 percent
of 2010 debt stock. Among bilateral lenders, Russia and Japan also scaled up their financing
during the crisis, increasing the share of the bilateral PPG to 30 percent of total PPG debt
stock, from 19 percent in 2008.

30
Box I.1. Armenia: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario (2010–30)
Real GDP growth is projected to be 4 percent for 2010 and 4.6 percent for 2011, after which
it will gradually return to its medium-term potential growth rate of about 4 percent per year
during 2012–15 (below the 10-year historical average of 8.7 percent), and will remain at that
level thereafter. Near-term growth will be supported by the robust activity in industry and
services, facilitated by a renewal of private transfers and FDI inflows.
For 2010, inflation is expected to be around 7 percent by year-end, due largely to sharp price
increases for food products. Inflation is expected to revert to the central bank’s target range
of 4±1½ percent during the second half of 2011. Consistent with the target range, the average
inflation rate over the long term is assumed to be around 4 percent.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to decrease from about 8 percent of GDP in 2009 to
2½ percent by 2013, in line with understandings under the EFF/ECF-supported program.
Over the long term, the deficit is projected to remain between 1−2 percent of GDP.
Net domestic financing (NDF) is expected to remain at around 2½ percent of GDP by 2013,
due to the expected increase in amortization payments starting in 2013 and the expected drop
in external flows. The financing mix will continue to rely more on domestic resources
throughout the medium term, and NDF will rise to about 3 percent of GDP in 2015, declining
thereafter to an average of about 2 percent of GDP in 2016−30, in line with assumed fiscal
adjustment.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 16 percent of GDP in 2009 to
14.6 percent of GDP in 2010. It will gradually narrow further to about 8 percent in 2015 as
exports and remittances pick up in line with the global recovery. Exports are projected to
grow robustly over the medium term, as new investments become operational.
As Armenia continues to grow at about 4 percent over the long term, remittances (the
growth of which moves in line with developments in Russia, the largest source) will average
around 10 percent of GDP and finance a significant share of the trade deficit.
FDI is expected to average about 9 percent of GDP over the medium term. In the near term,
FDI is expected to be concentrated in the communications, electricity, gas, and water sectors.
Over the longer term, improvements in the business climate should yield a more diversified
FDI structure. Long-run net FDI is projected to average around 6 percent of GDP.

31
II. External DSA
Baseline Scenario
The baseline scenario shows a sustainable position (Tables I.1 and I.2). The net present value
of external debt would gradually increase over the projection period from 34 percent of GDP
in 2009 to about 42 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting an increase in external borrowing,
before reversing and declining to 37.5 percent of GDP in 2015. The stock of external debt is
projected to drop further, reaching around 17 percent of GDP by 2030. The net present value
of external debt to exports plus remittances is projected at 117 percent in 2010, before
dropping steadily to reach 30 percent by 2030 (Table I.4). The external debt service to
revenue ratio is projected to increase from 6 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2013, and then
decrease to reach 4 percent in 2030. Under the baseline scenario, all the debt burden and
liquidity indicators remain below their indicative thresholds throughout the projection period.
PPG external debt is likely to remain manageable, despite the slight deterioration of the debt
indicators relative to the last DSA. The net present value of external PPG debt is expected to
rise from 29 percent of GDP in 2009 to 34 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting a gradual
increase in the share of the fiscal deficit financed by external sources in the medium term,
before reverting to about 13 percent in 2030. The net present value of public external debt in
percent of exports should fall from 183 percent in 2009 to 40 percent in 2030.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
The standard menu of alternative scenarios and bound tests indicates that Armenia’s external
debt outlook would be most adversely affected by depreciation and nondebt flow shocks
(Table I.3, Figure I.1). Under the extreme adverse scenario of a 30-percent depreciation of
the dram in 2011, the stress tests indicate that the PV of external debt to GDP plus
remittances ratio would increase from 28 percent in 2010 to 43 percent in 2012 and then
decrease to 16 percent in 2030. The second most adverse scenario of a negative FDI shock
would push the PV of external debt to GDP plus remittances ratio to 42 percent in 2012 and
back to 12 percent by 2030. Under the most extreme scenario of 30 percent depreciation, the
debt service to revenue ratio would increase from 6 percent in 2010 to 27 percent in 2013 and
come down to 6 percent by 2030.
Under all these standard alternative scenarios and bound tests, the external debt ratios remain
below the relevant thresholds, except when remittances are not included as a source of debt
repayment capacity. However, under some scenarios (export shock, FDI shock, or a
combination of real GDP shock and deflation in the United States), the debt-to-export ratio
crosses the 200 percent threshold over the medium term, underlining the external risks
related to the heavy borrowing by the government during the recent crisis. However, given
the relative size of remittances coming from migrants and the diaspora, Armenia is assessed
to be at low risk of external debt distress.

32
III. Public Sector DSA
Baseline Scenario
The baseline scenario shows a sustainable position (Tables I.1 and I.2). The net present value
of public sector debt would gradually increase over the projection period from about
33 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 40 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting the increase in
external borrowing. The stock of debt is then projected to gradually drop, reaching around
19 percent of GDP by 2030. The net present value of debt-to-revenue ratio would increase
from 13 percent in 2008 to 188 percent in 2011, before dropping again to about 72 percent by
2030. Taking into consideration the legal requirement in Armenia to keep public debt lower
than 50 percent of the previous year’s GDP, the indicators for public debt would remain at
comfortable levels throughout the projection period, and below their indicative thresholds.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
The standard menu of alternative scenarios and bound tests indicates that Armenia’s public
debt outlook would be most adversely affected by a lasting shock to economic growth (Table
I.4, Figure I.2). Under the extreme adverse growth scenario, stress tests indicate that public
debt ratios would follow a persistent upward trend through the projection horizon. The
second most extreme adverse scenario is a 30 percent depreciation in 2011, which would
push the net present value of debt to 55 percent in 2011 before slowly bringing it back to
31 percent by 2030. These two adverse scenarios also worsen Armenia’s liquidity situation,
putting the debt service to revenue ratio at 26 percent and 33 percent respectively in 2013
from 11 percent in 2010. This result reinforces the importance of maintaining prudent
financial policies and preserving macroeconomic stability in order to safeguard the debt
outlook. The implicit contingent liabilities of large infrastructure projects that are being
considered by the government should also be carefully analyzed.
IV. Debt Distress Classification and Conclusions
In the staffs’ view, Armenia should be considered at low level of debt distress, based on
external debt burden indicators. The public sector DSA suggests that Armenia’s overall
public sector debt dynamics are sustainable in light of the current size of the domestic debt
stock.
The rapid accumulation of public debt since the onset of the global crisis calls for pursuing
fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Public external debt was only about 14 percent of
GDP at end-2008, but reached 36 percent of GDP at end-2009, and is expected to peak at
more than 44 percent of GDP in 2012, before gradually declining over the medium term. The
projected debt-to-GDP levels do not appear excessive, and standard stress tests show that
Armenia’s public external debt remains sustainable. However, rollover risk is high, mainly
due to the short maturity of Fund financing with repurchase obligations during 2012–14.

33
Armenia’s debt dynamics are in line with the assessment made at the time of the request for
the EFF/ECF arrangement. Under the baseline scenario, the debt burden will temporarily
increase in the medium term as a result of significant financing contracted by the
government to counteract the effects of the economic crisis. While debt levels are
manageable under a strong policy scenario, the outlook is subject to risks, particularly if
remittances become volatile over the medium term. The standard bound tests show that
under certain scenarios, the debt-to-GDP ratio and the debt-to-exports ratio could go beyond
the threshold over the medium term, before receding gradually. The effect of a permanently
lower GDP growth shock is particularly pronounced.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); on-lending activities (especially in 2009); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For
projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
7/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Central government gross debt.
2/ Residuals include changes in gross foreign assets and valuation adjustments. For 2009, the large residual is mainly due to the on-lending activities. For projection also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.

Appendix II. Armenia: Assessment of the Real Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Staff’s current assessment, based on several methodologies, indicates that Armenia’s
real exchange rate is overvalued by 10−12 percent. The nominal effective exchange rate
(NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER) indices show that the dram has recently
appreciated, suggesting that the current overvaluation may be higher. Compared to major
trading partners and regional competitors, the dram showed the highest real appreciation
between December 2009 and July 2010.

Estimates using methodologies of the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
(CGER) suggest that while the dram is currently overvalued, it will return to its
equilibrium value in the medium term (2015), based on policies under the Fundsupported program. The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) Approach, which measures the
exchange rate needed to shift the underlying current account to its sustainable level, indicates
an overvaluation of about 15 percent in 2009, and based on staff current account projections,
predicts an overvaluation of 11 percent in 2010.1 The External Sustainability (ES)
Approach, which relates the equilibrium exchange rate to the gap between the current
account that stabilizes the net external position and the actual current account, suggests an
overvaluation of 27.5 and 20.1 percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively, based on current
account projections under the program.2 Estimates using the Equilibrium Real Exchange
Rate (ERER) Approach suggest an overvaluation of 10.9 percent at the end of 2009.3 The
1

The MB approach is based on the CGER methodology, but uses only emerging market economies in the crosscountry panel regression. The coefficients obtained from this regression are then applied to data for Armenia.
2

The net external position is extracted from Lane, P. and Milesi-Ferretti, G. (2007), “The External Wealth of
Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970-2004,” Journal of
International Economics, Vol. 73(2), pp. 223-250. Data for Armenia have been updated for 2008.

The ERER results presented here are derived from a single, country-specific model developed by Fund staff
from the Middle East and Central Asia Department (i.e., they are not drawn from the Fund-wide CGER panel).

42
ERER approach estimates the long-run statistical relationship between the real exchange rate
and its fundamentals, namely, the terms of trade, openness, government consumption and
investment, relative real per capita GDP, and the net international investment position. An
autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used to estimate a reduced form relationship
between the real effective exchange rate and selected fundamentals.

Estimates based on a cointegrated panel consisting of transition economies in Europe
and Central Asia also point to an overvaluation of around 10 percent. This approach,
which uses the same fundamentals as the ERER approach, allows heterogeneity among
countries in the short run while assuming homogeneity only in the long run.4 Its advantage
lies in its time and cross-section dimensions, which substantially improve inference. The
panel is estimated using common correlated effects estimators, which augment explanatory
variables by cross-section averages to capture the impact of common factors and thereby
yield consistent and asymptotically normal parameter estimates. Both the common correlated
effects mean group estimator (CCEMG) and the common correlated effects pooled (CCEP)
estimator are computed. They point to an overvaluation of the dram of 9.6 and 12.4 percent
at end-2009, respectively.

The CGER ERER panel does not include Armenian data, while productivity data used in the CGER regression
are not directly comparable to data available for Armenia, so that coefficients of the CGER ERER could not
easily be applied to Armenian data.

Four out of five estimators indicate that the dram is currently overvalued by 10–12
percent; these results are in line with estimates of the Central Bank of Armenia. Only
the results from the ES approach point to an overvaluation in the 20 percent range and thus
represent an outlier compared to the other four estimators. Real exchange rate estimates of
the CBA, which are based on an error correction model with remittances, capital inflows, and
government investment as long-run explanatory variables, also point to an exchange rate
overvaluation of 9−12 percent in mid-2010. As such and because of data limitations for the
ES approach (data on the net external position are not available after 2008), current
overvaluation of around 10–12 percent is viewed as the most reliable range.

Appendix III. Armenia: Tax Performance in Armenia and Its Peers
Armenia’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low relative to comparator countries (text figure).1 At
about 17 percent in 2008, Armenia’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low relative to that of its regional
peers, including those with lower per capita income (Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova,
Mongolia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan).2 This suggests that there is revenue potential that
remains to be tapped.

Weaknesses in taxes on income and on goods and services explain most of the gap
(Table III.1). Taxes on goods and services (goods tax) and taxes on income, profits, and
capital gains (income tax) contribute the main share of tax revenue in all countries.
Armenia’s performance with respect to both groups of taxes lags behind regional peers,
including countries with lower per capita income and noncommodity exporters. Armenia’s
weaknesses seem to be more prevalent in collecting income taxes (about 3 percentage points
of GDP) than taxes on goods and services (about 1 percentage point of GDP). Tax reform
should focus on both tax types, with particular emphasis on addressing weaknesses in income
tax collection.

The broader set of comparators include Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania,
Moldova, Mongolia, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. However, lack of data in some
cases limits the comparison to a subset of these countries.

In 2008, Georgia collected about 25 percent of GDP in tax revenues, including social contributions—which
was unified with the income tax starting 2008.

revenue productivity was 0.64 percent,
the highest efficiency recorded in the region, Armenia’s VAT revenue-to-GDP ratio would
have been 10.5 percent, more than 2 percentage points higher.
Despite their increasing share in tax revenues, revenue productivity of income taxes in
Armenia remains below that of other transition economies (Table III.3). A comparison of
corporate (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) productivity across transition economies
points to low productivity of income taxes in Armenia.3 This reflects policy gaps, such as tax
exemptions to the agriculture sector, tax incentives to large companies, and preferential tax
regimes for certain sectors (fuel and tobacco). Low productivity of income taxes could also
be attributed to compliance gaps, owing to weak tax administration and tax evasion,
including under-declaration of wages and employment.

1

Revenue productivity reflects the effectiveness or efficiency of revenue collection given the prevailing
standard tax rate. It measures how much revenue relative to the tax base each percentage point of the tax rate
provides. It is calculated by taking the actual revenue collected as a percentage of the tax base (=tax yield),
divided by the tax rate.

2

The estimated VAT revenue productivity uses consumption as the tax base. It also includes VAT tax credits,
and thus overstates the “actual” productivity. VAT revenue productivity, excluding VAT tax credits in 2008 is
0.33 percent, up from 0.27 in 2006.
3

The estimated revenue productivity for income taxes includes profit and income tax credits, and thus
overstates the “actual” productivity. CIT revenue productivity, excluding CIT tax credits in 2008 is
0.08 percent, down from 0.10 percent in 2006. PIT revenue productivity, excluding PIT tax credits in 2008 is
0.07 percent, up from 0.06 percent in 2006.

ATTACHMENT I. ARMENIA: LETTER OF INTENT

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Yerevan, November 11, 2010

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Armenia has exited the crisis, but the economic recovery is fragile and a swift
return to the high pre-crisis economic growth is unlikely. Thus far in 2010, growth has
been positive, and public finances have improved considerably. The financial sector
continues to be well capitalized and stable. Nonetheless, the economy faces considerable
headwinds, including weak external demand, important structural rigidities, and social
challenges. Sustained fiscal adjustment is needed, and in the financial sector, continued steps
are warranted to deepen intermediation, lower dollarization, and reduce vulnerabilities. At
the same time, we will aim at reducing external imbalances and enhancing competitiveness.
2.
Performance under our Extended Fund Facility and Extended Credit Facility
(EFF/ECF) programs has been very strong. The program is on track with all quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2010 as well as all indicative targets
for which data are available for end-September 2010 observed. The structural benchmarks
were also met, except for the benchmark on the establishment of the tax appeals board which
was met with a delay.
3.
This Letter of Intent (LOI) builds on the LOI and MEFP agreed between the
Armenian authorities and the Fund under the EFF/ECF arrangement approved on
June 28, 2010. Our near-term macroeconomic policies will continue to aim at balancing the
need to support the ongoing economic recovery and contain eventual macroeconomic
pressures. We remain committed to our reform program aimed at economic growth and
poverty reduction, fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing external imbalances, and
developing a sound financial system.
I.

Recent Developments and Outlook

4. The pace of economic recovery thus far in 2010 has been somewhat lower than
projected at the time of the program approval, while inflation is higher. GDP growth
was 3.1 percent in January−August 2010, driven by a recovery in services, industry, and
construction, offset in part by an unprecedented decline in agricultural output due to bad
weather conditions. Both trade and remittances have rebounded after a sharp decline last
year, but the current account deficit, while declining, remains high. Fiscal performance has

52
been strong in the first eight months of 2010 due to higher tax collections, including VAT
and social contributions, and restrained spending. After falling to 5.7 percent in June (yearon-year), consumer prices increased to 9.6 percent in August mainly driven by a surge in
food prices, notably for bread and fruit and vegetables. Banks remain well capitalized and
liquid, and credit to the economy is picking up, notably in foreign currency.
5. In the short term, the economic outlook remains subdued. Growth in Russia and
Europe—Armenia’s largest trade partners—is likely to be sluggish in the near term. Due to
the poor agricultural output and base effects from the resumption of growth in the last quarter
of 2009, GDP growth could be slower in 2010 than projected earlier. On this basis, and
mindful of downward risks, GDP is projected to grow at about 4 percent in 2010.
6. The medium-term outlook will continue to be challenging, and thus the pace of
growth is uncertain and the economy is unlikely to return to pre-crisis growth rates. We
expect GDP growth to rise to 4.6 percent in 2011, supported by strengthening domestic
demand and a recovery of the agriculture sector. However, with external demand and
remittances recovering only gradually, and FDI and private investment likely to remain
weak, growth is expected to stay at about 4−4½ percent over 2012−13. Inflation is expected
to revert to the CBA’s target band during the second half of 2011. Public debt is also
expected to drop to about 43½ percent of GDP by 2013 under the newly approved debt
management strategy and the medium-term expenditure framework. The current account
deficit is expected to be reduced considerably.
II. The Program for 2010 and 2011
A. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
7. As the economy recovers, we are gradually unwinding the fiscal stimulus to ensure
fiscal and debt sustainability. We remain committed to reducing our deficit to 4.8 percent
of GDP in 2010 followed by a further reduction in 2011 to 3.9 percent of GDP. This
reduction in the deficit is predicated on improvements in tax administration and limited
increases in spending. With the improving economic activity and renewed efforts to
strengthen tax administration, we expect the tax-to-GDP ratio to increase by about 0.5
percent per annum. During 2010−11, we will implement contingency measures if revenues
underperform relative to projections under the program, including by adjusting spending as
needed to achieve the deficit target. We will continue to adhere to our commitment to save at
least half of any tax revenue over-performance above the current projections reflected in the
EFF/ECF program. Over the medium term, given the need to free up some fiscal space
because of a sharp increase in public debt during the recent crisis, our fiscal policy will aim
at further reducing the deficit to about 2 percent of GDP by 2013.
8. In order to improve the transparency and planning of government operations, we
re-introduced our medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), suspended
temporarily during the crisis. The MTEF, approved in August of this year, is geared at

53
promoting growth, while placing public debt on a downward path and shifting spending
toward social programs and investment in key sectors. With the economic crisis over, we
intend to wind down our net lending program financed by the Russian loan, ensuring that
such programs support small and medium-sized enterprises and exports. In addition, we have
been consulting with our international partners on enhancing budgetary expenditure
framework and the efficiency of spending.
9. Our efforts to strengthen debt management have materialized in the adoption of a
new medium-term debt management strategy in July 2010. Under our program, we intend
to keep the public and publicly guaranteed debt stock at about 50 percent of GDP in
2010−11, and gradually reduce it over the medium term. We will also adhere to the average
concessionality target as agreed under the program by strictly limiting nonconcessional
borrowing to financially viable projects. We intend to strengthen our debt monitoring and
planning capacity. We have recently adopted a time-bound action plan to implement the debt
management strategy.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability under our inflation
targeting framework. We have kept our policy rate constant since May, communicating
clearly to the market that the recent shock to prices is temporary and exogenous and that
demand pressures remain subdued. We believe that second-round effects will not be large
and inflation will gradually decline to within the target band by mid-2011. Nonetheless, we
will continue monitoring price and output developments and adjust our monetary stance as
needed.
11. We remain committed to a floating exchange rate. Our interventions in the foreign
exchange market will continue to aim at smoothing large exchange rate movements, while
not resisting fundamental trends. We also aim to continue guarding international reserves as a
proven buffer from exogenous shocks. To avoid creating market perceptions of a return to
maintaining an exchange rate target level or range, we will communicate clearly and act
accordingly to ensure that market participants recognize the two-way risks in the foreign
exchange market.
12. We will continue to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. We are
striving to enhance the link between our policy rate and retail rates. To this end, we will
manage liquidity actively to keep market interest rates close to the policy rate and, thus,
advance the status of the policy rate as the market reference rate. To enhance further the
interest rate channel, we are also considering initiatives to develop the market for dram
instruments. We will standardize the pricing and settlement of treasury bills in line with
international practice and facilitate transactions in the securities market. The law on
mandatory third-party liability insurance passed in June 2010 and the law on private
investment funds—currently with parliament—are expected to promote market development.

54
13. We remain determined to reduce dollarization, given that it weakens the monetary
transmission mechanism. An earlier regulation requiring a quarter of banks’ reserves on
foreign currency deposits to be maintained in drams has widened interest rate spreads
between dram and foreign currency deposits. We have raised this proportion to one half in
September aiming to trigger a further shift in the composition of deposits. In addition, the
CBA and SRC are working on a plan to strengthen enforcement of foreign exchange
regulations which require the use of drams in certain transactions and for listing the prices of
goods and services. The draft law on restricting large cash transactions in the real sector is
currently being reviewed by the parliament. We acknowledge that successful dedollarization
will ultimately hinge on maintaining a track record of macroeconomic stability.
C. Financial Sector Stability and Development
14. We are committed to preserving the stability of the Armenian banking system and
are promoting reforms to enhance its resilience and increase the efficiency of financial
intermediation. Despite considerable improvement in recent years, private sector credit
reached only 20 percent of GDP and residents are hoarding cash, including in foreign
exchange. There is great scope for increasing financial access and deepening financial
intermediation which would help improve the traction of monetary policy. We intend to
undertake a full FSAP update in mid-2011, which would focus not only on financial stability
issues, but also analyze the impediments to credit growth and financial intermediation.
15. We continue our work on enhancing risk management and the supervisory
framework to limit vulnerabilities in the financial sector. Recent prudential regulations
have focused on ensuring proper management of foreign currency (FX) risk and FX-induced
credit risk. In August 2010, the limits on net open foreign exchange positions were made
symmetric at ±7 percent of bank capital. Prudential regulations on higher capital and
provisioning requirements on foreign currency loans were issued to become effective in
September 2010 and January 2011, respectively. In addition, we intend to require banks to
pay extra attention to FX-induced credit risk assessment. Furthermore, in line with the
Fund’s technical assistance recommendations, we envisage to enhance our supervisory
framework with a more forward-looking assessment of potential risks.
16. We continue strengthening our crisis preparedness and contingency planning. We
have formalized the Committee for Financial Stability through a memorandum of
understanding identifying actions and responsibilities of relevant institutions in various crisis
events (Structural benchmark, September 2010). We are drafting a regulation requiring banks
to set up their contingency plans for liquidity and solvency support (Structural benchmark,
December 2010). We envisage a comprehensive contingency plan that would include stress
tests designed by the banks themselves with an action plan on how to deal with these stress
scenarios.

55
III. Structural Reforms
D. Fiscal Reforms
17. Fiscal reforms, notably enhancing revenue management, continue to be a
centerpiece of our program commitments. Our efforts are primarily focused on ensuring
lasting improvements in tax administration, enhancing the integrity of the system, and
achieving efficiency gains, while providing incentives for taxpayers to comply. We set up a
tax appeals board under the government to deal with legal and procedural disputes of tax
payers (Structural benchmark, September 2010). In case of a difference of opinion between
the SRC and the appeals board, the decision of the Prime Minister will be binding and final
for the SRC. Moreover, a government decree was issued stipulating that clarifications and
interpretations of laws and legislative provisions on taxes, duties, and mandatory fees should
be agreed in advance with the Ministry of Finance. We are finalizing the development of
manuals in tourism, real estate, transport, and sectors using cash register machines for tax
audits for usage starting January 2011 (Structural benchmark, December 2010). However,
manuals for mining will be developed in 2011, as we continue to work with the World Bank
on revising the mining code. Furthermore, continued progress has been achieved in (i)
extending the e-filing system of tax returns to about 3,000 taxpayers, with all large taxpayers
currently reporting electronically, and (ii) improving the quality of taxpayer services,
including through the creation of a full scale taxpayer service center.
18. Looking ahead, further measures are envisaged to modernize tax administration to
enhance revenue collection and secure a sustainable revenue base. Consistent with the
earlier commitments for the near term we will:


Overhaul the VAT refund processing system. We will adopt a government decree
establishing a mechanism for implementing a fully functional risk management
approach in VAT refund processing (Structural benchmark, December 2010), and
ensure this approach is fully operational by June 2011 (Structural benchmark, June
2011).



Increase the number of large taxpayers (LTPs) by about 100 by December 2010 with a
view to ensuring that LTPs’ contribution in terms of total domestic revenues is
continuously increasing compared to the previous year.



Simplify the reporting system by reducing the frequency of reporting to tax authorities
and considerably streamlining tax forms for VAT, profit tax, and personal income tax
(Structural benchmark, December 2010).



Continue analyzing the systemic problems underlying the difficult issue of tax credits
and implement measures to reduce the stock of tax credits by December 2010.

56
19. Going forward, we will embark on a number of important reforms, including
(i) structural and staffing reforms in tax inspectorates; (ii) strengthening the analytical and
research capacity at the SRC and the Ministry of Finance; and (iii) launching a risk-based
system for selection of taxpayers for audit, and implementing a comprehensive planning
system for audits. We will develop a Three-Year Strategic Plan for Tax Administration
(2012−15), outlining further reforms.
20. We are stepping up our efforts in the tax policy area. In particular, the presumptive
taxation regime for petroleum products will be abolished and these products will be moved to
the regular taxation regime starting January 2011. Moreover, we will gradually increase the
presumptive payment for tobacco products with a view to harmonize the excise rates for
imported and domestic tobacco over the course of 2011−13. Furthermore, we are committed
to moving tobacco products from the presumptive to the regular taxation regime by 2014,
and have passed the law pertaining to these changes in October 2010. Finally, we have
submitted legislation to parliament to allow transfer of certain activities identified in the Law
on Presumptive Taxes to the general taxation system in September 2010.
21. We plan to introduce a funded pension pillar in 2014. The related legislative package
has passed the first reading at the parliament. We will ensure that realistic estimates for the
full costing of the reform plan are taken into account, including those associated with the
planned increase in basic pensions.
IV. Other Structural Reforms
22. We intend to update our Sustainable Development Program (SDP) by the time of
the second review of the EFF/ECF program. The updated SDP will serve as the basis for
our macroeconomic policy by providing an analytical background and ensuring a high
participatory process of the civil society in economic management.
23. Corruption remains a serious impediment to development and growth and a major
challenge for policy makers. In this area, we are committed to reversing the recent
deterioration noted by several international indicators. Notably, a draft law has been
submitted to parliament, which intends to address conflict of interest issues restricting public
officials from engaging in commercial activities. We aim to strengthen the capacity of the
competition commission in order to diminish monopolistic behavior in key sectors. We
intend to take measures to strengthen competition and further reduce barriers to entry for new
businesses, including a recent cabinet decree to create a one-stop shop for business
registration.
24. A number of reforms are planned under the umbrella of the recently-launched
negotiations for an EU Association Agreement with Armenia. We will revisit our
regulations and practices regarding standardization, certification, intellectual property rights,
competition rules, and public procurement procedures. The aim is to cut red tape and

57
promote private investment and exports by bringing the above procedures and regulations in
line with best international practice.
25. In the social policy area, we aim to reverse the recent increase in poverty and
improve access to social services. Our reform efforts to improve the quality of education
and health spending are expected to bear fruit through greater efficiency of spending. Also,
we aim to gradually increase allocations for health spending which remain in particular low
for Armenia’s income level. In addition, we will continue our efforts to better target our antipoverty programs, as well as increasing their coverage. In collaboration with the World
Bank, we will submit amendments to existing laws to enable the full functioning of an
integrated system for the provision of social protection services (Structural benchmark,
December 2011). We have also continued our progress toward achieving the Millennium
Development Goals, as indicated by lower maternal mortality rates as well as an increase in
life expectancy.
V. Conclusion
26. Given our strong program implementation, we request the completion of the first
review of the EFF/ECF program and the associated disbursement of SDR 36.2 million.
We also request modification of the end-December performance criteria for net international
reserves, net domestic assets, and the program fiscal balance. In addition, we request the
establishment of performance criteria for end-June 2011. We will maintain a close policy
dialogue with the Fund and stand ready to take additional measures, as appropriate, to ensure
the achievement of the government social and economic objectives under the EFF/ECF
program. We will continue to consult with the Fund on the adoption of measures, and in
advance of revisions of the policies contained in the LOI, in accordance with the Fund’s
policies on such consultation. We will also provide the Fund with information it requests for
monitoring progress during program implementation. The program’s quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, as per attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding and structural benchmarks are set out in Tables 1 and 2. We have cooperated
with the IMF to update the safeguards assessment. The second review is expected to be
completed on or after March 31, 2011 and will assess performance as of end-December 2010.
The third review is expected to be completed on or after September 30, 2011.

ATTACHMENT II. ARMENIA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Armenian authorities and
the IMF staff regarding the definition of performance criteria and indicative targets, their
adjusters, and data reporting requirements for the three-year EFF/ECF Arrangement as per
the Letter of Intent dated November 11, 2010 (LOI).
2.
For program monitoring purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities, and
flows in the monetary accounts will be evaluated at program exchange rates. The program
exchange rate of the Armenian dram to the U.S. dollar is set at dram 385 per one U.S. dollar.
The cross-rates for other foreign currencies are provided in Table 1.
I.

Quantitative Targets

3.
The program sets performance criteria and indicative targets for defined test dates
(see Table 1 in the November 2010 LOI ). The program sets the following performance
criteria:


Floor on the net official international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Armenia
(CBA);



Ceiling on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBA;



Ceiling on external public debt arrears (continuous); and



Floor on the program fiscal balance;

The program sets the following indicative targets:


Ceiling on reserve money;



Floor on average concessionality of new debt (quarterly on a disbursement basis); and



Floor on social spending of the government.

4.
The net official international reserves (stock) of the Central Bank of Armenia
(CBA) will be calculated as the difference between total gross official international reserves
and gross official reserve liabilities.


Gross official international reserves are defined as the CBA’s holdings of monetary
gold (excluding amounts pledged as collateral), holdings of Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs), including the August 28, 2009 General allocation and the September 9, 2009
Special allocation, the country’s reserve position at the IMF, and holdings of
convertible currencies in cash or in nonresident financial institutions (deposits,
securities, or other financial instruments). Gross reserves held in the form of

62
securities and other financial instruments are marked to market. Excluded from gross
reserves are the balance on the government’s Special Privatization Account (SPA),
capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions and illiquid foreign assets, any
assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, claims on residents,
claims in foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis
domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options), precious metals
other than gold, assets in nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid assets.


Official reserve liabilities shall be defined as the total outstanding liabilities of the
government and the CBA to the IMF and convertible currency liabilities of the CBA
to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year, as well as
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures,
forwards, swaps, and options).

NIR is monitored in U.S. dollars, and, for program monitoring purposes, assets and liabilities
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted into dollar-equivalent values using
the exchange rates as specified in Table 1.
5.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency issued, required and excess
reserves, and current and time deposit accounts of certain resident agents. Liquidity
absorbing transactions under reverse repurchase agreements, the CBA’s deposit facility,
foreign currency swaps, and securities issued by the CBA are excluded from the reserve
money definition. The ceiling will be considered as met if the outcome is within AMD 5
billion of the indicative target set in Table 1 attached to the Letter of Intent dated
November 11, 2010.
0F0F

6.
The net domestic assets are defined as reserve money minus NIR, minus reserve
money denominated in foreign currencies, plus medium and long-term liabilities (i.e.
liabilities with a maturity of one year or more) of the CBA, plus the balance of outstanding
Fund purchases credited to the government account at the CBA. NDA is composed of net
CBA credit to the general government; outstanding credit to domestic banks by the CBA
(including overdrafts) minus liabilities not included in reserve money and other items net.
External public debt arrears are defined as all unpaid debt-service obligations (i.e.,
payments of principal and interest) arising in respect of public sector loans contracted or
guaranteed, including unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these obligations
that are overdue beyond 30 days after the due date.1 The ceiling on external payment arrears
is set at zero.

1

The public sector is defined following the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS 2001) and System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). It includes the general government and nonfinancial public enterprises (as
defined in paragraph 11).

63
7.
The program fiscal balance is cumulative from the beginning of the fiscal year and
is measured from the financing side as the negative of the sum of net domestic banking
system credit to the central government, net domestic nonbank financing, and net external
financing to the central government (excluding net project financing). Should a general
subsidy be introduced off-budget, the overall balance will be measured including the subsidy
as part of government spending.


Net banking system credit to the central government equals the change during the
period of net credit to the central government.



Net nonbank financing equals the sum of: (1) the change during the period of
outstanding treasury bills and bonds to nonbanks (including accrued interest for
treasury bills and excluding accrued interest for treasury bonds); 2 (2) any other
disbursement or transaction that increases nonbanks’ claims on the central
government plus withdrawals from the special privatization account or the treasury
sub-account containing privatization proceeds in drams, less amortization paid by the
central government to private resident nonbank agents.
2F2F



Net external financing equals total debt-increasing disbursements from nonresidents to the central government (including Fund net purchases credited directly to
the government accounts at the CBA) less total amortization from the central
government to non-residents. All foreign currency-denominated transactions are
recorded in drams using the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

8.
Those project implementation units, which carry out projects financed by the U.S.based Lincy Foundation, or other budget-related project implementation units maintain
accounts at the CBA. The grants are recorded in the fiscal accounts as external grants on the
revenue side and as foreign-financed capital expenditure on the expenditure side. In addition,
any loans to finance investments and that are intermediated through the banking system are
recorded in the financial accounts as a financing item below the line and are thus excluded
from net lending.
9.
Foreign currency proceeds from selling enterprises are deposited into the Special
Privatization Account (SPA). The account is held at the CBA and the proceeds are invested
abroad together with the CBA’s international reserves. These proceeds are included in the
definition of the monetary accounts of the CBA as part of net foreign assets with a counter
entry in other items net. Any budgeted withdrawal from the SPA will be accounted for as
privatization proceeds used to finance the budget and will be recorded below the line. Any
unanticipated withdrawal from the SPA will be recorded below the line as privatization
2

Domestic nonbank holdings of treasury bills and treasury bonds are defined as total outstanding treasury bills
and bonds less holdings by the banking system and the State Fund for Social Insurance.

64
receipts; these withdrawals, however, will be replenished during the same fiscal year.
Domestic currency proceeds from selling enterprises to residents are deposited in a subaccount of the treasury single account.
10.
The program sets a floor of 30 percent on average concessionality of new debt on a
disbursement basis on debt with nonresidents with original maturities of one year or more
contracted and guaranteed by the public sector during the period 2010.


The monitoring of the average concessionality target is done on a disbursement-bydisbursement basis and consistent with the methodology used in the DSA to calculate
the original average concessionality target. In particular, the discount rate and the
exchange rates used in the DSA should be used for the monitoring.



The public sector comprises the general government, the central bank, and
nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the government
holds a controlling stake—typically owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but
which are not consolidated in the budget).



For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the
debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or
contractual obligation of the public sector to finance partially or in full any shortfall
incurred by the debtor.

11.
The program sets a floor on social spending of the government. For the purposes of
the program, social spending of the government is defined as 100 percent of the budgeted
amount of the family benefit program and lump-sum financial aid.
II. Adjustors
12.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the program are
subject to the following adjusters, calculated, where relevant, using program exchange rates:


Changes in reserve requirements: The ceiling on the NDA of the CBA and the
ceiling on reserve money will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of
banks’ reserves freed (seized) by any reduction (increase) of the reserve requirement
ratio on both domestic currency and foreign currency deposits relative to the baseline
assumption as per the following formula: ΔNDA = ΔrB, where B denotes the level of
the deposits subject to reserve requirements in the initial definition and Δr is the
change in the reserve requirement ratio.



KfW and World Bank loan disbursements: the ceiling on the NDA of the CBA
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount of any excess (shortfall) of
disbursements from the KfW and World Bank loans directed at SME financing

65
compared to programmed amounts (Table 2). The floor on NIR will be adjusted
upward (downward) by the cumulative amount of any excess (shortfall) of these
disbursements compared to program amounts.


Budget support grants to the public sector are defined as grants received by the
general government for direct budget support from external donors and not related to
project financing.



External financing to the public sector is defined as disbursements of loans from
bilateral and multilateral donors for budget support and Fund purchases credited
directly to the government accounts at the CBA, with the exception of the KfW and
World Bank disbursements mentioned above:



The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative amount of
any excess (shortfall) of external financing or EU grants in the form of budget support
(excluding Fund disbursements to the government) compared to program amounts
(Table 3). The floor on NIR will be adjusted downward for any external public debt
amortization amounts in excess of program amounts.



The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward by the amount of any excess of
external financing or EU grants in the form of budget support compared to program
amounts.



The floor on the program fiscal balance on a cash basis will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the cumulative total amount of the EU budget grants received in
excess (to account for a shortfall) of the program amounts (Table 3).

Guidelines on the Indicative Benchmark with Respect to
the Definition of External Debt

For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.
12274, Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the
principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number
of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, that is, advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and
(iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the
present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be
made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the
operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is
not considered debt under this definition (for example, payment on delivery) will not give
rise to debt.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s Safeguards Assessments policy, an update safeguards assessment of the CBA
was completed in November 2010 with respect to the current EFF/ECF arrangements. The
update assessment found that the CBA maintains a sound safeguards framework. The CBA’s
governance structure remains to be modernized to allow for more independent oversight, and a
longer-term appointment of the external auditors would also improve audit efficiency and
effectiveness.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
(a)

The de jure arrangement is “free floating.” The de facto arrangement was reclassified to
“floating” from a “stabilized arrangement” effective March 3, 2009. The official
exchange rate is quoted daily as a weighted average of the buying and selling rates in the
foreign exchange market.

(b)

Armenia maintains no exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

IX. Article IV Consultations
The 2008 Article IV consultation with Armenia was concluded on November 17, 2008.
Armenia is subject to a 24-month consultation cycle.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission assessed Armenia’s
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update
during February 16–March 4, 2005. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA)
report was discussed by the Executive Board on May 25, 2005.

ANNEX III. ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of October 10, 2010)
1.
As of October 10, 2010, the EBRD had approved 88 projects in Armenia in the
power, transport, agribusiness, municipal and infrastructure, manufacturing and services,
property, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Total commitments amounted to
EUR 409 million.
2.
There are four sovereign projects. First, the EBRD approved a sovereign-guaranteed
loan of EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal power plant in
March 1993, partly aimed at the eventual closure of Armenia’s nuclear plant in Medzamor.
The government was contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5 as the completion of
this plant was constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had funded technical
assistance for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and followed the privatization process.
The Hrazdan Thermal Power Complex was transferred to the Russian Federation in the
context of the debt-for-equity deal. Second, in November 1994, an agreement on a
EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in Zvartnots airport was signed under a
guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport was transferred to private management
in 2002 under a concession agreement. The new management has prepared a master plan for
the development of the airport, which is expected to generate further cargo traffic. In April
2007, the EBRD approved a EUR 7 million loan to the State Committee for Water Systems,
owner of the water and wastewater assets located in the small municipalities outside of
Yerevan. The loan has been used to improve wastewater treatment in five municipalities
located near Lake Sevan. In March 2010, EBRD signed a EUR 5 million sovereign loan with
Yerevan Metro Company, covering immediate rehabilitation needs, safety upgrades, and
energy efficiency.
3.
Most of the EBRD’s projects (96 percent) in Armenia are in the private sector. The
Bank committed EUR 85.2 million to Armenia in 2009 through 11 transactions, all in the
private sector. In addition to the loan to Electric Networks of Armenia (paragraph 7), the
Bank approved an additional loan to Zvartnots International Airport of EUR 29.6 million (to
be supplemented by investments from ADB and DEG). This project follows the successful
completion in May 2007 of the first phase of the Passenger Terminal, for which the Bank
provided a EUR 14.8 million loan together with DEG (USD 10 million). This project
involves the construction and purchase of equipment for the second phase of the Passenger
Terminal, with relocation of all arrivals and departures. The loan was a commercial facility
with no sovereign support. Other private sector finance includes smaller loans and equity
participation in a number of private companies. During January–October 2010, EBRD
approved 17 projects with total commitment of EUR 36.7 million. The portfolio for 2010
comprises 10 projects in the financial institutions sector, 4 in agribusiness, one in each of the
manufacturing and property sectors, and one sovereign project with Yerevan Metro
Company. Two of the loans to financial institutions are in local currency.

8
4.
In the banking sector, equity participation in the Commercial Bank of GreeceArmenia (EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999. Now there are four local banks where
the EBRD participates in equity: Armeconombank, Byblos Bank Armenia, Ararat Bank, and
Procredit Bank. The Bank also acquired an equity stake in an Armenian nonbank financial
intermediary—Cascade Insurance and Reinsurance Company, an insurance subsidiary of
Cascade Capital Holding.
5.
The Armenia Multi-Bank Framework Facility II (AMBFF II), established to provide
loans and equity to commercial banks and leasing companies, was approved in March 2006,
in an amount of USD 40 million. The facility was extended by a further USD 80 million in
November 2007. In late 2009, the EBRD approved a further USD 100 million extension to
AMBFF II, to support increased financial intermediation and the development of the
financial sector and to contribute to economic development by providing medium- to longterm funding to Armenian financial intermediaries. The Facility seeks to develop new
products for financial institutions, including provision of local currency loans.
6.
The EBRD has expanded its relationship with partner banks in Armenia from four to
twelve (two EBRD partner banks—Ameria and Cascade will merge in 2010). Nine banks
were provided with new credit facilities under the AMBFF. In 2010, EBRD has extended its
portfolio under AMBFF by three more banks (Byblos, ArmSwiss, and Ameria ). One
institution (Armeconombank) was provided with a mortgage facility, and the first leasing
facility in Armenia was signed with ACBA Leasing in 2008 for EUR 5.9 million. Cofinancing with six local banks was extended, resulting in 14 sub-loans to Armenian
corporates. By means of co-financing lines, the Bank has entered new sectors such as
healthcare and telecommunications, in addition to significantly expanding its portfolio of
agribusiness loans. A Trade Facilitation Program to facilitate access of Armenian banks to
trade financing was also made available to nine banks.
7.
Supporting development of renewable energy was another core activity of the Bank.
The EBRD has joined forces with the World Bank, USAID, and Cascade Credit to launch the
Armenian Renewable Energy Program (AREP). The Bank’s participation took the form of a
loan to Cascade Credit. The Bank also continued to finance renewable energy projects on its
own through a Direct Lending Facility, with two projects signed. In addition to renewable
energy, the Bank has sought to support post-privatization development of the energy sector
with a loan to the privately-owned power distribution company. In April 2009, the EBRD
signed a EUR 42 million loan with Electric Networks of Armenia to upgrade and modernize
infrastructure and improve efficiency.
8.
The EBRD launched Turn Around Management (TAM) and Business Advisory
Service programs in Armenia in 2003, originally funded by the EU-Tacis program and now
funded from the ETC Fund, to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Since
2003, BAS has completed 726 projects in an amount of EUR 2.7 million, while TAM
delivered more than 20 projects.

9
9.
Projects identified by the Bank for future development are well diversified across
sectors and include several relatively large transactions. New business opportunities are
offered by the country’s infrastructure sector, including in public transportation, water,
sanitation, and solid waste treatment. The Bank is about to launch a USD 25 million program
to finance projects for industrial energy efficiency and renewable energy through local banks.
10.
As part of inspection reform and doing business programs, the EBRD is assisting the
Government of Armenia to improve the business environment. The EBRD is promoting and
supporting preparation of a corporate governance code along with the Ministry of Economy,
the Central Bank, the Stock Exchange, and the IFC. The Bank is also providing assistance to
the Public Services Regulatory Commission for telecommunications sector regulation.
11.
The EBRD’s current country strategy was approved in May 2009. Key priorities for
the coming years are: (i) the financial sector; (ii) the enterprise sector, particularly SME and
micro-enterprises financing through credit lines to Armenian banks or direct loans and equity
investments; (iii) infrastructure investments in alternative energy sources and municipal
projects; and (iv) policy dialogue with the government, other multilateral and bilateral
donors, and other stakeholders.

10
ANNEX IV. ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
(As of mid-October 2010)
1.
As of mid-October 2010, ADB had approved 5 projects in the transport, municipal
infrastructure, and general budget support sectors. Total commitments amounted to USD 224
million.
2.
All approved projects are sovereign. The first project is a Rural Roads Rehabilitation
Sector Loan (USD 30.6 million) for rehabilitation of 220 km of rural roads approved in
November 2007. The second is a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Loan (USD 36 million)
for repair and replacement of the water supply infrastructure in small towns and villages
approved in December 2007. The third project is a Supplementary Loan (USD 17.3 million)
to the Rural Roads Rehabilitation Project approved in November 2008, to finance an increase
in project cost from higher construction materials prices, domestic inflation, and appreciation
of the dram. The fourth is the Crisis Recovery Support Program Loan (USD 80 million)
approved in July 2009, to protect budgetary social expenditures. And last is the first tranche
(USD 60 million) of the North-South Road Corridor Investment Project approved in October
2009 for rehabilitation of 18.4 km of the four-lane Yerevan-Ashtarak highway and safety
enhancement of a four-lane road between Yerevan and Ararat. All approved loans are from
the ADB concessional window under the Asian Development Fund (ADF). ADB has not
provided loans to Armenia from its nonconcessional window under the Ordinary Capital
Resources (OCR).
3.
In addition to loan projects, the ADB is also involved in non-lending operations,
mostly Advisory and Capacity Development Technical Assistance. This is mostly researchoriented: a Transport Sector Development Strategy for 2009−19 (transport sector road map
for 10 years); and Institutional Modernization to Improve the Business Environment
(assisting the government with the introduction of online business registry system). The
advisory technical assistance may lead to loan projects. The first tranche of the Armenian
Urban Infrastructure Sustainable Development Program is an example where the project
concept came from the Armenia Transport Strategy. The program will support the Yerevan
west bypass road and provision of better access to the Yerevan metro.
4.
To increase efficiency and long-term cooperation, the ADB has offered a new
instrument: project funding under the Multi Finance Facility (MFF). The MFF allows
approval of long-term sector assistance to be disbursed in tranches. Under the MFF, the ADB
has approved USD 500 million for the North-South Road Corridor Investment Program. The
funds will be available for 7 years, and the country would request them in tranches, with the
first USD 60 million tranche already approved. The Armenia Urban Infrastructure
Sustainable Development program is under preparation as an MFF–type project, with an
indicative amount of up to USD 500 million.

11
5.
The ADB’s economic report and the interim operational strategy for 2006−09 for
Armenia were approved in 2006. The Country Operational Business Plan for 2008−10 was
approved in 2007. In third quarter of 2011, the Bank is planning to prepare the Armenia
Country Partnership Strategy for 5 years. The key priorities for the coming years are:
(i) transport infrastructure; (ii) urban development; (iii) regional development; (iv) private
sector development, particularly banking, finance, renewable energy, and transport; and
(v) policy dialogue with the government, other multilateral and bilateral donors, and other
stakeholders on country development prospects and reforms.

12
ANNEX V. ARMENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Further
improvements in real, fiscal, and external sector statistics would be desirable to facilitate
enhanced design and monitoring of economic policies. The overall quality, timeliness, and
coverage of macroeconomic statistics have improved significantly over the past few years.
The Fund has substantially facilitated this process through technical assistance from the
Statistics Department, the Fiscal Affairs Department, and the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department. In November 2003, Armenia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). An April 2008 data ROSC mission prepared a detailed evaluation of the
quality of the macroeconomic statistics. A multi-topic statistics mission visited Yerevan in
February 2010 to review progress with implementation of past recommendations and follow
up on outstanding issues in national accounts, balance of payments, and monetary and
financial statistics. A follow up STA mission in September 2010 provided further guidance,
focusing on improving the accuracy of annual and quarterly GDP estimates.
Real sector statistics
2.
The National Statistics Service (NSS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly
national accounts. In addition, a cumulative monthly GDP by production approach is
compiled and disseminated 20 days after the end of each month. The NSS also compiles and
disseminates annually a full set of accounts (up to financial accounts) for the total economy
and by institutional sectors. The NSS is developing a plan for implementing the System of
National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA).
3.
The accuracy of the annual estimates is undermined by the lack of exhaustive source
data for informal activities and of appropriate price and volume indicators, particularly for
construction activities. Construction output volume measures are derived by deflating current
values with a price index for output, which uses weights and base year prices from a survey
in 1984. To improve volume measures of construction, the NSS should start compiling a new
construction output price index based on more sound methodology. Until the new
construction price index becomes available, the NSS should use other indicators for deriving
construction aggregates at constant prices. The NSS should also implement new surveys to
derive a proper benchmark for informal activities.
4.
The NSS compiles discrete quarterly GDP estimates by production and by
expenditure approaches at current and at constant prices. The production-side estimates at
current prices are derived partially from cumulative source data (from business statistics
surveys) and partially from discrete data sources. The NSS validates and reconciles data from
different sources, but the underlying problems associated with de-cumulating the cumulative
output data distort the quarterly pattern. The NSS compiles and disseminates two sets of
quarterly GDP volume measures—one at the prices of corresponding quarter of the previous
year and the other at average prices of 2005. The first set does not constitute a time series

13
since it does not allow a comparison of different periods. A multitopic IMF statistics
technical assistance mission in January 2010 suggested that the NSS discontinue compiling
these data. The compilation procedures for the second set (volume measures at average prices
of 2005) need to be improved. The January 2010 mission also suggested that the NSS
compile only one set of quarterly GDP estimates—quarterly GDP at previous-year average
prices—and derive time series through chain-linking. These estimates would be conceptually
consistent with the annual data. They would also allow comparisons between different
periods, which is essential for analysis of business cycle.
5.
The CPI covers 11 large population centers and Yerevan. Since January 2006, the
CPI has been computed using 2005 weights. Concepts and definitions used in the
compilation of the CPI are broadly in line with international standards; source data and
compilation techniques are generally adequate. The NSS compiles a ten-day and a monthly
CPI. The ten-day index and the monthly index are disseminated jointly. The February 2009
ROSC mission recommended development of an approach to include household expenditure
on owner-occupied dwellings in the CPI calculations.
Government finance statistics
6.
The budget execution reporting system compiles government finance data on a cash
basis, supplemented with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and
payables. Daily revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government are available
with a lag of one to two days. The ministry of finance (MoF) is undertaking a comprehensive
reform of the treasury system, including the introduction of an internal auditing system in
line ministries and their respective budgetary institutions. A treasury single account (TSA)
was introduced in 1996, and all bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were closed,
except for project implementation units that are required by donors to operate with
commercial bank accounts. Starting in 2002, some budgetary institutions have been
converted into “noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units have been taken out of
the treasury system and have their own bank accounts, but since 2003 report data on cash
flows and balances to the MoF. The February 2009 ROSC report recommended including
NCOs in the government finance statistics data published on national websites. These
exceptions notwithstanding, all government receipts and payments are processed through the
TSA, although there are still shortcomings on the timeliness and quality of data on the
operations of local governments. Classification of government transactions by function and
economic category are generally in line with the Manual on Government Finance Statistics
1986, and monthly data on central government operations are disseminated one month after
the reporting period.
7.
The budget presentation and the classification of items under the economic and
functional classification of expenditures need to be made more transparent; for instance, the
data have been subject to frequent reclassification, and wages for military personnel are
reported in the category of “other” goods and services rather than as a wage item. The

14
February 2009 ROSC report recommended using market value rather than face value for
financial assets other than loans, and for nonfinancial assets. The reconciliation of central
government with general government operations is done by the NSS in cooperation with the
MoF.
8.
Since 2008, government finance statistics meet the classification requirements of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for central government. Plans for
improvement of the MoF envisage further progress in the next two years in implementing the
GFSM 2001 classification for local government in 2009 and in accrual recording for all units of
general government in 2010.
Monetary and financial statistics
9.
Monetary and financial statistics are provided on a timely basis. Data on the accounts
of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) are provided daily with a one-day lag, while monthly
data on the monetary survey are provided with a three-week lag (and preliminary weekly data
with a one-week lag). The balance sheets of the CBA and of the deposit money banks follow
IAS methodology. Monthly interest rate data are provided with an one-week lag.
10.
Responding to an IMF STA request, the CBA has compiled and submitted a complete
set of monetary data beginning from December 2001 using Standardized Report Forms
(SRF). STA validated the resulting monetary aggregates, and the data have been published
since the December 2006 issue of IFS Supplement and are used to update IFS. An Integrated
Monetary Database (IMD) has also been established by STA to share the SRF data with the
IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department.
External sector statistics
11.
In 2009, the Armenian authorities decided to transfer the responsibility for compiling
the balance of payments, international investment position (IIP), and external debt statistics
from the NSS to the CBA. The NSS and CBA agreed on a target date for transfer beginning
with data for the first quarter of 2011. The February 2010 mission agreed with the authorities
on an action plan aimed at ensuring a smooth institutional transfer of responsibility, as well
as consistency and continuity in the production of the external sector statistics. A follow up
mission is scheduled for early 2011.
12.
The coverage of external sector data has improved in recent years. Trade statistics are
provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin, destination, and commodity are
generally available within a month. Price data for exports and imports are less readily
available. Quarterly balance of payments statistics are generally available with a three-month
lag. However, on remittances, which account for a significant part of the inflows, there are
considerable discrepancies among available source data. Remittance data obtained from
surveys are considerably lower than data obtained through the money transfer system. The
NSS and CBA are working on establishing a compilation program that would enable

15
improved measurement of remittances. The absence of a comprehensive, continuously
updated business register hampers the coverage of transactions and institutional units; in
particular, the coverage of the financial account items for the private nonbank sector.
13.
Quarterly data on international investment position are published by the NSS within
one quarter after the reference period, and the annual data within two quarters; and are also
provided for publication in IFS.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation for the
Republic of Armenia
On December 1, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Armenia on a lapse of time
basis.2
Background
The global financial crisis brought to an end a long period of high, but unsustainable growth.
Large remittances were funneled to construction and contributed to double-digit growth during
2000–07. These contracted during the crisis, along with exports and Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), so that the external current account deficit increased sharply and output declined
abruptly, by over 14 percent in 2009. A postponement of exchange rate adjustment led to a
crisis of confidence, and a sharp fall in fiscal revenues added to concerns. The authorities’
strong policy response, supported by the international community, helped alleviate the impact
of the crisis and restore confidence, albeit at the cost of a substantial increase of public debt.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

This year’s Article IV consultation was concluded on a lapse of time basis. Under the Fund’s lapse
of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.

2
Recovery is underway in Armenia in 2010, but the pace is slow. As the external environment
has improved, industry and services are rebounding, but agriculture has been hit hard by
adverse weather. With a rebound of agriculture, output is expected to grow by 4 percent in
2010, slower than the 6½ percent pace registered in the first half of the year, and by 4½
percent next year. The contraction of agricultural output and a rise in imported wheat prices
have translated into higher food prices. Comprising nearly half of the weight of the consumer
price index, higher food prices have pushed annual inflation over 9 percent in recent months.
However, as food price shocks recede, inflation should decline to 7 percent by end-2010, and
with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies in place, to the central bank’s target of
4±1.5 percent during the second half of 2011.
As the economy recovers, the authorities’ focus is shifting to medium-term challenges,
including restoring strong growth—from new sources—and reducing poverty, ensuring fiscal
and debt sustainability, and maintaining financial sector stability. Post-crisis policies include
fiscal consolidation, increased exchange rate flexibility, continued commitment to price
stability, strengthening the banking sector, and stepping up structural reforms.
Fiscal consolidation has proceeded in 2010. The crisis took a toll on public finances, with the
overall deficit rising to 8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year. Fiscal
performance has improved markedly in 2010, with tax collection increasing by 20 percent in
the first eight months of the year, reflecting the rebound of activity, spending restraint, and
progress in tax administration reforms. The fiscal adjustment is frontloaded, with the deficit
targeted to come down by over 3 percentage points in 2010 and by a further 1 percentage
point in 2011 and 2012. This will reduce public debt, which should peak at just below
50 percent of GDP in 2011, compared with 16 percent before the crisis. To protect social
spending, the authorities are increasing the efficiency of health and education spending and
improving the targeting and coverage of anti-poverty programs.
The authorities are committed to greater exchange rate flexibility, restricting interventions in
the foreign exchange market to smoothing volatility and rebuilding reserves. Reflecting
seasonal trends and external borrowing by domestic banks, the nominal exchange rate has
appreciated by 10 percent since March. Limited foreign exchange purchases have helped
rebuild reserves and stemmed a loss of competitiveness.
Monetary policy remains focused on price stability in an environment of higher dollarization,
and efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy continue. Liquidity conditions
have eased with the central bank’s foreign exchange purchases, and as the recent price
pressures are mainly supply-driven, the central bank has kept the policy rate unchanged since
May.
The banking sector remains stable, and credit has picked up in recent months, although mainly
in foreign exchange. Prudential measures have focused on ensuring proper management of
foreign exchange risks, by increasing capital and provisioning requirements. Nonperforming
loans have declined from a peak of more than 10 percent last year to less than 5 percent at
present.

3

The authorities are pursuing structural reforms to improve competitiveness and raise
Armenia’s growth potential. These include strengthening the competition framework, further
reducing barriers to entry for new businesses, and improving governance by addressing
conflicts of interest of public officials. Measures to improve tax administration are also part of
efforts to strengthen the business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation for the Republic of Armenia, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff appraisal, as follows:
The Armenian economy suffered a major setback during the global crisis with output
contracting by more than 14 percent in 2009. The swift policy response of the authorities, with
the assistance of the international community, rightly shifted to a countercyclical mode,
dampening the impact of the crisis, especially on the most vulnerable segments of the
population.
Armenia is on the right trajectory as it exits the crisis. Recent macroeconomic developments
are encouraging, despite some—largely supply driven—inflationary pressures. Fiscal
consolidation is moving forward, while the monetary policy stance remains neutral. Structural
reforms have also progressed, but need to proceed faster to raise the growth potential of the
economy.
Over the medium term, Armenia faces several challenges precipitated by the crisis. The
external environment is difficult, and external imbalances must to be tackled expeditiously to
avoid a disorderly adjustment. Decisive fiscal consolidation is needed to preserve debt
sustainability and support medium-term external adjustment. Broader reforms are essential to
promote growth and poverty reduction, namely, to address significant weaknesses in tax
administration and the business environment, strengthen financial stability, and deepen
financial intermediation.
The government’s fiscal policy strategy appropriately addresses the medium-term fiscal and
debt vulnerabilities. With the economy gradually recovering, the fiscal stimulus is being
gradually withdrawn. The budget deficit is projected to decline by 3 percent of GDP in 2010
and by a further 1 percent of GDP in 2011. The focus of consolidation is appropriately on
enhancing revenue collection, rather than expenditure compression that could hurt spending
on important sectors—education and health—as well as the poor. With these policies, the
fiscal deficit is projected to fall to about 2 percent of GDP in the medium term, which will
ensure that public debt remains sustainable. The MTEF and the new debt management
strategy should substantially contribute to sound public finances.
The CBA’s monetary policy response since the crisis has been appropriate. The move to a
more flexible exchange rate, the gradual lowering of the policy rate during the crisis, and its
gradual increase as the recovery started were steps in the right direction. In the near term,

4
monetary policy should continue to remain vigilant, increasing the policy rate if demand
pressures or second-round effects from food price shocks arise. The CBA should continue to
improve its communications to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored around the
inflation target. Planned dedollarization efforts could facilitate the monetary transmission
mechanism, but sustained and sound macroeconomic policies are essential to reduce
dollarization.
The increased flexibility of the exchange rate is serving Armenia well. The authorities’
commitment to maintaining a flexible exchange rate is welcome. The CBA intervention policy
should continue to aim at only smoothing sharp fluctuations in the market, while guarding
foreign exchange reserves and ensuring that the economy remains competitive. Any
appreciation bias in the interventions will further contribute to a misalignment of the exchange
rate with the equilibrium rate and delay external adjustment.
Armenia’s banking sector remains sound and proved resilient to the global shocks. After rising
in the first half of 2009, NPLs came down and have remained at low levels throughout 2010.
Staff is encouraged by the recent pick up in lending to the private sector. It is essential that the
authorities continue to implement measures to preserve financial stability, including
strengthening the supervision framework, tightening foreign exchange-related prudential
regulations, and improving crisis preparedness and contingency planning.
Further improvements in tax administration will be needed to support fiscal consolidation and
achieve stronger growth. While the government’s commitment to reforming the tax
administration is welcome, efforts to strengthen tax administration and advance tax policy
reforms have had mixed success, in part reflecting political economy constraints. The recent
actions are a step in the right direction, but decisive implementation in line with international
best practices will be crucial to realize gains.
Structural reforms will be essential if Armenia is to enhance its competitiveness and raise its
growth potential. Bolder and deeper reforms are needed to improve governance, enhance
competition, diminish monopolistic behavior, diversify exports, and more generally, modernize
the economy. Measures to address conflicts of interest of public officials, strengthen the
competition framework, and reduce barriers to entry by firms are welcome and should be
followed by further trade reforms.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under EFF/ECF Arrangement for Armenia
and Approves US$57.6 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed its first review of
Armenia’s economic performance under a program supported by the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) and the Extended Credit Facility arrangement (ECF).1 The Board's decision was taken on
a lapse of time basis2.
The decision enables the authorities to draw an additional SDR 39.0 million (US$57.6 million),
bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 78.1 million
(US$115.2 million).
The three-year SDR 266.8 million (about US$393.9 million) EFF and ECF arrangement with
Armenia was approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on June 28, 2010 (see Press Release No.
10/263).

1

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) as the Fund’s
main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by providing a higher level of access to
financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in program design features, and more focused streamlined
conditionality. Financing under the ECF carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5½ years, and a final
maturity of 10 years (http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/ecf.htm). The Fund reviews the level of interest rates
for all concessional facilities every two years.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.
