EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and recent economic developments
•

The Gambia is requesting a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement in the amount of SDR 20.22 million (65 percent of quota). The
staff report also covers the 2002 Article IV consultation discussions.

•

Economic performance during 2001 was mixed. Despite robust real GDP growth,
moderate inflation, and progress in the settlement of the property dispute with
Alimenta (a Swiss groundnut marketing company) and with the PRSP process, there
were budgetary slippages and delays in implementing some reforms. Presidential,
national assembly, and local elections were conducted in late 2001 and early 2002,
and the PRSP was forwarded to the Fund and World Bank in May 2002.

•

Real GDP grew by 6 percent in 2001, while inflation was 4½ percent, owing to good
agricultural performance. The external current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) widened to 14.8 percent of GDP from 12.1 percent in 2000, mainly
reflecting the onetime importation of electricity generators. The fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) increased to 8¾ percent of GDP from 3½ percent in 2000, owing
to shortfalls in customs revenue and one-off expenditures for the settlement of the
Alimenta property dispute, on-lending to a public enterprise, and election-related
expenditure overruns. Broad money growth, which had accelerated to 35 percent in
2000, moderated to 19.4 percent in 2001, with measures taken to mop up banks’
excess reserves. However, increased government domestic borrowing raised the stock
of domestic debt to about 34 percent of GDP.

•

The first quarter of 2002 was dominated by further expansionary fiscal policies.
While revenues were broadly on target, there were expenditure overruns of about
2 percent of GDP as elections-related outlays continued. Net government credit
expansion was moderated by project disbursements. Delays in receipts of groundnut
exports and border controls that impeded the reexport trade exerted pressure on the
dalasi, which depreciated by 5 percent against the U.S. dollar.

Macroeconomic framework for 2002–05
•

Consistent with the PRSP, the key medium-term macroeconomic objectives
include: annual real GDP growth of about 6 percent; average inflation of about
3¾ percent per annum; an external current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) of 10 percent of GDP by 2005; and gross external reserves of about
5¼ months of imports of goods and services. The overall budget deficit (excluding
grants) is expected to decline to 5 percent in 2002 and about 2 percent by 2005.

•

Structural reforms aim at promoting broad-based economic growth in a lowinflation environment, and at contributing to a durable reduction in poverty,

-4-

consistent with the PRSP. Fiscal policy focuses on improving tax administration and
reorienting expenditure to social sectors and infrastructure development in order to
underpin a tight monetary policy, with adequate provision of private sector credit.
•

Prior actions under the program comprise (a) a Central Bank of The Gambia board
resolution in support of the reforms recommended by the December 2001 Fund
technical mission; (b) initiation of a review of the Central Bank Act; and (c) an audit
of the 2001 operations of the Customs and Excise Department.

•

Measures to contain expansionary fiscal policies include improved tax
administration to curtail exemptions, collect arrears, and close loopholes, together
with strict controls on expenditure from the below-the-line accounts and the slowing
down of certain projects. The nonrecurring expenditure from 2001 would also be a
factor in containing the deficit.

Issues highlighted in the staff appraisal
•

The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to address the fiscal slippages, which need
to be complemented by broad reforms to strengthen the tax and budget systems.

•

In the monetary area, the envisaged broad-based reforms should emphasize the
expanded use of indirect policy instruments and enhanced supervision of institutions,
taking advantage of Fund technical assistance. The consolidation and broadening of
other structural reforms remains key to stimulating private sector activity, including
measures to improve business legislation, the regulation of public enterprises, and the
privatization process. The former Alimenta assets should be sold to competing firms
as part of other reforms in the groundnut sector.

•

The staff welcomes the PRSP, which has provided the essential building blocks for
the PRGF-supported program. The authorities are encouraged to strengthen the means
to solicit the views of the poor, including through the governance program. The staff
welcomes the efforts taken to strengthen the implementation of broad-based structural
reforms, partly through better coordination of donor technical assistance, to which the
Fund is contributing via the Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP).

•

Notwithstanding the progress that has been made in improving economic and
financial data, the staff urges the authorities to continue their efforts to enhance the
timeliness and quality of data, especially in the national accounts and prices, and the
fiscal and external sectors.

•

On the basis of a number of positive economic and financial developments, the
authorities’ efforts to address the slippages that emerged, their adoption of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework for 2002–05, and the implementation of prior
actions, the staff recommends that the Executive Board approve The Gambia’s
request for a new three-year PRGF arrangement.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Discussions for the 2002 Article IV consultation and the authorities’ request for an
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held in Banjul
during the period January 30–February 14 and April 25–May 8 2002.1 The Executive Board
approved The Gambia’s request for a three-year PRGF arrangement on June 29, 1998 in an
amount equivalent to SDR 20.6 million (66.5 percent of quota), together with the first annual
arrangement there under (SDR 3.4 million). However, the first review under the first annual
PRGF arrangement could not be completed because of slippages in implementing the budget
and structural reforms, as well as governance problems arising from the government’s
seizure of the property of the Gambia Groundnut Corporation—owned by Alimenta, a Swiss
groundnut-marketing company. Performance under the second and third annual PRGF
arrangements was satisfactory; the Board granted waivers for the nonobservance of
quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2000 (three), end-March 2001 (four), and
end-September 2001 (one). The authorities met all of the end-September 2000 quantitative
performance criteria. The Gambia drew fully the resources available under the three-year
arrangement.2
2.
On July 13, 2001, the Executive Board concluded the most recent Article IV
consultation with The Gambia. Directors, while commending the authorities for achieving
robust real GDP growth, low inflation, and progress in the poverty reduction strategy paper
(PRSP) process, noted that economic performance under the program had been mixed. They
expressed concern about slippages in fiscal policy, stressed the need for corrective measures
and reforms, and urged the authorities to implement the governance program on a timely
basis.

1

The Gambian representatives included the Hon. F. Jatta, Secretary of State for Finance and
Economic Affairs; Mr. M. Bajo, Governor of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG); other
secretaries of state; and senior public officials. Vice President Isatou Njie-Saidy received the
second mission. Discussions were also held with representatives of the donor community and
the private sector. Participants in the missions comprised Mr. Kibuka (Head), Mr. Tjirongo,
Mr. Haacker (all AFR), and Ms. Al-Mashat (EP, PDR). Mr. Haley (Research Assistant) and
Ms. Kabia (Assistant) (both AFR) were also part of the first mission while Mr. Christensen
(OTM) and Ms. Silman (Assistant, AFR) participated in the second mission. The two
missions overlapped with World Bank missions.

2

The Executive Board discussed the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC Initiative) decision point document (www.imf.org), the interim poverty reduction
strategy paper (I-PRSP) (www.imf.org), and the joint staff assessment (JSA) of the I-PRSP
(www.imf.org) in December 2000. It discussed the PRSP preparation status report
(www.imf.org) and the associated JSA (www.imf.org) in December 2001.

3.
In the attached letter to the Managing Director, dated June 25, 2002 (Appendix I), the
government of The Gambia requests a new three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an
amount equivalent to SDR 20.22 million (65 percent of quota). The requested arrangement is
in support of policies and measures outlined in the attached memorandum of economic and
financial policies (MEFP) for 2002/03 (April-March) and the full PRSP (www.imf.org). If
the full amount under the three-year PRGF arrangement is disbursed, and taking into account
scheduled repayments, The Gambia’s use of Fund resources would rise from 66.3 percent of
quota at end-2001 to 124.6 percent of quota at end-2005 (Tables 1 and 2).
4.
In 1993, The Gambia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3,
and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The Gambia maintains an exchange system that is
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. Summaries of The
Gambia’s relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group are contained in Appendices III
and IV, respectively. Outstanding statistical issues are discussed in Appendix V.
II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Under the PRGF arrangement (1998–2001), The Gambia overall registered
significant gains on the macroeconomic and structural policy fronts although performance
was somewhat uneven, especially towards the latter part of the program period. A recovery in
real GDP growth, led by improved agricultural performance, including in the key groundnut
sector, helped reduce inflation (see table below). There was considerable fiscal and external
sector adjustment, and exports and imports recovered significantly. However, broad money
growth was erratic, partly reflecting efforts to finance the marketing of groundnuts following
the disruption occasioned by the seizure of the Alimenta property.
6.
The authorities implemented a number of structural reforms, inter alia, to
strengthen the budget process, including measures to improve the reporting and control of
expenditure and to close the public accounts for 1991/92–993. They further reduced external
tariffs, lowering in 2000 the top rate from 90 percent in 1998 to 18 percent, and the number
of the tariff bands from over 30 to 3. In the financial sector, the remaining controls on
interest rates were lifted, longer-term treasury bills and foreign currency deposits were
introduced, and the Trust Bank was privatized. Parliament enacted legislation to encourage
private sector activities, including via the establishment of a regulatory and privatization
framework and supporting institutions. There was also a renewed emphasis, with support
from donors, on implementing agricultural marketing reforms and providing extension
services, improved inputs, and access to credit for farmers.

7.
Economic performance during 2001 was mixed.4 Real GDP grew by 6 percent,
underpinned by the strong performance of the agriculture, tourism, and construction sectors
(Tables 3 and 4). Moreover, average annual inflation (based on the consumer price index
for low-income households in the greater Banjul area) edged up to 4½ percent, driven by
higher imported inflation (via the depreciation of the dalasi) and expansionary fiscal policies.
Notable progress was achieved in the settlement of the property dispute with Alimenta (the
last payment of US$5 million was effected in August 2001) and with the PRSP process.
8.
In the fiscal area, the overall budget deficit (excluding grants) reached 8¾ percent of
GDP in 2001, compared with the revised program target of 5.9 percent; including grants, the
deficit increased to 7.6 percent of GDP from 3 percent in 20005 (Figure 1). The government
incurred sizeable one-off expenditures, including (a) D 15 million to rehabilitate the former
Alimenta assets in order to facilitate groundnut marketing; (b) nonprogrammed government
on-lending to a public enterprise to improve the generation and distribution of electricity; and

Grants funded mostly bilateral donor projects while debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative financed poverty-reducing expenditure.

-8-

-9-

(c) election-related outlays, largely from the below-the-line (BTL) accounts. Additionally,
revenue shortfalls, including in customs revenue (1.3 percent of GDP), reflected weak
performance in tax administration and the financial problems of public enterprises, as the
latter built up sizable arrears to the government. Overall, domestic revenue declined to
16.2 percent of GDP in 2001 from 18.2 percent in 2000. Moreover, outlays (US$6.7 million
in 2001) for the settlement of the Alimenta dispute and the delayed receipt of donor grants
(1.6 percent of GDP) contributed to higher domestic interest payments and to a larger-thanprogrammed recourse to net bank financing. Government domestic debt, which had been
programmed to decline, actually increased to 33½ percent of GDP at end-2001 from
31½ percent at end-2000.
9.
Owing to an expansionary fiscal policy, the end-September 2001 quantitative
performance criterion with respect to net bank credit to the government was exceeded by
some D 40 million (0.7 percent of GDP). Through end-2001, net credit to the government
increased by 8.3 percent of GDP, which was significantly above the target, while credit to the
private sector increased by 12.8 percent. Broad money growth, which had accelerated to
about 35 percent in 2000, moderated to 19.4 percent in 2001, reflecting measures to mop up
banks’ excess reserves (Figure 2). As a result, the Treasury bill rate was increased from
12½ percent in August to 15 percent by October 2001. A waiver of the performance
criterion was granted by the Executive Board during the final review of the third annual
arrangement under the PRGF.
10.
Developments in the external sector were dominated by a surge in imports, including
the unprogrammed importation of three electricity generators (funded by a donor
concessional loan and supplier’s credit). As a result, the current account deficit (excluding
official transfers) widened to about 14: percent of GDP in 2001 from 12 percent in 2000.6
The nondisbursement of donor grants (1.6 percent of GDP) was the main factor explaining
the decline in gross official reserves to the equivalent of 4.9 months of imports and also
contributed to a further depreciation of the dalasi by 7 percent in real effective terms in 2001
(Figures 3 and 4).
11.
Notwithstanding some delays, there was significant progress in implementing
structural reforms and arrangements aimed at accessing technical assistance to strengthen
the limited institutional capacity. All but one of the PRGF-supported program structural
benchmarks were implemented, some with delays (see Appendix I, Table 3). The
exception—the rebasing of the national accounts to 1998 (currently based on 1976/77)—was
delayed owing to inadequate personnel, a problem that is being addressed.
12.
Budgetary reforms included further efforts to enhance transparency and
strengthen the reporting and control system, assisted by the Fund resident budget advisor
6

The current account deficit, including official transfers, increased to 6¾ percent of GDP
from 4¾ percent in 2000.

Box 1. The Gambia: Public Expenditure Management Reforms
Background and problem identification. A Fund TA mission that conducted an Assessment and Action Plan in July 2001
as part of efforts to strengthen the capacity for tracking poverty-reducing expenditure identified The Gambia as one of the
HIPC Initiative countries that needed to substantially upgrade the system in this area. An earlier Fund TA mission on public
expenditure management and customs administration had also noted that problems in government accounting were
particularly pervasive and needed to be addressed urgently in order to lay the foundation for improving transparency, fiscal
reporting, and budget execution. In particular, it highlighted the following problems: (a) weak budgeting preparation, mainly
owing to unrealistic costings of policies and lack of control over the BTL accounts―on which little information was
available; (b) long delays in producing the general ledger; (c) large discrepancies between fiscal and monetary data in
monthly fiscal reports; and (d) no audited annual accounts of government since 1991/92. The antiquated computer system
used in the Accountant General’s Office (AGO) contributed significantly to these problems. Key problems in budget
preparation reflected weak capacity for forecasting revenues, the formulation of the budget based on only a one-year-ahead
framework, a dual budgeting system for recurrent and development expenditures, and inadequate information on the
government financing requirement and the stock of domestic government debt―the reduction of which remains a key policy
objective. Furthermore, the lack of reliable data on a timely basis frustrates the authorities’ efforts to execute the budget
and implement an effective cash management system.
Progress in implementing action plans
Structural reforms in public expenditure management have focused on strengthening the AGO, which remains a weak, yet
pivotal, link in improving the reporting and reconciliation of expenditure data under the PRGF-supported program:
•

With the assistance of the Fund resident budget advisor, (a) public accounts for 1991/92-99 were closed in 2001;
(b) an accounting framework to track poverty-reducing expenditure, including outlays funded under the HIPC
Initiative, was developed and incorporated in the 2002 budget; (c) a special central bank account was opened to
monitor expenditure funded from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative; (d) a spreadsheet-based
framework was developed to facilitate the timely reconciliation of treasury cash books with the accounts of the
central bank; and (e) measures were taken to bring a number of BTL accounts under budgetary control and
reporting procedures, including setting quarterly ceilings for those funded mainly from the Consolidated Revenue
Fund. The budget advisor is conducting a comprehensive study of the BTL accounts that will inform future policy
in this area. He is also undertaking a major reclassification of the budget (revenue and expenditure).

•

Under the World Bank’s Capacity Building for Economic Management Project (CBEMP), a major computerization
of government accounts has been initiated, including the development of an integrated financial management
information system (IFMIS); an IFMIS resident advisor was posted in Banjul in March 2002. Furthermore, in 2001,
the Commonwealth Secretariat posted a resident information technology expert, who assisted the AGO in
completing the computerization of the payroll system. The World Bank and United Kingdom also provided
assistance for public expenditure reviews (PERs) in key sectors (agriculture, education, and health) to ensure a
better linkage of sector policies to budgetary priorities in the PRSP, and to the budget starting in 2002. The PERs
are part of efforts to strengthen the multiyear public investment program, while starting the development of other
key elements for a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).

•

The resident Fund macroeconomic advisor (since April 2002) is helping to develop the capacity to project
budgetary aggregates in the context of a comprehensive medium-term macroeconomic framework; these
projections should help develop better linkages between budget estimates and expenditure policies.

•

The United Kingdom and the World Bank are also supporting efforts to strengthen Auditor General’s Office, in
order to expedite the auditing of public sector accounts. The Gambia is participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) in an effort to improve its capacity to generate accurate macroeconomic data on a
timely basis.

(see Box 1). As part of a joint Fund-World Bank enhanced HIPC Initiative exercise, a July
2001 Fund technical assistance mission assisted the authorities in developing an Assessment
and Action Plan (AAP) to strengthen the capacity for tracking overall poverty-reducing
expenditure, including outlays funded by interim debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. However, the development of public expenditure reviews (PERs) and the costing

- 14 -

of their prioritiesCwith technical assistance provided by donorsCwas delayed. As a result,
the budget for 2002, which was approved by parliament on December 17, 2001, relied on ad
hoc arrangements in allocating expenditures to the key social sectors (agriculture, education,
and health) to reflect the PRSP priorities
13.
As detailed in the MEFP (Appendix I, Attachment), ongoing or planned tax and
financial sector reforms and a program to strengthen data have been supported by
preparation of the Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP), through which Fund
technical assistance (TA) is being coordinated to improve macroeconomic policies.
Moreover, in July 2001 the World Bank approved the Capacity Building for Economic
Management Project (CBEMP) to help strengthen key economic institutions. Preparations
are also under way to develop a broader technical assistance program to support PRSP
implementation; the program will be presented to donors as part of the planned roundtable
meeting later in 2002.
14.
On the political front, The Gambia completed presidential (October 2001), national
assembly (January 2002), and local (April 2002) elections, through which democracy has
been strengthened. In March 2002, the United States normalized donor relations with The
Gambia and lifted the prohibition on economic aid. Around the same time, The Gambia also
resolved its differences with the European Union (EU) following request by the government
to the EU in late 2001 to replace its representative in Banjul.
15.
The drawn-out electoral process contributed to expansionary fiscal policies
during the first quarter of 2002. Notwithstanding improved tax collections, which brought
revenue broadly back as programmed, expenditure overshot the end-March 2002 target by
about 2 percent of GDP, as election-related outlays continued and project execution was
accelerated, including for the Mandinaba-Soma road, in the amount of US$2.6 million.
Although disbursement of project funds (including in respect of the electricity generators)
helped limit the adverse impact of the net government credit from the banking system (and
contributed to a decline in outstanding treasury bills), the end-March 2002 quantitative
indicative targets with respect to the basic primary balance of the central government and the
net domestic assets of the central bank were not observed. Delays in receipts of groundnut
exports and a recent tightening of border controls, which impeded the reexport trade, added
to exchange rate pressures; as a result, the dalasi depreciated by 5 percent vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar, despite sizable sales of foreign exchange by the central bank. The end-March 2002
indicative target on net official international reserves was not observed.
16.
In January 2002, the central bank took over the insolvent Continent Bank—one of the
smaller banks that caters mainly to middle- and lower-income customers—and thus managed
to avoid a potential run on the bank. At end-March 2002, the bank had about
20,000 depositors, and its total deposits amounted to D 71.9 million. The authorities are
working on a resolution plan for the bank, and an international accounting firm, KPMG, has
been contracted to undertake an audit of the bank. The central bank will discuss the
resolution plan with the Fund staff, including the possible need for technical assistance to
deal with the issue. Significant progress was achieved in making plans to allow the

acceptance of foreign currency deposits: one bank has already introduced such deposits,
while two banks have been licensed to do so and others are applying for licenses
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The discussions took place against the background of the reemergence of
expansionary fiscal policies through March 2002. On the positive side, the settlement of the
Alimenta property dispute, the completion of peaceful national elections, the finalization of
the PRSP, and improved donor relations provide a favorable environment for refocusing the
authorities’ efforts on redressing the recent slippages and consolidating the gains from the
previous PRGF-supported program.
18.
The discussions focused on the authorities’ comprehensive poverty reduction strategy
and the design of a PRGF-supported program to support their strategy (see Box 2), as
acknowledged by the authorities in the MEFP (para. 40). The authorities expressed renewed
determination to move forward, while giving a high priority to addressing the outstanding
fiscal policy issues. They also committed themselves to deepening the implementation of
structural reforms with the benefit of the increased emphasis by the Fund and donors on the
provision of technical assistance to address constraints associated with the limited
institutional capacity.
A. The Macroeconomic Framework for 2002/03–2004/05
19.
Broadly in line with the PRSP, the medium-term macroeconomic framework for
2002/03-2004/05 (April–March) was updated, with the key objectives comprising (a) annual
real GDP growth of about 6 percent; (b) average inflation of about 3¾ percent per annum;
(c) an external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) of 10¼ percent of GDP
by 2005; and (d) gross external reserves equivalent to 52 months of imports of goods and
services. The overall budget deficit (excluding grants) is expected to decline to about
2 percent by 2005. Total investment is envisaged to rise from 17¾ percent of GDP in 2001 to
22 percent in 2005 (and from 4¾ percent to 7 percent over that period for the government
investment), and the envisaged increase in the government saving-investment balance of
5 percentage points of GDP would contribute to the improvement in the external current
account.
B. The Program for 2002/03
20.
In light of the expenditure overruns during the first quarter of 2002, the
discussions on the program for 2002/03 focused on immediate actions that could be
taken to contain outlays. The authorities recognized that the expenditure trend through endMarch 2002 was clearly unsustainable, while noting that one-off factors were mainly
responsible. To ensure that there is no recurrence of the recent slippages, the authorities have

- 17 Box 3. The Gambia: Tax Reforms
Against the background of weakened revenue performance and preparations for the PRSP and the new PRGFsupported program, the authorities requested for Fund technical assistance in late 2001 to review and propose
reforms for the tax system. These reviews indicate that tax revenue outlook faces constraints as the potential to
introduce new taxes is limited, and that improvements in this area will rely mainly on administrative and
institutional capacity actions. The Fund tax policy mission report, in particular, noted The Gambia’s already high
“tax effort” by regional standards. For 2001, tax revenue in The Gambia was 15.8 percent of GDP, which is higher
than most countries in the region except Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire. If one takes into account The Gambia’s lowlevel per capita income, its “tax effort” is even higher than these two countries. At the same time, the report pointed
to the need to replace revenue lost as a result of recent trade liberalization. In view of the limited domestic
manufacturing, the importance of the re-export trade sector in government revenue (accounting for 40 percent of
customs and 70 percent of sales tax revenue), as well as the authorities limited institutional capacity, the mission
advised against the introduction of a value added tax (VAT—the most commonly used consumption tax). The
mission indicated that since a fully functioning VAT would have to exempt re-exports, its introduction would end up
substantially reducing tax revenue. Instead, tax policy proposals emphasize incremental changes to improve
efficiency and a broader application of excise taxes, including on services (e.g., on electricity), which are consumed
by the relatively higher income groups.
During the mission, the authorities and the mission worked on a two-phased approach to enhance revenue collection.
The first phase focused on quick fix measures designed to stem revenue losses. These measure included improved
customs valuation based on timely adjustments in the exchange rates, improved access to data on oil imports (prices
and volume) to provide a more realistic tax assessment, closure of loopholes that had permitted tax payers, notably
public enterprises, to build up tax arrears, and enhanced surveillance of the tax departments in part to reduce
discretionary tax exemptions. As a result, revenue performance through the first quarter of 2002 was broadly on
target. The second phase focuses on longer-term measures such as collection of tax arrears, which have accumulated
to substantial levels, especially by public enterprises. In this regard, the authorities prepared a cabinet paper, which
was approved in early May 2002, providing a basis for enhanced ministerial discipline on the various public
enterprises, inter alia, to enforce their payment of tax and other arrears owed to government. Other measures
include (a) the transfer of the domestic sales tax unit from the Customs and Excise Department to the Inland
Revenue Department; (b) continued efforts to improve computerization, including upgrading ASYCUDA; and (c)
redrafting the Income Tax Act with Fund technical assistance. As part of the envisaged second phase of reforms, the
authorities have increased their collaboration with the Fund, the World Bank and DFID in trying to develop a
comprehensive tax reform to strengthen tax administration and institutional capacity. This approach informed the
June 2002 joint Fund/World Bank tax mission, which worked closely with local donors and the authorities in
developing such a reform package, details of which were not available at the time of the finalization of this report.

taken several steps, including maintaining tighter controls on BTL accounts7, and slowing
project execution. The authorities redoubled their efforts to seek grants to finance a major
project—Mandinaba Soma road construction (see details in para 23 of the MEFP—
Appendix I, Attachment II), as of early June 2002, US $1.6 million in grants has been
disbursed to mitigate the pressure on budgetary resources. The authorities are now
undertaking a comprehensive mid-year review of the budget with a view to curtail
expenditure and disbursements in the second half of 2002, especially in areas where
expenditure overruns have occurred. On the revenue side, urgent action was taken to
implement phase one measures that have significantly enhanced revenue performance in the
first quarter of 2002, an out come the authorities intend to improve upon with longer-term
phase two reform measures (Box 3). With respect to export receipts, groundnut export

earnings are recovering, while high-level discussions are being held with the aim of lifting
impediments to border trade (reexports).
21.
For 2002, real GDP growth is projected at 6 percent, an outcome that is supported by
the expected privatization and reforms in groundnut marketing, the continued recovery in the
reexport and fishing sectors, improved confidence, and the augmented supply of foreign
exchange, infrastructure, and utilities. After a surge from end-2001 through early 2002,
annual average inflation is expected to stabilize at 5½ percent, as measures will be taken to
tighten financial policies.
Fiscal policy
22.
The discussions on fiscal policy focused on the review of the 2002 budget and
developments since it was approved, with a view to reducing the overall deficit (excluding
grants) to 5 percent of GDP, compared with the 4 percent in the original budget, and to
containing government access to domestic bank financing. This revised budget target is
based on an expected recovery in revenue performance, the nonrecurrence of previous
exceptional outlays in 2001, and measures to specifically control expenditure from the BTL
accounts and slow project execution. The revised budget reflects an emphasis on key
sector priorities (agricultural, education, and health) via ad hoc arrangements, but better
integration based on timely,8 improved PERs is planned in the context of the 2003 budget
and beyond. The budget also provides for a 6 percent across-the-board increase in the wage
bill to help retain skilled staff. As is customary, the government provided salary advances,
payable over a six-month period, to all civil servants (0.3 percent of GDP) in February 2002
for the Tobaski festival. Capital expenditure is projected to increase to 5¾ percent of GDP in
2002 (from 4.7 percent in 2001) (Table5). The budget also incorporated interim debt relief of
about US$4.4 million under the enhanced HIPC Initiative; including HIPC-supported
expenditure, the deficit is projected at 6¼ percent of GDP.
23.
Discussions on revenue measures and reforms were influenced by the
recognition that revenue performance will recover more gradually than had been
envisaged in the past. As detailed in the MEFP, the planned actions should improve
domestic revenue to about 17½ percent of GDP (against 16.2 percent in 2001).
Improvements in the outer years are envisaged to be moderate, with a target of about 18½
percent of GDP in 2005. The revenue projections for 2002 incorporate recent measures to
eliminate tax and other arrears to the government for a number of public enterprises by mid2003 (about D 32 million, or 0.5 percent of GDP, is to be repaid in 2002). Revenue reforms
focus on implementing the recommendations of recent Fund TA missions supported by the
CBEMP. A joint World Bank/Fund mission visited Banjul in June to assist the authorities in
formulating a tax reform program that incorporates the recommendations of the audit of the
8

The budget preparation cycle begins in June, and new or updated PERs will henceforth be
prepared and costed well ahead of this month.

- 19 -

2001 operations of the Customs and Excise Department; the audit was carried out in May
2002 (with assistance of the U.K. Department for International Development—DFID) in
fulfillment of a program prior action. The mission’s recommendations will become
available shortly.
24.
The reforms in public expenditure management that were outlined in the
September 2001 cabinet paper aim at improving human resources, equipment, procedures,
and systems in the Accountant General’s Office, in order to enhance the reporting and
control of expenditure. The cabinet paper also included measures to strengthen the office of
the Auditor General, in order to facilitate the auditing of public accounts. Following the
review of the report of inquiry of the former Auditor General, her replacement will be
appointed—an action that will be critical for the timely audit of government accounts. The
new expenditure system should also subsequently facilitate conversions to program
budgeting in line with the objectives of the PERs (and, eventually, of the medium-term
expenditure framework—MTEF) and improve expenditure classification to reflect the PRSP
and enhanced HIPC Initiative priorities. Fund and donor TA is expected to play a key role in
implementing these reforms.
Monetary policy and financial sector reforms
25.
The key objectives of monetary policy during 2002 are to maintain low inflation and
strengthen external reserves. The monetary program in 2002 targets a reduction in endperiod inflation to 3¾ percent and the maintenance of adequate gross official external
reserves. In this context, the government will maintain a tight monetary (and fiscal) policy,
while providing adequate credit to the private sector, and will continue to promote exchange
rate flexibility. The central bank will seek to moderate the growth of broad money to about
13 percent by end-2002. As detailed in the MEFP, the central bank has already implemented
two prior program actions: (a) the central bank board approval of the reforms discussed
with the December 2001 Fund technical assistance mission, and (b) the initiation of the
review and redraft of the Central Bank Act, as well as a number of supporting actions
associated with the provision of future Fund technical assistance to the central bank. Fund
technical assistance support is intended to deepen financial sector reform, improve the
operation of the money market, promote flexibility in interest rates, and enhance the
soundness and efficiency of the financial system. Some of the planned measures include the
expansion of the use of the book-entry system, steps to promote the use of longer-maturity
treasury bills and foreign currency deposits, and the development of a liquidity forecasting
framework. Work on the latter would be supported by the Fund macroeconomic advisor at
the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DOSFEA), via efforts to improve
the timely reporting of data on net government borrowing requirements. The CBG will also
be implementing measures to improve the supervision of the financial system (see Box 4).
The Financial Institutions Bill, the Insurance Bill, and the Money Laundering Bill are
expected to be approved by the National Assembly in 2002.

- 20 -

Box 4. The Gambia: Financial Sector Reforms
The Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) operates under the legal framework of the Central Bank Act of 1972 to
supervise and regulate financial institutions. Over the years, the supervisory activities of the central bank have grown to
encompass insurance companies and microfinance institutions. Currently, the central bank is involved in regional efforts
under the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ).
To review the broad mandate of the CBG and the use of Fund technical assistance, a Fund mission visited Banjul in
December 2001. The mission made recommendations in the areas of monetary policy formulation and implementation, the
deepening of the domestic money market, supervision of banks and other financial institutions, and human resource
development. Additionally, it reviewed the central bank’s record in implementing the recommendations of previous Fund
technical assistance missions.
To improve its ability to effectively conduct monetary policy, and to move toward the statutes of the proposed West African
Central Bank, the CBG is seeking a review of the Central Bank Act of 1972. In addition to amendments to define its
mandate more clearly, the proposed changes would result in a more independent central bank. In early June, a cabinet subcommittee approved a draft money laundering Bill, shifting overall responsibility to the Department of State for Finance
and Economic Affairs (DOSFEA), which will, in turn, designate the central bank as the supervisory agency. The Bill will be
forwarded shortly to the Fund for review.
In order to improve monetary policy formulation, the CBG has created an Open Market Committee, which will be
responsible for the basic monetary policy decisions. To strengthen policy coordination between the CBG and the DOSFEA,
this committee will include a representative from DOSFEA.
To improve the effectiveness of its monetary policy operations, the CBG is developing a liquidity forecasting framework.
This framework links changes in commercial banks’ reserves to anticipated changes in the government’s accounts at the
central bank and various central bank operations. Thus, by adopting a more forward-looking stance, and through improved
communication with DOSFEA, the CBG hopes to smooth commercial banks’ liquidity, and, by reducing excess reserves
held by the banks, to improve the response of banks to changes in monetary policy. So far, however, the use of this
framework is limited by data coverage of government transactions. Other measures in this area include the implementation
of a book-entry system for treasury bill auctions and the use of longer-term securities.
The Fund mission made several recommendations to deepen the domestic money market. As a first step toward
introducing repurchase facilities, the central bank is working with commercial banks to develop a master repurchase
agreement. Further recommendations include setting bank-by-bank limits on the use of standing facilities, shortening the
reserve averaging period, and, in conjunction with improvements in the liquidity forecasting framework, conducting open
market operations to reduce daily variations in overall reserve positions.
The central bank’s supervisory functions are hampered by a scarcity of trained staff, in particular in the area of insurance
supervision, and a lack of explicit examination policies and procedures. The authorities are revising two key financial sector
laws (the Financial Institutions Bill, and the Insurance Bill), which will provide an improved legal framework for the
supervision of the banking and insurance sectors. Additionally, the central bank is developing manuals of examination
procedures for banking, insurance, and microfinance institutions. The authorities have requested (and are receiving) Fund
technical assistance in drafting these laws; it is expected that both will be submitted to the cabinet and for parliamentary
approval soon. While some progress has been made in filling vacant positions in the central bank’s banking supervision
department, several senior staff have been seconded to manage the Continent Bank, which was seized by the central bank in
January 2002.
In addition to making the recommendations discussed above, the December 2001 Fund mission observed that the central
bank’s implementation record regarding Fund TA could be improved. It recommended that further Fund technical assistance
be contingent on a number of prior actions on the part of the central bank, such as a CBG board resolution approving the
proposed action plan, the passing of the Financial Institutions and the Insurance Bills, the filling of vacant staff positions, the
preparation of a resolution plan for the insolvent banks and insurance companies, and efforts to improve the coordination
and implementation of technical assistance. The central bank has made good progress in implementing these
recommendations.
In the context of the PRSP, interventions will be focused on the village savings and credit association (VISACA) and will
relate to capacity building, product development, improvements of the regulatory framework, better linkages among
microfinance institutions, the setting up of a credit guarantee fund, and incentive schemes for private sector investment in
agriculture. Formal financial sector reforms in the PRGF are being coordinated with the PRSP’s activities, which focus on
the informal sector, in order to provide better support to the private sector, including the poor.

- 21 -

26.
Nonperforming bank loans (NPL) had declined to 7.9 percent of total outstanding
loans by end-March 2002 from 13.6 percent in June 2000,9 and provisioning for
nonperforming loans has remained above 90 percent of the level of such loans in 2001. The
authorities will encourage banks to maintain their capital adequacy ratios above the legal
requirement level of 8 percent. They have also taken steps to strengthen the management
capacity of the Continent Bank, which has not been meeting some of these standards.
Addressing the full extent of the Continent Bank’s problems however, requires completion of
the resolution plan, which will also establish the cost to the budget of either its
recapitalization or liquidation.
Other structural reforms
27.
As detailed in paragraph 34 of the MEFP, the authorities are pursuing other
structural reforms to, inter alia, promote a macroeconomic environment conducive to
private sector activity, in line with the PRSP objectives. The areas covered include
(a) modernization of business-related legislation; (b) regulation and public procurement (the
Regulation and Procurement Acts were enacted in 2001); (c) competition policy (a draft was
prepared with technical assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat in 2000); and
(d) public enterprise divestiture. The divestiture program was given a boost following the
2001 cabinet approval of the privatization of Track I public enterprises—defined as
enterprises that can be sold without the need for legislative and regulatory support, and which
include the former Alimenta assets. Privatization of the remaining public enterprises (mainly
utilities) would be informed by a number of studies planned for 2002. The Gambia
Divestiture Agency (GDA) will channel part of the privatization proceeds into the divestiture
account at the central bank. In 2002, up to D 25 million will be transferred from the
divestiture account to reduce the government’s domestic debt. As detailed in paragraph 38 of
the MEFP, the government is also implementing a governance program to, inter alia, improve
transparency and governance in all public institutions, as well as in the legal and judicial
processes.
28.
The mission urged the authorities to follow through with a transparent privatization
of Alimenta’s former assets to competing firms, in order to improve groundnut marketing
and reduce the role of government. These measures are critical to the success of the broader
reforms envisaged for the agricultural sector—reforms aimed at enhancing the provision of
extension, research, and credit services to farmers in order to promote rural incomegenerating activities.
External Policies and Balance of Payments Outlook, and Ability to Repay the Fund
9

The decline in the NPL reflects the government’s payment of D 64 million in respect of
nonperforming crop loans in February 2001, as well as an improvement in crop-marketing
arrangements during 2001/02.

- 22 -

29.
The Gambia’s balance of payments position is expected to strengthen over the
medium term, with the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers)
projected to narrow from 14¾ percent of GDP in 2001 to 13¼ percent in 2002 and further to
10¼ percent by 2005. During this period, the volume of total exports (excluding reexports) is
expected to increase by nearly 6: percent, reflecting a further expansion in groundnut, fruit,
and fish exports, while reexports should benefit from improved cross-border relations, a
depreciated dalasi, and the introduction (in January 2002) of foreign currency deposits. In
particular, fish products will benefit from favorable world prices and an expansion in
processing capacity. Receipts from tourism are projected to increase significantly following
peaceful elections and the efforts to promote the sector. The terms of trade are forecast to
remain stable during 2003-05. Private transfers and the prospects of private inflows of direct
investment are expected to improve as the economy grows and the reform process is
deepened. Meanwhile, import growth is envisaged to moderate, starting in 2002, after a oneoff increase in 2001 related to the importation of three electricity generators. Gross official
reserves are projected to reach SDR 87.7 million by end-2002, equivalent to about five
months of import cover. A financing gap of SDR 10.3 million is estimated for 2002 and is
expected to be filled by recourse to Fund (SDR 5.8 million) and donor assistance (including a
minimum of € 3.7 million from the EU). A donor roundtable meeting planned for
September 2002 is expected to raise funding for the PRSP-related spending and the
associated financing gap starting in 2003. Key external sector reforms are summarized in
Box 5.
30.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a liberal trade and exchange
system. They will continue to explore further measures to rationalize and reduce external
tariffs, which, together with the pursuit of a market-based flexible exchange rate, should
significantly benefit The Gambia’s external competitiveness. The mission concurred with the
authorities’ assessment and considered the prevailing exchange rate, in conjunction with the
pursuit of prudent financial policies, to be broadly appropriate in maintaining the country’s
external competitiveness.
31.
Over the medium term, the debt-service ratio, after accounting for the enhanced HIPC
Initiative assistance, will fall from about 13¼ percent of exports of goods and nonfactor
services in 2002 to 8¼ percent by 2005 (Table 9).10 The share of repayments to the Fund in
relation to total debt service is expected to increase from 1.6 percent in 2001 to 8¾ percent in
2005. In 2001, the Fund approved interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative of
SDR 0.8 million, covering 9.6 percent of each repayment obligation falling due until
December 31, 2001. The government intends to use the remaining proceeds of the Fund
10

The nominal present values (NPV) and debt-service statistics (Tables 3 and 9) are slightly
higher than those envisaged in the Decision Point Document (www.imf.org), reflecting
higher-than-anticipated new multilateral loans and one concessional loan from a bilateral
donor in 2001. Moreover, the growth rates for exports and government revenue were
moderated in light of developments in 2001.

Box 5. The Gambia: External Sector Reforms
The strategic location of The Gambia, controlling a navigable river into the hinterland and possessing an efficient port, as well as
its long history of liberal trade and exchange rate policy, has enabled the country to develop into a regional entrepôt.
The Gambia accepted Article VIII sections, 2, 3 and 4 of the Funds’ Articles of Agreement in 1993. External tariff reforms have
been implemented recently. In 1998, the maximum tariff rate was lowered from 90 percent to 25 percent for all items except
tobacco, alcohol, and vehicles. Further tariff reforms were implemented in 1999, with the rates on tobacco, alcohol, and vehicles
reduced from 87 percent to 20 percent as well. The latest reforms took place in 2000, when the top maximum external tariff was
reduced to 18 percent and the number of tariff bands was further lowered to three nonzero bands. The current tariff rates are 0, 5,
10, and 18 percent.
The nominal exchange rate depreciated by about 20 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2001. The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 8 percent between January 2001 and January 2002. External debt is quite high, at about 125 percent of GDP. A
debt sustainability analysis was undertaken in 2000, leading to The Gambia’s becoming eligible under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. The Gambia enjoys relatively low interest payments-on external debt, averaging 4 percent of total exports and
nonfactor services or, 1.2 percent of GDP, and it has been granted debt relief to ensure that the long-run path of external debt is
sustainable. The country has a comfortable foreign exchange position, with gross international reserves (GIR) equivalent to five
months of imports and 21 percent of the nominal debt stock. Additionally, the ratio of GIR to quasi money has been stable at
around 80 percent during the program years.
Export performance has been favorable. The ratio of the exports of goods and services to GDP increased to around 54 percent in
2001. However, there has not been a qualitative transformation in the export base. Reexports still account for about 80 percent of
total exports, benefiting particularly from the country’s recent trade reforms. However, vulnerabilities arise from the threat of
border closures and the trade reforms that are taking place in neighboring countries.
The new PRGF arrangement provides a framework for prudent financial policies and reforms to improve The Gambia’s
external competitiveness and promote foreign investment.
The Gambia River and the country’s 200-nautical-mile-exclusive economic zone contain abundant ocean and river fish and
crustaceans, and remain largely underexploited. An estimated fish yield of around 75,000 tons, and a current annual offtake of
around 29,000 tons provide a wide scope for increased levels of both foreign and domestic investment in the sector. Fish exports
have benefited from investments in cold storage, shrimp and fish processing, and fish farming, as well as increases in the number
of oceanfishing trawlers and artisanal canoes. An Artisanal Fisheries Development Project is under way, with a plan to establish
the Industrial Fisheries Port in Banjul, funded by the African Development Bank. It aims to (a) establish a fisheries port, (b)
establish a central fisheries market, (c) support the Ministry’s Control and Surveillance (MCS) Department, (d) promote the credit
program for financing small-scale fishermen, and (e) establish a Human Resource Development Department.
Tourism is one of the main foreign exchange earners, contributing over 12 percent to GDP. The sector is facing a number of
constraints, including a continued fall in spending by tourists and environmental degradation in some areas. The African
Development Bank has started a US$10 million project for beach rehabilitation. The newly created, private-sector-directed
Tourism Promotion Agency has increased the promotion budget by a factor of 20. Moreover, the government is undertaking a
Tourism Development Master Plan Study for 2002–2020, which should inform a long-term strategy for growth and employment
consistent with the PRSP.
The groundnut sector accounts for about 25 percent of the value added in agriculture, about 8 percent of GDP, and 10 percent of
exports (about 70 percent of domestically produced exports). Production recovered from 78,000 tons in 1997 to 152,000 tons in
2001. The emphasis has now shifted to improve processing and marketing. The rehabilitation of barges and a processing plant are
under way, while a new oil-crushing plant has been established. A settlement with Alimenta, a Swiss marketing monopoly, was
completed in 2001, and there is a proposal to privatize the former Alimenta assets. There is donor support for the provision of
fertilizer, better seeds, and credit to farmers.
The enactment of the Investment Promotion and Free Zones Act in 2001 sets the stage for the establishment of The Gambia
Investment Promotion and Free Zones Agency (GIPFZA) and is expected to promote private investment. Foreign direct
investment picked up slightly in 2001 with new investments concentrated in the tourism sector, roads, and utilities (electricity and
telephones). Within the framework of the US$25 million Trade Gateway Project, the government has established free economic
zones administered and managed by GIPFZA. These zones utilize land around the Banjul airport to facilitate access to easy
transportation and related infrastructure development and are aimed at stimulating private investment in light manufacturing and
export-oriented activities. Commercial banks have been licensed to operate and some have opened foreign currency deposits,
which should facilitate the transfer of funds to promote remittances; the latter are increasingly channeled to investment projects.
Following elections and improved relations, the United States is expected to review The Gambia’s eligibility under the African
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and a positive outcome to this review would further encourage investments.

interim assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, approved on December 15, 2000, to
meet debt service payments on its existing debt to the Fund as they fall due during 2002. The
Gambia has a good record in meeting its debt service to the Fund, and, given the authorities’

- 24 -

ongoing commitment to implement a strong adjustment program, it is expected to continue to
meet its financial obligations to the Fund on a timely basis.
C. The PRSP Process and Enhanced HIPC Initiative
32.
The full PRSP, prepared through a participatory process, was presented to the
management of the Fund and World Bank in May 2002; it is assessed separately in the joint
staff assessment (www.imf.org), which is being presented to the Executive Board with the
PRSP (www.imf.org) in support of the request for the three-year arrangement under the
PRGF.
Poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) issues
The PRGF arrangement is underpinned by macroeconomic adjustments, including fiscal
measures and reforms to strengthen the financial sector that will have an impact on the poor.
Reforms envisaged for the Central Statistics Department (CSD) are likely to significantly
improve information about the poor; the effect of these reforms on the poor is discussed
below.
33.
The program adjustment focuses on containing the overall fiscal deficit11 and
eventually bringing it down to a sustainable level. The resulting impact would be to release
resources (up to 20 percent of the revenue that is currently absorbed by domestic debt
servicing) to augment poverty-reducing expenditure. Achieving this target requires
mobilizing domestic resources and strengthening public expenditure management.
34.
The revenue effort calls mainly for a reduction in discretionary customs tax
exemptions and better enforcement of sales taxes, especially those collected by hotels and
public enterprises (e.g., The Gambia Telecommunications Company (GAMTEL)) that have
accumulated tax arrears. The sizable revenue recovery would be an immediate cost to
individuals who have hitherto had the means to avoid taxes and, therefore, are not likely to be
among the poor. To the extent that better tax enforcement marks up the prices on taxed goods
and services, the tax incidence would fall on higher-income groups and foreigners who
consume taxable imported or reexported items or those subject to sales tax.12 Since items like
rice, medicine, and fertilizer attract a zero import duty rate and the latter two are not subject
to sales tax, consumption of these items by the poor would be largely unaffected. The
11

The fiscal deficit for program purposes is narrowly defined to exclude the povertyreducing expenditure funded under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and incremental PRSP
expenditure. These programs are, in any case, fully funded and would not have an impact on
budget financing.
12

The Fund tax policy mission estimates that nearly 40 percent of customs revenue and
70 percent of sales tax revenue come directly from goods imported for reexport.

- 25 -

proposed higher excise taxes on cigarettes, liquor, and electricity would also fall mainly on
higher-income groups and foreigners (the latter via reexports), who consume these items. The
expenditure measures taken to improve allocation, accountability, and transparency would
likely reduce corruption and waste and increase resources to priority sectors. The poor are
thus not likely to be adversely affected by these measures and could well benefit from the
programmed fiscal reforms. Moreover, the resulting salutary impact on inflation13 would
over time also increase welfare, especially for the poor.
35.
The most recent household survey (1998) reveals that the incidence of poverty
increased substantially in recent years and that the majority (about 91 percent) of the
extremely poor households in the rural areas are engaged in agriculture. The narrow resource
base of the economy is a major inhibiting factor to economic resilience, aggravated by an
influx of refugees from the region, which has put pressure on the limited social services. In
this context, the PRSP has identified a number of priority actions, including increased
budgetary allocations to key social sectors (agriculture, education, and health) as part of the
effort to alleviate poverty (Table 5b). Excluding the enhanced HIPC Initiative spending,
budgetary allocations to these sectors increased from 38 percent of non-interest current
spending in 2000 to about 43 percent in 2002.
36.
The financial sector reforms focus on strengthening the legal and institutional
framework, so as to broaden and deepen the financial system and promote private sector
access to credit. To the extent that the emerging dynamic private sector generate employment
while the PRGF reforms in the formal financial sector complement the expansion of credit
facilities to small enterprises and microenterprises (envisaged under the PRSP), the poor
would benefit. On a related issue, the mission argued for the closure of Continent Bank since,
as a small bank, it does not pose a systemic risk to the rest of the banking system; such an
action would also send a strong signal of the authorities’ commitment to promote sound
banking practices. The authorities argued strongly against the immediate closure of the bank,
pointing out that its services were mainly geared to the low-income households. However,
agreement in this area is dependent on finalizing the resolution plan for the bank.
37.
The proposed reform of the CSD (para. 43 of the MEFP) would substantially enhance
macroeconomic, social, and, especially, poverty data, thereby strengthening the design and
implementation of the PRSP and benefiting the poor considerably in the medium to long run.
The enhanced HIPC Initiative
38.
The government has achieved significant progress in implementing the enhanced
HIPC Initiative completion point triggers. The first six-monthly report on tracking
poverty-reducing expenditure, including HIPC Initiative-funded expenditure for 2001, will
13

The current consumer price index, based on a low-income urban household consumption
basket, understates measured inflation.

- 26 -

be presented to the High-Level Economic Committee shortly. Regarding education triggers,
the number of teachers (lower basic education) graduating from The Gambia College reached
361 in 2001 (compared with 192 in 2000), thus exceeded the annual growth target of
45 percent. The girls’ scholarship fund was also successfully implemented, and the number
of participants in the four poorest regions rose to over 7,800 at end-2001 (against the annual
target of 2,000). Progress in implementing the health triggers (the number of births attended
by trained antenatal personnel and the share of expenditure on primary and secondary health
care) is broadly on target.14 Notable progress has been achieved regarding other triggers. The
Regulatory Act was enacted in 2001, paving the way for the establishment of a regulatory
agency, while the privatization of the former Alimenta assets is under way. The Gambia is
expected to reach the enhanced HIPC Initiative Completion Point by mid-2003.
D. Technical Assistance and Statistical Issues
39.
The Fund staff has made substantial progress in the preparation of a
comprehensive TCAP aimed at promoting performance under the PRGF arrangement
(MEFP, para. 44). The TCAP focuses on key reforms in public expenditure management, tax
policy and administration, monetary and foreign exchange operations and financial sector
supervision, and macroeconomic data. The UK-DFID has expressed interest in providing
support, including possible financing of Fund technical assistance in support of the
macroeconomic reforms under the TCAP.
40.
The Gambia’s economic and financial statistics remain in need of improvement,
especially with regard to the balance of payments, national accounts and prices, public
investment, the public enterprise sector, and employment. Although the comprehensive
balance of payments data are still compiled on an annual basis, detailed key external
indicators on international reserves and government debt service are provided on a timely
basis, and thus the country meets the minimum reporting requirements for surveillance on
external debt and reserves. Data on the social sectors and poverty need to be substantially
improved and better integrated with mainstream economic data. The authorities have taken
steps to strengthen the statistical base, including through efforts to improve the staffing of the
CSD. The country is also participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System to
improve the quality, timeliness, and transparency of data provision. The Gambia’s metadata
are now available on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
E. Prior Actions and Economic and Financial Performance Monitoring

14

Preliminary budget data for 2001 indicate that allocations for primary and secondary health
care increased to 27.3 percent of total recurrent expenditure in health from 26 percent in
2000. The number of trained antenatal personnel is derived indirectly from the estimated
stock figure in 2000 and the number of trainees completing the courses each year in this area.

- 27 -

41.
To help ensure successful implementation of the program, the government has
implemented the following prior actions: (a) a CBG Board resolution in support of the
reforms, as recommended by the December 2001 Fund technical mission; (b) initiation of a
review of the Central Bank Act; and (c) an audit of the 2001 operations of the Customs and
Excise Department (Appendix I, Table 2). Items (a) and (b), together with other measures,
will trigger Fund technical assistance to the central bank under the TCAP.
42.
The program will be monitored through the quantitative benchmarks and quantitative
performance criteria specified in Tables 1 and 2 of Appendix I. Seven benchmarks have been
set for end-June 2002, and these will also serve as quantitative performance criteria for endSeptember 2002. Indicative targets on the same variables have been established for endDecember 2002. Five structural benchmarks have been set for specific dates through endNovember 2002, and a continuous performance criterion on the avoidance of external
payments arrears has also been set. Program implementation will be assessed during a first
review, to be completed by end-December 2002. Structural conditionality is also covered in
Box 6.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
During the last four years, The Gambia overall has achieved a measure of
macroeconomic and structural adjustment, with a considerable fiscal retrenchment and
external sector adjustment, including substantial trade liberalization. However, this
achievement was undermined by fiscal slippages in 2001 that continued through the first
quarter of 2002.
44.
The new PRGF-supported program represents a consolidation phase for The Gambia,
and the authorities plan to intensify efforts to build on the gains achieved so far to ensure
fiscal prudence, strengthen governance, and institute broad-based economic and financial
reforms to reduce poverty. These reforms should benefit from better coordination of donor
technical assistance, as a program with that objective will be presented at a donor roundtable
meeting to support implementation of the PRSP. The staff has played a role in this process
through its preparation of a comprehensive TCAP to enhance the formulation and
implementation of macroeconomic policies. The authorities’ efforts come on the heels of
peaceful national elections, the preparation of a full PRSP, improved donor relations, and the
settlement of the Alimenta property dispute. The authorities are to be commended for these
achievements, which provide auspicious conditions to move ahead. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ policy response, including the actions taken to reverse recent financial slippages.
The challenge is for them to fully implement the strategy and the supporting measures and
reforms on a timely basis.
The revised budget for 2002 provides for an appropriate strengthening of fiscal performance,
in line with the medium-term macroeconomic framework and with the goal of maintaining a
sustainable level of government domestic debt. On the revenue side, it is recognized that

- 28 -

recovery will take time and will depend largely on a gradual improvement in institutional
capacity, including a sustained improvement in customs administration. The staff also urges
Box 6. The Gambia: Structural Conditionality in the Proposed PRGF Arrangement for The Gambia
Coverage of structural conditionality in the proposed program
As detailed in Table 2 of Appendix I, structural conditionality in the proposed PRGF arrangement for The Gambia covers
five areas. First, the completion of Stage I of the Household Survey (dry season) will provide further data for the analysis of
poverty and form a basis for constructing an updated and comprehensive consumer price index (CPI). An updated CPI will
also be helpful in the formulation of monetary policy. Second, the measures envisaged to expand the automated system for
customs data (ASYCUDA) by networking the customs administration and using the system to automatically generate trade
data, will improve the efficiency of the customs administration and the timeliness of trade data. Third, structural
conditionality covers the completion of a second report on poverty-reducing expenditure (the first report was completed in
May 2002). Fourth, the quarterly schedule for eliminating government-public enterprise cross arrears based on a review of a
public enterprise study and cabinet paper was completed at end-May 2002. Fifth, the completion of the enterprise survey
will form the basis for the compilation of data on the international investment position in the balance of payments. Three
prior actions, all on structural reform issues, have been incorporated in the program. The audit of the Customs and Excise
Department was carried out to strengthen revenue performance while the actions relating to the central bank would
significantly improve its institutional capacity.
Change of status of structural conditionality from earlier programs
The proposed PRGF arrangement does not include structural conditionality on (a) the restructuring and privatization of
public enterprises; (b) the procurement code; (c) the investment code; and (d) the public investment program (PIP), all of
which were covered by structural benchmarks in the earlier PRGF annual arrangements. The World Bank has the lead role
in all these areas, and, except for item (a), they have been addressed through legislation, interim codes, and an initial review
of the PIP. The conditionality on privatization was not fully met, but the emphasis was shifted to providing legal
frameworks for privatization and regulation, both of which were approved by parliament in the 2000/01 sessions.
Meanwhile, to deal with financial problems of public enterprises, the current PRGF-supported program has incorporated
quarterly budget targets to eliminate government-public enterprise cross arrears. More generally, the third annual PRGF
arrangement was and the perspective thee-year arrangement has been refocused to include structural conditionality that is
more in the areas where the Fund takes a lead role and that has a more direct bearing on macroeconomic issues.
Structural areas covered by World Bank lending and conditionality
All existing and prospective (in fiscal-year FY 2003) World Bank lending is in projects, of which those in education and
health have conditionality that is reflected also in the HIPC Initiative floating completion triggers. The World Bank has not
scheduled any credit or structural adjustment lending in FY 2003.
Structural areas covered by HIPC Initiative completion point conditionality
Explicit structural reforms covered by the triggers include (a) improving the capacity to generate poverty data;
(b) strengthening the regulation of private and public enterprises; (c) improving public expenditure tracking; and (d)
bringing to the point of sale the former Alimenta groundnut-processing plants. The latter complements the broader
groundnut-marketing and production reforms, which are covered by agreements and arrangements with the European
Union—the lead donor in the sector.
Other relevant structural conditionality not included in the current program
This applies to three main areas. First, governance issues have been explicitly raised by donors, notably reforms in the
Auditor General’s Office. These are issues monitored by the relevant donors. Second, the PRSP process, including
participatory programs, sector policies, public expenditure reviews, the medium-term expenditure framework, and social
impact analysis, is supported by various donors and nongovernmental organizations; however; it has not been covered by
specific conditionality in the PRGF-supported program. Finally, liquidity forecasting by the central bank has been developed
to a certain extent by the monetary authority, acting on its own. Additional conditionality in this area is now dependent on
ongoing reforms in the accounts of the central government, which would provide timely inputs into the formulation of
monetary policy.

- 29 -

the authorities to ensure a strict adherence to the repayment plan agreed between a number of
public enterprises and the government and to persevere with reforms in the tax system.
Budgetary reforms to enhance the transparency and accountability of public expenditure are
also crucial to the PRSP and HIPC Initiative process. The authorities are encouraged to press
ahead with these reforms, including the appointment of as Auditor General with substantive
responsibilities so as to strengthen the office, and to resume the auditing of public accounts
on a timely basis. The authorities should also collaborate effectively with donors in
improving and broadening the PER exercise to cover other sectors, with a view to developing
a medium-term expenditure framework encompassing all major expenditure programs.
45.
The authorities need to continue to be vigilant in implementing a prudent monetary
policy, so as to maintain low inflation while providing adequate private sector credit growth.
Supporting reforms should emphasize the expanded use of indirect monetary policy
instruments, taking advantage of Fund technical assistance. The staff urges the authorities to
act resolutely and expeditiously to resolve the Continent Bank issue, including completing a
resolution plan to establish the full cost to the budget of either recapitalization or liquidation
of the bank.
46.
The consolidation and broadening of other structural reforms remains key to
stimulating private sector activity and accelerating a reduction in poverty. Key reforms
include measures to improve business legislation, establish a framework for the regulation of
public enterprises, and continue with privatization. Also, reforms to establish a sustainable
marketing arrangement for groundnuts with minimal government involvement should be put
in place.
47.
The mission concurred with the authorities’ assessment of the trade and exchange
system, and it considered the prevailing exchange rate, in the context of the implementation
of prudent financial policies, to be broadly appropriate in maintaining The Gambia’s external
competitiveness.
48.
The staff welcomes the full PRSP, which has provided the essential building blocks
for poverty-reducing adjustment and the reforms incorporated in the PRGF-supported
program. In order to strengthen the links between the PRSP and the PRGF-supported
program, further work is needed to refine sector priorities and improve the macroeconomic
and social data that will help to assess the impact of adjustment and reform on the poor. The
staff urges the authorities to strengthen these efforts to solicit the views of the poor, including
through the governance program, which seeks to empower the civic society.
49.
Notwithstanding the progress that the authorities have made in improving economic
and financial data, the staff urges them to continue their efforts to enhance the timeliness and
quality of data, especially in the national accounts and prices, and the fiscal and external
sectors. Furthermore, the social and poverty database should be strengthened in light of the
objectives outlined in the PRSP. While the provision of data to the Fund does not prevent
effective surveillance or program monitoring, the delays in reporting need to be reduced and
the quality of data upgraded to improve the analysis of economic developments.

- 30 -

50.
Possible risks to the implementation of the proposed policies and reforms include
delays in dealing with, or the reemergence of, governance issues (including avoidance of
unprogrammed expenses and revenue leakages), and delays in effectively using technical
assistance, especially in the fiscal area. Moreover, the heavy burden of implementing a broad
range of measures and reforms, including those related to the PRSP and the enhanced HIPC
Initiative, will be a major test of the constraints on institutional and human resource capacity.
Thus, the staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts in intensifying their collaboration with
donors and the Fund to ensure timely access to, and effective use, of technical assistance.
51.
On the basis of the broadly encouraging economic and financial developments, the
authorities’ efforts to address the slippages that have emerged, and their adoption of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework (and supporting policies, including prior actions) for
2002–05, the staff recommends that the Executive Board approve The Gambia’ request for a
new three-year PRGF arrangement.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with The Gambia be held on
a standard 12-month cycle.

June 25, 2002
Mr. Horst Köhler
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Köhler:
1.
On behalf of the government of The Gambia, we have the honor of transmitting the
attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) that sets out the objectives
and policies that the government intends to pursue during 2002/03–2004/05 (April–March).
The MEFP is itself based on the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation (SPA II—our version of the
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)),15 whose focus is on a longer-term development
strategy to reduce poverty with sustainable growth and external debt management, as well as
structural reforms. The reforms entail enhanced public participation in policy formulation,
accelerated economic growth with increased private sector activity, and various social sector
measures to enhance human capital. The government intends to make the contents of this
letter and those of the attached MEFP and technical memorandum of understanding (TMU),
as well as the staff report on the request for the three-year arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), available to the public and authorizes you to arrange
for them to be posted on the IMF website, subsequent to Board approval.
2.
In support of these objectives and policies, the government of The Gambia hereby
requests a three-year arrangement under the PRGF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 20.22
million (65 percent of quota). Moreover, in support of its overall economic program, the
government will also be requesting support from bilateral and multilateral donors and
creditors.
3.
The government of The Gambia will provide the Fund with such information as the
Fund requests in connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and
financial policies and achieving the objectives of the program.
4.
The government of The Gambia believes that the policies and measures set forth in
the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but it will
take any further measures that may prove necessary to this end. During the period of the
three-year PRGF arrangement, the government will consult with the Managing Director on
the adoption of any measures that may be appropriate, at the initiative of The Gambia or
whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation. Moreover, after the period of
15

The PRSP was forwarded separately to you and the President of the World Bank.

the three-year arrangement and while The Gambia has outstanding financial obligations to
the Fund arising from loans under that arrangement, The Gambia will consult with the Fund
from time to time, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Managing Director
requests consultation on The Gambia’s economic and financial policies.

Sincerely yours,

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

THE GAMBIA
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2002/03–2004/05
V. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum reviews performance under the recently completed program
supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for 1998–2001. It also
outlines the government’s medium-term program for 2002/03–2004/05 (April–March),
focusing especially on the current financial year, in support of which the government of The
Gambia is requesting a new three-year arrangement under the PRGF. The government’s
program is formulated against the background of the launching of the Strategy for Poverty
Alleviation (SPA II—our version of the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)) and the
December 2000 decisions by the Fund and World Bank Executive Boards approving debt
relief for The Gambia under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC Initiative). The latter provided a significant boost to the government’s effort to reduce
poverty.
VI. PERFORMANCE DURING THE PRGF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM AND RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS
A. Performance under the PRGF-supported program (1998–2001)
2.
Overall economic performance under the PRGF-supported program for 1998–2001
was mixed. Notwithstanding robust real GDP growth (led by a recovery in the agricultural
sector, particularly groundnuts), accompanied by low inflation and good progress in a
number of structural reforms, there were slippages in implementing the budget. In addition to
shortfalls in customs revenue collection (partly reflecting the faulty introduction of a
preshipment inspection (PSI) scheme during 1999–2000 and weak customs administration),
budgetary expenditure exceeded program targets as a result of payments associated with the
government’s seizure in January 1999 of property belonging to Alimenta—a Swiss
groundnut marketing company—and on-lending to the electricity public enterprise to
purchase generators. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants), which had declined
from 7.8 percent of GDP in 1997 to 3.6 percent in 2000, increased to 8.7 percent in 2001.
Borrowing to cover the fiscal deficits and delays in the receipt of donor grants contributed to
an increase in domestic debt to over 33 percent of GDP by end-2001. Broad money growth
was uneven and accelerated to 35 percent in 2000 in conjunction with efforts to finance the
groundnut crop before moderating toward the end of the program.
3.
The external sector, while experiencing a significant improvement, remained under
pressure, partly reflecting delays in the disbursement of donor grants. Thus, international
gross reserves declined to the equivalent of 4.9 months of imports at the end of the program,
while the exchange rate depreciated by an average of about 4 percent annually in real
effective terms during 1998–2001. However, the depreciation contributed to the

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

improvement in The Gambia’s external competitiveness, as did the extensive reforms to
reduce the maximum external tariff from 90 percent in 1998 to 18 percent in 2000; the
number of tariff bands was reduced from 30 to 3 over the same period.
4.
Among the key structural reforms were the fiscal reforms entailing the
(a) introduction of an automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA); (b) preparation of
public expenditure reviews (PERs) for three key social sectors with assistance from donors;
(c) enhanced expenditure control and reporting, partly through procedures to better manage
the below-the-line (BTL) accounts; and (d) closing of government accounts for 1991/92
(July-June)–1999; the latter two reforms were implemented with the assistance of a Fund
resident budget advisor. Significant legislation was prepared and part of it approved by the
National Assembly to support the legal and institutional reforms for the financial sector and
to enhance private sector activities (on issues such as privatization, regulation, and
competition). The government privatized the Atlantic Hotel and the Trust Bank in 1999.
Moreover, it reached a settlement with Alimenta on the property dispute, and the democratic
process was strengthened through elections.
5.
The government remains determined to consolidate the overall economic gains made
over the last four years. Accordingly, and in conjunction with the preparation of the PRSP, it
is coordinating with its development partners the preparation of a comprehensive technical
assistance program to strengthen institutional capacity. This should allow the achievement of
better results, building on past efforts that include (a) an emphasis on continued robust
economic growth (focusing on the groundnut sector) to enhance income-generating activities;
(b) budgetary reforms to improve transparency, accountability, and the allocation of
resources (targeting agriculture, education, and health) in order to enhance the provision of
services; and (c) an enhanced focus on developing the financial sector, and more broadly
private sector activities, via a supportive macroeconomic and legal environment as part of a
strategy to broaden economic participation. These and other initiatives to better involve the
Gambian people, especially the poor in the poverty reduction and growth process, will
inform our efforts in the future, as discussed below.
B. Recent Economic Developments16
6.
In 2001, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 6 percent, thanks to the robust
performance of the agricultural sector (especially groundnuts), which benefited from very
good rain distribution. At the same time, the fisheries, construction, trade, and transport and
communication sectors experienced rapid expansion. Notwithstanding the good harvest, the
expansionary fiscal policies and sizable depreciation of the dalasi (see below) contributed to

Details of developments through September 2001 are provided in our letters to you dated
June 29, 2001 and November 14, 2001, as well as the Staff Report for the 2001 Article IV
Consultation (Country Report No. 01/148).

- 47 -

ATTACHMENT II

higher inflation: end-of-period inflation increased to 8 percent compared with the program
target of 3½ percent.
7.
The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) widened to about
14¾ percent of GDP in 2001 as a result of the unprogrammed importation of three electricity
generators (funded from a donor concessional loan and supplier’s credit) and higher imports
for domestic use. Gross official reserves, at the equivalent of about five months of imports,
also fell short of the 2001 target, largely because of an estimated delay in the disbursement of
donor grants of 1.6 percent of GDP. The latter also contributed to a further depreciation of
the dalasi of 8 percent in real effective terms in 2001.
8.
Slippages occurred in the implementation of the 2001 budget; the overall deficit
(excluding grants) is estimated at 8.7 percent of GDP, exceeding the revised target of
5.9 percent of GDP. This was mainly the result of shortfalls in customs duty receipts, but
recurrent expenditure, including other charges, also exceeded the program target. In addition,
the government incurred unprogrammed expenditure (on-lending to a public enterprise) in
purchasing electricity generators and related equipment and making payments to commercial
banks (see below). Since September, further shortfalls in customs and sales tax (on imports
and domestic goods) revenue amounting to an estimated 1.3 percent of GDP have
accumulated, including a buildup of tax arrears by public enterprises. Notably, the Gambia
Telecommunications Company (GAMTEL)—which operates a fast-growing mobile
telephone business with significant forward sales of telephone cards—incurred tax arrears
amounting to D 32 million,17 while the National Water and Electricity Corporation
(NAWEC) was unable to pay D 27 million in tax arrears. There were also shortfalls in nontax
revenue (0.5 percent of GDP) and overruns in net lending (0.4 percent of GDP), reflecting
the financial problems of public enterprises. An additional 0.4 percent of GDP in excess
outlays was incurred through the BTL accounts to accelerate development projects in
response to election pressures. The government had recourse to net bank financing
amounting to about 26 percent of beginning period money stock, compared with 8 percent
under the program; outstanding government domestic debt had risen to about 33 percent of
GDP by end-2001.18
9.
In 2001, domestic credit expansion was dominated by government borrowing, which
crowded out the private sector. This outcome resulted in part from government payments to
commercial banks (D 64 million, equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP) for the nonperforming
17

Owing to delays in closing its accounts, GAMTEL was also recently assessed an estimated
D 25 million in overdue income tax, which, together with sales tax arrears, amounts to
0.4 percent of GDP.
18

This outcome was in part aggravated by the payment (amortization) for the Alimenta
settlement (US$6.7 million in 2001) and the nondisbursement of donor grants that could have
partly offset this payment.

crop finance loans extended to private operators in 1999/2000 in the aftermath of the seizure
of the Alimenta assets. Nevertheless, broad money growth was contained at 19 percent
(35 percent in 2000) following efforts by the central bank to mop up liquidity through sales
of treasury bills; these sales contributed to an increase in the treasury bill rate from
12 percent to 15 percent during the year. Notwithstanding these efforts, four quantitative
performance criteria for end-March 2001 and one such criterion for end-September 2001
were not observed; however, waivers were approved by the Fund’s Executive Board. With
regard to fourth quarter performance, two end-December 2001 quantitative indicative targets
concerning net bank credit to, and the basic primary balance of, the central government–
were not observed (Appendix I, Table 1).
10.
On December 17, 2001, the National Assembly approved the budget for 2002,
providing for an overall deficit (excluding grants) of about 4 percent; including grants, the
deficit was projected at 1 percent of GDP. The budget incorporated poverty-reducing
expenditure funded with interim debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and also
reflects key sector priorities derived from PERs in the agricultural, education, and health
sectors. In January 2002, the central bank seized the Continent Bank, following a further
deterioration in the latter’s financial situation and pending a resolution plan.
11.
The implementation of structural measures was somewhat behind schedule;
nevertheless, by end-2001, all but one of the structural performance criteria and structural
benchmarks had been fully implemented (Appendix I, Table 2). There were technical delays
in establishing a regulatory framework, issuing guidelines, and authorizing commercial banks
to establish foreign currency deposits. However, by year’s end, one bank had been authorized
to offer foreign currency deposits, while others were working toward reaching this goal.
Moreover, the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) introduced a 364-day treasury bill
effective September 2001 and had earlier established a new Department of Rural Finance to
focus efforts on improving the supervision of microfinancing institutions and promoting the
provision of rural/informal finance, consistent with the authorities’ efforts to better serve the
poor. The Central Statistics Department (CSD) suffers from an acute manpower shortage and
has not been in a position to either improve the consumer price index (CPI)19 or to rebase the
national accounts to a more recent date (from the 1976/77 base currently used). The Fund
technical assistance mission in September 2001 recommended emergency measures to
bolster the CSD personnel, and the government agreed to provide funding for an immediate
increase of personnel in the National Accounts Section.
12.
Progress on other key reforms has been encouraging. With the assistance of the Fund
budget advisor, government accounts for 1998–99 were closed in August 2001 and, as in the
case of the 1991/92–97 accounts, were submitted to the Auditor General; it is expected that,

- 49 -

despite the loss of some relevant public records, arrangements can be made to complete the
audit of these accounts and permit the timely audit of public accounts for subsequent years.
13.
During 2001, substantial progress was made in improving access to technical
assistance in order to strengthen institutional capacity. Government undertook initial
discussions with Fund staff on the proposed Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP),
which aims to provide more comprehensive and better-coordinated technical assistance in
support of an improved formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies. Within
this context, the Fund agreed to extend the services of the resident budget advisor for one
year, and to provide a macroeconomic advisor in the Department of State for Finance and
Economic Affairs (DOSFEA). To complement these efforts, several Fund technical
assistance missions were mounted to review (a) the capacity to track poverty-reducing
expenditures, including those funded from enhanced HIPC Initiative debt relief; (b) the need
for strengthening tax administration; (c) the means to enhance the compilation of monetary,
price, and national accounts data; and (d) the requirements for strengthening the institutional
capacity of the central bank. The most recent mission found that, despite its considerable
need to strengthen institutional capacity, the central bank had implemented only a limited
number of past IMF recommendations. It was thus important to use a more integrated
approach for future technical assistance and monitor it carefully; meanwhile, the central bank
would have to continue to demonstrate its strong commitment to implement reforms.
14.
The government also worked better with multilateral institutions and donors in
identifying the technical assistance requirements for the PRSP. To this end, DOSFEA set up
a technical assistance coordination desk and has been working closely with the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in preparing a comprehensive technical assistance
program for the SPA II (PRSP). Moreover, the government agreed on a Capacity-Building
Project with the World Bank to strengthen public finance systems. The World Bank and the
United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) have also provided
assistance in developing the PERs, the poverty assessment, and the participatory process.
15.
With regard to the governance and political process, the settlement reached with
Alimenta should enhance investor confidence and catalyze reforms in the key groundnutmarketing sector. The presidential elections were conducted in October 2001, and President
Jammeh was reelected with 53 percent of the vote. During his second inauguration in
December, he condemned the September 11 attacks, granted amnesty to the former president
and his family, and called for national unity. The National Assembly elections took place in
January 2002, and the new Assembly was inaugurated on February 1. Following these
elections, the United States agreed in March to remove the suspension of economic aid to
The Gambia in force since the military coup in 1994. Local government elections were held
in April 2002.
16.
Economic developments through the first quarter of 2002 were characterized by the
implementation of expansionary fiscal policies. While revenues were broadly on target
(reflecting continued robust economic activity that benefited income tax collections and
measures to close tax loopholes, especially for public entities) expenditure overshot the

- 50 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

targets by about 2 percent of GDP, as elections-related outlays continued. There were some
increases in recurrent expenditure, funded mainly from the BTL accounts, where timely
reporting and control proved ineffective. Construction was started on the Mandinaba-Soma
road, funded by a payment of US$2.6 million on the US$35 million contract with the
construction company (Tetrax), and the implementation of a number of projects was also
accelerated.20 A balance from the disbursement of some funds by Taiwan Province of China
for the power project (including electricity generators imported in 2001) helped cushion the
level of the net government credit from the banking system and led also to a drop in the stock
of outstanding treasury bills. However, the end-March 2002 quantitative indicative targets
with respect to the basic primary balance of the central government and the net domestic
assets of the central bank were not observed. Delays in receipts of groundnut exports and
border controls that impeded the reexport trade added to pressure on the exchange rate of the
dalasi. Notwithstanding sales of foreign exchange by the central bank, the dalasi depreciated
by 5 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The end-March 2002 indicative target on net official
international reserves was not observed.
VII. OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR 2002/03–2004/05
17.
Consistent with the SPA II (the full PRSP) objectives, the government has formulated
a medium-term macroeconomic framework that aims at achieving macroeconomic stability
through market-based incentives that are conducive to robust private sector activities and
poverty alleviation. To this end, the focus will be on (a) further strengthening public finances
to contain the budget deficit and thus the high level of domestic debt; (b) continuing and
deepening structural reforms; (c) strengthening institutional capacity through extensive
recourse to technical assistance; (d) implementing a comprehensive social sector agenda,
especially in the agricultural, education, and health sectors; and (e) further strengthening the
macroeconomic and social databases to facilitate the formulation of policies that link
macroeconomic and social targets, especially focusing on the poor.
18.
The key macroeconomic objectives are to (a) maintain real GDP growth of about
6 percent annually during 2002–05; (b) limit average inflation to below 4 percent per annum
over the 2002–05 period; (c) contain the external current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) at about 10 percent by 2005; and (d) maintain gross external reserves over the
period at about 52 months of imports of goods and services. Total investment is projected to
increase from 17¾ percent of GDP in 2001 to 27¼ percent in 2005 from (4¾ percent to
12¼ percent, respectively, for the government), and the envisaged increase in the government
saving-investment balance of 7 percentage points of GDP (before PRSP-related expenditure)
would contribute to the improvement in the external current account

20

This level of implementation is not sustainable given resource and other constraints
including the onset of rains in May–June.

- 51 -

VIII. THE PROGRAM FOR 2002/03
19.
For 2002, real GDP is projected at about 6 percent on the basis of expected continued
strength in agriculture, buttressed by the reforms envisaged in groundnut marketing
following the settlement of the Alimenta dispute. Moreover, tourism and the reexport sectors
are expected to recover fully with the improved border relations, and overall economic
activity should benefit from improved infrastructure and utilities (electricity and telephones).
With the help of good weather and a bumper crop in 2001, coupled with tightened financial
policies, inflation is projected to decline to below 6 percent by end-2002.
A. Fiscal Policy
20.
Modifications have been introduced in the budget for 2002 to incorporate the impact
of recent developments, including the preliminary outturn for 2001 and the updated PERs in
the key social sectors, which reflect the costings of the priority policy interventions. The
budget incorporates interim debt relief of about US$4.4 million under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative provided by the Fund, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank/Fund.
On this basis, the overall deficit (excluding grants) is now projected at 5 percent of GDP;
including grants, the deficit will be reduced to 2½ percent of GDP. Allowing for the
enhanced HIPC Initiative debt-relief expenditure, the overall deficit would reach 6¼ percent
of GDP.
21.
Revenues are projected at about 17½ percent of GDP in 2002, underpinned by
measures to improve tax administration. These measures, in turn, are supported by Fund (tax
administration and tax policy missions visited Banjul in November 2001 and February 2002,
respectively) and World Bank technical assistance under the Capacity-Building Project.
Measures have been taken to prevent the emergence of new tax arrears21 and collect existing
arrears (estimated at D 32 million, or 0.5 percent of GDP), while a decision has been made to
discontinue the summer sales tax relief for hotels that was granted in 2001. The government
undertook an independent audit of the 2001 operations of the Customs and Excise
Department in April to ascertain and, if necessary, address revenue leakages; this constitutes
a prior action for the PRGF-supported program. With a view to ensuring satisfactory control
of duty exemptions and the timely collection of customs duties, the authorities will no longer
use the direct delivery system (with the exception of perishable and bulk cargo items) unless
a voucher is presented at the time of clearance. At the same time, action has been taken to
process such applications expeditiously to minimize the inconvenience to importers. To
support these efforts, the list of exemptions has been updated and will be gazetted shortly. As
recommended by the Fund tax administration mission, the domestic sales tax unit will be
transferred from the Customs and Excise Department to the Central Revenue Department as
21

A directive was issued in February 2002 that, henceforth, oil companies will pay the full
customs duty due on all oil products imported on behalf of NAWEC, thereby fully closing a
loophole through which that enterprise had accumulated tax arrears.

- 52 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

soon as possible to facilitate tax administration.22 Measures have been initiated to set up a
headquarters office to oversee the proposed tax reforms (and leave the existing Tax
Department to focus on collecting revenue) as a first step toward establishing an autonomous
revenue authority. Coordination among the revenue departments should benefit from
computerization, including the planned implementation of ASYCUDA II in the Customs and
Excise Department. Moreover, the government intends to follow up on the recommendations
of the Fund tax policy mission. A joint World Bank/Fund mission in June 2002 prepared a
joint work agenda to introduce the other planned reforms.
22.
On the expenditure side, the aim is to reduce recurrent expenditure to 17¾ percent of
GDP in 2002 from the estimated 20¼ percent in 2001 (the latter partly reflects the
nonrecurring current expenditure from last year). The key social and poverty sectors
identified in SPA II (PRSP) have received allocative priority, while a 6 percent across-theboard increase in the civil service salaries and public wages has been provided to help retain
skilled staff following a wage freeze for senior personnel in 2001. The government provided
a one-month salary advance to civil servants for Tobaski (a religious festival falling in
February 2002), which is repayable over a six-month period through automatic salary
deductions. Additional resources from the enhanced HIPC Initiative interim debt relief will
augment allocations to the priority social sectors. With donor support, capital expenditure is
projected to increase to 6¼ percent of GDP in 2002 (4¾ percent in 2001), in order to
strengthen the physical infrastructure and the agricultural, health, education, and judicial
sectors; the ultimate goal is to alleviate poverty, strengthen private sector activity, and
promote exports.
23.
To address the first quarter expenditure overruns, the government has agreed to
finance the Mandinaba-Soma road project with grants now expected from two donors.
Progress has been made in this regard, and as of early June 2002, US$1.6 million in grants
had been disbursed. Moreover, funds that had been set in escrow for this project (D 42
million) have been repatriated and paid back into the consolidated revenue fund. Recurrent
expenditure and the disbursement on a number of development projects, including the
Mandinaba-Soma road, will be slowed via tightened controls on the relevant BTL accounts.
Effective May 2002, all expenditure from BTL accounts will require proper documentation
and reporting. Additionally, the filling of vacancies in the budget unit and the Auditor
General’s office should help improve expenditure control and auditing.
24.
A cabinet paper approved in September 2001 outlined comprehensive budgetary
reforms associated with the requirements of the SPA II (PRSP), triggers for debt relief under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the PRGF-supported program. These reforms are centered
22

Access to corporate income statements provides the Central Revenue Department with the
best means to also administer the domestic sales tax. This will require a change in the law to

ATTACHMENT II

on the Accountant General’s Office and are aimed at improving the reporting and control of
expenditure, including the BTL accounts, as well as expediting the reconciliation and closing
of public accounts. The new system should also subsequently facilitate conversion to
program budgeting in line with the objectives of the PERs (and, eventually, the medium-term
expenditure framework—MTEF) and improve expenditure classification to reflect better the
SPA II (PRSP) and enhanced HIPC Initiative priorities. Complementary reforms will also be
aimed at the Auditor General’s Office, among other things, to expedite the audit of accounts.
Currently, the white paper on the Commission of Inquiry on the former Auditor General and
a paper on its recommendation have been placed on the cabinet’s agenda. The government
looks forward to continued Fund technical assistance in those areas, with the return of the
resident budget advisor and the placing of a DOSFEA macroeconomic advisor in Banjul. The
work of the latter would also facilitate coordination within DOSFEA and between the
DOSFEA and the central bank through improved regular reporting and projections of fiscal
data (revenue, expenditure, debt service, external assistance, and government borrowing
requirements); the latter is a key input in liquidity forecasting and would facilitate monetary
policy formulation. Other donors, including the World Bank, UNDP, and DFID, would also
play a key role in implementing these reforms.
25.
The government is implementing measures to deal firmly with the reemergence of
cross arrears between the government and the public enterprises (PEs), including the abovementioned tax arrears, owed, among others, by GAMTEL and NAWEC. As of endJanuary 2002, the government had accumulated arrears of D 43.5 million (0.7 percent of
GDP) to PEs, while the latter had accumulated an estimated D 138 million in arrears to the
government. A cabinet paper was prepared to highlight the problem and proposed a
comprehensive program to address the financial problems of the PEs and a mutual settlement
of these arrears. Quarterly targets leading to the elimination of these cross arrears by mid2003 were agreed with the key public enterprises. The longer-term issues of PEs will be
addressed in a donor-funded study that will provide recommendations to restructure or
privatize eight Track II PEs (see also Subsection D below).
B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reforms
26.
The key objectives of monetary policy during 2002 are to reduce inflation and
strengthen external reserves. To these ends, the government will maintain prudent fiscal
policies and a tight monetary policy (while providing adequate credit to the private sector),
and promote exchange rate flexibility consistent with a further buildup of official reserves.
The avoidance of unprogrammed increases in net credit to the government, such as those
associated with payments to Alimenta and related developments in 2001, will also be an
important objective for monetary policy in 2002. Through sales of securities, the central bank
will seek to moderate the growth of broad money from an estimated 19 percent during 2001
to 13 percent by end-2002, in line with projected nominal GDP growth.
27.
Reforms in the financial sector will aim at improving the operation of the money
market, making interest rates more flexible, and enhancing the soundness and efficiency of
the financial system. To assist in these tasks, the CBG received three Fund technical

- 54 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

assistance missions in 2001, including the December mission, which undertook a diagnostic
review of the capacity requirements and past Fund technical assistance. In August 2001, the
CBG received additional Fund technical assistance, which recommended measures to
improve monetary statistics. The recommendations of these missions to address weaknesses
in the CBG’s core functions—supervision, monetary operations, reserve management,
payments systems, and internal controls—will form a key part of the medium-term reforms.
The latter in turn, should also take into account the need for the central bank to continue to
demonstrate a strong commitment to implement reforms, as well as the means to improve the
effectiveness of technical assistance. To these ends, the central bank has started to implement
a package of measures that will also trigger its access to Fund technical assistance under the
TCAP. These measures include (a) a CBG board resolution to support the above-mentioned
reform measures; (b) initiation of a review of the Central Bank Act; (c) revision (to reflect
the mission’s recommendations) and resubmission of the Financial Institutions and the
Insurance Bills for parliamentary approval; (d) establishment of a committee to prioritize,
coordinate, and enhance the CBG’s training program; (e) preparation of a resolution plan for
an insolvent bank and two insurance companies; (f) introduction of a liquidity-forecasting
framework and operation of the book-entry system; (g) issuance of the revised foreign
currency deposit prudential regulations to commercial banks; and (h) the filling of vacancies,
particularly in the banking and insurance areas. Items (a) and (b) above, which were both
implemented in February 2002, are also prior actions for the PRGF-supported program for
2002/03–2004/05. The proposed legislation and the various technical assistance
recommendations require extensive revisions in the financial institutions’ reporting
requirements, which will be addressed during 2002–03.
28.
Nonperforming loans had declined to 6.8 percent of total outstanding loans by endMarch 2002 from 13.6 percent in June 2000, and provisioning for nonperforming loans at
end-March 2002 remained above 90 percent of such loans in 2001. The government will
encourage banks to maintain their capital adequacy ratios above the legal requirement of
8 percent and has taken steps to strengthen the management capacity of a financial institution
that has not been meeting some of these standards.23 The CBG is now working on a
resolution plan for the Continent Bank and has commissioned an audit of the bank by an
international firm—KPMG. Details of the resolution plan will be discussed with the Fund
before it is finalized and implemented. The CBG’s Rural Finance Department is expected to
play a key role in efforts to improve the supervision and growth of the microfinance sector.
29.
During 2002, The Gambia will continue to pursue regional monetary integration
through collaboration with five other countries in west Africa24 to establish a West African

The CBG proscribed the Continent Bank in August 10, 2001 and seized it on
January 11, 2002 following a deterioration of the latter’s financial situation.

Monetary Zone (WAMZ) by 2003. In April 2001, the West African Monetary Institute
(WAMI) was established, with a mandate to prepare the groundwork for the establishment by
2003 of the West African Central Bank (WACB), which will function as the central authority
of the WAMZ.
30.
To address the problem of the large stock of government domestic debt (33 percent of
GDP at end-2001), whose service absorbs more than 20 percent of government domestic
revenue, the government has focused on efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit (excluding grants
and the fully-funded HIPC Initiative expenditure) to sustainable levels. Furthermore, the
government plans to use part of the proceeds from privatization, available donor assistance,
and a part of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to further reduce the stock of
domestic debt. Since a sizable part of this debt is held by commercial banks, it will be
important that its reduction avoid an injection of liquidity in the economy. A solution may lie
in the establishment of an offshore entity that would take over the debt, or through
debt/equity swaps for selected public institutions.
C. External Sector Policies
31.
On the basis of the economic policies detailed above, the external current account
deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to decline to about 13¼ percent of GDP in
2002. The volume of total exports (excluding reexports) is projected to increase by about
6.8 percent, reflecting a further expansion in groundnut, fruit, and fish production. It is also
expected that groundnut exports will contain a larger proportion of high-quality nuts. While
import volumes are projected to decline by about 2.7 percent in 2002,25 the reexport trade is
expected to continue to recover, with improved cross-border relations and external
competitiveness via a depreciated exchange rate, as well as the better availability of foreign
exchange, including through the introduction of foreign currency deposits. The terms of
trade, excluding reexports, are projected to improve by 1.4 percent in 2002. Receipts from
tourism are expected to increase significantly as the sector—supported by an increase in
weekly flights and the recent creation of the National Tourism Authority (see below)—
continues to recover from the sharp decline in 2000. Donor assistance is also projected to
increase, contributing to gross official reserves of SDR 87.7 million in 2002, a level
equivalent to about five months of import cover. A financing gap of SDR 10.3 million is
projected for 2002 (SDR 76.5 million, including PRSP-related funding gaps for 2002–05),
which is expected to be covered by recourse to Fund and donor assistance, the latter likely
through a donor roundtable meeting planned for September 2002.
32.
The government remains committed to a liberal trade and exchange system. It will
continue to assess the impact of the reduction in the external tariff to a maximum rate of
18 percent and in the number of tariff bands from ten to three in 2000, as well as of the
reforms in the neighboring West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
25

Taking into account the generators imported in 2001.

- 56 -

ATTACHMENT II

countries (which maintain a maximum external tariff of 20 percent). Efforts have been
intensified to improve the balance of payments data, based on the recommendation of the
September 2000 Fund technical assistance. Technical assistance was received from DFID
in 2001 to launch surveys of foreign direct investment, while the UNDP assisted with the full
introduction of ASYCUDA to, inter alia, generate trade data on a timely basis. The reduction
in external tariffs, together with the pursuit of prudent financial policies and a market-based
flexible exchange rate, should benefit The Gambia’s external competitiveness.
33.
The government intends to use the remaining proceeds of the Fund interim assistance
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, approved on December 15, 2000, to meet debt-service
payment on its existing debt to the Fund as they fall due during 2002. Measures have been
taken to strengthen the loan and debt management unit at the DOSFEA with additional
staffing and equipment, in order to improve the quality and timeliness of external debt data.
Efforts are also under way to obtain debt relief from all other creditors. The Gambia will opt
to participate in the sovereign credit rating assessment, funded either by the U.S. government
or the UNDP.
D. Structural and Sectoral Policies
34.
The efforts to modernize business-related legislation and regulations have gathered
momentum with the December 2001 National Assembly enactment of the Regulatory and
Procurement Acts, which also provide for the establishment of implementing agencies to
regulate privatized utilities and handle public procurement, respectively. A contract has been
tendered for a DFID-funded PE regulatory study. Since May 2000, the government has
worked closely with the Commonwealth Secretariat to develop a competition policy (a draft
has been completed) and, eventually, a Competition Bill to remove legal and regulatory
impediments to competitive markets. In July 2001, legislation was approved by the National
Assembly that, inter alia, set up the National Tourism Authority (a largely private sectordriven body) to promote the industry, including through the classification of hotels to
improve the quality of service. Preparatory work is about to be launched on the Tourism
Master Plan for 2002–20, funded by the AfDB. A part of the broader agenda on private
sector legislation will entail efforts to introduce various bills (on business transactions,
organization, and partnership), which together, will replace the existing antiquated Company
Act. The Mortgage and Money-Laundering Bills will be drafted, which would help to
streamline and further strengthen the regulation of the financial sector.
35.
Regarding the public enterprise sector, the Privatization Act introduced in 2000, inter
alia, formalized the establishment of the Gambia Divestiture Agency (GDA). The GDA is
undertaking a major review of public enterprise finances to help disentangle government
finances from the former, while a longer-term study will pave the way for further
privatization. Already, the privatization of Track I public enterprises26 has been approved by
26

Ten public enterprises that can be sold without need for legislative and regulatory support,
including the former Alimenta, Denton Bridge, and Kaur processing plants and barges.

- 57 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

cabinet; the GDA will channel part of the privatization proceeds into the divestiture account
at the central bank. In 2002, up to D 25 million will be transferred from the divestiture
account to reduce the government’s domestic debt.
36.
During 2002, the government will start to implement the Trade Gateway Project
(US$23 million) approved by the World Bank in February 2002. The project will, among
other things, enable The Gambia to establish an export-processing zone to promote private
sector activity consistent with the PRSP objectives. The project will also promote investment
in the country through the one-stop Investment Promotion Center and will support further
efforts toward privatization. To this end, further studies on public enterprises, beyond the
cabinet paper mentioned above, would assist the government in elaborating policies and
reforms in this area.
37.
In agriculture, the government intends to continue to work with the European Union
(EU) and the Agri-Business Service Plan Association (ASPA), the latter comprising farmers
and buyers, in order to improve the marketing of groundnuts and encourage the ASPA to
adhere to a schedule of public announcements of producer prices early in the planting season.
The settlement of the Alimenta dispute and the proposed privatization of its processing plants
and barges among competing and reputable firms should promote private crop financing
while contributing to better earnings by farmers. This privatization program is being prepared
by the GDA; meanwhile, experts provided through EU technical assistance have evaluated
the assets in preparation for their expected offers for sale. Already, the government has
injected some D 15 million to improve these assets, in order to facilitate groundnut marketing
during the 2001/02 season and the subsequent asset sale. Moreover, the proposed EU audit of
the 1999/2000 operations of the trading companies will provide remedies to ensure adherence
to proper internal control measures in compliance with industry standards. The government
intends to make timely arrangements to help provide improved seed, fertilizer, and
microfinance facilities to farmers, the latter through the US$10 million International Fund for
Agricultural Development Rural Finance and Community Initiative. Significant support for
the fishing sector will be provided by projects, worth some US$13 million, to build a second
cold storage facility and establish artisanal facilities in during 2002.
38.
The government is implementing a governance program adopted during the
March 2000 roundtable meeting in Banjul, including reforms to (a) strengthen the
constitutional and electoral processes; (b) strengthen the National Assembly structures and
processes; (c) promote civic education and enhance civil participation in the political process;
(d) improve the legal and judicial processes; (e) decentralize and reform the local
government system; and (f) improve the management and transparency of public finances. A
number of these reforms are also being supported by the DFID, EU, and UNDP and are being
implemented in the context of the SPA II (PRSP).
39.
As part of implementing the PRGF-supported program, the government intends to put
in place measures that comprise structural benchmarks outlined in Table 11 of this Appendix.

- 58 -

E. Social and Poverty Reduction Policies
40.
The launching of the SPA II (PRSP), which has drawn on The Gambia’s experience
since 1992 to develop a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, marks a milestone in,
among other things, the evolution of the PRGF-supported program. The latter is now based
on SPA II (PRSP) and thus incorporates the views of Gambians, including the poor. SPA II
(PRSP) has significantly improved the government’s ability to identify the poor and the
sources of poverty, and to intensify efforts to develop intervention to better target the poor.
Accordingly, the PRGF highlights the SPA II (PRSP) program “pillars,” namely, the efforts
to create an environment conducive to sustained high growth (targeting income generation in
rural agriculture), while providing the means to increase the allocation of public resources
and the delivery of social services. While our articulation of the agricultural sector strategy
will require more time to develop, the preparation of PERs in key sectors has provided an
early means of linking sector and national budget priorities—a process that has been
reinforced by interim resources provided through debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. Moreover, the PRGF-supported program draws extensively on our efforts, in
collaboration with various donors, to promote the role of the private sector; enhance
transparency and accountability for public finances; improve macroeconomic and social data
to strengthen poverty policy analysis; and access technical assistance to support institutional
capacity.
41.
The budget for 2002 provides the first attempt at integrating PERs and debt relief
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, in order to allocate increased resources for the social
sectors and for development expenditure. The system for reporting on poverty-reducing
expenditure established last year, including the special HIPC Initiative account at the central
bank, will become fully operational in 2002 with the issuance of the first biannual reports
(May and November), designed, inter alia, to make further progress toward the triggers for
the enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point. The broader resource requirements of the
SPA II (PRSP) have been evaluated in conjunction with the financing gaps in the PRGFsupported program and will be presented to the donor roundtable meeting planned for the
second half of 2002.
42.
The government is aware that the updating of the comprehensive poverty reduction
strategy will place a considerable burden on institutional capacity and necessitate further
reforms to improve the delivery and monitoring of enhanced public services. In this regard, it
intends to intensify collaboration with donors, including the Fund, to ensure timely access to,
and effective use of, technical assistance.
F. Statistical Issues
43.
The Gambia’s economic and financial statistics remain in need of improvement,
especially with regard to the major components of the balance of payments, the national
accounts and prices, public investment, the public enterprise sector, and employment.
Moreover, data on the social sectors and poverty need to be substantially improved and better
integrated with mainstream economic data. The government has benefited from the

- 59 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

recommendations of various recent Fund technical assistance missions to strengthen the
compilation of economic data. A notable development is the recent effort to improve the
staffing of the CSD on an interim basis, pending the longer-term restructuring of the
department into an independent agency, by offering better incentives to retain staff. Apart
from generating macroeconomic data, the CSD is expected to play an important role in
carrying out the household survey, the baseline delivery survey for social amenities, and the
2003 housing and population census. These efforts are key to improving the capacity for
undertaking poverty and social impact analyses. The country is also benefiting from
participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and uses the framework to
improve the quality, timeliness, and transparency of data provision.
G. The Technical Cooperation Action Plan (TCAP)
44.
Following our request to the Fund management for technical assistance in April 2001,
the government has worked closely with the Fund staff and other donors to prepare a
comprehensive technical assistance program for the PRSP. It is expected that the coordinated
effort will promote complementary efforts aimed at covering the key requirements for
technical assistance through a careful identification of gaps. These gaps would then be
presented to the donor roundtable meeting planned for September 2002, together with the
SPA II (PRSP) for funding. Within this framework, considerable work has been undertaken
by the Fund staff to prepare a comprehensive TCAP aimed at promoting performance under a
possible new three-year PRGF arrangement.
IX. PROGRAM MONITORING AND REVIEW
45.
To monitor policy implementation under the program, prior actions, a number of
quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2002, and quantitative benchmarks have
been identified. Issuance of the papers on the request for the PRGF arrangement will be
subject to three prior actions, comprising (a) a CBG board resolution in support of the
reforms recommended by the December 2001 Fund technical assistance mission; (b) the
initiation of a review of the Central Bank Act, with a view to modernizing the act; and (c) the
audit of the 2001 operations of the Customs and Excise Department. Items (a) and (b) are
drawn from a group of measures that will also trigger Fund technical assistance to the CBG
under the TCAP.
46.
Performance under the first annual program under the PRGF arrangement will be
monitored on the basis of the following quantitative performance criteria for endSeptember 2002: (a) a ceiling on net bank credit to the government; (b) a ceiling on net
domestic assets of the central bank; (c) a floor on the basic primary balance of the
government; (d) the nonaccumulation of external payments arrears; (e) a minimum level of
net official international reserves; (f) a limit on new nonconcessional external loans
contracted or guaranteed by the central government in the maturity ranges of 1–12 years; and
(g) a zero ceiling on the outstanding stock of short-term external public debt (excluding
normal import-related credits). The performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external
payments arrears will be applied on a continuous basis. Also, quantitative benchmarks have

- 60 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

been established for these variables for end-June 2002; indicative targets on the same
variables were agreed for end-December 2002. In addition, quarterly financial indicators
were established on total government revenue, the wage bill, and the primary budget balance.
47.
The program also includes a number of structural benchmarks for various dates as
indicated in Table 2 of this Appendix.
48.
In addition, policy implementation under the first annual program under the PRGF
arrangement will be assessed by two reviews. Disbursement of the second loan under the
PRGF arrangement will be conditional on the observance of the end-September 2002
performance criteria and the completion of the first review no later than end-December 2002.
The disbursement of the third loan will be subject to the observance of the end-March 2003
performance criteria and completion of the second review no later than end-June 2003.

(As of May 8, 2002)

I. INTRODUCTION
49.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Gambian authorities and
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of quantitative and
structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the third annual arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), as well as the related reporting
requirements. The tables with the latest actual data for the monetary aggregates, as well as
the preliminary estimates for March 2002 used for the derivation of the flows for the program
period, are included in the staff report (Tables 6 and 7).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING STANDARDS
A. Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of The Gambia
50.
Definition. Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets less
liabilities to foreign residents of maturity of one year or less and less borrowing from the
IMF. Gold holdings will be valued at U.S. dollar market prices, together with foreign
currency holdings, at the bilateral exchange rates prevailing on March 31, 2002. The NIR
shall be converted into dalasis at the exchange rate prevailing on March 31, 2002 (estimated
at D 21.3000 per SDR). Reserve assets are defined for this purpose as external assets readily
available to, or controlled by, the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG). Pledged or otherwise
encumbered reserves assets, including, but not limited to, reserves assets used as collateral or
guarantee for third-party external liability, are to be excluded.
51.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on the net international reserves of the central bank
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of disbursed external budgetary support
(comprising non-project-related loans and grants) at the end of each quarter in excess (in
shortfall) of the programmed amounts in the budget (Appendix I, Table 1).
52.
Supporting material. Net international reserves of the central bank will be
transmitted on a weekly basis within ten days of the end of each week; the net foreign assets
of the commercial banks and external budgetary support will be transmitted on a monthly
basis within six weeks of the end of each month.
B. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank
53.
Definition. The net domestic assets of the central bank are defined as the difference
between reserve money (the sum of currency outside banks and all deposits of the
commercial banks, excluding deposits of the central government) and the net foreign assets
of the central bank, converted at the foreign exchange rate specified in paragraph 2. Net
foreign assets are defined as NIR plus other claims on, and liabilities to, foreign residents.

- 65 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT III

54.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on net domestic assets of the central bank will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of disbursed external budgetary support

Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on net claims on the central government by the
central bank will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of disbursed external
budgetary support (comprising non-project-related loans and grants) at the end of each
quarter in excess (in shortfall) of the programmed amounts in the central government budget
(Appendix I, Table 1).
58.
Supporting material. Data on cumulative government revenue and expenditure, on
the net central government position with the central bank, and on treasury bills outstanding,
as well as data on external loans and grants to the government, will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within six weeks of the end of each month.
D. Basic Primary Balance of the Central Government
59.
The basic primary balance is defined as government domestic revenue (tax and
nontax) minus total expenditure and net lending, excluding interest payments and externally
financed capital expenditure.
E. External Payments Arrears
60.
Definition. External payments arrears are defined as the stock of external arrears on
loans contracted or guaranteed by the public sector (as defined below in paragraph 14),
except on debts subject to rescheduling or a stock-of-debt operation.
61.
Supporting material. An accounting of nonreschedulable external arrears by creditor
countries (if any), with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within
four weeks of the end of each month. This accounting would include, separately, arrears
owed by the central government and other public sector entities to Paris Club creditors, nonParis Club creditors, and other creditors.

F. New Nonconcessional External Public Sector Debt
Contracted or Guaranteed by the Central Government
62.
Definitions. In this memorandum, the public sector consists of the central and
regional governments and other public agencies, including the Central Bank of The Gambia.
This performance criterion is on the contracting or guaranteeing of external debt with
original maturity of 1-12 years by the government.27 Excluded from this performance
criterion is debt with borrowing from the IMF and with a grant element of at least 35 percent.
The grant element is to be calculated by using currency-specific discount rates reported by
the OECD (commercial interest reference rates): for maturities of less than 15 years, the
grant element will be calculated based on six-month averages of commercial interest rates,
and, for maturities longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on tenyear averages.
63.
Supporting material. A comprehensive record, including a loan-by-loan accounting
of all new concessional and nonconcessional debt contracted or guaranteed by the public
sector, with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within four weeks
of the end of each quarter. Nonconcessional external debt over one year includes financial
leases and other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or otherwise, on
concessional terms.
G. Outstanding Stock of External Public Debt
64.
This performance criterion is the outstanding stock of external public sector debt with
original maturity of less than one year owed or guaranteed by the central government.28
Excluded from this performance criterion are normal import-related credits.
65.
Supporting material. A comprehensive record of all external debt with original
maturity of less than one year owed or contracted by the public sector, with detailed
explanations, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within four weeks of the end of each
quarter.
III. PRIOR ACTIONS AND QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
66.
To monitor policy implementation, three prior actions and a number of quantitative
benchmarks have been proposed over the course of the program, as well as quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks for end-September 2002 (see Appendix I, Table 1). The
27

This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point no. 9 of the “IMF
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt” (adopted by the Executive
Board of the Fund on August 24, 2000), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed
for which value has not been received.
28

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point no. 9 of the “IMF Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt,” adopted on August 24, 2000.

- 67 -

will be applied on a continuous basis. Limits on items (a)-(g) above for end-September 2002
will serve as quantitative performance criteria. Indicative targets have been set for endDecember 2002. Five structural benchmarks are outstanding, set for specific dates through
end-November 2002, and a continuous indicative target on the avoidance of external arrears
has also been set (Appendix I, Table 2).
IV. STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS

APPENDIX II

Safeguards Assessments
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG)
is subject to a full Stage One safeguards assessment with respect to the forthcoming
PRGF arrangement. Based upon the off-site review of information submitted by the
CBG, it was concluded that a safeguards mission should be conducted to draw definitive
conclusions and determine possible recommendations, including timing, prior to
completing the safeguards assessment. In this regard, an on-site safeguards assessment
mission will visit The Gambia before September 2002. The first review under the PRGF
arrangement will address potential issues emerging from the safeguards assessment.
Exchange rate arrangement
Prior to January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound
sterling at a rate of D 5=,1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange
was introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. At
end-April 2002, the midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D 18.7 per U.S.
dollar.
The Gambia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 21,
1993.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2001 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 01/148) was concluded by the

APPENDIX III

The Gambia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 30, 2002)
1.
The World Bank, through IDA, has assisted the government in pursuing four main
objectives: (a) establishment of a macroeconomic and sectoral environment conducive to
economic growth; (b) rehabilitation and development of infrastructure; (c) development of
human capital through the provisions of more efficient social services; and (d) capacity
building in departments that have a key role for economic management. Instruments used in
supporting these objectives have been adjustment lending (first and second structural
adjustment credits (SAL I and SAL II)), buttressed by sector-based rehabilitation and
investment projects.
2.
In addition to SAL II, which provided a global framework for its support, past IDA
lending has supported policy and institutional reforms. Among others, the Enterprise
Development Project assisted in promoting private sector investment in small and mediumscale activities. Past projects in the transport, utility, and urban sectors promoted private
sector activities by improving the maintenance and rehabilitation of infrastructure, and by
rendering better services with a more efficient use of public resources.
3.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for The Gambia for fiscal years (FY) 19982001, endorsed by the Board on September 10, 1998, is under implementation. At the end of
FY 2001, the Bank’s lending portfolio reflected its base-case scenario, and the proposed
Trade Gateway Project would occur under the high-case scenario. A new CAS is under
preparation (Board presentation currently scheduled for fall 2002).
4.
As of April 30, 2002, IDA had approved 30 credits for a total amount of about
US$271 million, with an undisbursed amount of about US$70 million. The current portfolio
consists of six projects in health, education, poverty alleviation, capacity building for
economic management, and the private sector, totaling US$99 million.
5.
In health, the Participatory Health/Population/Nutrition operation was approved in
March 1998. It aims at improving the quality of services related to reproductive health, infant
and child health, and nutrition for women of reproductive age, infants, and children. It also
aims at improving the quality of management and implementation of a family health
program. An HIV/AIDS Rapid Response operation was approved in January 2001. The
project aims at (a) containing the HIV/AIDS pandemic; (b) reducing the spread of the
pandemic and mitigating its effects; and (c) increasing access to prevention services, as well
as treatment, care, and support for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.
6.
In education, the Third Education Sector Project was approved in September 1998 to
support the implementation of the second half of the government's Education Sector Policy
Framework, 1988–2005, and its accompanying investment program.
7.
A Poverty Alleviation and Municipal Development operation was approved in
March 1999, with the following objectives: (a) to reduce the backlog in public infrastructure

- 75 -

APPENDIX III

development and improve the maintenance of public assets; (b) to alleviate poverty through
the creation of temporary jobs and improvements in the selection of small and medium-sized
investments, which should aim at upgrading the living environment of the poor; and (c) to
strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of local authorities (with an emphasis on
their financial situation), local private firms (namely, consultants and contractors), and
Gamworks (a procurement agency).
8.
A Capacity Building for Economic Management Project was approved in July
2001 to help (a) build government capacity for economic planning, policy formulation, and
execution, and (b) build the capacity of the judicial and financial systems to facilitate private
sector development.
9.
A trade Gateway Project was approved in February 2002 to help the country
establish itself as a globally competitive export and processing center by laying the
foundation for expanded private investment, export-oriented production, and employment,
through the establishment of a free zone and an improved institutional environment.
10.
As of April 30, 2002, the IFC’s portfolio had two investments with a balance of about
US$0.6 million. The current portfolio includes investments for a medical clinic (Ndebaan),
and commercial fishing (Lyefish).
11.
IDA, MIGA, and the IFC will continue to coordinate their respective roles to support
development activities in The Gambia. These activities are being enhanced by the IFC’s
office in Dakar, which also oversees the IFC’s activities in The Gambia.

APPENDIX IV

The Gambia: Statistical Issues
73.
There are substantial weaknesses in The Gambia's economic and financial statistics,
especially in the national accounts, balance of payments, and external debt statistics.
Although these weaknesses do not preclude a meaningful assessment of economic policies,
the reporting delays and poor quality of some of the data hamper the analysis of recent
economic developments. The authorities have recently provided most core data to the Fund
in a timely manner. Available data are published in the central bank's quarterly bulletins and
the Central Statistics Department's (CSD) publications. The Gambia has volunteered to serve
as a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) pilot country. In November 1999, a STA
technical mission helped the authorities to develop the metadata for the GDDS. The metadata
are now available on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Real sector
74.
An STA real sector expert provided assistance on the Consumer price index (CPI)
and national accounts in August 2001. According to his report, annual national accounts
estimates are compiled on the basis of indicators in the absence of comprehensive
information on various economic activities and are available only from the production side.
Reliable data on employment and labor costs are also not available. The breakdown by
expenditure category is largely estimated by Fund staff. It should be possible to make
independent estimates from the expenditure side for the year 1998, when a comprehensive
household survey was carried out. However, improvements in accounts will require adequate
staffing of the CSD and the improvement of data collection through surveys.
75.
STA technical experts provided assistance on national accounts in NovemberDecember 1998. During 2000, the authorities published documentation on sources and
methods used in the current series of GDP by kind of economic activity. Also, the
publication of national accounts for fiscal years (FY) 1995/96 and 1996/97 (June–July) and
calendar years 1997 and 1998 will be completed by year’s end. Currently, the national
accounts section of the CSD is engaged in the following improvements: (a) to move the base
year from 1976/77 to a more recent year; (b) to provide estimates of private final
consumption; and (c) to change the framework of national accounts from the 1968 System of
National Accounts (SNA) to the 1993 SNA.
76.
Currently, the CSD publishes low-income CPI data using weights based on the
1976/77 survey. The geographical area covered by the price survey is also limited to the
greater Banjul area, and there are consistency issues in price data for nonfood items. A new
consumer price index (with a base of July 1994-June 1995) for the low-and middle-income
population in the greater Banjul area has been produced, using new weights from the 1992/93
household expenditure survey. However, the household survey data underlying these weights
are thought to be rather weak. During 1998, an extensive household survey was undertaken
to map the poverty situation in the country. As the survey covered all of the country and was
large in size, it could form the basis for a new weights system for the CPI. As with the

- 78 -

APPENDIX IV

national accounts, improvements in the CPI will also require adequate staffing of the CSD
and the improvement of data collection through surveys.
Government finance
77.
The authorities provide the staff with current information on central government
revenue and expenditure. Data on domestic government financing are also available on a
monthly basis with a short lag. The three-year rolling public investment program has not
been updated for some time, and the execution of public investment needs closer monitoring.
The latest annual data reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook and International Financial Statistics (IFS) correspond to 1993.
Monetary data
78.
Monthly balance sheet data of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) are available
within two weeks after the end of the reference month, and data for the monetary survey with
a lag of one month. The coverage of banks in the monetary survey is comprehensive, and the
banks follow a uniform chart of accounts to report financial data to the CBG. Flash reports of
key monetary data are also sent from the banks to the CBG on a weekly basis. Over the past
two years, the CBG has introduced several reclassifications of the monetary accounts in an
attempt to improve sectorization and coverage, as well as to harmonize the data reported to
STA and AFR.
79.
The STA mission on monetary statistics in August 2001 made recommendations
regarding the inclusion of noncommercial bank depository corporations (the Postal Savings
Bank and Village savings and credit associations (VISACAs)) in the monetary survey. In
addition, the mission recommended reclassification of several items on the balance sheets of
commercial banks and the CBG, and suggested changes in the reporting procedure to
harmonize data between STA and AFR. The CBG has made some progress in implementing
these recommendations, and STA is envisaging a follow-up mission later this year.
Balance of payments
80.
The Gambia's external transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in
the informal sector. For example, the bulk of the reexport trade is unrecorded. Therefore,
balance of payments statistics have to be supplemented by estimates of activity in the
informal sector. The central bank estimates reexports as a fixed share of total imports.
Tourism revenue is estimated based on tourist arrival data from the relevant ministry. Data
on private capital flows are poor, mainly because survey data are nonexistent. Data on
official grants and loan disbursements and repayments are relatively good. Data on the gross
and net international reserves of the central bank are available with a short lag.
81.
The Fund provided technical assistance (TA) on balance of payment statistics in JuneJuly 1999 and September 2000. In reviewing progress, the 2000 mission noted that
significant advances had been made in the compilation of balance of payments statistics and
that several of the 1999 mission’s recommendations had been implemented. Based largely on

- 79 -

APPENDIX IV

the mission’s recommendations, The CBG established a balance of payments unit, equipped
with computer resources, and successfully initiated surveys of the banking sector, insurance
companies, travel and shipping agents, hotels, and foreign embassies. The government has
fully computerized its database on the stock of external public debt and the related debtservice obligations, using the Commonwealth Secretariat’s debt-reporting and management
system with technical assistance from The World Bank.
82.
Further steps to improve cooperation and coordination between the Central Statistics
Department and Customs and Excise Department have been taken. The CBG has recently
received assistance from DFI, which is a United Kingdom-based consulting company
contracted by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) to support the
central bank in estimating the level of private capital flows. As part of this support, the CBG
will be establishing a balance of payments committee consisting of relevant government
agencies, companies, and organizations, partly to raise awareness and partly to ensure their
cooperation in providing information on a timely basis. A register of establishments has been
compiled with support from The Gambia Chamber of Commerce and the Registrar of
Companies, and a survey of these has been undertaken (a structural benchmark for
September 30, 2001).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 8, 2002

IMF Concludes

2002 Article IV Consultation

with The Gambia

On July 8, 2002, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with The Gambia.’
Background
Overall economic performance in The Gambia during 2001 and the early part of 2002 was
mixed. The economy benefited from robust real GDP growth with moderate inflation. Notable
progress was also achieved in the settlement of the property dispute with Alimenta’ (the last
payment of US$5 million out of a total of US$11.5 million was in August 2001). Important gains
were made in implementing economic and structural reforms. However, there were budgetary
slippages leading to a sizeable increase in the overall budget deficit. Presidential, national and
local elections were held in late 2001 and early 2002 and the full Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP) was finalized and forwarded to the Fund and the World Bank in May 2002.
In 2001, real GDP growth was 6 percent, underpinned by strong performance of agriculture,
tourism, and the construction sectors. Average annual inflation (based on the low-income
consumer price index) edged up to 4’/2 percent, slightly above the target of 4 percent, driven by
higher imported inflation (via the depreciation of the dalasis) and expansionary fiscal policies.

’ Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities. In this PIN, the main features of the Board’s discussion are described.

-2The external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have increased
to 14% percent of GDP in 2001 from 12 percent in 2000, reflecting one-off importation of
electricity generators to improve generation and distribution; reexports were slowed by crossborder difficulties. The real effective exchange rate of the dalasi depreciated by 8 percent during
2001, contributing to an improvement to the external competitiveness of The Gambia. The nondisbursement of donor grants (equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP) contributed to the decline in
gross official reserves to SDR 81.4 million at the end of 2001 (against SDR 86.3 million in
2000), equivalent of about 4.9 months of import cover.
The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) increased to 8% percent of GDP in 2001 from about
3% percent in 2000. The deficit including grants, at 7.6 percent of GDP, significantly exceeded
the target of about 3 percent, reflecting delayed receipt of donor grants. The government
incurred one-off expenditures comprising (a) repayment to commercial banks related to the
1999/2000 groundnut financing; (b) D15 million to rehabilitate the former Alimenta assets in
order to facilitate groundnut marketing; and (c) on-lending to a public enterprise to improve the
supply of electricity; and (d) election-related outlays. Additionally, there were revenue shortfalls,
including in customs revenue (1.3 percent of GDP), reflecting weak performance in tax
administration and financial problems of public enterprises, as the latter built sizeable arrears to
the government.
Monetary policy was accommodating as domestic credit expansion, both to the government and
the private sector, exceeded the targets at end-2001. Through end-2001, net credit to the
government increased by 8.3 percent of GDP, which was significantly above the target, while
credit to the private sector increased by 12.8 percent. However, broad money growth, which
accelerated to about 35 percent in 2000, moderated to 19.4 percent in 2001, reflecting
measures to mop up banks’ excess reserves. Reserve money, mainly currency outside banks,
also exceeded the program target. The treasury bill rate was raised from 12.5 percent in August
to 15 percent by October 2001.
Notwithstanding some delays, there was significant progress in implementing structural reforms
and arrangements to access technical assistance to strengthen the limited institutional capacity.
A number of reforms were implemented to strengthen budgetary performance, including the
closing of public accounts for 1991/92-1999, developing an accounting framework to monitor
expenditure on poverty reduction, including expenditure funded from the enhanced HIPC
Initiative debt relief, developing a framework to facilitate timely reconciliation of treasury cash
books with the accounts of central bank, and bringing a number of below-the-line accounts
under budgetary control and reporting procedures. Donors provided financial support for public
expenditure reviews in key social sectors (agriculture, education, and health) to ensure a better
linkage of sector policies to budgetary priorities in the PRSP. In the financial sector, the
authorities took further steps to broaden and deepen the money market, with the introduction of
longer maturity treasury bills and the book-entry system to facilitate the trading of treasury bills
and other securities. As part of the effort to promote attractiveness of The Gambia as a regional
entreport and financial center, commercial banks were allowed to open foreign currencydenominated deposits for their customers.

-3Consistent with the PRSP objectives, the National Assembly enacted key legislation to
encourage private sector activities, including the Privatization, Regulatory and Procurement
Acts. To complement these efforts, Cabinet approved a fast-track privatization program for a
number of public enterprises that do not require regulation, including the former Alimenta
assets. There were also renewed emphasis on implementing agricultural marketing reforms and
providing extension services, improved inputs, and access to credit for farmers with support
from donors.
The authorities intensified their efforts to access technical assistance in order to strengthen the
implementation of broad-based structural reforms. This was achieved partly through better
coordination of donor technical assistance, to which the Fund is contributing through the
Technical Assistance Action Plan (TCAP) to strengthen the formulation and implementation of
policies. Moreover, in July 2001 the World Bank approved the World Bank’s Capacity Building
for Economic Management Project to help strengthen key economic institutions.
The full PRSP was submitted to the Fund and the World Bank in May 2002, and the authorities
also achieved significant progress in implementing triggers for the enhanced HIPC Initiative
Completion Point, especially in key social sectors (education and health). There were efforts to
redirect government spending to social sectors (agriculture, education and health), as witnessed
by increased capacity at training institutions for agricultural extension specialists, lower basic
education teachers, and primary health care technicians. Moreover, the girls’ scholarship
program, which started in 2001, on a pilot basis in two poor regions, has become a great
success in increasing girls’ enrolment, especially among the poor households; plans are
underway to extend the scholarship to all poor households in the country.
Executive

Board Assessment

Directors noted that The Gambia’s economic performance during 2001 had been mixed.
Positive developments included continued robust real GDP growth, moderate inflation, the
preparation of a comprehensive PRSP, and the settlement of the property dispute with
Alimenta. Commendable progress was also achieved in implementing the enhanced HIPC
Initiative completion point triggers, notably on education and health. However, Directors noted
with concern that, partly due to one-off factors, fiscal slippages, which continued through the
first quarter of 2002, had undermined earlier progress toward fiscal consolidation. They also
noted the widening of the external current account deficit.
Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to reverse the
recent fiscal slippages, as well as their renewed commitment to press ahead with reforms aimed
at achieving a durable improvement in fiscal performance. Building on earlier progress, the
2002103 program will also deepen broad-based economic and financial sector reforms to
strengthen the foundations for private sector confidence and investment, and for poverty
reduction. Directors were encouraged that, with donor relations improved, these reforms should
benefit from closely coordinated technical assistance, and, in this context, looked forward to the
TA program to be presented at the upcoming donors’ roundtable meeting. The Fund’s Technical

-4Cooperation Assistance Plan to enhance macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation
will be an important contribution in this regard.
Directors urged the authorities to adhere strictly to their plans to strengthen fiscal performance
in line with the revised targets of reducing the overall deficit (excluding grants) to 5 percent of
GDP in 2002, and to about 2 percent by 2005. On the revenue side, efforts should aim at a
sustained improvement in the institutional capacity of the tax administration, including the
customs administration. Strict implementation of the measures to eliminate tax and other
arrears owed to the government by a number of public enterprises, as well as perseverance
with reforms to improve tax efficiency and reduce tax exemptions will also be crucial.
Directors welcomed recent steps to contain public spending, and urged the authorities to
maintain tight controls over expenditures from below-the-line accounts. Going forward, the
authorities should give a high priority to budgetary reforms to enhance transparency and
accountability of public expenditure, as this will also be crucial to ensure satisfactory
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and the enhanced HIPC Initiative assistance.
In particular, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the appointment of an
Auditor General with substantive responsibilities to audit public accounts on a timely basis, and
to collaborate effectively with donors in improving and broadening public expenditure reviews,
with a view to developing a medium-term expenditure framework encompassing all major
expenditure programs.
Directors supported the Central Bank of The Gambia’s continued pursuit of a prudent monetary
policy, which aims at maintaining low inflation and strengthening external reserves while
providing adequate room for private sector credit growth. They agreed that the emphasis should
continue to be on an improved and expanded use of indirect instruments, taking advantage of
Fund technical assistance. Directors noted the steps taken to strengthen the management
capacity of the Continent Bank, but urged the authorities to act expeditiously to address the
Bank’s financial problems, including completion of a resolution plan to establish the full cost to
the budget of either recapitalization or liquidation of the bank. They looked forward to the
enactment of the anti-money laundering bill, and of measures to strengthen the central bank’s
supervisory functions and enhance its independence.
Directors welcomed the full PRSP, which benefited from a highly participatory process and
provides the building blocks for the poverty-reducing policies and reforms incorporated in the
PRGF-supported program. They urged the authorities to continue with work to refine sector
priorities, further articulate and strengthen the governance component of the PRSP, and
improve the macroeconomic and social data that will help assess the impact of adjustment and
reform on the poor.
Directors underscored the importance of continued efforts to consolidate and broaden structural
reforms, which are key to stimulating private sector activity and accelerating a reduction in
poverty. Priorities include improvements in business legislation, establishment of a framework
for the regulation of public enterprises, and continuation of the privatization program. They also
urged the authorities to make further progress toward a sustainable marketing arrangement for
groundnuts with minimal government involvement.

-5-

Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to a liberal trade and exchange system.
They considered that continuation of a flexible exchange rate policy remains appropriate for
maintaining the country’s external competitiveness in the context of the planned prudent
financial policies.
While The Gambia provides data to the Fund that meet the requirements for effective
surveillance and program monitoring, Directors welcomed The Gambia’s participation in the
General Data Dissemination System and encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to
reduce reporting delays and to upgrade the quality of data used for economic analysis.

IMF Approves In Principle a Three-Year, US$27 Million PRGF Arrangement
for The Gambia
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved in principle a
three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for
SDR 20.22 million (about US$27 million) for The Gambia. The IMF’s Board’s decision will
become effective after the World Bank Executive Board’s review of The Gambia’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), scheduled for July 16,2002. Upon effectiveness of the IMF’s
Board decision, The Gambia will be able to draw SDR 2.89 million (about US$3.8 million)
under the arrangement.
The PRGF is the IMF’s concessional facility for low income countries. It is intended that
PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies
adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners, and
articulated in a PRSP. This is to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth
and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable
over 10 years with a 5 l/-year grace period on principal payments.
After the Executive Board’s discussion on the Gambia, Eduardo Aninat, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chairman, stated:
“The Gambian authorities have achieved a broadly encouraging economic performance under
their previous PRGF arrangement, including sustained real GDP and per capita income growth,
and low inflation. Notable achievements include the reforms in the financial sector, the
substantial reduction and rationalization of external tariffs, the settlement of the property dispute
with Alimenta, and the preparation of a comprehensive PRSP. However, fiscal slippages in 2001
and continuing through the first quarter of 2002 have partly undermined these positive
achievements.
“The Fund therefore welcomes the authorities’ renewed commitment to strengthen fiscal
performance. The new PRGF-supported program aims at improved fiscal discipline, further
progress in ensuring good governance, and the continued implementation of broad-based

economic and financial reforms which are key to promoting private sector activity and reducing
poverty. Better coordination of donor aid, including a comprehensive technical assistance
program which will be presented to a donor conference, will help support the implementation of
the PRSP. The Fund contributes to this effort, and the staff has prepared a Technical Cooperation
Action Plan to improve macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation.
“The revised budget for 2002 provides for an appropriate strengthening of fiscal performance to
reduce the fiscal deficit and the stock of domestic debt in line with the medium-term framework.
To achieve the program’s fiscal objectives, the authorities will press ahead with reforms to
further strengthen revenue, including by improving tax administration; maintain strict
expenditure controls, especially on the below-the-line accounts; and slow down the pace of
implementation of certain projects. Broader budgetary reforms aimed at enhancing the
transparency and accountability of public expenditure will also be crucial to support the
emphasis on key social sector priorities, in line with the PRSP and HIPC Initiative objectives.
“The pursuit of a prudent monetary policy, while providing adequate private sector credit
growth, will remain key to containing emerging inflationary pressures. The authorities should
also act expeditiously in addressing the Continent Bank’s financial problems, including
finalizing a resolution plan for the distressed bank.
“Implementation of structural reforms, including measures to improve business legislation,
continuation of the privatization program, and the creation of a sustainable marketing
arrangement for groundnuts with minimal government involvement, will be essential to
strengthen the foundations for private sector activity and accelerating poverty reduction,”
Mr. Aninat said.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Under the 1998-2001 PRGF arrangement supported by the IMF, The Gambia overall registered
significant gains on the macroeconomic and structural policy fronts, although performance was
somewhat uneven, especially towards the latter part of the program period. A recovery in real
GDP growth, led by improved agricultural performance, including in the key groundnut sector,
helped reduce inflation. There was considerable fiscal and external sector adjustment, and
exports and imports recovered significantly.
Economic performance during 2001 was mixed. Real GDP grew by 6 percent, underpinned by
the strong performance of the agriculture, tourism, and construction sectors. Average annual
inflation edged up to 4 % percent, driven by higher imported inflation and expansionary fiscal
policies. In the fiscal area, the budget deficit before grants widened to 8 % percent of GDP in
2001, compared with the revised program target of 5.9 percent. Including grants, the deficit
increased to 7.6 percent of GDP from 3 percent in 2000. In addition, revenue shortfalls,
including in customs revenue, reflected weak tax administration and the financial problems of
public enterprises. Overall, domestic revenue declined to 16.2 percent of GDP in 2001 from
18.2 percent in 2000.
To ensure that there is no recurrence of the recent slippages, the authorities have slowed project
execution and maintained tighter expenditure controls. On the revenue side, there was a
significantly enhanced revenue performance in the first quarter of 2002.
Program Summary
The PRGF arrangement is underpinned by macroeconomic adjustments, including fiscal
measures and reforms to strengthen the financial sector that will help the poor.
Real GDP growth is projected at 6 percent for 2002. This outcome is supported by the expected
privatization, and reforms in groundnut marketing; the continued recovery in the re-export and
fishing sectors, and improved confidence.
After a surge from end-2001 through early 2002, annual average inflation is expected to stabilize
at 5 1%percent, following measures to tighten financial policies.
Fiscal policy aims at reducing the overall budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP, compared with the
4 percent in the original budget. This revised budget target is based on an expected recovery in
revenue, the nonrecurrence of previous exceptional outlays in 2001, and measures to tighten
expenditure controls. The revised budget reflects an emphasis on increased expenditure
allocations for key sector-al priorities such as agriculture, health, and education.
The key objectives of monetary policy during 2002 are to maintain low inflation and strengthen
external reserves. The monetary program for 2002 targets a reduction in end-period inflation to

-4-

3 % percent and the maintenance of adequate gross official external reserves. In this context, the
government will maintain a tight monetary policy, while providing adequate credit to the private
sector, and continuing to promote exchange rate flexibility.
On the structural front, areas covered include the modernization of business-related legislation,
the regulation and public procurement, the competition policy, and public enterprises divestiture.
The PRSP Process
The main objectives of The Gambia’s PRSP are to promote growth and employment, enhance
the provision of social services and mainstream cross-cutting policies for gender issues and the
HIV/AIDS problem, as well as to improve the economic environment in order to accelerate
poverty reduction.
The PRSP provides a clear set of indicators and targets for monitoring and evaluating the
implementation of the strategy in the health and education sectors in an innovative approach. It
proposes to integrate conventional quantitative approaches to monitoring with participative
methods, involve civil society groups in the budget process to increase transparency, and include
indicators on the new area of social capital along side the more traditional indicators of physical
and human capital.
The Gambia joined the Fund on September 21, 1967. Its quota is SDR 31 million (about US$41
million), and its outstanding use of IMF resources as of April 30, 2002 is SDR 20.61 million
(about US$27 million).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 10, 2002
Information that has become available since the staff report (Country Report No.04/42) was
issued provides evidence of improving economic conditions, which do not affect the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
Adequate rains have been reported so far and the authorities are guardedly optimistic about
a good year for agriculture. Groundnut production is expected to benefit from increased
acreage and better inputs while marketing will be enhanced with an expected new entry of
new traders and the rehabilitation of a processing plant and 21 barges that transport
groundnuts. Acreage for food crops has increased and better inputs, especially the
introduction of high yielding rice varieties, augur well for increased production.
Tourist arrivals so far in 2002 have benefited from political calm and increased charter
flights, including for the summer season. Completion of major renovations at the leading
hotels will also contribute to at least a 15 percent increase over 2001.
Annual Inflation through April 2002 was about 5.6 percent, having moderated from
8 percent at the end-2001, as prices for mostly imported food items have continued to
increase albeit at a slower pace in line with moderating pressure on the fiscal and external
sectors; the dalasi has depreciated in nominal terms by less than 1 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the elections in late April.
Preliminary fiscal data for April-May show that expenditure growth has moderated
significantly especially on projects and now overall expenditure and net lending appears
within range of the end-June program target. On the revenue side, the good performance in
the first quarter appear to have slowed, as tax on international trade were adversely affected
by the border problems that hindered the reexport trade during the period. At end of May, a
Joint High Commission held meetings in Dakar, Senegal to resolve the issues in this area and
revenues are expected to recover.
Annual broad money growth stood at 22¾ percent at end-April, slightly down from the
25 percent recorded at end-March, reflecting the decline in credit to the government while
growth in credit to the private sector continued to be robust. Increased coordination between
open market operations and foreign exchange market intervention has improved liquidity
management in the banking system. As a result, the stock of treasury bills, sold to mop up
excess liquidity, has started to moderate significantly; the outstanding stock of treasury bills
at end-May was D 1883 million compared with D 1919 million at end-2001.
Relations with the Paris Club: A Paris Club creditor has reported long-standing technical
arrears of about US$7 million, on which it has agreed that no payments need to be made. The
Paris Club has indicated creditors’ willingness to provide a rescheduling on Cologne terms to
regularize the arrears and provide interim HIPC relief to The Gambia. The resulting cash

-2-

payments are similar to what was assumed under the program, and thus there is no effect on
the residual financing gap.
In late June 2002, The Gambia and the European Commission signed the release of
€ 3.7 million, which should be disbursed shortly and is expected to be used to reduce
government domestic debt. A Financing Agreement was signed concurrently in the amount
€ 4.255 million, including a 15 percent enhanced HIPC Initiative eligibility augmentation.
Thus, the residual financing gap in the PRGF program for 2002 should be covered.
On technical assistance issues, a June 2002 joint Bank/Fund tax mission agreed a work
agenda for 2002/03 for the tax revenue departments, including setting up a revenue project
management unit and headquarters office to oversee the reforms pending establishment of an
Independent Tax Revenue Authority. Proposed measures include setting up a large tax payer
unit, self tax assessment, computerization, setting up a taxpayer identification number
system, and better implementation and eventual upgrading of the automated system for
customs data. The detailed reform package will be incorporated into the PRGF program
during the September 2002 program review mission. Meanwhile, the Fund will send an
expert to Banjul in late summer to help with the drafting of a new Income Tax Bill.
Separately, the authorities have requested the Fund to provide a follow up mission to the
central bank (planned for late July 2002) to initiate a work on a comprehensive program
under the Technical Cooperative Action Plan.
