MAURITIUS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 29, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks: The outlook for growth and inflation is broadly positive, although
growth is likely to slow somewhat to below 4 percent. The external environment,
particularly the export dependence on Europe is the largest risk for the outlook.
Fiscal policy and public debt sustainability: The cyclical component of Mauritius’
fiscal balance is projected to be small. A less expansionary fiscal stance than currently
projected by staff would contribute to building policy buffers and reducing relatively
high debt levels. In the event of a deterioration in the external environment, automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to work and limited fiscal stimulus could also be
considered, particularly to help employment change and mitigate social costs. Fiscal
adjustment should focus on public enterprises and better targeting of social protection.
Monetary and exchange rate policies: The monetary policy stance is appropriate, but
developments in inflation and excess liquidity need to be followed closely. The recent
decline in year-on-year and core inflation point to lesser inflationary pressures for
2012. Staff estimates that at end-2011 the real exchange rate was broadly in line with
fundamentals, but there is a need to reduce the current account deficit over time. The
flexible exchange rate continues to play a useful role as a potential shock absorber;
exchange rate interventions should be used primarily to limit excess volatility. Net
international reserves appear fully adequate, but not excessive.
Inclusive Growth: The poor have benefitted from economic growth, but less than
richer groups in recent years. The social protection system could be better targeted to
ensure that growth is inclusive. Revenue policies appear to be moderately progressive.
Financial sector: Stress-tests indicate that the Mauritian banking system is wellcapitalized and resilient against many shocks. Supervisory coordination between the
Bank of Mauritius and the Financial Services Commission (FSC) should be enhanced
further to ensure that there are neither supervisory loopholes nor supervisory overlaps.

Discussions centered on the fiscal stance for 2012 given the uncertainty of the external outlook and the
need for consolidation to strengthen public debt dynamics. Also, the role of monetary policy and
liquidity management in stabilizing inflation and supporting growth was discussed in conjunction with
exchange rate policy and reserve management given the real appreciation of the rupee and ensuing
concerns regarding the competitiveness of the export sector.

economy’s resilience to shocks. On the

relevant budget documents.

revenue side, changes included the abolition
of a tax on capital gains and certain property
taxes, deemed to have negatively affected the
real estate sector without generating
significant revenue. These measures were
partly compensated by an increase in excise
duties (notably on alcohol and cigarettes),
which should maintain the overall tax revenue
broadly stable as a percentage of GDP. Current
expense in 2012 is projected to decrease as
a percent of GDP due to lower transfers and
subsidies. The 2012 budget envisages a strong
increase in public investment spending to
4 percent of GDP, which appears ambitious
given the capacity constraints that limited
capital budget execution in 2010 and 2011.
There is also a plan to spend 1½ percent of
GDP out of special funds, with a large share of
these expenditures linked to investment
projects or of a contingent nature. While staff
agreed with the authorities’ revenue
projections, it projected that capital projects
and spending from special funds would be
lower than budgeted. Thus, staff projects a
more moderate fiscal expansion, with the
overall budget deficit (including the special
funds) increasing from 2.4 percent of GDP in
2011 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012 (compared
to 5.3 percent of GDP under the budget). In
fact, staff’s projections are in line with
historical budget implementation as the fiscal

11.

Staff recommended a less

expansionary fiscal stance than projected
for 2012. The cyclical component of Mauritius’
fiscal balance is projected to be small,
reflecting small estimates of the output gap.
Thus, the mission argued that there was little
need for expansionary fiscal policy for cyclical
considerations, particularly given the fact that
fiscal multipliers are likely to be small in an
open economy with a flexible exchange rate
regime. As a consequence, the mission argued
for a less expansionary fiscal stance than
currently projected by staff in order to build
policy buffers and ensure favorable debt
dynamics, given that current debt levels are
still relatively high for an emerging economy.
12.

Authorities’ responded that

infrastructure investments are needed to
remove bottlenecks and that external
shocks impose a constraint on fiscal
consolidation. They explained that most of
the planned expansion is related to capital
spending to address infrastructure constraints
on growth, which should yield benefits for
future growth. They also noted that over the
last two years, fiscal policy has been less
expansionary than anticipated. Moreover, the
2012 budget includes contingent expenditures

support businesses through loan guarantees,

The discussions centered on the appropriate medium-term fiscal policies to control public debt
including through improvements in the public enterprise sector; on inclusive growth and the

and on productivity-enhancing structural reforms.

Transfers to SOEs from the budget amounted

that SOEs do not charge full cost-recovery

cost recovery would represent an important
potential for savings and fiscal adjustment. The

monitoring framework aimed at promoting
improvements in efficiency and minimizing the
need for central government transfers. The

The authorities have elaborated a

strategy to reform the social protection

programs undertaken by the authorities in
2010 concluded that social assistance
programs are fragmented, leading to
diseconomies of scale, and that these
programs generally do not help beneficiaries

and evaluation of these programs is also
considered to be weak, which impairs the
ability of policy makers to determine whether

The 2011 foreign asset and liability survey has resulted in significant upward revisions in the stock of short term debt, thus leading to a sharp reduction
in the ratio compared to previous projections.

APPENDIX I. EXCHANGE RATE AND EXTERNAL
BALANCE ASSESSMENT
The real value of the Mauritian rupee has followed a U-shaped path over the last decade. The
currency depreciated some 25 percent from peak (2001) to trough (end-2006). During the 2008/09
crisis, the depreciation of the Euro and the British Pound pushed up the rupee’s real value. With the
relatively quick rebound from the world economic crisis, FDI and other investment flows returned to
pre-crisis levels in 2010–11, which translated into a slight real appreciation over that period.

The rupee was broadly in line with fundamentals. The empirical strategy follows Vitek’s “Exchange
Rate Assessment Toolkit” (2012), based on the application of three CGER approaches:
macroeconomic balance (MB), external sustainability (ES) and equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER).
All approaches point to a small overvaluation at end-2011, but the estimates taken together are still
statistically indistinguishable from a zero misalignment and the misalignment declines over time.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach is a two-stage method. First, the equilibrium
“current account norm” (CA norm) is estimated based on a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
regression using a dataset covering 184 economies and spanning 1973–2010. The CA norm is
compared to the “underlying CA”, which adjusts current account projections for one-off operations
and real exchange movements. Second, using the country-specific elasticity of the current account
with respect to the real exchange rate (0.88 estimated in IMF WP/08/212), the misalignment is
computed as the real exchange rate adjustment required to close the external gap.
The MB approach shows that the underlying current account deficit has been greater than its
equilibrium level since 2005 (Figure I.2). In 2011, the implied overvaluation decreased slightly from
2010 to below 8 percent. Zero deviation is within the 95 percent confidence interval, and thus the MB
approach does not provide strong evidence of overvaluation in 2011. The balance of payments
projections imply that the overvaluation is expected to continue shrinking in the medium term.

The external sustainability (ES) approach also estimates the misalignment as the adjustment
required to close the external gap. However, unlike the MB approach, ES defines the CA norm as
the current account balance that would keep Mauritius’ net foreign assets constant as a share of
GDP. Despite differences in methodology, results for the ES approach (Figure I.3) are similar to those
derived from the MB approach: the exchange rate was overvalued by some 12 percent in 2011, but
the misalignment is projected to diminish over the medium term.

Figure I.3. ES Approach: Norm vs. Underlying Current Account and Implied Real Effective Exchange Rate Misalignment

Actual CA

The ES approach misalignment estimates should be interpreted cautiously. As discussed in IMF
WP/08/212 and WP/10/148, the liability side of Global Business Corporations’ (GBCs) activities is
likely underestimated in external statistics, which biases upwards the NFA estimate for Mauritius.1
This results in overestimating the CA Norm and, consequently, the REER overvaluation. Confidence
intervals cannot be estimated using the ES approach because it is based on an accounting identity.
The reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach uses fitted values from a
panel regression to compute the equilibrium real exchange rate. The difference with the actual REER

constitutes the misalignment. Results, presented in Figure I.4, broadly corroborate those obtained by
the other two methods: the overvaluation, currently at 12 percent, is projected to decrease over the
medium term. The overvaluation is statistically significant at the 5 percent level in 2011 in the ERER
approach.

The analysis does not provide support for active exchange rate management. There might be
some scope to resist further appreciation that does not reflect fundamentals, although this might not
be fully effective and would carry important sterilization costs. Moreover, the exchange rate is only
one of the instruments available to close the external balance gap, and not necessarily the most
obvious for a country with a floating exchange rate regime. Sustained fiscal adjustment can also
contribute to reduction of external imbalances and reduce overall vulnerabilities (and is required by
law). Reforms to increase productivity and reduce trade restrictions appreciate the equilibrium real
exchange rate and thus reduce potential overvaluation.

APPENDIX II. RESERVE ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT

1

Net international reserves held by the Bank of Mauritius appear fully adequate to face the
current volatile global environment.
In nominal terms, net international reserves have nearly doubled since 2006, reaching USD 2.5 billion
at end-2011 (Figure II.1). This rapid accumulation, plus the fact that at above 4 months of imports,
reserves exceeded the 3 months threshold, has prompted policy discussions about the excessiveness
of reserves and the merits of committing part of them to a sovereign wealth fund. This appendix
analyzes international reserve adequacy for Mauritius using both traditional and new metrics.

100% ST Debt

While reserve accumulation may appear impressive in nominal terms, it has been broadly in line with
the growth of the economy, the deepening of its financial sector and increased trade openness
(Figure II.1). Over the last 6 years, reserves have been closely tracking another commonly-used
benchmark—20 percent of M2, thus just keeping pace with rapid financial deepening. At some
500 percent of short term debt on a remaining maturity basis, reserves appeared particularly
comfortable with respect to the Guidotti-Greenspan rule of 100 percent. It should be noted however
that available statistics likely underestimate the stock of private short term debt.2

The 2011 foreign asset and liability survey has already resulted in significant upward revisions in the stock of short

term debt. However, future statistical surveys there are likely to uncover more short-term private liabilities.

MAURITIUS 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Mauritius has been accumulating reserves at a slower pace than comparator countries. As
shown in Figure II.2, emerging markets have increased reserve import cover to an average of over
6 months of goods and services. Mauritius’ relative drop over time is not driven by outliers. As shown
in the right column graphs of Figure II.2, the country’s percentile ranking among the 80 emerging
markets included in the analysis has been on a decline across all three traditional metrics, albeit from
high levels.
Mauritius’ reserves are adequate when measured against the new multi-dimensional
IMF (2011) metric.3 A main drawback of traditional metrics is that each of them only measures the
country’s exposure to one type of risk: current account shocks (import cover); sudden stops (shortterm debt cover); and capital flight (M2 cover). Moreover, the actual thresholds (e.g. 3 months of
imports) are relatively arbitrary rules of thumb. The study of external market pressure episodes
conducted as part of IMF’s recent research on reserve adequacy shows that these risks often
materialize simultaneously. The event study also allowed constructing relative weights for each of
these risks and the corresponding reserve cover needed to face them. In the case of countries with a
floating regime, reserves should cover the sum of: 30 percent short term debt on remaining maturity
basis, 10 percent of other portfolio liabilities, 5 percent of M2, and 5 percent of exports of goods and
services. An adequacy index of 100 percent means that reserves exactly equal the sum of these four
components. At end-2011, the metric for Mauritius constituted 143 percent, which is at the upper
end of the suggested adequacy range (100 to 150 percent). Again, Mauritius has been slipping in
relative terms among the 80 emerging markets for which the metric was computed, and is currently
in the middle quintile (bottom graphs in Figure II.2).
Staff considers it appropriate for Mauritius to continue targeting the upper end of the
suggested reserve adequacy range, as measured by the IMF metric. In addition to facing
standard economic risks, the country is also exposed to the risk of costly cyclones and floods. Given
the increasing role of Mauritius as an international financial center, M2 is an increasingly less
representative measure of the size of the financial sector and associated risks. Finally, in the short
run, an additional safety margin is needed to factor in increased uncertainty stemming from
Mauritius’ high exposure to the European market. Staff therefore sees little scope in devoting any of
BOM’s reserves to a potential sovereign wealth fund. However, staff welcomes BOM’s ongoing
efforts to increase the yield potential on the upper tranches of reserves, including through
diversifying the currencies in which reserve instruments are denominated.

APPENDIX III. MAURITIUS: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS (DSA) USING THE DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
FRAMEWORK FOR MARKET ACCESS COUNTRIES
1

Recent Debt Developments
Public debt has stabilized over the last two years, albeit at a relatively high level of close to
60 percent of GDP, highlighting the need for fiscal consolidation over the medium term. After
reaching a peak of close to 75 percent in 2003, the ratio of public debt to GDP had been on a
declining trend mainly due to strong economic growth and sound fiscal policy. Nevertheless, a series
of stimulus measures to counter the effects of the global financial crisis has pushed up public debt to
close to 60 percent of GDP by the end of 2009, thus approaching the legally-mandated ceiling
defined in the 2008 Public Debt Management Act (PDMA).2 Although the comprehensive policy
packages are considered to have been broadly effective in facilitating economic recovery in 2010–11
and bringing the debt ratio to 56 percent of GDP by end-2011, the Mauritian authorities are
cognizant of the need for fiscal consolidation over the medium-term.
The central government relies mostly on domestic debt for its borrowing needs, whereas in
relative terms, state-owned firms have relied more heavily on external debt. As of
end-December 2011, domestic debt represented some 80 percent of total central government debt,
a small decline with respect to the average share for the period 2003–09 (90 percent), as the
government pursued a strategy of seeking long-term financing from multilateral and bilateral
creditors under favorable conditions (below market terms). Over 20 percent of domestic central
government debt is classified as short-term (by original maturity). The debt of State-Owned
Enterprises (SOEs) is estimated to account for 11 percent of total public debt as of end-2011. External
debt amounted to over 40 percent of total SOE debt in 2011, a decline with respect to the historical
average of over 50 percent for the period 2003–09.
The authorities are currently elaborating a new debt management strategy. The strategy
attempts to meet the borrowing needs of the government in a manner that avoids market

The limits are 60 percent of GDP until 2017 and 50 percent of GDP after 2018. The 2011 Article IV consultation

(SM/11/60) included discussions on the appropriateness of the debt ceiling rule contained in the PDMA in supporting
fiscal sustainability.

disruption; to minimize the cost of the debt portfolio within an acceptable level of risk; and to
support the development of a well-functioning market for government securities. Among other
objectives, the strategy envisages lengthening the maturity profile of government debt (partly by
increasing the share of external debt in the total portfolio), increase the issuance of long-term
domestic debt instruments, and increase liquidity in the domestic market for government securities
by increasing the number of benchmark instruments.

Baseline Assumptions underlying the DSA
The results of this debt sustainability analysis are based on a number of important
assumptions, notably regarding fiscal consolidation, sound monetary policy and sustained
economic growth over the medium term. GDP growth is expected to increase gradually to
4.2 percent by 2014 driven by increased infrastructure investment and productivity improvements.
Inflation should remain moderate due to credible implementation of monetary policy by the Bank of
Mauritius. Furthermore, the macroeconomic framework used for this exercise assumes that the
government will resume fiscal consolidation after 2012, with the primary deficit (including grants)
declining by 1 percentage point of GDP between 2012 and 2017. A reduction in transfers and
subsidies and better enforcement of financial discipline for public enterprises is expected to
contribute to deficit reduction.
The current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow reaching close to 4 percent of GDP
by 2017. The trade balance should improve over the projection period as import growth decelerates
from current high levels (imports are estimated to have grown by 17 percent in dollar terms in 2011),
while export growth continues to be robust at around 6 percent on average. After a marked slowdown in 2011 and 2012, financial flows including FDI are expected to recover contributing to an
accumulation of international reserves over the medium-term.
The baseline macroeconomic framework is subject to downside risks. Given the strong links
between Mauritius and advanced economies in Europe, the macroeconomic outlook remains
vulnerable to the volatile external environment. FDI flows, tourism receipts and exports of
manufactured goods to European trading partners are particularly important transmission channels
for external shocks.

Public Debt Sustainability
The results of the debt sustainability analysis indicate that public debt is sustainable over the
medium-term (Table III.1 and Figure III.1). Despite the small fiscal expansion expected in the
context of the 2012 budget, public debt should gradually decline over the projection period, as fiscal

MAURITIUS

consolidation takes place. Nevertheless, more ambitious consolidation efforts might be required to
reach the 50 percent debt-to-GDP target mandated by the Public Debt Management Act (PDMA)
before 2018. In fact, public debt is projected to peak at 57 percent of GDP in 2012 before falling to
close to 50 percent by 2017, the end of the projection period.
Public debt dynamics are resilient to several stress tests (Figure III.1). The results of standardized
sensitivity tests do not fundamentally alter the broadly positive outlook for public debt previously
discussed. In most cases, the public debt-to-GDP ratio does not approach 60 percent by the end of
the projection period under the different shocks considered,3 except for the scenario including an
increase in contingent liabilities, which would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to exceed 65 percent in
2013 before falling back to 59 percent by 2017. The external debt outlook is somewhat vulnerable to
a large devaluation, which would push up the debt-to-GDP ratio by 7 percentage points to
57 percent in 2017 (Figure III.1).

External Debt Sustainability
External debt dynamics are sustainable in the baseline scenario (Table III.2 and Figure III.2).
Excluding short-term private sector liabilities, external debt is estimated at 15 percent of GDP at the
end of 2011, down from 20 percent in 2002. Gross bank external liabilities surpassed 100 percent of
GDP at the end of December 2011. They are not included in external debt figures, as bank foreign
assets are almost twice as large,4 and as in many international financial centers, it would be
misleading to include gross bank liabilities in the external debt measure.5 External debt is projected
to increase over the medium term reaching 18 percent of GDP by 2013, as authorities take
advantage of partially concessional long-term financing from multilateral and bilateral sources.
Stress tests indicate that the external debt trajectory is particularly vulnerable to shocks to the
non-interest current account and large exchange rate depreciations. Sensitivity analysis suggests
that Mauritius’ external debt is resilient to interest rate and growth shocks, but a 30 percent real
depreciation would push up the external debt-to-GDP ratio to around 23 percent in 2017. A current
3

Sensitivity tests include shocks to the interest rate, to growth, to the primary balance, a combination of shocks, as

well as shocks to contingent liabilities and a 30 percent exchange rate depreciation.
4

Bank investments of the GBC float—that is, money from foreign investors meant to be transferred to third countries

but held for a short period by GBCs in bank deposits—are included. Excluding these GBC counterpart investments
would still result in a positive bank net foreign asset position.

account deficit that is 3 percentage points of GDP larger than projected in the baseline would likely
put the country on an unsustainable path, as the debt-to-GDP ratio would shoot up to 27 percent by
2017. Thus, moderating the non-interest part of the external current account balance is key to
maintaining external debt sustainability.

Conclusion
Overall, the DSA results indicate that the debt outlook for Mauritius is broadly positive. Both
total public debt and external debt are on sustainable trajectories in the baseline, and the results of
stress tests indicate that debt dynamics are resilient to several shocks. Nevertheless, the external
debt outlook is particularly vulnerable to a shock to the non-interest current account, which may lead
to unsustainable trajectories. In addition, total public sector debt could be significantly affected by
shocks to contingent liabilities. It is important to note that the simulated debt trajectories are based
on the assumption that structural reforms will be implemented to sustain growth rates and that
some fiscal consolidation will take place over the medium-term.

APPENDIX IV. GREEN TAXES AND ETHANOL POLICIES

1

Mauritius is a pioneer in the development of green taxes. The authorities view taxes as the best policy
instrument for reflecting environmental damages in the costs of energy and vehicle use and for
promoting a variety of changes in household and firm behavior to reduce these damages. The excise on
carbon-based fuels under the Maurice Ile Durable Initiative comes close to an ideal CO2 tax.
The amendment to the Excise Act in July 2011 to allow for the imposition of a CO2 levy or the
granting of a rebate on the excise duty payable on motor cars has merit, but could be improved.
The levy or rebate system depends on the CO2 emissions of the vehicle (new and second-hand motor
cars) and was designed to be revenue neutral.2 Staff considers that levy/rebate scheme has merit, but it
would be desirable to remove the graduated tax/subsidy rates, as the value of reducing CO2 by an
additional ton should be the same across all possible uses. For example, currently the reward for
incrementally reducing CO2 per km is much higher for high-tax vehicles than for other vehicles.

Designing Policies to Promote the Use of Ethanol
The appropriate subsidy per liter of ethanol should reflect the value of environmental benefits. To
the extent that ethanol production from sugar cane (for blending with motor fuels) generates less carbon
emissions and pollution than gasoline, it should be taxed at a lower rate, or equivalently, receive a tax
refund or subsidy. The Mauritian authorities intend to follow this approach and currently, an ethanol
subsidy (Rs 2 per liter or US $0.27 per gallon) is being proposed based on a careful assessment of
lifecycle emissions from ethanol production compared with emissions from combusting gasoline. With
pollution benefits appropriately rewarded, the market should supply the economically efficient amount of
ethanol. If future sugar prices are high, or oil prices are low, ethanol supply will likely be minimal or zero,
as production would not be commercially viable. However, ethanol could be economic to produce under
several alternative future price scenarios that appear realistic at the moment.
There is no obvious economic rationale for supplementing the ethanol subsidy with a quantitative
ethanol mandate. Even though mandates are common in other countries, a mandate could, in fact, be
counterproductive, if it forces ethanol into the market when it would otherwise not be economic to
produce (despite its environmental benefits, which should be addressed through the subsidy).
In principle, if there are additional market impediments, this may warrant more initial policy
support, but this seems less plausible. Whether there are such impediments is not entirely clear (for
example, one possible impediment, the inability of early ethanol producers to capture spillover benefits
accruing from their ‘learning-by-doing’ to later producers should not be a large problem, given that the
number of potential ethanol producers is very limited). Moreover, even if additional support might be
justified, setting a higher initial subsidy would be better than forcing ethanol production through a
mandate, regardless of whether future production makes economic sense.

Prepared by Ian Parry (FAD).
The motor vehicle buyer pays an additional amount as a CO2 levy (penalty) per gram of CO2 emission per km above a
threshold. On the other hand, the buyer receives a rebate calculated on the basis of gram of CO2 emission per km if the
CO2 emission standard of the motor car is below the CO2 threshold.

APPENDIX V. INCLUSIVE GROWTH

1

Poverty and inequality in Mauritius are relatively low. Extreme poverty, measured by the proportion
of the population living below $1.25 a day in PPP terms was below 1 percent in 2006/07. By international
standards, inequality in Mauritius with a Gini coefficient of 38.8 is not high. Egalitarian societies such as
Sweden and Canada have Gini coefficients between 25 and 35, whereas most countries have coefficients
around 40 (United States, China, and Russia). Between 1996 and 2007, Mauritius experienced strong per
capita GDP growth, averaging 3.7 percent. Based on data from three household budget surveys (HBS), we
review how inclusive growth in 1996-2007 has been and analyze the distributional incidence of social
protection expenditures. We also discuss the redistributive impact of the tax structure.

Inclusive Growth Measured by Growth Incidence Curves
All income groups experienced positive real growth in household expenditure per capita between
the three surveys, but the poor gained less more recently. Growth incidence curves examine the
interaction between growth, poverty and inequality. As depicted in Figure V.1, for the whole period from
1996/1997 to 2006/2007, both the poorest percentiles and the richest percentiles grew well above the
mean. However, from 2001/2002 to 2006/2007, richer groups’ expenditures grew faster, pointing to a
more unequal distribution of the benefits of growth in recent years.

Mauritius performed well compared to African countries analyzed in the latest AFR Regional
Outlook. Even though mean growth in real expenditure per capita was stronger in some countries (not
surprising given lower levels of development), in several instances poorer households saw slower growth
or even negative growth in expenditure per capita.
Structural changes in the Mauritian economy might be an important factor in explaining recent
trends in inequality. During the years of the last survey (2006 and 2007) unemployment rates were

relatively high in Mauritius (around 9 percent). The loss of trade preferences in textile, the decline in some
traditional sectors (agriculture, textile manufacturing) might have reduced demand for lower-skilled
workers, whereas the expansion of the financial service and health sectors might have increased demand
and wages for higher-skilled groups. This could reflect a global trend related to globalization and
technological progress that are likely to have increased return on human capital and greater inequality
between skilled and unskilled workers—something that might persist going forward. The educational
system has been unable to accompany these structural changes and inequality in educational outcomes
is still relatively high leading to significant problems of skill mismatches.2

Social Protection System
The Mauritian social protection system needs to improve to ensure that the poor benefit more
from economic development. Social protection expenditures at close to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 are
relatively high. Non-contributory and non-targeted pensions account for 1.3 percent of GDP. Only about
50 percent of direct and indirect beneficiaries of Social Aid (the main means-tested social assistance
program) live below the poverty line. Old age pension benefits overwhelming go to non-poor households
(only 22 percent of recipients of old age pensions are poor). Furthermore, 39 percent of the basic
retirement pension benefits go to the richest 20 percent (Table V.1). The two richest quintiles of the
population receive close to 58 percent of all social protection benefits, and the richest 20 percent alone
receive 37 percent. Eliminating transfers to the richest 40 percent of the population could save significant
sums, which could be deployed more effectively in the pro-poor sectors of primary and secondary
education and health.

Structure of Tax Revenue and Incidence of Taxes
Major tax reforms after 2006 aimed at broadening the tax base and increasing tax progressivity.
Measures included the introduction of a single 15 percent rate for VAT, corporate and personal income
tax (the latter with an increase in the exemption threshold). Taxes on consumption are the most
important sources of tax revenue (Table V.2) with VAT and excise duties accounting for more than half of
total tax revenue. Corporate income taxes are some 15 percent on tax revenue, whereas personal income
tax is about 8 percent of tax revenue.

Personal income taxes are relatively progressive but their redistributive potential is limited. The
concentration index3 for income tax payments is very high, indicating that richer segments of the
population bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden (Table V.3). The Kakwani index—the
difference between the Gini for pre-tax income and the concentration index for taxes—is the highest
among the comparator countries considered, confirming that personal income taxes are relatively
progressive. Nevertheless, the Kakwani index does not take into account the redistributive potential of
the tax. The Reynolds-Smolensky (RS) index addresses this shortcoming by measuring the difference
between the Gini coefficients for pre-tax and post-tax income.4 It suggests that income taxes have a
negligible income distribution capacity in Mauritius, because of their relatively small share in total taxes.
The RS index for Mauritius is close to zero, comparable to Costa Rica and Panama, whereas redistribution
through taxation is much stronger in New Zealand and the United States.
VAT does not seem to be regressive in Mauritius. The early literature on the incidence of the VAT
suggested that it was regressive, although some recent studies on VAT incidence in developing countries
conclude that it might be less regressive than previously thought. A study by Statistics Mauritius based
on the latest household survey estimates that the average share of VAT payments for poor households
relative to total household expenditure was 5.8 percent compared to 8.7 percent for the richest
households (7.2 percent for all households). Furthermore, the poor accounted for 2.8 percent of VAT
payments, whereas the richest 10 percent accounted for 26.7 percent of all VAT payments.

3

The concentration index is the area below the concentration curve for a given tax. The concentration curve plots
cumulative shares of tax payments with respect to the quantile distribution of pre-tax income.

4

Note that the Gini coefficients in the Table differ from the overall Gini discussed at the beginning of the appendix
because the welfare measure used for the analysis in the table is household income per adult equivalent, excluding
government transfers. We define gross income as the sum of income from employment, income from self-employment, net
rent income, and any other income from property. The measure of income net of income taxes simply subtracts from the
gross income measure deductions related to PAYE and income tax on income from self-employment.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Mauritius achieved high economic growth with positive results for poverty, but better targeting of
social benefits is needed. The extensive, but largely untargeted social protection system needs reforms
to ensure that resources are spent in the most cost-effective way. The authorities should improve the
targeting of social protection by completing the Social Registry of Mauritius (an information system that
provides comprehensive data on existing and potential program clients). Conditional cash-transfer
schemes could help foster human capital accumulation and address skills mismatches in the labor market.
Redesigning the eligibility criteria for the basic retirement pension could have a positive redistributive
impact over time. Reform of the basic educational system is required to address the unequal distribution
of educational outcomes and mechanisms need to be put in place to support the access of poorer
segments of the population to tertiary education.
The tax system does not appear to be regressive, but offers limited scope for redistribution.
Personal income taxes are relatively progressive, although they are too small to have much of an impact.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the VAT is not regressive, but more analysis would be useful given its
economic importance. In general the tax system is relatively efficient, and expenditures offer better tools
for addressing income inequality.

APPENDIX VI. STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES: FINANCIAL
MONITORING AND REFORM
1

State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are of considerable macroeconomic importance in Mauritius. The
revenue of 15 large SOEs (for which data was available) was 15 percent of GDP in 2010 (Figure VI.1).
Investment expenditure for these firms was 8.5 percent of GDP, but considered insufficient and probably
inefficient. This appendix discusses the options for integrating SOEs into the macrofiscal analysis and
describes the authorities’ recent efforts at reforming the sector to improve service delivery and statistics.

MAURITIUS 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Integrating SOEs into the fiscal statistics for the overall public sector would allow for a better
evaluation of the macrofiscal stance. Six out of 15 large SOEs had an operational deficit in 2010, the
highest number since 2006; and government transfers to SOEs are estimated to amount to 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2010. This suggests that having consolidated public sector statistics (general government, central
bank, and SOEs) would help assess the true macro-fiscal stance and provide a better view of the public
sector’s net worth.2 Moreover, it would provide a better description of the public sector’s expenditure
priorities.
Inadequate pricing policies negatively impact SOE financial sustainability and public sector
investment. For example, despite recent increases in water tariffs, below full cost recovery pricing in
water has led to years’ of underinvestment in public infrastructure and severe service delivery problems.
The government has paired with Singapore to develop a strategy for the water sector, which might
benefit from World Bank review. Other sectors might also be reviewed to ensure that all (i) SOEs fulfill a
public service objective that cannot be provided by the private sector; (ii) pricing reflects full cost recovery
(including externalities, if any); (iii) service delivery standards are well-specified and verifiable; and
(iv) management is well-qualified and accountable. Following these objectives should allow to
significantly decrease transfers to SOEs, while increasing investment.
The Mauritian authorities are enhancing the monitoring of SOEs to increase their operational
efficiency and mitigate fiscal risks. The Parastatal Information Management System (PIMS) is currently
being implemented on a pilot basis and contains financial and non-financial indicators. The PIMS collects
information on assets management; corporate governance; financial management, human resource
management, and strategic management. The indicators chosen seem broadly appropriate but the
system would benefit from obtaining information on risks to which SOEs are exposed (including
contingent liabilities, exposures to liquidity risk, roll-over risk, interest rate risk and currency mismatches).
These indicators would permit to better assess the risk that a specific SOE poses to public finances.
The exclusion criteria to discount SOE debt with low risks from the public debt ceiling calculations
are broadly appropriate. The assessment questionnaire covers (i) managerial independence, including
pricing and employment policy; (ii) transparent and stable relations with government; (iii) governance
structure; (iv) sustainable finances; and (v) other risks. Overall, this framework is compatible with the IMF
Staff Guidance Note on Debt Limits in Fund-Supported Programs (2009). But coverage of information on
off-balance sheet liabilities (foreign exchange hedging and other derivative contracts), on currency
mismatches, on the cost of debt, and on pricing policies could be improved. It might also be desirable to
increase the focus on risks to debt sustainability to the detriment of purely corporate governance issues.

2

In 2010, total SOE debt was 7 percent of GDP or 12.5 percent of total public debt. After 2005, SOE debt fell as a share of
GDP, and its composition has tilted towards domestic debt, which reached 55 percent in 2010.

APPENDIX VII. STRESS-TESTING THE BANKING SYSTEM

1

Stress tests based on June 2011 data indicate that the level of capitalization appears sufficient to withstand
sizeable macroeconomic shocks; the concentration of loans on single borrowers remains a major
vulnerability; the direct exchange rate and interest rate risks on banks’ capitalization are likely to be limited;
and liquidity conditions appear adequate. Exposure to Europe is limited and funding is diverse and stable.
The activities of the GBCs appear to carry low risk for the banking system with maturities and currencies
well-matched, but further research in this area would be useful when more data become available.
Since the 2007 FSAP update, the Mauritian banking system retained its key features. The number of
banks operating in the market increased from 19 in 2007 to 20 at end-2011. The sector is fairly
concentrated, with three largest banks accounting for 60 percent of domestic deposits and five largest
banks controlling 70 percent of the system’s assets. Stress tests are conducted for 18 banks, since two
smaller banks that are funded primarily through equity and including their results would skew the
aggregate capital adequacy ratios (CAR).2 For the purposes of reporting stress test results, we sub-divided
banks into four types: (1) three large banks serving both domestic and non-resident market; (2) three
large banks serving primarily non-resident market; (3) five medium to small banks serving mostly nonresidents; and (4) seven medium to small banks serving the domestic market.

Financial soundness indicators (FSIs) suggest that:
(i) capitalization is adequate (CAR > regulatory minimum
of 10 percent); (ii) credit quality appears to be good (low
non-performing loan (NPL) ratio); (iii) profitability is
comfortable with good return on equity (ROE); and
(iv) liquidity is adequate and net open positions in
foreign exchange are low (Figure VII.2).

Stress tests apply Cihak (IMF WP/07/59) methodology, estimating the impact of credit, concentration, exchange rate,
interest rate, and liquidity shocks. The stress tests assume uniform shocks. New NPLs stemming from shocks are assumed
to be in proportion to existing loans, fully provisioned and reduce regulatory capital in due proportion, without considering
the profit cushion, which would make the effect of shocks more benign.

MAURITIUS 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Cross-country comparisons shown in Figure VII.3 indicate that (i) regulatory capital as a percentage of
risk-weighted assets (RWA) is in the intermediate range when compared to other countries; (ii) nonperforming loans are relatively low, but comparable to and somewhat higher than in financial centers
(Luxembourg, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore); (iii) returns on equity are high when compared to
advanced countries, but average compared to other SSA countries, some of which might feature both
higher risks and less competition; and (iv) the implied leverage ratio is lower than in advanced countries
and comparable to financial centers, but higher than average when compared to SSA and emerging
markets.3

System-wide, capitalization is not very vulnerable
to credit risk shocks. A fifty percent increase in NPLs,
when allocated in proportion to existing loans, does
not lead to major drops in CARs (Figure VII.4, Panel 1).
The maximum decrease in the CARs is about
1 percentage point for a type 3 bank, but the median
drop is well below 1 percent. Also, the median excess
of the CARs over the Basel II requirement of 8 percent
is comfortable between 15 and 5 percent, and even
the minimum for all banks at around 3 percentage
points seems reasonable.
Concentration of exposures remains a risk for
banks. A 50 percent default on the largest borrower
would bring CARs below the domestic regulatory
requirement for some type 2, 3, and 4 banks, but all
would remain above the Basel II requirement (Figure
VII.4, Panel 2). Here the median drop in CARs is
around 3 percentage points and the maximum almost
10 percentage points, indicating that some banks have
relatively concentrated loan portfolios, and could
benefit from further diversification.
The banking system appears resilient to external
growth shocks, but smaller banks are more
vulnerable. Two alternative scenarios were
considered: (1) a mild slowdown in Europe with a
policy response, leading to a one percentage point
drop in real GDP growth in Mauritius in 2012
compared to the baseline; (2) a larger slowdown in
Europe without a policy response. The elasticity of the
NPL ratio to GDP growth uses a rule of thumb value of
-0.38 compared to -0.5 during the 2008/09 crisis. The
shocks have a larger affect on smaller banks and those
banks with larger exposure to domestic economy.
Only one smaller bank falls marginally below the
domestic CAR requirement in the mild slowdown
scenario (Figure VII.4, Panel 3). In the severe downturn
scenario, one smaller bank would see its CAR fall
slightly below Basel II requirements (Figure VII.4,
Panel 4). This indicates that the Mauritian banking
system is relatively well prepared for external shocks
although there is a need to monitor the exposure of
some banks in the case of severe shocks.

Shocks on net foreign exchange positions and interest rate shocks suggest limited impact on bank
capitalization. Most banks have small net-long foreign exchange exposures, which means that they gain
from a rupee depreciation (Figure VII.5, Panel 1). The shock applied the most severe depreciation against
major currencies over the last 10 years. In the worst and median case, there is essentially no impact on
the CAR, but some banks gain moderately. A 300 basis point decrease in the policy interest rate has a
limited impact on most banks’ capital positions because of moderate gaps between assets and liabilities
with short-term maturity (Figure VII.5, Panel 2). One bank would gain significantly because short-term
liabilities are greater than short-term assets (the bank would pay significantly less on deposits and loose
only a moderate amount of interest on short-term assets).

International exposure analysis: On a net basis, the banking system is intermediating funds from the
domestic economy into Asia with a small net claim on Europe (Figure VII.1 and Table VII.1). Since
Mauritius has a net claim on Europe, the impact from an economic slowdown in Europe might be limited.
The largest net exposure is to Asia, which reflects intermediation of funds to India in particular.

GBCs and residents fund non-residents and foreign banks on a net basis. The largest sources of
funds for the banks are GBCs and domestic residents, which contribute about 170 percent of GDP to
banks (Figures VII.7-8 and Table VII.2). Banks use the funds mainly to finance non-residents, the domestic
economy (residents), and foreign banks. The maturity profile of assets and liabilities is considered to be
well matched, although some further study would be beneficial (see below).

Areas of further investigation and analysis regarding stress testing should include (i) better
understanding of the transmission of real, exchange rate, and interest rate shocks into NPLs; and
(ii) monitoring of the cross-border and cross-sector exposures. In particular, better information on the
international activities of GBCs would be useful in determining the potential risk to the banking system.
GBCs intermediate foreign investments into other countries (mainly India) of a primarily equity type,
which appears to be low risk. The float of funds that is held in Mauritius before being sent to their final
destination is deposited with domestic banks. The banks mostly place these deposits with other banks
abroad matching the maturity and currency profile of the funds involved, which should carry very limited
risk. The authorities consider the risks from GBCs to be low and are working on improving the
information available from GBCs to undertake better analysis of the potential risks.

APPENDIX VIII. TOURISM SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS

1

At over 8 percent of GDP, tourism is Mauritius’ major export industry, as well as a potential
channel through which external shocks affect the domestic economy. Staff is currently undertaking
research concerning tourism competitiveness and vulnerabilities stemming from the sector. The study
uses a new panel dataset of the universe of bilateral tourism flows for 1999–2009, covering over
180 countries (underlying data from UNWTO), and applies a gravity model used in empirical international
trade research since the 1960s. This appendix summarizes selected preliminary results that the mission
shared with the authorities.

destinations is complicated by the fact that
2.0
tourism flows to each destination is subject
1.5
to multiple objective factors, known in the
1.0
traditional international trade literature as
0.5
trade frictions. Some of these cannot be
0.0
influenced by policies (at least not in a
-0.5
useful time frame), such as common
borders, distances to main markets, bilateral -1.0
cultural and historical ties. Accounting for
and eliminating these effects allows for
constructing a ranking of countries’ tourism
competitiveness.2 As shown in Figure VIII.1,
Mauritius is doing on par with major
destinations in the Caribbean (The Bahamas
and Jamaica), but is slightly behind regional competitors – Maldives and Seychelles. Preliminary results
also show that Mauritius is doing slightly worse than predicted by the model, which, if correct, would
allow some scope for increasing tourism arrivals through appropriate policies (e.g. further market
diversification) over time.

The tourism industry represents an important channel through which Mauritius is exposed to the
risks emanating from Europe. To quantify the impact of this slowdown, one requires estimates of the
elasticity of tourism—as measured by arrivals, visitor-nights and receipts—to GDP in tourist-originating
countries. Using first differences regressions, staff estimates the elasticity of tourist-arrivals at around
0.54, and the elasticity of the average tourist stay at 0.45. Mauritius is therefore likely to see tourism
demand drop one for one if GDP growth in main markets (France, UK) turns negative. Preliminary results
also indicate that tourists are price sensitive, as each percent of real appreciation is associated with a
0.5 percent shorter stay.

Starting in July 1, 2010, Mauritius intervened occasionally in the foreign exchange market to smooth
excess volatility and the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from free floating to

APPENDIX II. THE JMAP BANK-FUND MATRIX (2012)
(As of February 9, 2012)
The IMF and World Bank Mauritius teams met on February 9 to discuss a Joint Managerial Action
Plan (JMAP). The team from the World Bank comprised Mr. Muñoz (senior country economist) and
from the IMF, Messrs. Petri, Culiuc, David and Ms. Svirydzenka (all AFR).
The IMF’s work program entails continued engagement through the Article IV consultation process
as well as technical assistance in: public financial management provided through the Fiscal Affairs
Department (FAD) and AFRITAC South (AFS); financial sector stability and government debt and asset
management through the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM), and enhancements to
macroeconomic statistics with the support of the Statistics Department (STA).
The World Bank’s work program entails continuing work on infrastructure, competitiveness, public
sector reform, social sectors and social protection. The 2007-2013 World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy for Mauritius aims at helping the Government to deal with (i) short-term trade shocks and
(ii) the transition to a more competitive and diversified economy, while minimizing negative social
impacts along the transition. On-going and planned Bank assistance to Mauritius is:


The Mauritius Infrastructure Project signed in December 2009 seeks to support the
government investment program in transport, water and electricity. Additional support in
infrastructure is envisaged through fee for services and a new infrastructure project under
discussion.



The IFC has focused its interventions on three key sectors: infrastructure, tourism and
financial services. Its activities have been targeted at: supporting the mobilization of foreign
direct investment to these sectors; introducing climate change mitigation and cleaner
production standards and best practices; improving access to finance for SMEs; and
promoting South-South transactions.



The Bank is expected to approve in March 2012 two new two year Development Policy Loans
of $20 million and US$15 million each per year. The Public Sector Performance DPL aims to
support improvement in the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the
government to implement reforms within the following three pillars: (i) strengthening
services that support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation
and processes; and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and
monitoring of SOE performance. The Private Sector Competitiveness DPL aims to support
competitiveness and enterprise development in three areas: (i) improving competitiveness
and growth of enterprises; (ii) improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov
for enhancing competitiveness and transparency.



In line with the DPL agenda, a civil service policy note will be delivered in FY12, to take stock
of the challenges in the sector and support the authorities in the design and implementation
of the on-going civil service reform.

The Bank has initiated dialogue with the government to prepare a Public Expenditure Review
report in FY13 to gain efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector; taking stock and
propose areas of improvement in public enterprises and parastatals; benchmarking service
delivery with peer countries and analyzing the redistributive impact of public services
delivered.



The Bank envisages a series of policy notes to identify opportunities in air space cooperation,
tourism, ports and fisheries between Indian Ocean Countries.

APPENDIX III. RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of February 13, 2012)
The African Development Bank (AfDB)’s 2009-2013 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Mauritius
provides the framework for its partnership with the country. The CSP has two pillars (i) reducing
bottlenecks to competitiveness and trade and (ii) Enhancing public sector efficiency and social
service delivery. The Bank’s assistance to Mauritius combines lending and non-lending activities.
Within the first pillar, the lending program currently focuses on infrastructure development
particularly transport, ports and energy. The lending program within the second pillar focuses on an
operation supporting water and sanitation services. The largest on-going lending operation is a
policy-based lending in form of direct budget support that supports both pillar I and II. About
US$200 million has been disbursed. A review of the operation will be conducted in March, 2012. The
Bank is also providing MIC grants to support policy reforms, capacity building and studies in specific
areas within the framework of the two strategic pillars. These include support to public debt
management, public sector investment program, preparation of the sewerage master plan, review of
outline planning, statistical capacity building and preparation of sector strategies for health, gender
and ICT to improve the Performance based budgeting (PBB). In line with its Regional Integration
Strategy for Southern African, the Bank is supporting the country’s vision of becoming a regional
center of excellence. In this area the Bank is working with the IOC in partnership with the EU,
COMESA and SADC to support the recently launched Regional Multi-Disciplinary Centre of
Excellence. The Bank is also collaborating with the Commonwealth Secretariat in supporting Capacity
Building for Public Debt Management. Past collaboration with the World Bank (and other partners)
has included the following sectors: water, sewerage, and sanitation (the Plaines Wilhems Sewerage
Project) and transport (Southeastern Highway). The Bank collaborates very closely with other
development partners including the World Bank, EU, AFD and UNDP in supporting structural reforms
through its policy based lending. The CSP Mid Term Review Report of 2011 envisages continued
collaboration on the policy based lending, MIC Grants and studies.

MAURITIUS—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of February 10, 2012
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, balance of payments (BOP) and
international investment position (IIP) statistics could be further improved. The authorities are
aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Coverage and accuracy
of BOP and IIP statistics have diminished as a consequence of the growth of global business
license holders. The authorities are in the process of reinforcing the statistical framework. Already,
there were significant improvements in reducing the errors and omissions category in the BOP
statistics.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Mauritius
On March 14, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Mauritius.1
Background
The Mauritian economy continued its recovery in 2011, but growth momentum has slowed down
in face of an adverse external environment. Real GDP growth is estimated to remain at around
4 percent, driven mostly by growth in textiles, ICT, financial services, and real estate.
Inflationary pressures increased substantially in the first half of the year (the year-on-year
inflation rate tripled to 6.6 percent in June) mainly on account of import prices and one-time
increases in administered prices. There was a further jump to 7 percent in November 2011 due
to one-time increases in alcohol and tobacco excises. By December, inflationary pressures
moderated with year-on-year inflation falling to 4.9 percent as the base effects became
absorbed. The fiscal stance was broadly unchanged compared to 2010, but less expansionary
than expected. The overall deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 2.4 percent of GDP. The
structural primary deficit excluding grants decreased from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to
0.1 percent. A small shortfall in total revenues and grants was more than offset by the fact that
capital expenditures were almost 1 percentage point of GDP lower than anticipated. While total
expense remained close to projected levels, contrary to what was anticipated there was a net
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
accumulation of resources in extra budgetary funds of almost 1 percent of GDP. Expense on
goods and services and compensation of employees was lower than projected partly because
of the postponing of local elections to 2012 and delays in filling vacancies in the civil service,
whereas expense on grants and transfers was almost 2 percentage points of GDP higher than
anticipated, because of larger capital grants and transfers to the special funds. Public sector
debt declined to 56 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy was tightened with the key repo rate increased cumulatively by 65 basis points
in response to inflationary developments. To address excess liquidity that built up in the system,
the Bank of Mauritius (BOM) increased cash reserve requirements from 6 to 7 percent in
February and issued Bank of Mauritius Bills and Notes with maturities of up to four years. It also
increased the repo rate by 50 basis points in March and by 25 basis points in June, before
lowering it by 10 basis points in December to address inflationary and economic developments.
Private sector credit growth estimated at 13 percent for 2011 remained adequate, and similar to
2010. The authorities continued to intervene in the foreign exchange market to smooth excess
volatility. Later in the year, the BOM also intervened to limit the appreciation of the rupee with
most of the interventions sterilized. As a result of its liquidity management, the BOM's
profitability was reduced in 2011.
The banking sector remains robust, and the system has proved resilient. Banks have remained
liquid and well-capitalized, with 14.1 percent of Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets
in June. Non-performing loans (NPL) decreased from 2.8 percent of gross loans at end-2010 to
2.6 percent by June 2011. Banks have remained profitable with 21.5 percent return on equity,
despite relatively low leverage ratios. In June 2011, the BOM started publishing CAMEL rating
of domestic banks. This is a welcome development, as it is one of the first central banks in SubSaharan Africa (SSA) to do so. This should contribute to increase transparency about the state
of the banking system. Despite strong export growth, a rebound in world commodity prices led
to a widening of the current account deficit, but international reserves increased. Exports
increased some 16 percent (in dollar terms), with strong growth registered across all major
tradable industries. Tourism receipts grew some 12 percent as well, but a marked decrease in
fourth quarter arrivals from key EU markets point to a difficult year ahead. On balance, the
17 percent increase in imports and a reduction in net transfers widened the current account
deficit to some 10 percent of GDP. The deficit was more than covered with portfolio inflows and
official loan disbursements. International reserves increased in nominal terms, but reserve cover
in terms of imports of goods and services slipped to 4.4 months.
Over the past two decades, wide-ranging structural reforms, supported by prudent policies,
have established Mauritius as a top regional performer. Mauritius’ national statistical capacity is
being strengthened in line with its needs as an emerging economy. In line with these efforts,
Mauritius subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in February 2012.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities’ skillful policy response to the global crisis, which has enabled a strong economic
recovery and contained inflationary pressures. The growth outlook for 2012 is broadly positive,
although external risks have increased. The key priorities going forward are to sustain fiscal

3
consolidation, reduce external imbalances, enhance competitiveness and public sector service
delivery, and foster inclusive growth.
Directors acknowledged the need for higher public investment to remove infrastructure
bottlenecks. At the same time, most Directors saw merit in a slightly less expansionary fiscal
stance than projected for 2012, in view of the need to build policy buffers. In case of a
significant slowdown in growth, contingent measures in the budget can be used and automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate.
Directors agreed that fiscal consolidation needs to be sustained to reduce debt vulnerabilities
and achieve Mauritius’ debt reduction targets. They emphasized the need to reform the social
protection system and public enterprises. They supported efforts to rationalize subsidies and
better target social benefits, and to develop a financial monitoring framework to minimize
transfers to state owned enterprises, implement full cost recovery, and enhance governance.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to ensure price stability, underpinned by an
appropriate monetary policy stance. They supported continuing efforts to remove excess
liquidity in the system. Directors welcomed future plans to adopt formal inflation targeting, which
could help anchor inflation expectations, and supported ongoing initiatives to strengthen
capacity within the central bank.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. They agreed that the floating regime has served the economy well, and that
exchange rate interventions should be limited to smoothing volatility. They noted that an
adequate reserve cushion together with a stronger fiscal position and improved competitiveness
are important to reduce external imbalances and safeguard against shocks.
Directors noted that the banking system is well capitalized and resilient to shocks. They
welcomed efforts to increase transparency and plans to strengthen supervisory coordination,
enhance the stress testing framework, and improve data availability in the financial sector.
Directors called for continued efforts to secure more inclusive and diversified growth. In addition
to social protection and state owned enterprise reform, this will require investments in human
and physical infrastructure, as well as further improvements in the business environment.
Directors commended Mauritius’ subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) in February 2012.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MAURITIUS

Statement by Mr. Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Mauritius
March 14, 2012
My Mauritian authorities thank staff for the constructive and fruitful discussions held in PortLouis in the context of the 2012 Article IV Consultation. The focus of the discussions was on
the economic challenges facing the country given the global uncertainties, and the policies to
be implemented to ensure continuous, sustainable and inclusive growth. In this regard, my
authorities highly appreciated the presentations made to senior officials by staff on the topics
that are included in the Appendix to the main staff paper, and which address critical issues of
interests to the country.
I.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

The Mauritian economy performed well in 2011, with real GDP growing at
4.1 percent, helped by strong growth in textiles, the information technology (IT) sector,
tourism, financial services and construction. This performance is also explained by the
prudent macroeconomic policy put in place since the global financial crisis of 2008/09, and
the continuous structural reforms being implemented in the different sectors of the economy.
Consumer price inflation, after increasing in the middle of the year due to higher import
prices and one-time increases in administered prices moderated to 4.9 percent by the end of
the year. The unemployment rate stood at 7.9 percent at end-2011, same as in 2010.
Growth is expected to moderate in 2012 due to the adverse external
environment. While the authorities welcome the projection by staff of real growth at
3.7 percent, they are concerned about external developments, in particular in the euro zone,
the most important trade partner of Mauritius, as regards trade, tourism and foreign direct
investment. If the external situation is as projected, the authorities are confident that the
policies in place will help to maintain a healthy level of growth. However, should the
difficult external situation worsens or lasts longer, the impact on the Mauritian economy
would be significantly worse, and in this respect, the authorities have already prepared
contingent macroeconomic policies, which are included in the 2012 budget.
Fiscal policy in 2011 was less expansionary than envisaged in the Budget, as capital
expenditure was less than budgeted. Expenditure on goods and services and compensation of
employees were also lower. As a result, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 2.4 percent of GDP.
For 2012, fiscal policy is geared towards improving the economy’s resilience to external
shocks. The 2012 Budget emphasizes higher public investment spending, in particular, to
address infrastructure constraints. However, the authorities will remain mindful of the deficit,
and the objective of reducing the debt ratio which has been brought down to 57 percent of
GDP, of which about 80 percent is domestic debt. If the global situation worsens, the
authorities intend to allow fiscal stabilizers to work, and to reinforce the targeted programs to
protect the poor and help firms restructure. Increased spending on infrastructure, including
from special funds, is also envisaged under such circumstances.
Monetary policy was tightened in 2011 to address inflationary pressures. The
key repo rate was increased cumulatively by 65 basis points and the cash reserve requirement

was also increased from 6 to 7 percent. Private sector credit growth remained at 13.5 percent,
the same as 2010. The Mauritian rupee appreciated during the year, mainly due to strong
capital inflows and despite some interventions by the Bank of Mauritius (BOM). For 2012,
monetary policy will remain focused on maintaining domestic price stability. In the
implementation of its monetary policy, the BOM has relied on a “hybrid inflation targeting”
framework which has been appropriate in the context of the Mauritian economy. However,
the authorities agree with staff on the desirability to move, over the medium term, to a more
formal inflation targeting framework, but before doing so, they are of the view that they
should further strengthen their macro-forecasting and analytical capabilities, as well as price
and external sector statistics. As regards the exchange rate, any further real appreciation not
in line with fundamentals will be viewed with concern, in view of its adverse impact on
competitiveness, and may warrant some exchange rate intervention. However, the authorities
are of the view that presently the overvaluation in itself is not significant enough to warrant
active exchange rate management. They prefer to let the rate be determined by the market,
with limited intervention to smooth out fluctuations.
The banking sector remains healthy. It is liquid and well-capitalized. Its
Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted-assets remains well above Basel II and the
proposed Basel III requirements. Banks have remained profitable, and non-performing loans
are low. The stress tests performed by staff confirm the robustness of the sector and its
resiliency to shocks. In March, 2011 the Bank of Mauritius started publishing the CAMEL
ratings of local banks. Moreover, the BOM has made good progress in preparing the adoption
of a deposit insurance scheme, as recommended by the 2007 FSAP. Enhancing the
coordination of supervision between the BOM and the Financial Services Commission
(FSC), which is in charge of regulating the non-bank financial sector, will continue to be
pursued. Already a protocol of understanding has been signed between the two to reinforce
the framework for exchanging information.
The external current account deficit widened to 10 percent of GDP in 2011.
Although exports increased significantly, imports also increased due to higher costs,
especially food and energy, and imports related to investment in infrastructure. FDI remained
strong at about 3 percent of GDP, and there were loan disbursements to the government on
previously approved projects. As a result, the overall balance registered a surplus of
1.2 percent of GDP.
II.

Medium-term Challenges and Policies

The section in the staff report entitled “Long-term Challenges” and the
appendices describe well the policies that have been implemented and those envisaged
to ensure long-term sustainable growth. My authorities are in broad agreement with the
analyses and policy recommendations of staff. I will therefore highlight some of the most
important features and provide additional information for clarity and completeness.
Maintaining sustainable inclusive growth in the context of macroeconomic
stability remains the primary objective of the authorities. The projection, based on
policies being implemented and envisaged, is for per capita income to grow and reach about
US $12,000 by 2020. Achieving a fair and equitable distribution of income in the context of

high economic growth remains an important objective of the authorities. In this regard, it is
worth noting that extreme poverty is quite low, as less than 1 percent of the population lives
on US $1.25 per day. At the same time, as the economy has developed, the tax system has
become more progressive and social protection has also increased. Nevertheless, groups that
are less poor seem to have benefitted more from economic growth. This is due to a number of
factors as staff’s studies show, as well as the fact that some of the subsidies and social
benefits are given to the whole population. Nevertheless, the authorities very much
appreciate staff’s studies and recommendations and intend to use them to improve the
targeting of social protection expenditures. Already, steps have been taken along the lines
recommended by staff. The Social Register of Mauritius project is now being implemented
which will enable further targeting of some social assistance programs, namely the social
housing and day care centers programs which were announced in the last Budget. A proxy
means test will be undertaken for all beneficiaries of these programs, and this will also apply
to all beneficiaries of Social Aid gradually improving the targeting process.
As regards fiscal policy, it is the intention of the authorities to continue fiscal
stabilization efforts. My authorities will implement policies that should bring the debt ratio
to 50 percent of GDP by 2018, as is legally-mandated. The authorities’ efforts will focus
mainly on curtailing current expenditure, in particular, transfers to public enterprises and
better targeting of social benefits. In this regard, the authorities are strengthening the
monitoring of public enterprises to increase their operational efficiency and minimize
government transfers. It is worth noting that presently, there are no current transfers to
parastatals from the budget and capital transfers are in the form of advances at the cost of
capital to government plus a small premium.
As regards taxation, Mauritius is playing a leading role in the development of
green taxes, which are aimed at taxing CO2 emissions and encouraging ethanol
production. This is being done through a system of subsidy/taxation of cars and ethanol as
explained in Appendix IV of the staff report. Under the system in place for CO2 emissions, a
levy is payable if the CO2 emission exceeds a certain threshold, and a rebate is granted if it is
below the threshold. Regarding ethanol, it is to be noted that the tax system that is being
developed will target the related externality and will not make use of a quantitative ethanol
mandate. The ratio of the mix of ethanol to gasoline will be market determined.
The Mauritian authorities will pursue steadfastly the comprehensive structural
reform plan that is needed to address the structural bottlenecks and to create a
competitive environment conducive to the further development of the private sector.
Important measures are being taken, namely:
•
On the transportation system, the road network is being expanded, and other modes of
transportation are being studied to reduce road congestion. In this regard, a light rail
system on a PPP model is being studied with assistance from Singapore. The
Government also is planning to award, in July, a PPP contract for the road
decongestion program which will introduce toll roads.
•
Water supply has become a serious problem, and the authorities are working closely
with experts from Singapore to develop a water strategy. This strategy is considering,
among others, how to involve the private sector in operating an integrated water
sector. Already, early this year water tariff was significantly increased.

The electricity company, which is profitable, is not expanding its own production but
is relying on private suppliers for both expansion of its base load and renewable
energy (a tender for wind power has just been awarded). It should also be noted that
already about16 percent of electricity is being produced by the sugar factories through
the use of “bagasse”, a by-product of sugar cane, and the electricity is fed into the
national grid.
Air Mauritius, the national airline, has already started the process of looking for a
strategic partner.
The statistical framework is being continuously strengthened, and since February of
this year Mauritius has started to subscribe to the SDDS.

Overall, the Mauritian economy continues to perform well, and vulnerabilities are
being addressed. The authorities remain committed to their reform agenda and will pursue
their efforts that should help to take Mauritius to the next stage of development.
