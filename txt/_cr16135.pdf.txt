IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Maldives
On May 13, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Maldives.
After outperforming its peers for several years, Maldives economy slowed sharply in 2015
to 1.5 percent from 6.5 percent the previous year, as tourism arrivals decelerated. The fiscal
deficit narrowed following measures in the 2015 Budget and a sustained strong revenue
performance, although public debt remains high and on a rising trajectory. The monetary policy
stance was eased in 2015 and credit to the private sector began to pickup. Inflation remains
contained and further pass through from lower oil prices is expected. The current account deficit
widened to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2015, despite a positive terms of trade shock from the decline
in oil prices.
Growth is expected to pick up but the outlook is clouded by the risks of less robust growth in
Asia and uncertain returns from large-scale infrastructure scaling up. Staff expects real GDP
growth to rise to 3.5 percent in 2016 supported by a modest recovery in tourism. A substantial
infrastructure scale up is planned by the authorities comprising three mega projects—airport
expansion, Hulhumalé island development and bridge, and port enlargement—which are aimed
at supporting further development of the key tourism sector and improving resilience to climate
change. The authorities plan a doubling of capital spending in the next three years and are raising
external debt to finance these projects.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Maldives’s considerable progress in reaching middle income
status on the back of rapid tourism development over the past two decades. Directors noted,
however, that important challenges remain ahead. In particular, the planned infrastructure scale

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

up could be transformational for the economy, adding to growth and helping to build resilience
to climate change, but it could also bring with it external financing risks if not implemented
appropriately, as the projects require significant external financing that would add to already
elevated public debt. Against this backdrop, Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue the
development strategy while preserving fiscal and external sustainability.
Directors agreed that a durable fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure that public debt is placed on
a sustainable trajectory. This should include prioritizing overall capital expenditures, leveraging
the well administered tax system to generate higher revenues (including user fees for new
infrastructure and broadening the tax base), and strengthening controls on current spending.
Enhanced public financial management, with a particular focus on public investment
management, would also be key for successful fiscal adjustment.
Directors viewed the stabilized exchange rate regime as appropriate. They generally noted,
however, the staff’s assessment that the external position is moderately weak while the real
effective exchange rate appears moderately overvalued. In this regard, Directors concurred that a
tighter fiscal policy stance would help improve the external position and support the exchange
rate. They also noted that support from monetary and financial policies would be important to
help stabilize the external position. In particular, small step increases in administered rates and
the minimum reserve requirement may be called for if capital outflow pressures emerge.
Directors welcomed the Maldives Monetary Authority’s focus on further strengthening banking
supervision beyond credit risk.
Directors commended Maldives’ success in overcoming logistical challenges to provide near
universal access to basic services across all the inhabited islands. Looking forward, they
encourage the authorities to further build resilience to climate change, reduce the cost of public
service delivery, invest in human capital, and promote economic diversification. Directors
welcomed Maldives’ early ratification of the Paris Agreement. They supported the authorities’
initiatives to establish regional hubs and improve inter-island connectivity, and recommended
establishing a more detailed national development strategic plan to aid coordination and bring
about the expected growth dividends. Directors stressed that strict ring fencing of tax exemptions
for special economic zones will be necessary to preserve the tax base.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 6, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context Maldives living standards have risen to middle income levels over the past two
decades driven by tourism development. The country’s geography—with a widely
dispersed population across small far flung islands—creates fiscal challenges and the
economy has faced persistent fiscal deficits over the past decade. The economy is
highly exposed to climate change which further adds to fiscal costs.
Recent economic developments. The real economy outperformed its peers in the past
few years but tourism slowed last year. The current account deficit widened despite a
positive terms of trade shock but inflation is contained. Public debt is high and on a
rising trajectory. The authorities are embarking on a substantial infrastructure scale up
which could transform the economy but brings with it external financing risks.
Policy recommendations:


Fiscal policy. Durable fiscal adjustment is needed to prevent growing fiscal and
external imbalances. Staff supports priority public infrastructure spending where
benefits clearly outweigh costs. But additional fiscal measures are needed to contain
the overall increase in debt. This should include revenue raising measures and firmer
control of current spending, alongside more prioritized capital expenditure.
Strengthened public financial management is critical to support fiscal goals.



Monetary, financial and external policies. The external position looks moderately
weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies and the exchange rate
moderately overvalued. Alongside fiscal adjustment, support from monetary and
financial policies would help stabilize the external position.



Building longer term resilience. Building climate change resilience, improving
public service delivery and economic diversification are key challenges. Encouraging
voluntary resettlement to regional hubs and better connectivity would reduce the
cost of service provision but will take many years. A detailed national development
strategy would ensure that investment plans are well coordinated and bring about
bigger growth dividends. Diversification into new sectors would be helpful, but care
is needed to preserve the tax base.

SETTING
An islands idyll facing difficult challenges…
1.
Maldives living standards have risen to
middle income levels over the past two
decades driven by tourism development.
Tourism directly or indirectly accounts for three
quarters of activity with income per capita
reaching $6792 in 2014. The economy is highly
dollarized, has a de facto fixed exchange rate but
an open capital account and a deep parallel
foreign exchange market. The country’s unique
geography with 188 inhabited islands and spread
over 90000 sq kms creates fiscal challenges—with
high costs for the provision of public services
across such far flung small islands. Despite this
challenge, Maldives has successfully provided
near universal access to basic services of
electricity, clean water and sanitation (Table 7).
But some gaps remain in health and education;
and many youths have opted out of employment.
2.
The islands are highly exposed to
climate change. The economic costs from
climate change could become very large by the
end of the century, and Maldives would significantly benefit from a reduction in global emissions
(Box 1). Domestic policies—encouraging voluntary resettlement onto fewer islands over the longer
term, promoting renewable energy, improving waste management and environmentally-friendly
tourism infrastructure—would also help adapt and build resilience to climate change.
3.
An unprecedented scale up in public infrastructure is planned which could transform
the economy but brings with it large financing risks. The public investment program is aimed at
further developing tourism, easing constraints in the capital Malé, and includes elements of climate
change adaptation. However, public debt levels are already very high following persistent fiscal
problems; and while the investment program could boost growth in the long run, it will substantially
add to fiscal and external risks in the near term.
4.
Political tensions clouded developments last year. Maldives’ new constitution was
established in 2008, with multi-party elections. Relations between political parties are fractious
which has led to bouts of political unrest over the past ten years. In 2015 tensions rose following the
arrest of the former president; and a sequence of events leading to the imposition of a brief state of
emergency in November.

Box 1. Climate Change Challenges and Adaptation Policies /1
Maldives is highly exposed to climate change from a rising sea level, sea surges and flooding alternating with
drought. The country comprises 25 low lying coral atolls with 1192 islands of which 188 are inhabited. 80 percent of
the total land area is less than 1 meter above the mean sea level. Most of Maldives’ islands are small, half of all
settlements, including tourist resorts, and two thirds of key infrastructure are within 100 meters of the coastline—and
are exposed to severe weather events. Drought and flooding are already occurring with greater frequency than in the
past. High urban density in the capital Malé—home to a third of the population—adds to difficulties.
Climate change adaptation costs are high for public and private sectors, including:



Developing renewable energy. Maldives is reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generation and faces the highest
costs in South Asia. Solar energy is being developed, but geography and population dispersion pose challenges.



Promoting voluntary population resettlement. Consolidating onto fewer islands over the longer term is
necessary to adapt to climate change and would help reduce the costs of service provision.



Improving infrastructure resilience. Coastal protection of inhabited islands, resorts, airports and ports.



Water security. Rainwater is the main source of drinking water on many islands. Changes in annual rainfall
patterns are leading to periods of drought and localized water stress, requiring desalination and strengthened
water resource management policies, including by the tourism industry.



Protection of biodiversity and better waste management. Critical to conserve coral reefs and reduce pollution.



Health. Higher risks from vector and water borne diseases have been identified as an emerging challenge.



Tourism and fisheries industries. Protection of the coral reefs, beaches and coastal infrastructure are essential
for tourism. The fisheries industry will need to adapt to changes in sea temperature.

Maldives could face the highest economic burden in South Asia from climate change and has most to gain
from global action. The Asian Development Bank/UKAID estimate that without global action to tackle climate change
(business as usual scenario), the average economic costs in South Asia would accelerate. For Maldives the costs could
be 2 percent of annual GDP in 2050 and 12 percent of annual GDP in 2100. By contrast, global action (the
Copenhagen-Cancun scenario—keeping the mean temperature rise below 2 C) could limit the economic losses to
Maldives to around 3.5 percent of annual GDP by 2100. Successful implementation of the Paris COP 21 agreement is
therefore critical for Maldives. It will help mobilize grants and concessional financing in key adaptation areas. Research
indicates that early investment in adaptation can help limit losses in later decades; and climate change policies are
most effective when fully integrated in a sustainable development strategy.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Growth has faltered and performance is mixed…
5.
Maldives tourism has outperformed
its peers in the past few years but this
success faded in 2015. Growth slowed sharply
from 6.5 percent in 2014 to around 2 percent
(Figure 1). Tourist arrivals slowed following a
collapse in arrivals from Russia, a slowing from
China (after rapid market expansion) and a
temporary downward blip as November’s state
of emergency led to some cancellations.

by the tourism slowdown, a large increase in
non-oil imports and higher capital outflows.1 Gross official reserves fell back to $564mn at the end
of 2015, although usable reserves showed an improvement, and the parallel market exchange rate
premium increased to 6 percent in January 2016 from 3–4 percent in 2015. Inflation has remained
contained (1.2 percent y on y in December) and further pass through from lower oil prices is
expected (Figures 2 and 3).
7.
Encouragingly, significantly better revenue performance contained the fiscal deficit.
The 2014 fiscal deficit is estimated by staff to have reached 9.1 percent a significantly better outturn
compared to 11.6 percent of GDP expected in the previous Article IV Consultation. In 2015 revenues
were further buoyed by fiscal measures including the increase in the tourism goods and services tax
(TGST) rate, higher business profits tax revenue (BPT) and import duties (Figure 4). Preliminary
estimates suggest a small improvement in the overall deficit in 2015. Outstanding domestic arrears
have also been reduced.
8.
But public debt remains on a rising trajectory. Notwithstanding higher revenues,
sustained deficits have placed public debt on a rising path to 73.1 percent of GDP in 2015, above the
60 percent limit in the Fiscal Responsibility Law—and higher infrastructure spending will drive up
debt further (Figure 4). The international arbitration ruling over the authorities’ cancellation of the
airport operating concession adds a significant contingent fiscal liability.2

In 2012 the authorities cancelled the airport concession contract with GMR and Malaysia Airports Berhad to
upgrade and operate Malé airport. In June 2014 international arbitration ruled in favor of GMR. Maldives Airport
Company Limited (MACL) paid $4mn in immediate costs. A final settlement has yet to be reached.

authorities sought to stimulate credit, reduce interest costs and lengthen maturities. With a
structural excess liquidity position, banks have continued to invest in treasury bills notwithstanding
lower rates and have begun to take up longer maturity treasury bills. After some years of weakness,
private sector credit has turned up rising 13 percent in the year to December (Figure 5).
10.
Financial soundness indicators are strengthening. Banks have met capital adequacy ratios
and are compliant with prudential limits. Legacy non performing loans (NPLs) are being settled with
the sale of tourism resorts and NPLs are down from the 2011 peak (Figure 6). However, a recent
corruption case has highlighted the need to tighten banks’ operational risk management.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS: HIGH STAKES
A. Unprecedented Infrastructure Scale Up
11.
A big push on infrastructure investment is underway to further develop the tourism
sector and create a regional hub around the airport. Three main projects are in the pipeline
(Box 2), costing around 35 percent of GDP and doubling capital spending in the next three years
(Debt Sustainability Analysis).
Box 2. Public Infrastructure Program
Three large projects are planned:



International airport development (cost totaling around US$828mn) will open up Maldives to increased
tourist traffic. The airport is unable to accommodate large jets and is operating at close to full capacity. The
new runway, plus terminal development, would increase passenger capacity fivefold (to 7.5 mn). While,
geographical, logistical and size constraints are likely to cap feasible maximum tourism capacity, there is still
substantial scope for expansion. Tourism and ancillary services are likely to increase once the airport
development is completed. But risks include engineering complexity, implementation capacity, and the
availability of financing.



Phase II Hulhumalé development and bridge (cost totaling around $400mn) will develop a new population
center next to the international airport and Malé, to support population resettlement, ease overcrowding, and
expand electricity generation at lower cost. Projects in the north and southern atolls aimed at developing
hubs are in the early stages of development. Over the medium term, voluntary population resettlement,
supported by employment opportunities, would help adapt to climate change and reduce the costs to
government of service delivery.



Port relocation and development would improve resilience to climate change, ease bottlenecks and reduce
transport costs—but this is at an early stage of planning with financing yet to be identified.

Staff’s Position
12.
On the positive side, the economic gains from investment scale up could be
substantial:


International experience suggests the impact on growth could be sizeable. More direct
flights to small islands are also associated with a large increase in tourist arrivals (Appendix I).
The airport development would remove a key growth inhibitor, potentially generating additional
foreign investment.



There is ample room for Maldives’ tourist
industry to grow. With accommodation at an
average 70 percent occupancy rate, there is capacity
to boost tourism in the short term and expand
substantially in the long run with additional
investment. Long term tourism forecasts point to
robust growth in the Asia and Pacific region, with
South Asia expected to be the most rapidly
expanding region (see Chart).

Climate change adaptation. The capital projects described in Box 2 may help diversify activity,
ease congestion in Malé, and some may help build resilience to climate change.

13.
However, on the negative side, external and fiscal vulnerabilities would increase. The
bulk of infrastructure capital and labor will be imported, requiring foreign exchange cash flow
(through external loans). If growth benefits are not substantial, debt may become unsustainable,
leading to financing difficulties as the infrastructure loans amortize. Strengthened management of
the capital budget is needed to help realize the growth benefits (see paragraphs 20, 27 and Box 3).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

14.
The transformation of tourism will pose additional challenges. Maldives business model
would need to change from a niche luxury market to accommodate a wider range of luxury resorts,
mid-market hotels and guesthouses. Domestic as well as international competition would intensify,
demand would become more price elastic, and tourist spending per head would be lower than it is
today. The challenges of generating demand to meet the expanded supply would likely be greater
than at earlier stages of development.

Authorities’ Views
15.
The infrastructure scale up is necessary to ensure that Maldives remains an attractive
tourism destination and address social and economic challenges. The airport and port are
operating at close to full capacity and substantial investment is needed to accommodate growing
demand. The development of Hulhumalé and the bridge is a key plank of the authorities’ policies to
relieve overcrowding in Malé, further develop the regional center and encourage voluntary
population resettlement which will be necessary as the country adapts to climate change.

B. Outlook and Risks: A Challenging Global Environment
Staff’s Position
16.
Growth rises moderately in 2016 against an uncertain global backdrop, and
infrastructure scale up adds a little to potential in the medium term.


Growth picks up to 3.5 percent in 2016 supported by a modest recovery in tourism—a
marketing initiative aimed at Asia plus new airline services should boost tourism arrivals; higher
transport and electricity generation activity is also likely.



The current account deficit remains close to current levels in 2016 as the highly import
intensive infrastructure projects come on stream and offset the improvement from lower oil
prices, and widens beyond 2016 with higher infrastructure spending. In the near term,
infrastructure spending goes hand in hand with external loan disbursements, but financing
pressures could build as loans mature.

17.
The medium term outlook is clouded by uncertain returns from infrastructure scaling
up, and less robust growth in Asia. Staff factor in a ½ percent of GDP per year increase in
medium-term potential growth from tourism development—consistent with public investment
efficiency in line with the average of less developed economies. More positive growth outcomes
could be achieved with higher public investment efficiency (Appendix I). Growth peaks at 5 percent,
somewhat lower than the 6.5 percent reached during the initial phase of tourism development.

High

The risks are largely on the downside (Appendix IV):



A sharper than expected slowdown in China and persistent U.S. dollar appreciation.
Chinese outbound tourism has broadly held up so far. But a slowdown would dent tourism
arrivals. With tourist resorts pricing in U.S. dollars, a further U.S. dollar appreciation could also
dampen growth.



Policy mistakes could compound vulnerabilities. External debt-financed capital expenditure
will add to already elevated debt levels. Other tax incentive proposals could erode the tax base
(paragraph 42). A re-emergence of political tensions would exacerbate risks.

19.
There is little policy space to respond to risks. Reserves are low and there is no fiscal
space to absorb shocks (including climate change related shocks). Fiscal slippage would likely be
accompanied by capital outflows, pressure on the parallel foreign exchange market premium, and
an erosion of official reserves. In those circumstances an accelerated fiscal adjustment would be
needed with measures to shore up revenues as well as sustained and durable expenditure restraint.

…however, with careful fiscal management, there is upside potential…
20.
Imposing greater fiscal discipline at an early stage would lead to better outcomes.
Careful planning of capital projects (see paragraph 27 and Box 3), revenue raising efforts, and
durable expenditure control would raise investment returns, catalyze additional financing and avert
the need for more abrupt adjustment at a later stage.

Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities expect growth to bounce back to over 6 percent in 2016 and to remain
stronger than projected by staff over the medium term. They expect sizeable domestic spillovers
from public investment, in construction and tourism, which would also boost growth in the medium
term. The infrastructure scale up is seen as necessary to address the bottlenecks in the economy and
expand production capacity. On fiscal policy, non-tax revenues are expected to rise sharply and this
would help cover capital spending; and spending plans would be adjusted if revenues are not
forthcoming.

POLICIES FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Staff’s Position on the Budget
22.

The 2016 Budget is expansionary. Public spending on wages, subsidies and social welfare
has risen sharply in recent years. But in 2015 significant and encouraging progress was made
addressing the deficit through revenue raising measures, a public employment freeze and
streamlining of electricity subsidies. The

substantial boost to non-tax revenues
including from the setup of special economic zones (SEZs) and new resort leases. Staff’s view is
that such a large increase in non-tax revenues cannot be attained, as investors in the SEZs have
yet to be identified and resort openings would need to accelerate sharply to bring in the
revenues envisaged.



Expenditures. Differences on overall expenditures are less—though staff projects less capital and
more current spending than the authorities. Staff and the authorities agree that firm control over
the public sector wage bill is needed but there are also strains on healthcare, and social security
spending. The reversal of the decision to fully eliminate electricity subsidies will add to costs.

23.
Without fiscal adjustment, debt is on an unsustainable path. Staff projects that public
debt could reach 121 percent of GDP in 2020; and would continue rising, substantially above in the
Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). The risk of external debt distress has deteriorated to a high risk
rating. Recent debt contracts have been on semi-concessional terms even though Maldives remains
PRGT eligible.

Staff’s Fiscal Policy Recommendations
24.
Durable fiscal adjustment is needed to prevent growing fiscal and external imbalances.
The 2014 Article IV consultation emphasized that a sustained fiscal adjustment effort was needed
with stronger expenditure restraint. The 2015 budget included measures which were a significant
step forward, although they relied more on revenue raising efforts than on expenditure restraint. It
was emphasized that careful planning of infrastructure investment would help ensure a bigger boost
to growth. Staff supports priority public infrastructure spending where feasibility studies
demonstrate viability (Box 3). But additional fiscal measures are needed to contain the increase in
debt—now requiring both expenditure restraint and further revenue measures. Since the limits in
the FRL are unlikely to be achieved in the near term, interim targets for the current primary balance
could be used to anchor adjustment. Together with more strictly prioritized overall capital spending,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MALDIVES

this would help stabilize the debt ratio by 2020 and bring debt levels down thereafter. A medium
term debt strategy—guided by the FRL—would help anchor the path. The growth impact should be
contained as Maldives has low multipliers.

Expenditure saving. The authorities focus on the public sector wage bill is welcome. The public
service review should be restarted but it will take time to plan and implement, while ensuring
key functions are preserved. A baseline costs review of the healthcare system would identify
emerging pressures and scope for savings. Plans to better target social welfare and food
subsidies through means testing and to eliminate the electricity subsidy (the latter postponed)
are welcome. SOE transparency and oversight should be strengthened to reduce rent seeking.
Savings could also be made through greater use of renewable energy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

Maldives obtain better terms. Presenting the climate-change adaptation features and quantifying
costs in each Budget would help demonstrate Maldives’ development strategy and could mobilize
resources available to small states following Paris COP 21.
27.
Better public financial management is a prerequisite to support fiscal sustainability.
The 2014 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment (PEFA) and recent technical
assistance have confirmed that deep rooted expenditure control problems remain. Difficulties
include unrealistic budgets with insufficient spending allocations, unenforced expenditure ceilings
and reshuffling of spending between activities/ministries. Completion of the Public Accounting
System would address some but not all of these problems. Staff’s technical assistance has
recommended wide-ranging reforms (Table 8), including to public investment management (Box 3).
Strengthening budgetary institutions would improve investment outcomes. An economic
management team, building on the Economic and Youth Council and including the MMA, could be
established to steer investment priorities and instill discipline. Commitment by the Majlis to the
aggregate spending envelope and composition of spending would also help.
Box 3. Public Investment Management Efficiency
Improvements in public investment management (PIM) can significantly enhance the productivity of
investment. In many countries infrastructure scale-up initiatives have not generated a sustained growth impetus as
inefficient processes undermined public investments, crowded out private investments and saddled countries with
high debt (“Making Public Investment Efficient”, IMF 2015).
Maldives’ budgeting and planning process is weak. Capital expenditure proposals are not prioritized, instead a
list of projects is aggregated from all levels of government, with parliament adding projects. Capital budgets are not
aligned with implementation capacity and are undertaken with only partial funding identified. The practice of
deferring capital projects within the year when fiscal revenue outturns disappoint is inefficient and inhibits planning;
new projects are often launched and ongoing projects left uncompleted.
Maldives could strengthen all aspects of the PIM process. A rigorous vetting and selection process (with
feasibility studies) would ensure project viability. Ceilings for capital expenditure should focus on finishing
committed projects before proposing new spending. IMF technical assistance has been offered to follow up in
these areas. A revised annual budgeting and implementation process similar to the one adopted by Chile has been
proposed by staff—the process eliminates projects with no financial viability in the pre-investment phase; starts
political debate over projects after the pre-investment phase; and has mandatory steps for each project decision:
idea, pre-feasibility study, feasibility study, and design.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities expect substantial growth gains from infrastructure scale-up—with the
payoffs enabling debt reduction in the medium term. They do not see a need for higher tax
rates, although they are open to considering base broadening and user fees for some infrastructure
projects. They are optimistic that the increase in external debt is manageable and that non-tax
revenues, expenditure restraint and a boost to growth will be sufficient to repay infrastructure
project loans. If revenues disappoint they would defer some lower priority capital spending. On
expenditures restraint, the public sector hiring restrictions will continue to be enforced and they will

consider undertaking a public service review. The authorities are looking at better targeting
subsidies and social welfare schemes, as well as streamlining healthcare expenditures. Technical
assistance is supporting the strengthening of public financial management, including the capital
budget, and the roll out of the public accounts system. Staff’s proposal to quantify and present the
climate adaptation policies in each Budget is welcome.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
Background
29.
The real exchange rate has appreciated by 30
percent since the 2011 devaluation with a 10 percent
increase over the past year. Since the April 2011
devaluation, Maldives has operated within a wide exchange
rate band at 20 percent either side of Rf 12.85 per dollar
but in practice the rate has stayed at the weakest end of
the band, operating like a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar.3
The real exchange rate has risen as the U.S. dollar has
appreciated against the euro, with increase higher than for
some of Maldives’ competitors.

Box 4. The Operation of Maldives Parallel Foreign Exchange Market
Maldives has a stabilized exchange rate; the capital account is very open but there is an active parallel
foreign exchange market with a stable premium. With low reserves, the MMA is able to supply only a small
fraction of foreign exchange demand to commercial banks. Excess demand leads to the existence of a parallel
market. The tourist industry appears to be a key supplier and driver of the parallel market. The scale of the
premium has been stable fluctuating from 2–15 percent since the GFC (2–6 percent in the past year) possibly
reflecting the oligopolistic nature of the market. Flows are difficult to monitor as many transactions are conducted
abroad and do not go through the domestic banking system.
The parallel market premium and shortage of foreign exchange at the official rate gives rise to exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCP) subject to IMF approval under Article VIII Sections 2(a)
and 3./1 Maldives is an Article XIV member but no longer maintains any measures under Article XIV. The official
exchange rate used by MMA for government transactions may deviate by more than 2 percent from the prevailing
market exchange rate and there is no mechanism to prevent such a spread which gives rise to a multiple currency
practice. Although these measures are non-discriminatory, Fund approval is not recommended as they are unlikely
to be temporary and would be eliminated only once official reserves levels are higher and the fiscal position has
improved. Over the past two years the MMA has eased rationing by increasing the foreign exchange provided to
commercial banks and adjusting amounts in line with seasonal patterns.

30.
Despite lower oil prices, the current account deficit is estimated to have widened in
2015. The deficit will widen as infrastructure projects are implemented but this will be matched by
external financing inflows and does not pose an immediate financing problem, although rollover
risks will rise in the medium term.

Staff’s Position
31.
The external sector position looks moderately weak. The assessment is difficult given the
large turnover in the parallel foreign exchange market, possible underestimation of tourism
spending, and likely data revisions. But, available evidence points in one direction:


Standard indicators (Box 5) point to a moderately weak external position and moderately
overvalued real exchange rate. The loose fiscal stance explains most of the policy gap.



Reserves are low relative to adequacy metrics. The parallel foreign exchange market
premium also points to some overvaluation (Box 4).



Infrastructure spending could add 7–10 pps of GDP a year to the current account deficit.



Further U.S. dollar appreciation could hurt competitiveness.

32.
With a moderately weak external position and pressures likely to build, corrective
action is needed. Fiscal adjustment would help improve the external position and support the
exchange rate going forward. A peg/stabilized regime is appropriate for Maldives given the small
scale, high openness, dollarized nature of the economy, and large seasonal variation in revenues.
The U.S dollar link was historically appropriate given a natural hedge of the tourism sector and
U.S. dollar denominated imports and financing. With greater tourism from Asia, prospective
financing from the region and the future possibility of greater exchange rate flexibility in China,
consideration could be given in the medium term to reviewing the operation of the stabilized
exchange rate.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities are committed to the stabilized exchange rate regime in the current
band and agree that improving the fiscal position is the best way to sustain it. They are of the
view that large capital spending will generate growth which will help contain the fiscal deficit going
forward. The stabilized exchange rate regime and the U.S dollar link remains appropriate and no
exchange rate adjustment is needed at present. The increase in the parallel market premium in
January 2016 is likely to be seasonal and therefore temporary; it has not been passed on to
consumer goods prices suggesting it is not too high. The premium is likely to fall back to 3 to 4
percent, but as it is structural in nature, it is not expected to be eliminated. The authorities agree
that there is likely to be no change on Article VIII issues until official reserves levels have increased
and the fiscal deficit narrowed.

SUPPORTING MONETARY AND FINANCIAL POLICIES.
Background
34.
Monetary policy was eased in 2015 to boost credit, reduce interest costs and lengthen
maturities on sovereign bonds. The MRR was halved to 10 percent and administered yields on
treasury bills and bonds were cut to 3–4.6 percent. With excess liquidity, banks and the pension fund
have continued to purchase treasury bills; and have taken up longer term bonds. Credit growth has
begun to accelerate.
35.
Access to finance remains difficult and the authorities are seeking ways to cut costs.
Maldives ranks 116th on Doing Business indicators (World Bank) for access to finance by small and
medium sized enterprises(SMEs), and financial inclusion is challenging with the high cost of
providing services to remote islands (Appendix III). The authorities’ initiatives include concessional
and Islamic financing to SMEs; and mobile banking services. They have also announced a plan for
sovereign guarantees for private sector loans in the tourism sector as a way to rejuvenate
investment in tourism resorts mothballed since the global financial crisis.

Staff’s Position
36.
The overall monetary stance appears relatively loose, especially given the
expansionary fiscal policy setting and a wider current account deficit. The 2014 Article IV
consultation noted that the policy stance was eased during 2014 with measures that staff viewed as
being aimed at facilitating government financing. Following further easing, the policy stance appears
relatively loose. While previously administered rates were very high, they are now below the rates in
neighboring countries. Though financing pressures are not currently evident, a tightening of yields
in small steps may be needed if financing shortfalls emerge. The authorities should also stand ready
to increase the MRR if the external imbalance looks to be widening, capital outflows increase and
there is pressure on reserves. Open market operations could help mop up liquidity. Over the longer
term, once the fiscal position improves, the MMA should move back to auctions and market based
financing of government debt.
37.

Facilitating credit:



Sovereign guarantees to the private sector. The scheme is a costly way to promote credit and
adds to contingent fiscal costs. Staff recommends dropping or strictly limiting it. If implemented,
the following features would be important—ensure risk sharing with banks; provide guarantees
only on new loans (to residents); and impose fees to build a provisions fund against a call on
guarantees.



Other ways to improve access to finance. Credit growth has been subdued until recently
given public financing needs, high NPLs, and limited information on counterparty risk.
Constraints could be eased: by fully establishing the credit information bureau to aid risk
assessment; and by clarifying secured creditors’ legal rights regarding collateral plus more timely

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

enforcement of the bankruptcy law to help banks more easily recover losses and provide a
better environment for the extension of loans.


Encouraging savings. Developing mobile money through the non-bank (mobile phones)
should help facilitate financial intermediation across the country. The World Bank FSAP
development module may also identify ways to strengthen the savings culture.

38.
There is scope for further supervisory strengthening. Compliance with prudential limits
has improved and NPLs are almost fully covered. Nonetheless there are areas for strengthening and
the MMA’s is increasing its focus on operational, liquidity and market risks alongside credit risk; as
well as building analytical capacity. Plans to relax single borrower limits for some infrastructure
projects backed by collateral will need to be strictly controlled. Risks stemming from high exposures
to the tourism sector, lending concentration and the rapid growth of construction credit deserve
particular attention. Given the high footprint of foreign banks in Maldives, it is important that the
authorities access the views of all home regulators. Reconsidering the types of licenses available to
foreign exchange money changers could assist with prioritizing supervision over large players.
Regular data collection, analysis and closer supervision of large fx operators would assist policy
decisions. A safeguards assessment of the MMA was conducted in 2010; progress has been made on
many recommendations (see Informational Annex), although the recommendation to enhance
MMA’s autonomy and accountability through legal reform remains outstanding.

Authorities’ Views
39.
The authorities view the monetary policy stance as appropriate. The significant
reduction in the MRR in 2015 had helped to turn around a lackluster domestic credit market and
credit expansion in the second half of the year is viewed as positive. The MMA is also mindful that
credit growth should not accelerate too rapidly. The relaxation of the single borrower limit will only
be in clearly circumscribed circumstances, and it will be closely monitored on a case by case basis to
contain financial stability risks. More generally the MMA is bolstering its supervisory capacity and is
focusing more attention on operational and other risks. The impact of the lower yields on treasury
bills and the bond market is yet to be fully observed, but the banks have plentiful reserves and tap
auctions have typically been adequately subscribed. The authorities noted that the sovereign
guarantee scheme will be limited in aggregate size and they plan to take staff’s views into account
when designing the scheme.

BUILDING LONGER TERM RESILIENCE
Background
40.
Maldives’ geography—critical for tourism—poses a climate change challenge and
imposes high costs. The costs of service provision across small and far flung islands is unavoidably
high, and is compounded by the costs of building resilience to climate change and disaster relief
management (see Box 1). Maldives is already investing in a number of areas to adapt to climate
change—food and water security, infrastructure resilience, public health, coastal protection, fishing
industry, waste management and renewable energy—but focus on these priorities is often diverted
by poor planning and the need to deal with a weak fiscal position.
41.
The government is promoting long voluntary resettlement to regional hubs and
improving transport connectivity. This would enable higher quality service provision at lower cost
in key areas such as health, education and water management and would help contain the cost of
climate change adaptation. However, resettlement will take place only over many years as it requires
changes in the social fabric and adequate provision of housing.
42.
The SEZs are part of the government’s strategy to diversify into labor intensive sectors
such as off port shipping services, IT and financial services. The SEZs (with a 40 percent limit on
tourism activity) will encourage mixed activity into labor intensive sectors such as off-port shipping
services, IT and financial services and help diversification.

Staff’s Position
43.
Careful planning and prioritizing infrastructure investment scale up would ensure that
it adds more to growth. It would generate better growth outcomes, raise foreign investment and
unlock cheaper financing. Greater predictability in investment and spending would also reduce
waste. The development of regional hubs and voluntary resettlement will also cut the cost of public
service provision. But resettlement also brings with it the challenge of providing the relocated
population with access to traditional ways of making a living or viable alternatives, and adequate
housing.
44.
Establishing a detailed national development strategic plan would foster coordination
of climate change resilience and other plans and create employment opportunities. Such a
plan would set current infrastructure plans in context and could identify scope for prioritization. It
could include more systematic climate adaptation planning and be supplemented by reporting of
the climate adaptation impact of the Budget, including a quantification of climate change costs. The
strategy could include ways to better prepare and equip Maldivian youth for employment in the
tourism and supporting service sectors.
45.
Ring-fencing SEZs. Staff agrees that development of the SEZs could help diversify
economic activity in labor-intensive sectors. But the SEZs will need to be strictly ring fenced so as
not to substantially add to incentives and undermine the tax base. Keeping the tax system broad
based, simple, transparent, stable and automated is important as it reduces scope for corruption and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MALDIVES

bargaining. Safeguards are also needed to ensure that financial institutions setting up an SEZ face
equivalent prudential, supervisory and reporting requirements as those onshore (including anti
money laundering provisions).
46.
Data gaps could inhibit policy making. Priority should be given to passage of the statistics
law (planned for 2017) which provides data collection powers to the MMA, Maldives Internal
Revenue Authority and the statistics office; and would improve private sector data. The same
requirements should apply to entities operating in SEZs. Continued support through technical
assistance in the areas of external statistics, national accounts and fiscal areas is a high priority.

Authorities’ Views
47.
Climate change adaptation measures features high on the government’s medium term
agenda. The government’s voluntary resettlement policy should generate significant cost savings in
terms of service delivery which will help improve fiscal position and create space for development
activities. Other climate adaptation measures over the medium term include progressive reduction
in thermal generated electricity—to raise renewable capacity—to provide 30 percent of daily peak
load by 2018 and schemes for harvesting rain water for domestic purposes.
48.
The authorities are also hopeful that the SEZ law will bring about much needed
diversification of the economy. The scheme includes a generous tax incentive scheme which
comprises of a blanket 10-year tax holiday (on land tax, GST and income tax) for all approved
ventures. The authorities are hopeful of managing the tax expenditures and believe that the
additional economic activity created will have long term favorable impact on the economy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Maldives developed rapidly reaching middle income levels driven by tourism
development. The real economy outperformed its peers in the past few years but tourism slowed
last year. The current account deficit widened despite a positive terms of trade shock but inflation
has remained contained and further pass through from lower oil prices is expected this year.
50.
Substantial infrastructure scale up could transform the economy but brings with it
external financing risks. Airport development has been shown to have significant growth effects in
other small tourism economies and other projects will support the authorities’ efforts to build
resilience to climate change. However, after good progress in reducing the deficit, the 2016 Budget
is expansionary driven by capital spending. Public debt will rise from already elevated levels, and
prospective external borrowing indicates a high risk of debt distress.
51.
Durable fiscal adjustment is needed to prevent growing fiscal and external imbalances.
Capital expenditures should be prioritized and accommodated only where feasibility studies show
the benefits clearly outweigh the costs. Additional restraint is needed to contain the increase in
debt. Staff would recommend a fiscal adjustment of around 5.5 percentage points of GDP by 2020.
User fees should be charged for key infrastructure. Maldives well administered tax system can be
leveraged to generate higher revenues, through base broadening and higher tax rates. Firmer

MALDIVES

control of current spending is needed—including the wage bill and healthcare costs. Plans to better
target subsidies should move forward. Stronger public financial management, including over capital
budgets would raise the probability of successful fiscal adjustment.
52.
The external position looks moderately weak. The current account deficit has widened,
the real exchange rate appreciated last year following U.S. dollar appreciation and reserves remain
low relative to adequate levels. Notwithstanding uncertainties, overall the external position looks
moderately weaker than fundamentals and desirable policies; and the real exchange rate moderately
overvalued. A tighter fiscal policy stance would improve the external position and support the
exchange rate. A stabilized exchange rate regime continues to be appropriate for Maldives. The
parallel market premium of greater than 2 percent, the rationing of foreign exchange and an official
exchange rate used by MMA for government transactions that may deviate by more than 2 percent
from the prevailing market rate, leads to multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions.
Without a timetable for removal of these measures, Fund staff does not recommend their approval.
53.
Support from monetary and financial policies would help stabilize the external
position. The current monetary stance appears relatively loose, especially given expansionary fiscal
policy. Small step increases in administered rates may be called for and the MRR may need to be
raised if capital outflow pressures emerge. The MMA’s focus on further strengthening supervision
beyond credit risk should continue.
54.
Building climate change resilience, improving public service delivery and economic
diversification are key medium term challenges. Maldives could face substantial long run
economic costs from climate change. Encouraging voluntary resettlement to regional hubs and
better connectivity is an important part of the authorities’ adaptation strategy. It would also reduce
the cost of service provision but will take many years. Establishing a detailed national development
strategic plan would help ensure that investment programs are well coordinated and bring about
growth dividends. Diversification of economic activity in new sectors through SEZs is welcome but
strict ring-fencing of SEZ tax exemptions is needed to preserve the tax base.
55.
Work strengthening statistics is yielding good returns and should be continued. A
statistics law would help greatly improve private sector data provision.
56.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Appendix I. The Benefits and Costs of Scaling Up Using a Debt
Investment Growth Model
International evidence shows that the benefits of airport development could be substantial. The airport
expansion in particular could have a substantial growth impact, expanding capacity, leading to lower airfares and
boosting tourism demand:



Airport development. Punta Cana has become a key Caribbean tourist destination as its airport became the
most important in the Dominican Republic: raising numbers from 850 thousand tourists (35 percent of all
arrivals in the country) in 2000 to nearly 3 million (65 percent of arrivals) in 2014 (an increase of almost 240
percent).



Culiuc (2014) suggests that the presence of direct flights to small islands is associated with a large increase in
tourist arrivals. While estimates are sensitive to estimation methodology and control variables, increases range
between 20–80 percent. Acevedo et al (2015) finds that increasing the number of flights to tourist destinations
is the most effective way to boost tourist arrivals.

But there are fiscal as well as growth implications from infrastructure scaling up. Research in the October
2014 WEO, Is it Time for an Infrastructure Push? The Macroeconomic Effects of Public Investment, showed there are
historically wide variations in the macroeconomic outcomes of public investment for emerging markets and less
developed economies—with inefficient investment often leading to larger fiscal deficits without substantially
improving the quality of public assets.
A debt investment growth (DIG) model traces the possible growth and fiscal impacts for Maldives (see
Selected Issue).12 The DIG model takes into account the highly open nature of Maldives’ economy, high import
intensity, and the size and pace of investment plans. Since the benefits are mainly to the tourism sector, and
supporting FDI will be needed in resorts and transportation to fully exploit the enhanced infrastructure, there is
greater than usual uncertainty about the economic impact. This is captured by using alternative rates of return for
public capital.



The baseline demonstrates potential for higher growth. With the return on public capital in line with the
average drawing on evidence from less developed economies, the model suggests a temporary by sustained
increase in real growth rates of ½–¾ percentage points can be attained (Figure A (right panel), blue lines). But
higher growth rates can be achieved with greater efficiency of public investment.

The impact on public finances is also large. An increase in tax rates of more than 6 percentage points to 19
percent would be necessary to finance the scaling up and limit the impact on the deficit in the absence of
further adjustments, even allowing for a substantial amount of concessional debt. A more balanced fiscal
response with a smaller increase in taxation could be achieved with other, complementary adjustments in the
budget, such as in public transfers—to limit the increase in taxes to 15 percent would require a temporary cut
in transfers of 2.5 percent of GDP. The authorities’ current plans are more heavily weighted to external debt
than would be suggested in this model.



Sound project implementation is crucial to boost private sector confidence and to reap all the
potential benefits. Increasing the return on public investment from 25 to 50 percent, could increase
output growth by an additional 0.6 percentage points for 3–4 years after completion, and by around 0.3
percentage points for 6–7 years. Private investment and capital, as well as private consumption, would all
increase substantially over the medium-to-long term. Poor project management that results in lower
public investment efficiency would not add much to growth but would drive the debt level higher.

Appendix II. Maldives: Tax System – Keep it Simple, Keep it Fair
Maldives tax system and revenue performance compare favorably to South Asian economies and
Caribbean islands. Maldives tax system is relatively new with a small number of broad based taxes that enables
efficient tax administration and strong revenue collections. The tax system being newly established operates
efficiently and productively and has not been distorted with tax incentives which other comparators find to be
the main cause for their tax base erosions and weakening revenue performances. As the tax system matures, it is
important to maintain its strengths as a simple, fair and effective framework and avoid introducing tax incentives.
Experience shows that tax incentives carry a significant risk to the long-term revenue generation capacity.
Maldives Special Economic Zones Act 2014 (SEZ) sets unlimited discretionary space for tax incentivizing
of investment, which carries significant risks to the current simple, effective and efficient tax system. SEZs
are specifically designated geographical areas with special regulations and financial incentives aiming at
attracting investment and job-creation. Maldives plans to set up free trade, offshore financial services, industrial,
export processing, and ports SEZs. Incentives include wide-ranging exemptions from import duty, BPT, GST, and
withholding taxes, and concessions in bringing in expatriate workers and land taxes. There are many
shortcomings to SEZ framework, particularly:


Unlimited room for discretion. Respective roles and margins of discretion are not clearly defined.
Some incentives are automatically available (“guaranteed”), while more generous ones are subject to
negotiation. The act does not define roles, accountability, reporting, and oversight frameworks for
issuing, negotiating, and evaluating incentives.



Unlimited room for tax incentivizing. The act does not define nature of tax incentives and its limits.
Potentially extremely broad tax exemptions, holidays, rate reductions, and various forms of deductions
could be obtained affecting BPT and GST legal frameworks.

Discretionary tax incentivizing under SEZ may undermine health, stability and efficiency of the overall tax
system. SEZ sets open windows for interaction between various Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and government
opening unlimited space for using tax incentivizing. Similar to Caribbean countries and Sri Lanka, this will invite
competition among potential investors, business community, individuals to seek tax regime customizations
which will be made available only for these groups, protecting them from any unwanted competition. More
importantly, this will make tax system prone to annual injections of new tax incentives, eroding the tax base and
reducing the revenue potential. As a result of these efforts, current efficient and effective tax system will become
increasingly complex, unpredictable, and unstable. More tax incentives are granted under SEZ, more government
would need to scramble to find alternative revenue sources, increase tax rates, and bring on new taxes to
compensate for the tax base erosion and revenue reduction from incentivizing.
Consideration should be given to tightening SEZ legislation with a view to limiting discretionary space
and protecting integrity of the existing tax system. In particular: i) define roles, responsibilities, accountability
and reporting framework for various agencies involved in tax incentivizing decisions; ii) use alternative incentive
mechanisms than the tax legislation; iii) establish gatekeeper role for ministry of finance and treasury for any tax
incentivizing decisions with a view of protecting integrity of the tax system; iv) quantify and report all tax
incentives as part of budget submission; and v) establish and enforce quantitative ceilings for tax incentives, if
such being considered.

Appendix III. Financial Inclusion in the Maldives
Financial Inclusions (FI)—access to formal financial services by households and firms—is especially challenging
for Maldives, given the high transaction and sunk costs of providing these services to the sparsely populated and
remote islands.1 Despite these challenges, Maldives compares relatively favorably on two measures of FI: the
number of bank branches and the number of ATMs, if measured in terms of area (Chart 1). Additionally, it also
scores relatively well on FI amongst some developing economies in Asia according to a study done by the Asian
Development Bank. 2 However, because of the high population density in the capital and larger islands, these
indicators are pulled down when measured on a per 100,000 adults basis highlighting the problem that FI on the
small remote islands is still very low.

Improving financial access by marginalized groups would help them raise income (reducing its volatility), and
build assets, promoting growth and improving resilience to economic shocks. As part of their efforts to increase
FI, the Maldives authorities are scaling up their support to SMEs including through concessional and Islamic
financing, reviving small scale industries, encouraging female labor force participation and prioritizing
government contracts to SMEs. The Bank of Maldives has also increased its FI efforts by providing a range of
services via dhoni banking units to the remote islands. They have also announced that plans are under way to
provide banking services to all islands by 2017. In addition, the FIRST Initiative has also launched a project—
Enabling a Non-Bank Mobile Money Solution—that addresses financial inclusion targeting the population in the
outer islands where financial infrastructure is largely absent.3

1

FI is measured in three dimensions – access, usage, and quality of financial services and products. A total of 24 key categories
endorsed by G20 leaders measure the three dimensions of financial inclusion. See http://www.gpfi.org/featured/g20-basic-setfinancial-inclusion-indicators. Given that the authorities only submit data to the Financial Access Survey and not to FINDEX, only data
on access is currently available (the authorities plan to report to FINDEX in 2016).

Challenges persist and credit remains expensive and exclusive due to: (i) limited information about counterparty
risk (the coverage of the credit registry is limited); (ii) a lack of accurate information on collateral (given the
absence of an electronic collateral registry) and complexities in the legal framework. Credit diversification is
therefore limited and businesses not in the perceived profitable sectors have difficulties in obtaining credit.
Furthermore, harnessing up to date technology such as mobile and internet banking would help the population
in remote atolls to have access to basic financial services and reduce transaction costs. Internet banking is
available from the major banks but mobile banking is still in its nascent stage and the widespread scope of
telecom connectivity is still underutilized.
Measures to improve inclusion include: revamping the credit registry and pushing for technology like mobile
banking to combat geographical constraints in parallel to schemes to promote the ease of credit to women and
youth via SME development. Strengthening financial literacy programs, conducting surveys to understand the
needs of minority groups and their constraints, making use of existing networks like the postal system for
financial awareness would also help.

2. Global risks—structurally weak growth in China (medium term), a sharp slowdown in growth in
China in 2015/16 and persistent US dollar strength (short term). Tourism activity has been driven
increasingly by arrivals from new markets such as China. A slowdown which affects Chinese middle class,
outbound travel and spills over to other Asian economies would have a significantly negative impact on
Maldives tourism arrivals. A further U.S. dollar appreciation against the euro could also dampen growth.
The real effective exchange rate has risen as the US dollar appreciated and Maldives may be losing some
competitiveness compared to other tourist destinations. As a high end destination with around
60 percent of resorts in the 5 star and plus category, Maldives tourist demand is likely to be relatively
price and income inelastic—though the new and growing middle-market is likely to be more price
sensitive. But over time a further sharp U.S. dollar appreciation against the euro would likely have some
dampening effect on demand
High
3. Policy slippages. Stronger public financial management and investment management needs to be in
place to help manage fiscal vulnerabilities. The large public investment program is substantially adding
to downside risks.



The baseline projections show that debt is on an
unsustainable path and will add to external pressures in
the medium term. The authorities’ investment plans
need to be prioritized, sequenced and carefully
managed to avoid debt distress. Public financial
management needs to be substantially strengthened.
Financial supervision can be further strengthened.

 Domestic and external shocks would add to an already

highly vulnerable outlook, cause the fiscal position to
deteriorate, would place pressure on the parallel market
premium, and erode the level of MMA official reserves.

 In the event that risks materialize, fiscal adjustment

would need to be accelerated and investment plans
abated. Tough and durable expenditure control would
need to be in place.

 Financial stability risks need to be closely monitored, In
the events of strains in a bank a range of resolution
measures would need to be considered and should
include independent external assessment.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and
50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
“Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Exchange Arrangements
Since April 2011, the rufiyaa has floated in a band of 20 percent on either side of Rf 12.85 per dollar. In
practice, however, the rufiyaa has been virtually fixed at the band’s weaker end of Rf 15.42 per dollar.
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands and the de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized exchange rate arrangement. Maldives
continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV but no longer maintains any
measures under this provision, and has not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,

channeling of foreign exchange transactions for current international transactions to the parallel

practice subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 3 and also to an exchange restriction, given
the additional cost involved for obtaining foreign exchange. The extent of rationing has been eased
over the past two years by increasing the amounts provided to commercial banks and adjusting
amounts in line with seasonal patterns. The official exchange rate used by the MMA for government
transactions is calculated based on the mid-point of the weighted average of the buying and selling
rates of foreign exchange transactions conducted by commercial banks one day earlier. The lack of a
mechanism to prevent the spread between this official exchange rate used by the MMA for
government transactions and the prevailing market exchange rate from deviating by more than 2
percent gives rise to a multiple currency practice subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 3.

Last Article IV Consultation
The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 11 2015.

Technical Assistance
FAD: FAD main areas of engagement are in Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment and providing TA for cash management. A joint IMF/WB-led PEFA assessment was carried
out in February 2014 to gauge progress made since the last PFM Action Plan for 2009-2011, identify
remaining weaknesses and future direction. As a follow-up to the PEFA, the FAD team together with
the World Bank developed a Public Financial Management Reform Plan (PFMRP) for the GoM in June
2014. This was a broad PFM reform and consolidation plan aimed at improving the overall policymaking, coordination, implementation and monitoring framework in PFM. Altogether 3 missions on
cash management have been carried out since FY14 by the Cambodia-based Regional PFM Advisor.
These missions focused on developing a cash management manual for the GoM and related activities.
To consolidate this work and to broaden it to expenditure and commitment controls, the August 2015
mission reviewed progress. The mission developed an updated action plan to make the cash
management unit functional, start using the cash flow forecasting model and the implementation of a
commitment control system. On request from the authorities, in September 2014 FAD carried out a
review of Chart of Accounts (CoA) at the ministry of finance and proposed structure for a revised CoA
and an action plan to achieve same. The mission was coordinated with an overlapping STA mission to
review the mapping of the government COA to GFSM 2014.
LEG: In October 2003 provided technical assistance on the revision of the Maldives Monetary
Authority Act (MMA Act). A series of missions (March and September 2005, and April 2006) were
provided to revamp the banking law. In August 2009, a mission provided assistance on the MMA Act
(jointly with MCM). A follow-up mission in February 2011 focused on payments law. LEG conducted an
AML/CFT assessment in October 2010 and conducted a desk-based review of the draft AML/CFT law
in May 2012. In 2014 and 2015 LEG provided advice on the Special Economic Zones Law, offshore
banking legislation and deposit insurance.

MCM: Two missions visited in 2006 on monetary operations, financial market development, and
banking issues. In 2007, a series of mission were provided on debt management, monetary policy and
financial supervision. In 2008, three missions visited on monetary operations and liquidity
management, monetary policy and financial supervision issues. In November 2008 and
March/May/August 2009, a series of mission were provided on research capacity building, bank
supervision, monetary policy and the MMA act. Two missions visited Malé to advise on monetary
operations, liquidity management, and the development of a crisis management framework. In
December 2010, MCM conducted a TA mission on crisis preparedness and management, bank
restructuring, and monetary operations. In May and September 2011, MCM consecutively conducted
missions on the development of debt markets, and on on-site banking supervision. In February 2012,
MCM undertook a TA mission on assessing the foreign exchange operations framework. In 2014,
MCM conducted a series of TA missions on banking supervision in early February and late May. Also,
together with APD another joint mission on developing foreign exchange market was carried out.
MCM also provided advice on deposit insurance schemes. In 2015 MCM fielded two missions to Malé
in the areas of banking supervision (March) and foreign exchange reserve management (September).
A mission is confirmed for late March 2016 to advise on foreign exchange and monetary policy
operations
STA: In May 2007, STA conducted a mission on money and banking statistics. In February and April
2011, STA offered TA on multiple topics covering improvements in balance of payments statistics,
government financial statistics (GFS), monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and national accounts. In
June and September 2011, STA conducted TA missions on improving price statistics and on the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). In February, May, and October 2012 STA continued
providing TA on improving price statistics. Similarly, in April 2012, a TA mission on improving national
accounts covered constructing GDP from the expenditure side and compiling quarterly national
accounts. Further advice on improving GDP and developing quarterly GDP was provided in November
2012, January and July, 2014, and April 2015, the latter jointly with APD . Subsequently, Maldives
attended a workshop for the ICP-SNA project covering both national accounts and price statistics.
Between March 2013 and January 2016, STA field eight TA missions on balance of payments statistics,
in the context of a project funded by the Government of Japan. Another TA mission on balance of
payments statistics is scheduled for March 2015.

Safeguards Assessment
In line with the Fund's safeguards assessments policy, an assessment of the Maldives Monetary
Authority was concluded in March 2010. In addressing recommendations, the MMA appointed an
external auditor and strengthened controls over foreign payments through the automation of the
authorization process. A Chief Internal Auditor has also been appointed, while capacity in the internal
audit function continues to be improved. In addition, to strengthen the legal framework, amendments
to the MMA Act were drafted in 2011 in consultation with the Fund. While the MMA Act was amended
in 2015, some safeguards recommendations on the establishment of an Audit Committee, limits on
credit to government, and safeguards for personal autonomy of Board members have not been
incorporated.

IMF–WORLD BANK JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN
(As of February 2016)
The World Bank Group Systematic Country Diagnostic (2015) for Maldives identified three specific
priority areas to promote growth, reduce poverty, and increase shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner. The priorities are as follows: enhancing opportunities in tourism and fisheries for the
local population; enabling opportunities for the creation of new sources of inclusive growth; and
enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reduce macro-fiscal
risk. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY16-19, which relies heavily on the SCD analysis,
and is expected to be presented to the Board in April 2016, proposes a selective program of
engagement that aims to enable more inclusive and sustainable growth through better use of the
country’s assets including human capital, natural assets and financial resources. Under the
proposed CPF program, support is oriented towards enhancing the economic participation of
Maldivians to improve the inclusiveness of growth and deepening successful interventions in the
following sectors: education, public finance management, environment and natural resource
management and renewable energy. Youth, gender, governance and climate resilience are crosscutting themes that are recognized as essential for social inclusion and sustainable management
of resources.
The World Bank is supporting a Public Financial Management Systems strengthening project for
FY 15-20, with the objective to enhance budget credibility, transparency, and financial reporting
of central government finances. It is focusing on strengthening the PFM environment (including
enhancing the medium-term fiscal framework and strengthening debt and cash management)
and strengthening budget execution. A separate Bank funded project supports the office of the
Auditor General in updating the audit law, conducting performance audit pilots and training the
staff on auditing the consolidated financial statements of the country using international audit
standards.
The teams have been holding, and will continue to hold, joint missions and regular briefing
meetings on macroeconomic developments. Public financial management is a key area of
collaboration for these operations.
The Bank is taking the lead on a number of initiatives aimed at improving targeting of universal
subsidies and reforming social protection:




Health: Bank technical support currently focuses on helping achieving operational savings
for Aasandha, though substantial capacity building of the implementing agency, NSPA,
would be needed to plan, implement and monitor the much needed reforms.
Poverty: the Bank – through the Statistical Capacity Building Project and Poverty
Technical Assistance – has been assisting in the design of a new Household Income and
Expenditure survey, which is planned to start field operations in March 2016. Upon the

completion of the survey which is expected by November 2016, the poverty team will
assist in the estimation of a new, official national poverty line for Maldives.
Proxy Means Testing: Bank support has helped NSPA develop a targeting mechanism
based on both means and proxy means test (PMT) methods to target the electricity
subsidy and other social safety net programs; the PMT formula will be updated once new
HIES data is available

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of August, 2015)
The ADB country operations business plan (COBP), 2015–2017 was approved in February 2015, and
was based on the interim CPS, 2014–2015. Appendix 1 provides an updated results framework under
the new business plan. To anchor the COBP -- particularly the program in its first year, an abridged
interim CPS –consistent with CPS 2014-15 was prepared for 2016. A full CPS spanning 2016–2020, is
to be prepared in 2016. This will inform successive COBP’s.
The Maldives is eligible for resources from the Asian Development Fund. Indicative resources
available during 2016−2018 amount to $25.36 million. The final country allocations for 2017 and
2018 will be subject to available Asian Development Fund grants and concessional ordinary capital
resources and the outcome of the country performance assessments. The Maldives was eligible for a
100 percent grant share of country allocations in 2015. The proportion of grants for the country
allocations in 2016–2018 will be determined by future annual debt distress classifications. As per the
Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB will make efforts, wherever possible, to secure co-financing
resources for projects to be developed during the COBP period.
The indicative assistance pipeline (both for lending and non-lending products) for 2016–2018 and
the ongoing non-lending program is given below:

For 2016, funds for the Kulhudhuffushi Harbor Expansion Project was reduced from $12.68 million to
$9.69 million; this is the result of the revised allocation of Asian Development Fund resources for the
Maldives for 2015 and 2016 (the project uses the resources set aside for 2015 and 2016). The L. GanFonadhoo Major Cross-Roads Project, proposed as standby in 2017 in the previous COBP, is to be
moved to 2018 as a firm project with a change in the name to L. Gan-Fonadhoo Community
Connectivity Project.

kept on standby pending a funding decision on the proposal to be made to the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction, as well as a request from the government for specific TA components. For 2017,
a project preparatory TA is proposed for the Township Development Project (for $1,000,000), as
suggested by the government and as part of its plans for the development of urban areas. The funds
are to be used for a project design advance, as needed. Finally, for 2018, a capacity development TA
is proposed to be attached to the L. Gan-Fonadhoo Community Connectivity Project (for
$1,000,000).
Non-sovereign operations.
There are ongoing constraints in actively pursuing private sector investments and non-sovereign
operations in the Maldives. Two critical ones are (i) the lack of effective convertibility of the rufiyaa,
and (ii) the country’s weak sovereign rating. To this should be added the generally weak capacity of
the private sector in key areas such as financial management and accounting, and constraints
regarding the availability of a skilled workforce. Given the government’s strong push for economic
transformation, which includes support for private sector investments, ADB will—during 2016–
2018—consider scoping out specific areas where it can support the private sector, which will
subsequently support inclusive economic growth. Where feasible, ADB will discuss with the
government support for possible areas of non-sovereign operations that could be considered in the
future.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics have improved in recent years, with technical assistance from
STA and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). While data are broadly adequate for surveillance
(Category B) there are nonetheless significant data gaps that complicate policy making and
aspects of surveillance. Remaining shortcomings affect the balance of payments, government
finance, and national accounts statistics.
Real sector: National accounts statistics are available on an annual basis and with a considerable
lag, though the authorities have also begun to publish quarterly GDP data. While GDP estimates
are made using both the production and expenditure approaches, these estimates are
inconsistent. Furthermore, the base year for constant price estimates is 2003, so that recent
changes in the structure of the economy are not reflected by the base period weights. The AsDB
has assisted the authorities in setting up a framework for compiling more comprehensive
national accounts and STA has provided substantial assistance for improving the annual
production and expenditure GDP measures, and for developing quarterly GDP series.
The CPI was rebased to June 2012=100, with assistance from STA. Weights are based on the
2012 household income and expenditure survey.
Fiscal sector: General government data are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the
latest published data are for 2011. Monthly data on revenue and expenditure are available, but
the reporting system is new, and its reliability is as yet untested. In particular, the consistency of
these data with below-the-line financing numbers provided by the monetary authorities is weak.
Data on external debt are subject to reconciliation with creditors. Data on the operations of state
enterprises are limited.
Financial sector: APD receives an electronic report on monetary statistics every two weeks,
covering the balance sheets of the MMA and the commercial banks. Current summary data are
published in the MMA’s Monthly Statistics publication as well as in its QEB and AR. There are
inconsistencies between monetary and fiscal data regarding the financing of the fiscal deficit due
to issues of timing and coverage. The MMA uses the standardized report forms (SRFs) to report
data for the central bank and other financial corporations on a regular basis. An integrated
monetary database that meets the needs of the MMA, STA, and APD and is operational.
External sector: The MMA compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis. Coverage has
improved substantially but is still limited in some areas and recent recommendations provided
by technical assistance missions have yet to be implemented. Travel credits (receipts) and other
services items are estimated on the basis of tourism GST receipts and the use of the withholding
tax on services provided by nonresidents which has improved the coverage of other services

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

(debits) although it does not capture all cross-border services. The survey run by the Ministry of
Tourism should be used to validate the estimates related to the travel credits. The MMA
conducted the first survey on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) in June 2013 and a second
in 2015; a new regulation should address the problem of a low response rate. The FDI source
data are now sufficiently detailed to enable Maldives` participation in the next IMF`s Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey (CDIS). Other private financial flows are estimated on the basis of the
CPIS and BIS data, but coverage needs to improve. A revised and more complete international
investment position dataset consistent with the financial account will be disseminated in April
2016. Quarterly data on external debt and debt service are available for the government and the
monetary authority, and to some extent for the banking sector and state enterprises at the time
of the annual consultation missions, but no data are reported for the nonfinancial private sector
and the external debt data are not reported to QEDs. STA technical assistance missions have
been working to improve external sector data and the International Investment Position.
Notwithstanding recent improvements in the balance of payments statistics, the reliability of the
data is uncertain—in part as it is inherently difficult to capture full data with many transactions
occurring outside the country and no international counterparty data on tourism services to
validate revenue estimates.
Official reserves assets are reported every two weeks with a (variable) one-week lag.
Predetermined foreign currency outflows (mainly debt service payments) are known and
reported to APD at the time of annual Article IV consultation missions, while other movements of
foreign currency assets are not identified.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Maldives has participated in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
October 14, 2011.

No data ROSC available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The authorities report macroeconomic data to the IMF on a regular and generally timely basis for
publication in the IFS, BOPSY, and GFSY.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

Approved By

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Development
Association (IDA)

Kalpana Kochhar,
Catherine Pattillo (IMF),
and Satu Kahkonen (IDA)
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) updates the March 2015 DSA. Maldives’ external risk rating
has been elevated to a high risk of debt distress, based on an assessment of public external debt in
the context of large prospective increases in capital spending. The assessment of the overall risk of
debt distress is also high and is reinforced by significant vulnerabilities related to domestic debt.
The 2016 Budget, included in the baseline, projects a substantial increase in capital spending
financed wholly by external debt (with no offsetting fiscal measures) which will add to both debt
and foreign currency risk and would markedly change the composition of Maldives debt. The
execution rate of the capital projects is highly uncertain—and under-execution is likely—but after
factoring this in debt still rises sharply (and there could be cost overruns). The authorities’ 2016
Budget entails a large increase in external debt which would breach the PV of external debt to GDP
threshold.1
Fiscal policy mistakes and shocks to tourism exports or foreign direct investment are key risks that
could trigger debt distress. To stabilize and then reduce public debt ratios, staff proposes greater
prioritization of capital expenditures, additional fiscal revenue and expenditure measures and
public financial management reforms. Adjustment measures – as illustrated by the staff’s
illustrative scenario (Figures 4 and 5)—are needed to reduce the probability of debt distress while
accommodating an increase in capital expenditure.

Maldives continues to be classified as a medium performer in terms of policies and institutions by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), averaging 3.25 over 2012–14.

MALDIVES

RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
Total public debt has risen rapidly since the 2004 tsunami and is above the 60 percent limit in the
Fiscal Responsibility Law as of end-2015 at around 73.1 percent of GDP (Table 3).23, The increase
initially reflected additional expenditure needs in the aftermath of the tsunami but more recently
additional recurrent spending on wages, social welfare, and subsidies and capital spending on
infrastructure scale up. Under the baseline scenario, public debt would remain on a rising path over the
medium term.
Public Debt Holdings by Sector

Public debt is held mainly by
domestic banks, pension funds, the
Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA)
and official multilateral and bilateral
creditors (text figure).
The economy has relied heavily on
the issuance of treasury bills and
monetization as well as external
borrowing to finance deficits.
Domestic arrears are likely to have
declined significantly in 2015 (aided by
better revenue performance) and the
DSA baseline assumes these are cleared
over a period of three years.

The external debt ratio has declined since the global financial crisis. Between 2010 and 2015, net
repayments of external public and publicly guaranteed external debt and private external debt reduced
the external debt (Table 1 and 3). With an open capital account and little reporting, private sector
external debt data are subject to large errors and there are likely to be further revisions to debt
estimates.
Taken together private external debt and total public debt are estimated at about $ 2.6 bn
(82.3 percent of GDP) in 2015.

The fiscal year for Maldives is January to December.
Public debt is defined as the debt of the non-financial public sector comprising central government, including loans on-lent to State

Owned Enterprises. It does not include publicly guaranteed debt and domestic arrears. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) is
currently undertaking a process to gather and record all data and information regarding government guarantees. Once the process is
completed, guaranteed debt might be included in the analysis.

Box 1. PRGT Eligibility for the Maldives
The PRGT eligibility framework reviewed on a two-year cycle was last reviewed in June 2015. Maldives
continues to be PRGT eligible to date. The criteria for PRGT eligibility – income and market access criterion –
are closely linked with the PRGT’s key objectives that access should be reserved for members with low per
capita income levels who do not have durable and substantial access to international financial markets. Even
though Maldives meets the income criterion by a large margin, its short term macroeconomic vulnerabilities
particularly a risk of income decline and loss of market access from elevated debt kept it from graduating
from PRGT eligibility. Broad alignment with IDA practices was also an important element in defining its PRGTeligibility as it still remains an IDA-only country based on the small island economy exception, receiving most
of its assistance from IDA on grant terms.
With medium term risks like the planned investment scale up, the slowdown in China (its largest tourism
market) and the possible costs from climate change, concessional financing will continue to be a key source
of external financing in the Maldives given the existing level of very high debt.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
The baseline scenario is built on current policies, including staff’s assessment of the
Authorities’ 2016 Budget. The budget projects unrealistically low current expenditures which does not
match staff’s assessment of commitments and an unprecedentedly large rise in capital spending.
Managing these projects could strain implementation capacity if they are wholly financed through debt
with no offsetting fiscal measures making debt unsustainable even with financing on semi concessional
terms. The actual execution of these projects is highly uncertain, depending on the availability of
financing (many projects are not yet under contract). Staff’s baseline does not include estimates for
revenues from the Special Economic Zones (SEZs). It also does not include any compensation amount
from the arbitration ruling over the airport concession.4
Key assumptions: Overall, the baseline macroeconomic assumptions are a little weaker in the next few
years than in the previous DSA but are stronger in the medium term when the growth impact of the
airport and other infrastructure development comes through.5


Real GDP growth. Growth remains subdued in 2016 and 2017 and averages 4.4 percent
over 2021–35 which is a slower pace than the average of the past ten years (around 6.5 percent)
that included the initial rapid development of the tourism sector. Staff factor in a ½ percent of
GDP per year increase in medium-term potential growth from the tourism development—this
assessment is consistent with public investment efficiency being in line with the average of less
developed economies, more positive growth outcomes could be achieved with higher public
investment efficiency

In 2012 the authorities cancelled the airport concession contract with GMR and Malaysia Airports Berhad to upgrade and operate Malé
airport. Arbitration ruled in favor of GMR. Maldives Airport Company Limited (MACL) paid $4mn in immediate costs. Agreement on a
final settlement has yet to be reached.
5
The baseline scenario in the DSA assumes that the stabilized exchange rate regime holds although reserve cover dwindles by 2034.



Inflation. GDP deflator inflation remains low over the next two years reflecting lower oil prices
and generally weaker global commodity prices partly offset by higher import duties and then
rises to around 3.2 percent—close to its long run average.



The current account. The non interest current account deficit balloons from 2016 reflecting
higher imports for infrastructure projects. The deficit narrows once the large projects are
completed but the deficit is higher than before at 7.5 percent of GDP on average over 2020–
2035. Over the longer term financing pressure from maturing infrastructure loan result in
reserves levels dwindling to be negligible in terms of import cover by the end of the forecast.



The fiscal deficit. The primary deficit (under the baseline), widens substantially from 2015
to 2016 due to capital projects and social welfare spending and once capital projects are
completed the primary deficit remains well above that which would stabilize debt.



Financing. In the recent past, the bulk of the deficit financing has been met from domestic
sources, in particular through the domestic banking system and the pension fund. Interest rates
had risen sharply in the primary market for T-bills in 2012 and 2013. But, from mid-2014 the
government replaced the auction system with a 'tap system' (of administered interest rates) and
has successively lowered the rate recently halving them to a range of 3.5–4.6 percent across
maturities. This temporarily stabilized interest cost on domestic debt. So far demand for T-bills
has been sustained by the banking sector. However, as debt rises, lower yields may not be
sustained and with global interest rates expected to rise, staff assume that Maldives yields are
high and rise over the forecast horizon. External infrastructure loans are assumed to be on semiconcessional terms.



New debt. The new infrastructure projects are included in the 2016 Budget. The DSA assumes
external disbursements totaling US$ 1.1 billion which includes the infrastructure projects (see
Box 2) and undisbursed loans signed in 2015. The loans contracted in 2015 are semiconcessional loans (a positive grant element below 35 percent) and may affect future financing
for the Maldives for two reasons. First, Maldives receives grant funding from IDA and is
therefore subject to a continuous criterion under IDA's non-concessional borrowing policy

MALDIVES

(NCBP).6 In the absence of an IMF program and its associated borrowing limits, IDA still has its
NCBP in place and therefore a breach will entail requesting a waiver to the policy. Waivers are
considered based on country- and loan-specific criteria. Second, financing from other
multilateral institutions including IDA and the ADB are affected by the outcome of the debt
sustainability assessment given that these institutions use the results of the DSA to determine
eligibility requirements for future financing.7


Sovereign guarantees to the private sector. Since the guarantee scheme has not yet been approved,
staff has not included any amounts for potential guarantees under the scheme in the DSA.



Non debt creating financial flows. With limited lending opportunities, Maldives banks have paid
down debt and increased assets abroad. These outflows are expected to continue.

Box 2. Scaling up and new borrowing
The planned infrastructure scale up in the 2016 Budget is unprecedented for Maldives. This includes Ibrahim
Nasir International Airport development (cost estimate: US$828 million), a road bridge connecting the
airport to the capital (cost estimate: US$189 million), continued investment in new housing developments
along with the relocation and expansion of the port. Of these mega projects, the authorities have signed an
agreement for US$ 373 million with China’s Exim Bank (runway and fuel farm) and have also received
commitments for some of the other costs related to the airport development. An implementation agreement
with China’s Exim Bank for the road bridge project has also been signed. In addition, the authorities have
signed three other external loans in 2015 – US$ 80 million with Saudi Funds (housing development), US$ 6
million with Abu Dhabi (waste management) and US$ 50 million with OPEC Fund (water and sewerage
project). While not fully concessional, with low interest rates (2 to 5 percent) and longer maturities (close to
20 years or more) these loans are semi-concessional with grant elements close to 30 percent. It is expected
that the authorities will continue to negotiate terms similar to these and therefore this has been assumed for
future disbursements included in the DSA. The total external disbursements are estimated to be US$ 1.1
billion (including the undisbursed loans signed in 2015) and are front loaded until 2019 to meet the timeline
set for the completion of the mega projects pipeline.

STAFF’S ILLUSTRATIVE SCENARIO
To stabilize debt and place the fiscal position on a sounder footing staff are proposing the
following measures.


Capital projects. Greater prioritization saving around 2.5 pps of GDP compared to the baseline



Revenue raising. Staff suggested charging user fees for key infrastructure including a bridge toll
(commercial and leisure) and an increase in airport departure tax. Broadening the base of business
profits tax and increasing rates on some taxes should be feasible as the business profits tax rate is

Maldives is a group A (ADF only) country in the ADB and an IDA eligible country under the small island exception. The proportion of
grant financing for both these institutions is contingent on the country's risk of debt distress. This is determined by the outcome of a
forward-looking Debt Sustainability Analysis. For more information, please visit http://www.adb.org/site/adf/faqs and
http://www.worldbank.org/ida/financing.html.

low compared to the Asia Pacific region and the tourism goods and services tax is not out of line
with other competitor economies.


Expenditure saving. The authorities focus on the public sector wage bill is welcome. Staff
suggested that the public service review should be restarted taking time to plan and implement it,
while ensuring key functions are preserved. A baseline costs review of healthcare would help
identify emerging pressures and scope for savings. Plans to better target social welfare and food
subsidies through means testing and to eliminate the electricity subsidy (the latter currently
delayed) are welcome. SOE transparency and oversight should be strengthened. Savings in other
areas could also be made, including through greater use of renewable energy.



Public financial management. These measures would be accompanied by strengthened public
financial management, development of a debt strategy and public investment framework.



Growth dividend. In Staff’s view improving the efficiency of public investment and stabilizing debt
would help to generate longer term growth dividends. In the medium term growth could be around
0.5 pps per year higher than in the baseline, falling back to 0.3pps by 2030–2034.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External debt sustainability. The main cause for concern in the Maldives is the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio. Under the baseline scenario, the nominal PPG external debt rises to 56.9 percent of GDP in 2035
while the PV of PPG external debt to GDP is just under the threshold around 2020 necessitating further
analysis under the probability approach. Under the probability approach (Figure 3), the threshold for
the PV of external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio is breached in the baseline mainly driven by capital spending.
8
Furthermore, the external debt path is not only vulnerable to all the standard shocks in the DSA but
especially to a one time depreciation shock and an exports shock. Taking this into consideration, staff is
of the view that the debt distress in Maldives has deteriorated from a moderate to a high risk of debt
distress.9
Public debt sustainability. Public debt ratios continue to rise. Under the baseline, the PV of public
debt rises from 66.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 161.1 percent of GDP in 2035. Domestic debt is also
highly vulnerable to shocks to the primary balance, to growth and data in line with historical averages.

ASSESSMENT
Without fiscal adjustment and careful management of the infrastructure investment program,
current policies would lead to large domestic and external financing requirements and
adjustment would be needed. Such high financing needs are unlikely to be met on a sustained basis
and problems could magnify as repayments of infrastructure loans become due in the medium term.
The probability approach methodology focuses on the evolution of the probability of debt distress over time, rather than on the
evolution of debt burden indicators. This approach provides complementary, country specific information to help decide cases where a
country’s risk rating is on the border between two categories – in this case, a ±5 percent range is nearly breached for the present value
of debt to GDP ratio in the baseline scenario.
9
Note given a strong revenue performance (with revenue well above developing country levels) and a large tourism sector (gross
exports of goods and services over 100 percent of GDP), the thresholds for revenues and exports are not breached.

This may lead to financing problems, the need for abrupt fiscal consolidation and pressure on the
exchange rate. The DSA therefore points to the need for additional fiscal consolidation measures in the
near term together with greater prioritization of overall capital expenditures and improved public
financial management.
Fiscal measures are needed to stabilize the debt ratio and place it on a downward path and this
should entail tighter expenditure control and public financial management reforms.
Even with a sustained fiscal consolidation effort, Maldives has a high level of public debt and
would remain vulnerable for a number of years. A deterioration of public finances, or external
shocks to tourism earnings and foreign direct investment, or a dent to confidence against a backdrop of
rising fiscal pressure are all important risks.

CONCLUSION
Risk rating. Maldives’ debt distress has deteriorated and it currently faces a high risk of external debt
distress. The assessment of the overall risk of debt distress is also high risk and is reinforced by
significant vulnerabilities related to domestic debt.
To lower the risks staff, suggest policy measures described in the staff’s illustrative scenario above. A
more careful scale up of overall capital expenditure together with offsetting fiscal measures, can help
boost the growth impact of infrastructure spending (this is also supported by an alternative model
looking at public investment debt and growth dynamics), and would help limit the rise in both public
and external debt.

Authorities’ Views
The authorities are of the view that the substantial increase in external borrowing is needed to
finance infrastructure investment. This is required to ensure that Maldives remains an attractive
tourism destination and to address climate change challenges. The authorities are seeking long term
loans on the best terms available. They are mindful of the risks and are seeking to contain current
expenditures, while undertaking the scale up. Over the longer run, the authorities believe that the
infrastructure investment will add substantially more to growth than suggested by staff and that the
payoffs should be sufficient to enable debt reduction. They concur with staff that the Paris COP21
agreement opens up new opportunities to finance climate change adaptation on concessional terms
and they plan a strategic approach to such investments going forward. They noted the change in the
external risk rating from moderate to high risk of debt distress and disagreed with the change, given
the conservative assumption of growth used by the IMF. They expect that the infrastructure scale up
would enable a shift in the production frontier to a higher growth path.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/2014 Balance of Payments is a preliminary estimate and includes errors and omissions, change in assets and valuation effects and over the projection period banks pay down debt abroad/ increase
asset position abroad
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Public debt is defined as the debt of the non-financial public sector comprising central government, including loans on-lent to State Owned Enterprises. It does not include publicly guaranteed debt and domestic arrears. The Ministry of
Finance and Treasury (MoFT) is currently undertaking a process to gather and record all data and information regarding government guarantees. Once the process is completed, guaranteed debt might be included in the analysis.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
This supplement reports on information that has become available since the Staff Report
was issued to the Executive Board on April 7. It does not alter staff’s broad assessment of policy
issues and recommendations contained in the report.
2.
Published data for 2015 are slightly softer than staff’s projections but latest monthly
indicators continue to point to a pick up in activity this year.


GDP. The preliminary estimate for GDP growth in 2015 is a little weaker than projected by
staff at 1.5 percent compared to 1.9 percent. Tourism activity contracted a little more than
expected; and other sectors were subdued apart from transport and construction. However,
the latest monthly indicators are positive—tourism arrivals picked up by 4.3 percent in
January-March 2016 compared to the same period last year, with higher arrivals from Europe
(perhaps reflecting re-established airline routes) making up for a continued decline in arrivals
from Asia.



Inflation. Inflation has remained contained, rising by 1.4 percent year on year in March and
continues to benefit from the pass through of lower oil prices, plus declining
communications costs.



Current account and reserves. The 2015 current account deficit widened to 8.8 percent of
GDP compared to staff’s projection of 8 percent of GDP. Against a backdrop of steady
imports since the start of the year and some increase in tourism exports, gross and usable
reserves rose to $685 million and $225 million respectively in early May (2.9 and 1 months of
import cover). However, the parallel market premium has remained higher, hovering between
6 and 7 percent.



The fiscal position. Based on the latest available information, staff assesses the 2015 fiscal
position to be broadly in line with projections (overall deficit 8.4 percent of GDP)—a slightly
weaker outturn for revenues is offset by modestly lower current spending. However, the
estimates are still preliminary and data, especially on expenditures and grants will be verified
further ahead of November’s Budget.

3.
Climate change. Maldives was one of the fifteen countries who were first to ratify the
Paris Agreement on April 22.

Statement by Mr. Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director and Ms. Wafa Fahmi Abdelati,
Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 13, 2016
The Maldives economy has shown remarkable dynamism over the past two decades that has
brought living standards to middle income levels. The economy has shown resilience following
the 2004 tsunami and slowdown in global growth, but remains highly dependent on tourist
receipts. To maintain robust growth, the authorities have identified critical infrastructure
upgrades that will entail a spike in foreign financing but are expected to propel the country’s
growth potential. The authorities appreciate the constructive dialogue with staff on the potential
implications of up-scaling infrastructure investment and, to some extent, agree with the
assessment and recommendations.
Large external imbalances that were identified a decade ago—a current account deficit
exceeding 35 percent of GDP—have significantly diminished reflecting the dynamic growth in
tourism as well as the overhaul of external sector statistics with Fund Technical Assistance
(TA). Tourism activity has outperformed its peers in recent years, except in 2015 when the rapid
market expansion from China, Russia, and Ukraine slowed. As a small island economy,
Maldives will continue to depend on imports, but strong tourism growth and foreign direct
investment averaging over 10 percent of GDP have helped sustain reserves, limit pressure on the
exchange rate peg, and contain external debt.
Like other small states, especially ones with a widely dispersed population, government
expenditures in the Maldives are much higher than in countries at comparable income levels.
Current expenditure reached 35 percent of GDP in recent years, following sharp increases in the
wage bill, subsidies, and health care costs. Following the modernization of the tax authority and
tax system since 2011, Maldives outperforms its neighbors in terms of tax collection and the
efficiency or productivity of its taxes, as highlighted by staff.
The authorities’ 2016 budget targets a narrowing of the fiscal deficit by 1¾ percent to 6.7
percent of GDP after accounting for a 240 percent increase in capital expenditure to nearly 20
percent of GDP in 2016 to be financed by higher tax and non tax revenues as well as grants. The
sharp increase is meant to signal the intention to upscale infrastructure spending, but the pace of
implementation will depend on the availability of revenue or financing on favorable terms. The
authorities aim to delay some projects if tax collection disappoints or if the expected non tax
revenue from resort leases or grants does not materialize. Setting aside the near term spike in
spending on megaprojects, the authorities believe they will be able to contain the growth in the
fiscal deficit to GDP in future years by containing the growth in the wage bill and in health
costs, and by significantly boosting GDP growth. The authorities will continue to consider
additional fiscal measures, including a bridge toll or a higher airport departure tax, broadening
the base of the business profits tax; and expenditure savings through better targeting of
subsidies, improved oversight of SOE finances, and potential for greater use of renewable
energy.

Spending on the three megaprojects that aim to raise the economy’s overall growth is estimated
to amount to 30 percent of GDP over the next three years. The first of these projects is the
expansion of the airport which is currently running at close to full capacity and whose upgrade
is essential to sustain strong growth in tourism. The second project aims to support population
resettlement to a large island near the capital and an airport that would reduce the cost of service
delivery to the outer islands, help adapt to climate change, and improve job opportunities. The
third project aims to relocate and expand port facilities to ease bottlenecks and improve
resilience to climate change. These three high-priority projects will be mostly foreign-financed,
at reasonable market cost, and subject to detailed feasibility studies. The initial viability
assessments anticipate a sizeable growth impact and ample room for Maldives’ tourist industry
to grow.
The authorities understand staff’s debt sustainability concerns but believe staff’s assessment—
that the investment upscale-up will only add ½ percent to GDP growth—does not adequately
capture growth prospects. First, the authorities expect continued market expansion for tourism
and expect the economy to benefit from the gradual recovery of growth in Europe and
expansion of Asian markets, aided by the opening of many new hotels now under construction,
and the extension of airport capacities. The low price elasticity of demand in the Maldives could
allow strong tourism growth despite dollar appreciation, with a positive impact on construction,
communications, and fishing. They question the rationale for the staff’s downgrading of growth
in the next few years compared to the previous DSA and anticipate growth to return to 6 percent
levels. Second, staff’s assumption that public investment efficiency would be in line with the
average of less developed countries seems too conservative, especially when Maldives’ tax
system operates more efficiently than its peers (as highlighted in Appendix II and the SIP). Fund
TA is supporting the further strengthening of public financial management, including of the
capital budget to ensure maximum investment benefits. The authorities will be receiving IMF
TA in June to conduct a public investment management assessment and to provide advice on
prioritizing future investment projects within a well-defined budget envelope. Third, while the
authorities understand that the DSA is based on current announced policies, Maldives has a
strong track record of implementing staff recommendations, particularly in terms of tax reforms.
Although a fully fleshed-out medium-term budget framework is not yet in place with timebound measures and explicit contingency plans, they informed staff that they would consider
broadening the tax base and that expenditures will be deferred if revenues disappoint or the
fiscal position worsens.
In this regard, and since other island economies plan to upscale infrastructure investment to
boost growth, the authorities have asked that the Fund review the DSA framework to take
account of the special circumstances for small states that are necessarily reliant on large
borrowing to harness the economic gains from the investment scale-up. The authorities believe
that the growth dynamics should be better reflected in the DSA; they also believe that the
assessment that Maldives’ debt distress has not only deteriorated but it currently faces high risk
of external debt distress is a byproduct of the overly conservative growth projection and is
unduly alarming.

The authorities are committed to the stabilized exchange rate regime within the currency band
and agree with staff that continued improvement in the fiscal position is the best way to support
it. The exchange rate has stabilized since the 2011 devaluation; the capital account is very open;
and the economy highly dollarized. Like other countries pegged to the dollar, the real exchange
rate has appreciated by 30 percent since 2011. There is an active parallel market, which is
structural in nature due to the size of dollar-denominated tourist transactions, with a relatively
stable premium. The operation of the exchange system will remain under review, taking into
account market developments. Regarding the Article VIII issues, the authorities believe the
deviations from the official rate would remain until the fiscal deficit narrows and official
reserves strengthen.
The MMA eased monetary policy by significantly reducing the marginal reserve requirement in
2015 which helped reduce borrowing cost, boost private credit, and lengthen maturities on
sovereign bonds. Despite this easing, the overall expansion in monetary aggregates remained
contained in 2015, reflecting lower net foreign assets and sluggish growth of private sector
credit in the first half of the year. Credit picked up in the second half of the year after a long
spell of stagnation. Enhancing financial inclusion is a national priority and the authorities would
welcome Fund support, including providing information on successful experiences elsewhere.
They are moving toward mobile banking services through the use of Dhoni Banking Units to
reach the outer islands. An announced sovereign guarantee scheme for private sector loans in
tourism aims to rejuvenate investment in some projects that were stalled during the global
financial crisis. In designing the scheme, the authorities plan to limit its size and its contingent
cost. More generally, the MMA continues to reinforce its supervisory capacity and activities,
within a risk-based approach.
The authorities’ national development plan for climate adaptation was shared with staff. It
highlights the challenges and policies considered important to mitigate the impact of climate
change. The authorities agree that there is scope for a more strategic approach that would set in
context current infrastructure plans and include more systematic climate adaptation planning,
including reporting on the budgetary impact. The authorities agree with staff’s suggestion to
quantify and present the climate adaptation policies in each budget. It is hoped that adding such
detail would help access possible financing. They would welcome specific examples of how this
has been done by others. They also see merit in a more coordinated planning of the different
investment projects and monitoring of their implementation.
The development of special economic zones could help diversify economic activity in labor
intensive sectors. The authorities take note of staff’s concerns regarding excessive tax incentives
and the potential for tax erosion or tax evasion, which could be mitigated by adequate reporting
procedures. Safeguards will be considered when viable projects are under consideration.
The Maldives authorities welcome the opportunity to have an open and candid exchange of
views with staff on their current challenges and policies. They appreciate the Fund’s valuable
TA and look forward to a continued fruitful engagement with the Fund. They also welcome the
Fund’s increased focus on issues of relevance to small states under the leadership of DMD Zhu.
