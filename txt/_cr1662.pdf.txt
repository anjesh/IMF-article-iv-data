IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Uruguay
On February 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Uruguay.
Recent Developments and Outlook
Uruguay has achieved more than a decade of high and inclusive economic growth, supported by
social stability and reduced regional linkages. International financial markets have recognized
Uruguay’s stability and strong financial buffers. Yet, economic activity in Uruguay markedly
slowed in 2015, triggered by a regional downturn and weakening prices of its export
commodities. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen to 1.5 percent in 2015, as investment
and consumption growth have declined from recent highs. Meanwhile, inflation remains
entrenched above the central bank’s 3–7 percent target range. Defying the closing output gap, a
relatively tight monetary stance over the past two years, and low international food and energy
prices, headline inflation has edged up to more than 9 percent since July.
Depreciation pressures intensified during 2015, broadly in line with the regional and global
trend among emerging markets. Domestic deposit dollarization picked up, although more than
half of the increase was driven by valuation effects rather than a portfolio shift. Gross
international reserves have dropped by US$2.6 billion since June, as the central bank has
extensively intervened in the foreign exchange market to contain the depreciation of the peso.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The medium-term budget for the new government’s 5-year term foresees an improvement of the
primary fiscal balance by 1.5 percent of GDP over 2015–2019. The 2015 primary balance is
estimated at close to zero, in line with the budget, as lower tax revenues were offset by a sharper
reduction in public investment. The overall fiscal deficit in 2015 is estimated at 3.6 percent of
GDP, 0.3 higher than in the budget, because of higher interest payments.
GDP growth is projected to remain tepid in 2016 as external conditions remain weak and
consumer confidence has dropped. The further slowdown in fiscal spending and consumption is
likely to temper domestic demand. In the medium term, growth is expected to rise back to a
potential rate of 3.1 percent.
Risks to the outlook are mostly external. Although Uruguay’s regional economic linkages have
lessened, a worse-than-expected slowdown in Argentina and Brazil could significantly weigh on
Uruguay’s economy. A global slowdown would affect Uruguay’s commodity exports, and
increased volatility in oil prices would impact on import costs. A tightening in global financial
conditions could raise financing costs.
Near-term financial risks seem limited. There is no evidence of a credit bubble or excessive
private sector leverage. The 2015 uptick in non-performing loans, from low levels, does not, at
this stage, seem a cause for significant concern. Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers should
facilitate an orderly adjustment to shocks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Uruguayan authorities for their sound macroeconomic
policies, institutions, and reforms, which have supported strong and inclusive growth over the
last decade and have helped achieve one of the lowest poverty and income inequality rates in
Latin America. While the economy’s strong fundamentals position the country well to weather

the recent slowdown, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue implementing prudent
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to further strengthen the economy’s resilience,
lower persistently high inflation, and boost potential growth.
Directors emphasized that continued exchange rate flexibility is essential to absorb external
shocks. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to limit foreign exchange interventions to
smooth excessive volatility, which should also help avoid premature erosion of the country’s
reserve buffers.
Directors stressed the importance of continued efforts to put inflation on a downward path. They
supported the authorities’ tight monetary policy, and noted that a prudent fiscal stance should
help the monetary policy effort. They welcomed the new wage setting guidelines aimed at
curbing inflation inertia, but encouraged further steps to fully remove backward indexation.
Directors also called on the authorities to closely monitor the performance of the new monetary
policy framework.
Directors welcomed the government’s five year budget, which appropriately combines budgetary
consolidation with efforts to support infrastructure development and key social objectives. The
authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and continued improvements in the public
sector’s primary balance will be essential to stabilize net debt over the medium term. Directors
also stressed the importance of restoring the financial soundness of the public oil distribution
company expeditiously and of improving the financial performance of state owned enterprises
more generally. They agreed that well designed private public partnerships, with strong control
of liabilities, could help finance needed infrastructure investment and improve project
management.
Directors welcomed the recent initiatives to promote financial inclusion and deepening, such as
the financial inclusion law. They noted that these initiatives may require upgrades to the
country’s solid regulatory framework, including the full implementation of the Basel III
standards. Directors observed that foreign currency credit to unhedged borrowers in the non
tradable sector has moderated from its 2013 high, but underscored that close monitoring of this
ratio remains warranted, particularly given the recent peso depreciation.

4

Directors agreed that further diversification of export markets and expansion of higher value
added commodity production could help reduce the country’s exposure to adverse external
shocks. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to upgrade transport and logistics infrastructure,
and encouraged initiatives to reform secondary education in order to boost growth potential.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Uruguay has achieved more than a decade of high and inclusive economic
growth, supported by social stability and reduced regional linkages. The country has
weathered the recent global and regional headwinds relatively well so far. Yet the
economy is slowing down, while inflation remains above target, and deposit dollarization
has risen. While the baseline projection foresees a temporary and moderate slowdown,
the country is exposed to further shocks, especially from the immediate region.
Main Policy Advice


The fiscal agenda launched by the new government in 2015 envisages a welcome
combination of budgetary consolidation and emphasis on supporting infrastructure
development and key social objectives. Its implementation should focus on
stabilizing public debt in the medium term and ensuring sustainable growth.



More generally, and especially at this time of heightened regional uncertainty,
enhancing the credibility of the anchors for fiscal and monetary policy would
complement Uruguay’s policy buffers for weathering economic and financial shocks.



In this context, bringing inflation into its target range remains a key policy priority.



Exchange-rate flexibility should be the central tool for absorbing external shocks.



Financial deepening can also help better insulate the economy against external
shocks, support growth, and strengthen the credit channel of monetary policy.



The public petroleum distribution company’s financial soundness should be restored.

Past advice. There has been broad agreement between the authorities and Fund staff
on the priorities for macroeconomic policy. Broadly in line with staff recommendations
on the importance of exchange rate flexibility, the authorities have allowed the exchange
rate to adjust in response to market pressures, albeit with recent interventions to smooth
the adjustment. In light of the above-target inflation, monetary policy has been
tightened since mid-2013 in line with staff advice. The 2014 Article IV staff report
recommended a gradual increase in the primary fiscal balance by 2 percent of GDP; the
recent 5-year budget incorporates a somewhat smaller adjustment.

CONTEXT
1.
Uruguay has experienced more than a decade of high economic growth, and has
become a bastion of stability in a volatile region. Since the financial crisis of 2002, living
standards have greatly improved, with a per capita GDP that is among the highest in Latin America,
while inequality and poverty are among the lowest. This success owes much to broadly shared
societal support for social stability and inclusion, combined with a growth model that emphasized
diversification into new markets and new products, thereby reducing regional linkages, while
embracing the opportunities in agriculture, forestry, and tourism offered by the country’s natural
resources.
2.
Over the last five years, growth has been higher than in neighboring countries and
international financial markets have recognized Uruguay’s stability and strong financial
buffers. Against a historically high correlation with growth in Argentina and Brazil, growth in
Uruguay has remained relatively resilient since 2010. Uruguay has also distinguished itself through
prudent debt management. Its relatively steady sovereign spreads are indicative of the ongoing
differentiation by international investors between Uruguay and other countries in the region, in a
context of increased volatility.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
During 2015, economic activity in Uruguay markedly slowed, triggered by a regional
downturn and weakening prices of its export commodities. Growth is estimated to have
decelerated to 1.5 percent in 2015, the lowest level since the 2002 crisis, due to a cooling off in
investment (including the completion of a large pulp mill) and private consumption from recent
highs. The second quarter saw a small contraction in real activity (on a y/y basis) for the first time
since 2003, followed by a moderate rebound in the third quarter. Although the second-quarter
4

URUGUAY

decline was driven mostly by a large, albeit transient, drop in electricity production due to drought,
there is also evidence of a more persistent slowdown, with a decline in consumer and business
confidence, and weaker credit growth for both firms and households. The latter seems to be due to
lower demand for credit rather than to supply constraints. Unemployment rose during 2015, to
7.9 percent in November. The current account deficit is estimated to have fallen to 3¾ percent of
GDP in 2015 as the lower oil import bill and higher pulp exports from the new pulp mill offset the
effects of lower agricultural export prices and weak demand from key trading partners Argentina
and Brazil.

Despite the cooling economy, inflation remains entrenched above the central bank’s
3–7 percent target range. Defying the closing output gap, a relatively tight monetary stance over
the past two years, and low international food and energy prices, headline inflation has edged up to
more than 9 percent (y/y) since July, while core inflation (excluding food and administered prices)
has exceeded 10 percent (y/y) since June. Significant depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar
has contributed to inflationary pressures. The pass-through of low international fuel prices has been
limited, in an effort to improve the financial health of the state-owned oil distribution company,
ANCAP.

Box 1. The Drivers of Inflation in Uruguay
Against a history of chronic high inflation from the 1960s to the early 1990s, inflation has been reduced to
single-digit levels since 2004. However, inflation has remained stubbornly above the official inflation target
range.
Earlier (2013) staff estimates of the Phillips curve showed that the inflation process in Uruguay was
driven by both past and expected inflation.1 The findings also indicated that inflation expectations (which
in recent months have drifted up to 9.35 percent at a one-year horizon) are influenced by actual inflation.
The output gap and labor costs were also found to influence inflation. Most collective wage agreements
include clauses stipulating ex-post corrections for the deviation of actual from expected inflation. Such wage
indexation can help explain why lagged inflation remains a particularly important driver of inflation.
A decomposition of inflation dynamics (measured as deviations from the mid-point of the inflation
target range) also points to the role of the recent depreciation and the delayed impact of monetary
tightening.2 The decomposition in terms of structural shocks that drive inflation, shows that exchange rate
depreciation has contributed to excess inflation since early 2014. It also highlights that—although monetary
policy has become tighter following the adoption of money targeting in July 2013—the earlier more relaxed
monetary stance still contributes to excess inflation, as a result of the strong inflation inertia.

Depreciation pressures intensified during 2015. After depreciating through 2014, the
peso has weakened further against the U.S. dollar in 2015 (22 percent since the start of the year),
broadly in line with the regional and global trend among emerging markets. As the surge in
nonresident purchases of local government securities had abated, in April 2015 the authorities
eliminated the only remaining capital flow management measure—the 30 percent reserve
requirement on nonresident purchases of central bank securities. Pressures on the peso intensified
during July through October, with portfolio outflows on both the asset and the liability side, as
domestic pension funds purchased Uruguayan securities from non-residents and increased their
foreign-currency assets (closing in on their regulatory exposure limit). In particular, domestic
investors (including pension funds) purchased around 20 percent of the successful issuance of a
US$1.7 billion external government bond in October. In addition, domestic deposit dollarization
picked up during 2015, rising from 77 percent to more than 81 percent of total deposits, although
more than half of the increase was driven by valuation effects rather than a portfolio shift.1
Preliminary indications are that these pressures abated in November. FDI inflows have slowed down
a notch in recent quarters but continued to fully

in November. At 29 percent of GDP (14½ months of imports), end-2015 reserves remained
comfortably above the upper bound of the IMF reserve adequacy metric, and various other
prudential benchmarks. Furthermore, the BCU and commercial banks’ foreign assets taken together
are sufficient to cover total foreign currency denominated bank deposits. The real effective
exchange rate (REER) is estimated to remain in line with fundamentals: analysis based on the EBA
current account model suggests a 1 percent undervaluation of the REER, while staff estimates using
the external stability approach point to a 5 percent overvaluation. (Annex I).

The associated increase in banks’ deposits abroad, as they offset the increase in their U.S. dollar liabilities, is
recorded in the balance of payments under ‘other capital flows’.

30, 2014. M1+ growth has slowed further since then (even though the recent foreign exchange
interventions have been mostly sterilized), with a coinciding decline in the demand for base money
as a result of the economic slowdown and the pickup in deposit dollarization. With one-month
interest rates at about 15 percent, the monetary policy stance is in line with what a Taylor rule would
suggest (Figure 3).
8.
The medium-term budget for the new government’s 5-year term projects a tightening
of the primary fiscal deficit by 1½ percent of GDP over 5 years (Box 2). For 2015, the primary
balance is estimated at close to zero, aligned with the budget, as lower tax revenues were offset by a
sharper reduction in public investment. The overall fiscal deficit in 2015 is estimated at 3.6 percent
of GDP, 0.3 higher than in the budget, because of higher interest payments. Staff forecasts a
reduction in the overall deficit from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent by 2019, which is in
line with the budget, albeit with lower interest costs than in the budget (owing to the recent
reduction in costly central bank debt) and a correspondingly smaller improvement in the primary
balance, by 1 percent of GDP by 2019. Based on these assumptions, the impact of the fiscal
consolidation on the path of net public sector debt would be less than foreseen in the budget, and
would not fully stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.2 An important deviation from earlier practices is that
the nominal spending levels in the budget have been stipulated for only the next two years. In 2017,
the government will assess appropriate spending levels for the period 2018–19, based on the
evolution of external and domestic economic developments, and allowing for adjustments as
needed to meet the 5-year targets.

2

The simultaneous reduction in both the BCU’s assets and debt (along with some other liability management
operations) promises a reduction in net public sector interest payments of around 0.5 percent of GDP per year.
However by selling reserves, the BCU also foregoes the expected valuation gains on these reserves that would result
from the depreciation of the peso. Indeed, the expected depreciation (driven by the persistent inflation differential) is
a major determinant of the high carry cost of reserves. Staff estimates that the forgone valuation gains would offset
about 40 percent of the improvement in net debt dynamics that results from the reduction in net interest payments.

The government has proposed new wagesetting guidelines that could moderate wage growth
and alleviate the indexation of wages to past inflation
(Box 3). Employers and unions are currently negotiating
new multi-year wage agreements. The guidelines for the
negotiations—the bulk of which is expected to be
concluded by end-2016—envisage an increase in nominal
wages between 6–10 percent per year, based on sectoral
performance. The few sectoral agreements already signed
did not fully incorporate the features of the guidelines
that could moderate inflation inertia.

Since the new government took office in March 2015, it has initiated important
reforms. Key initiatives would aim to improve education, boost infrastructure investment with
private funding, and enhance the monitoring of public enterprises. The successful and timely
implementation of these and other reforms could be challenging.

Box 2. The Government’s Budget Plans for 2015–19
The five-year budget plan presented by the government in August 2015 was approved by Parliament in
December. The budget envisages a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit by 1 percent of GDP over 5 years
and an improvement in the primary balance of 1.6 percent of GDP. Half of this improvement would come
from a reduction in current and capital expenditures. On the revenue side, higher revenues from public
enterprises would contribute to a fourth of the overall improvement.
Current expenditures of the non-financial public sector are expected to remain stable as a percentage
of GDP, excluding the 2014 payment to the Energy Stabilization Fund of 0.3 percent of GDP. Public
wage expenditures should remain at 5 percent of GDP, which includes keeping real wages constant as well
as additional spending in the areas of education, public health, and security.
The budget also includes a broader
initiative to boost public
investment, a third of which would
be financed by private funds,
including through public-private
partnerships (PPPs). Public sector
capital expenditures as a percentage
of GDP would be around 2.7 percent
over the period, which corresponds
to their 2011 level.

On the revenue side, the budget
foresees an increase in revenues by
0.6 percent of GDP between 2014
and 2019. In particular, the cumulative operating profits of public enterprises are projected to increase by
$440 million over five years. Tax revenues would increase by 0.3 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2019 as a
result of higher tax revenues from public enterprises, improvement in collection and payroll increases.
The budget documents foresee that the above measures would raise the gross and net public debt by about
4 percentage points of GDP through 2018 before stabilizing by 2019.

Box 3. The New Wage-Setting Guidelines
The government’s guidelines for the ongoing sixth round of wage council negotiations propose wage
increases set in nominal terms that vary by sector depending on growth performance. The proposal
includes a backward-correction mechanism that would be activated if accumulated inflation after the first
two years of the wage agreements exceeds the proposed nominal increases, to ensure that employees bear
no real wage loss.1 In addition, a safeguard clause allows for an immediate adjustment of nominal wages if
accumulated inflation over a 12-month period exceeds 12 percent.
The new guidelines would alter the wage setting practices relative to previous rounds, which focused
on wage increases set in real terms, with actual wages being adjusted for past and expected inflation.
While the government’s guidelines for the previous round of negotiations offered the option of setting wage
increases in nominal terms (to reduce the impact of automatic indexation of wages on inflation), only 5 out
of 183 agreements used that option. Furthermore, the new proposed nominal wage increases are lower than
those agreed in the previous round of negotiations (for the 5 sectors which opted for such nominal
adjustments) and are differentiated by sector. In fact, the highest suggested nominal wage increase over the
next three years remains below projected nominal GDP growth. In addition, the sectoral differentiation of
wage increases provides a first attempt to address the heterogeneity across sectors in terms of productivity
growth, and to limit

help reduce the wage inertia
that has contributed to inflation persistence. Adjustments based on past inflation would be made only
after two years and only to avoid real wage declines, and the trigger for the safeguard clause that could lead
to adjustments within the first two years is set well above the 3–7 percent inflation target range and inflation
expectations. This contrasts with the semiannual and annual adjustments for inflation included in the
agreements following the previous negotiation round.

Wage agreements are typically negotiated for two or—more commonly—three years.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
GDP growth is expected to remain tepid at 1.4 percent in 2016 as external conditions
remain weak and consumer confidence has dropped. Adding to weak external demand, the
further slowdown in fiscal spending and consumption is likely to temper domestic demand. Despite
a projected moderate deterioration in the terms of trade relative to 2015, the current account deficit
is projected to hold steady at 4 percent of GDP as lower demand for imports broadly offsets weaker
foreign demand for exports. In the medium-term, growth is expected to rise back to a potential rate
of 3.1 percent as external demand and investment recover. The current account deficit is projected
to narrow to 3½ percent of GDP in the medium-term, as external demand recovers.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

12.

Risks to the outlook are mostly external:


The immediate region. Although Uruguay’s regional economic ties have lessened, a worsethan-expected slowdown in Argentina and Brazil could significantly weigh on Uruguay’s economy.
Historically, spillovers from Argentina have had the largest impact, with the country accounting for
more than half of Uruguay’s sizeable tourism receipts, and importing mostly specialized
manufactured products without obvious alternative markets. Although Brazil imports one-fifth of
Uruguay’s merchandise exports (four times more than Argentina), these are predominantly
commodities, for which thus far alternative markets could be more readily found. The role of
financial linkages as a transmission channel for regional shocks has decreased significantly in the
past decade. Also, there has been no evidence of contagion in the sovereign bond market resulting
from recent events in Brazil. Non-resident deposits (mostly from Argentina) have declined to
16 percent of total deposits, making a potential rapid withdrawal manageable in light of banks’
plentiful foreign currency liquidity. Nevertheless, Argentina and Brazil still accounted for about a
third of FDI inflows into Uruguay in 2013.

The global economy. A global slowdown would affect Uruguay’s commodity exports, and
increased volatility in oil prices would affect import costs. However, the agricultural content of
Uruguay’s commodity exports (two-thirds of the total) makes the country less vulnerable than other
commodity exporters to a slowdown or further rebalancing in China from investment to
consumption. While increased volatility in oil prices would affect Uruguay, which imports all of its oil,
the positive correlation between agricultural commodity prices and oil prices has so far provided a
natural hedge. A tightening in global financial conditions could raise the cost of financing: empirical
analysis indicates that the impact of the Fed’s tapering announcement in May 2013 on local and
foreign currency bond yields in Uruguay was moderate and broadly in line with the region. The high
share of nonresident holdings of Uruguay’s public debt may pose an external risk.

While domestic confidence indicators point to weaker demand, near-term financial
risks seem limited. The reliability of the confidence indicators in foretelling domestic consumption
and investment is hard to gauge, as is the potential impact of further regional turmoil on domestic
confidence. In addition, a possible further rise in deposit dollarization could contribute to pressure
on the exchange rate. However, there is no evidence of a credit bubble or excessive private sector
leverage. Banks’ regulatory capital ratio has declined over the last few years, in an effort to reduce
the costs of excess capital. The banking system remains adequately capitalized and an uptick in nonperforming loans in 2015 does not, at this stage, seem a cause for significant concern, as provisions
for loan losses remain high. Foreign currency credit to unhedged borrowers in the non-tradable
sector has also moderated from its 2013 high, although close monitoring of this ratio remains
warranted, particularly given the recent peso depreciation.
14.

Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers should facilitate an orderly adjustment to shocks.


Government financing risks are limited given access to contingent credit lines (including
from the World Bank and IaDB) amounting to 4 percent of GDP and liquid financial assets (6 percent
of GDP) sufficient to cover debt service through the end of 2016. Furthermore, the average maturity
of public debt is high, at 15.5 years, reducing short-term risks.

The BCU’s ample gross reserves could help cushion severe external shocks. Taking into
account Uruguay’s high level of financial sector dollarization (80 percent of deposits and 60 percent
of banking system loans are in U.S. dollars), reserves still cover 96 percent of end-2014 foreign
currency deposits, and almost four times the amount of end-2014 non-resident deposits (Annex I).

15.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s outlook but saw smaller regional
spillover risks. They foresaw somewhat higher growth in 2015 and 2016 than in the staff’s baseline
projection. They nuanced the risks stemming from possible deeper Brazilian and Argentinean
recessions, noting that Uruguay had already successfully absorbed significant shocks from the
region. They also emphasized the decline in the estimated correlation between growth in Argentina
and Uruguay and offered that Uruguay could benefit from the dismantling of existing Argentinean
trade restrictions. They considered that domestic reform implementation risk was low, pointing to
the recent approval of the five-year budget by Parliament without any additional expenditure
increase, and progress in the wage negotiations in accordance with the government’s guidelines.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Enhancing the Resilience to Macroeconomic Shocks
16.
Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate offers an important instrument for responding to
inward spillovers.

The flexible exchange rate should remain the key stabilizer that absorbs external shocks. The
recent depreciation of the peso reflects a reassessment by financial markets of the region’s
comparative external outlook. Maintaining competitiveness, in particular vis-à-vis regional markets
and competitors, will be vital for supporting growth.

The BCU’s ample gross reserves can help cushion severe external shocks. That said,
interventions in the exchange market should be used to counter disorderly market conditions, and
not to counter trends driven by fundamentals. In this regard, staff welcomes the sharp decline of
central bank foreign exchange sales in November. Continued interventions would not be warranted
if external depreciation pressures continued. Prolonged interventions could erode the country’s
buffers prematurely, with substantial financial risks still ahead. Moreover, resisting market
expectations of a further depreciation through interventions that delay the adjustment could feed
into asset dollarization pressures.
17.
Strengthening the credibility of the targets for monetary and medium-term fiscal
policy could more firmly anchor expectations and confidence, both domestically and in
international financial markets. Increased global risk aversion, Fed lift-off, and regional shocks
could test the positive assessment of Uruguay’s financial position. In this context, reinforcing
budgetary and monetary frameworks could promote more favorable international borrowing terms
and reduce economic volatility.
18.
In the near term—until fiscal consolidation has been fully entrenched, and inflation is
comfortably within its target range—there is only limited room for countercyclical policies to
counter adverse external shocks to growth.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

19.
Authorities views on external resilience. The authorities confirmed the importance of
exchange rate flexibility as a shock absorber. They clarified that the goal of the central bank’s
interventions had been to smooth exchange rate volatility, including from large transactions that
could disrupt the relatively small foreign exchange market, and to prevent overshooting driven by
political noise from neighboring countries—and not to prevent a depreciation of the currency driven
by fundamentals. Their estimation confirmed that the exchange rate was in line with its
fundamentals. The authorities indicated that the sale of part of the BCU’s excess reserves allowed for
a welcome reduction in the BCU’s costly short-term domestic-currency debt, which would contribute
to the improvement in the overall fiscal balance for the consolidated public sector. They expected
that interventions would continue to decrease in the next months.
Reducing Inflation
20.
Reducing inflation remains a key policy priority. Lowering inflation would promote dedollarization and create scope to use monetary policy as a countercyclical tool. It would also reduce
the inflation tax on low-income households, with no bank account, or only a checking account
paying little if any interest. Furthermore, given the current level of inflation, a relatively small price or
exchange rate shock could trigger a rise to double-digit inflation that, in turn, could feed into
inflation expectations.
21.
A more effective and comprehensive disinflation strategy is needed to put inflation on
a downward path. Tight monetary policy has helped contain inflationary pressures in recent years.
The fiscal tightening that commenced in 2015 will complement this effort. As the output gap is
expected to close, inflationary pressures are projected to show a gradual decline, with inflation
remaining above target through 2018 due to inflation inertia—which staff expects to moderate
gradually, with the new wage agreements.

Keeping a tight policy stance. The slowdown in M1+ growth and the substantial increase
in real interest rates since mid-2013 has led to a tightening in financial conditions. Nevertheless,
inflation has remained high owing, in particular, to the weakness of the credit channel and the
muted effect of interest rates on domestic demand. Given the imperative of reducing inflation and a
still positive output gap, the tight monetary policy stance should be maintained, even in case of
moderate further downward shocks to growth.

Reducing inflation persistence. The new wage-setting guidelines set by the government
include a helpful focus on wage increases in nominal terms, but still include indexation provisions. It
would be advisable to move toward the full elimination of backward indexation as expeditiously as
possible to reduce inflation persistence.

Strengthening the monetary policy framework. It is still too early to convincingly assess
the efficacy of the new monetary framework in controlling monetary conditions and anchoring
expectations. It will be important to closely monitor the performance of the framework and remain
open to adjustments as needed. In particular, the M1+ growth target should be attuned to changes
in money demand. In the near term, the impact of rising dollarization and lower economic growth

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

URUGUAY

could imply a need for reducing the target for M1+ growth to avoid an undue relaxation of the
monetary stance. Furthermore, a comprehensive strategy should not need price agreements with
domestic suppliers of consumer goods to reduce inflation pressures temporarily.
22.
Authorities views on inflation and monetary policy. In explaining the persistence of
inflation, the authorities pointed to the still strong domestic demand as well as to the inertia of
nontradables prices, stemming in part from wage indexation. They emphasized that consistent
policies were in place, with a contractionary monetary policy, a cautious fiscal stance, and wage
guidelines that would dampen the impact of indexation. They pointed out that the new monetary
framework had allowed for the tightening of monetary policy since mid-2013 while avoiding
excessive volatility of the medium and longer term interest rates. They considered that price
agreements played a useful supplementary role, by helping to anchor expectations. They felt that
recent the pickup in deposit dollarization did not pose significant risks and pointed to the dedollarization process of public debt and of retail bank lending.
Implementing Structural Fiscal Consolidation
23.
The government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation over the 5-year government
term will be critical for stabilizing public sector debt over the medium term. The adoption of
the 5-year budget is an important step in this direction. Assuming that the revenue
underperformance of 2015 persists through the budget period, staff baseline projections foresee a
smaller primary surplus than the budget and an ensuing gradual rise in both gross and net debt as a
share of GDP through 2020. The staff therefore advised that the authorities should achieve the full
budgeted improvement in the primary balance to a surplus of 1 percent of GDP by 2019, so as to
ensure that net debt is put on a stable path by the end of the budget period. The projected decline
in the BCU’s net interest costs would complement the strengthening of the primary balance in
achieving this goal but would not on its own be sufficient to stabilize net debt given valuation
effects.
24.
Alongside a gradual further reduction of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, there
is scope for automatic stabilizers to operate in case risks to growth were to materialize. Staff
advised that a strong commitment to the structural adjustment path for the primary balance that is
embedded in the budget would provide adequate room for automatic fiscal stabilizers—stemming
from the social safety net as well the progressive tax system—to operate to cushion cyclical shocks.
25.
The authorities may wish to consider options for fortifying the fiscal anchor over the
longer run. The fiscal expansion since 2009 was accommodated within the existing rule that limits
the increase in net debt, and debt levels are projected to edge up further over the next few years.
Against this backdrop, a cap to indebtedness could be made part of the rule, to prevent debt from
reaching uncomfortable levels. More generally, a periodic recalibration of the fiscal path will be
important for ensuring that debt targets are met given the sensitivity of the debt outlook to shocks,
especially to growth or interest rates.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

26.
Furthermore, active liability management remains an important tool for reducing debt
vulnerabilities. Over the last decade, the debt management strategy has limited refinancing risk by
increasing the maturity of the debt and smoothing the redemption profile, and reduced both the
share of debt denominated in foreign currency and the share of debt at floating rate. This strategy
should be continued, while taking into account developments in international and domestic financial
markets. Furthermore, there could be opportunities for diversifying the debt portfolio across
currencies and for deepening the local bond market.
27.
The consolidation effort is focused on enhancing the efficiency of public enterprises
and increasing reliance on the private sector for infrastructure investments. Investment plans
of the—autonomous—public enterprises have been constrained and placed under government
scrutiny. Effective execution of plans for strengthening the monitoring and corporate governance of
public enterprises will be important to support the targeted improvement in their financial
performance. The authorities’ plans also foresee that private funding—in particular through PPPs—
will support one-third of the agenda for expanding investments in energy, transportation, and other
infrastructure. PPPs are expected to finance 30 percent of the investments in road infrastructure,
one-fourth of the investment in railways and more than 10 percent of the projected investment in
the energy sector. The use of PPPs can help to improve project management and risk-sharing with
private entities. However, proper contract design, effective monitoring and oversight, and strong
controls of explicit and contingent liabilities will be essential.
28.
A state intervention in ANCAP combined with low oil prices should provide an
opportunity to improve the financial position of the company, before moving towards a more
transparent system of passing through oil price changes. Restoring ANCAP’s financial soundness
is a policy priority, and in December 2015, the government announced a recapitalization of the
company, combined with strict new oversight (Box 4). ANCAP is currently benefiting from lower
global oil prices that, given the limited pass through allowed to domestic prices, should help the
company restore its financial position. Looking ahead, further efficiency gains will be critical, and
should create room to allow prices to adjust in line with the world market, based on a transparent
formula (and maintaining an appropriate tax that covers the environmental cost of fuel). This would
restore financial discipline and remove the risks to the budget inherent in the stabilization of
domestic fuel prices.
29.
Authorities view on fiscal policy. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to a
reduction in the overall fiscal balance to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2019 and emphasized the possibility
of revising the budget in 2017 to meet this objective. They mentioned the expected reduction in net
interest payments by the BCU, as well as the targeted improved performance of state-owned
enterprises, as major factors contributing to a lower deficit. They expressed skepticism about
possible amendments to the current debt rule, which in their view is predictable without unduly
constraining the ability of future governments to set policies. They saw the restoration of ANCAP’s
financial soundness as a prerequisite for a decrease in domestic fuel prices.

Box 4. Resolving ANCAP’s Financial Situation
On December 23, 2015, the government announced a rescue package for the public oil distribution
company, ANCAP. Administración National de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP) is Uruguay’s
state-owned oil distribution company. The company has a monopoly in refining activities. ANCAP is the
largest Uruguayan corporation, with total assets of US$2.3 bn in 2014.
ANCAP has been running losses for the past five years, despite the drop in international oil prices. In
2014, ANCAP’s losses reached US$323 million, bringing net worth down to $424 million at the end of the
year. The apparent negative correlation between
ANCAP’s profits and oil prices was broken in 2012.

Aiming for Higher and Sustainable Growth
30.
While Uruguay has achieved relatively high living standards, supported by strong
social policies, recent developments have prompted a reassessment of Uruguay’s mediumterm growth outlook. In particular, staff’s projection of potential growth has been revised down
from 3.3 percent to 3.1 percent, reflecting lower domestic investment growth. This adjustment puts
a premium on the identification of policy options for boosting growth.
31.
Further diversification of export markets and quality upgrades to existing products
and services can boost Uruguay’s growth potential. Greater diversification of markets would also

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

help reduce exposure to adverse external shocks. An upgrade of Uruguay’s transport and logistics
infrastructure, improvements in the quality and enrollment of secondary education, expansion of
vocational training programs, and increase in labor market efficiency to better tie wages to
productivity are key requirements for raising Uruguay’s medium- and long-term growth potential. In
this context, staff welcomed the broad consensus on the need to upgrade transport infrastructure to
meet the needs of Uruguay’s growing economy, which could also enhance FDI.
32.
Important progress has been made in moving towards energy self-sufficiency based
on renewable sources. On average, more than half of Uruguay’s power stems from hydropower
(although with large weather-related fluctuations), and for the remainder the country is
progressively switching to other renewable sources, in particular wind-energy. The power company
is also investing in a larger connection with the Brazilian grid, to accommodate exports of the
expected excess power supply.
33.
The authorities emphasized their efforts to boost infrastructure and strengthen
education outcomes. The authorities have started rolling out a series of infrastructure investment
plans though PPPs, in particular for highways and railroad projects. The authorities indicated that
improving the quality of secondary education and upgrading labor skills would be essential to
sustain strong and inclusive growth in the long run. They also noted the increase in public spending
on vocational training as well as a series of initiatives to support youth employment, small and
medium-sized enterprises, and high quality jobs through FDI.
Investing in Financial Deepening and Stability
34.
The steadfast implementation of the far-reaching financial inclusion law has the
potential to enhance resilience to shocks, policy transmission, and growth. The low level of
bank credit to GDP in Uruguay suggests there is scope for strengthening the credit channel. The
segmented and concentrated structure of the banking market also limits bank lending in pesos
rather than in U.S. dollars. The implementation of the 2014 financial inclusion law—which increases
households’ access to financial services—is already creating competition among banks for salary
accounts, which should facilitate access to credit and foster more competition in the peso market,
leading to efficiency gains.
35.
Government projects for infrastructure investment can be designed to foster the
development of new capital markets instruments. New instruments can, in particular, offer more
opportunities for retail investors in the peso market. The public power company has lead the way,
with a tranche of a 2015 windfarm project reserved for retail investors, and several new such
initiatives are under preparation.
36.
These financial innovations require related upgrades in the prudential framework. The
supervisor’s increased attention to monitoring nontraditional entrants into the financial system and
correspondent relationships of traditional banks is essential. The ongoing implementation of the
Basel III standards, including the liquidity coverage requirements, and the move to International

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

URUGUAY

Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting norms should also help to maintain and further
strengthen Uruguay’s robust prudential framework.
37.
Authorities views on financial deepening and reforms. The authorities noted the initial
positive effects of the 2014 financial inclusion law, in particular the five-time increase in the volume
of transactions paid with debit cards, a significant reduction in the cost of interbank transfers, and
progress in the interoperability of point-of-sale terminal networks. Regarding regulatory reforms,
the authorities assessed the effect of the introduction of the new Basel III requirements on banks at
each step of the implementation process. They mentioned that five out of twelve banks had been
classified as systemically important and would face a capital surcharge, scheduled for 2017.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Following a decade of high and inclusive growth, economic activity in Uruguay has
slowed. Notwithstanding the progress made in economic diversification and in decoupling from
neighboring countries, the economy is affected by slowing activity across Latin America, and anemic
growth in other markets, and declining commodity prices. The currency has depreciated broadly in
line with other countries in the region, and remains broadly aligned with fundamentals. At the same
time, inflation continues to exceed the central bank’s target range.
39.
As a small open economy exporting mostly agricultural products, importing all its oil,
and dependent on international financial markets, Uruguay remains exposed to possible
further shocks. While the baseline projection foresees a temporary and mild slowdown, the nearterm economic future of Argentina and Brazil presents important sources of uncertainty. In addition,
the decline in domestic credit and in consumer and producer confidence weighs on the outlook for
domestic spending.
40.
With proper economic management, Uruguay should be well-positioned to weather
the recent slowdown. Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate offers a key tool for absorbing external
shocks. In addition, ample gross reserves and the government’s sizable liquidity buffers can help
cushion severe external shocks. Nevertheless such buffers could be prematurely eroded by
prolonged foreign exchange interventions if these continued after disorderly market conditions have
subsided.
41.
A strong public sector balance sheet is essential for underpinning confidence in
Uruguay’s economy. In this context, the government’s 5-year budget appropriately combines
emphasis on budgetary consolidation with efforts to support infrastructure development and key
social objectives. A firm commitment is needed to continued improvements in the structural primary
balance that will stabilize net debt over the medium term. Such commitment would offer scope for
automatic stabilizers to operate along the structural consolidation path. Restoring the financial
soundness of the oil-distribution company ANCAP is crucial for the fiscal outlook. Well-designed
public-private partnerships can support project management and relieve immediate financing
constraints.
26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

42.
A threefold strategy is needed to bring inflation back within the target range. Such a
strategy involves keeping a tight monetary policy stance, supported by a prudent fiscal stance,
eliminating wages’ backward indexation to reduce inflation persistence, and ongoing strengthening
of the monetary policy framework. Price stability would be an important element of a strategy to
gradually reduce the high level of dollarization, which limits the effectiveness of monetary policy.
43.
Greater economic diversification, infrastructure upgrades, and secondary education
reform would contribute to boosting Uruguay’s growth potential. Expanding higher valueadded commodity production and processing, and increasing the diversification of markets would
reduce exposure to adverse external shocks. Improvements in transport and logistics infrastructure
will be important for keeping up with the demands of a growing and increasingly diversified
economy.
44.
The authorities’ initiatives to promote financial deepening are promising. The 2014
financial inclusion law is expected to foster more competition in the retail banking market and
improve intermediation efficiency. Ongoing upgrades in Uruguay’s solid regulatory framework,
including the judicious implementation of the Basel III requirements, should accompany the financial
sector innovations
45.

Staff proposes that Uruguay remains on the 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Annex I. Uruguay—External Stability Assessment
Uruguay’s current account deficit (CAD)
narrowed in 2014–15 on the back of a lower
oil import bill and strong commodity exports,
in spite of continued weakness in the services
account. The CAD narrowed to just under
4½ percent of GDP in 2014, from 5 percent of
GDP in 2013, as the trade deficit improved owing
to lower prices for oil imports and strong
commodity exports. Weakness in the external
services balance (from a surplus of 3 percent of
GDP on average in 2009–12 to near balance in
2013) continued in 2014, due to a surge in

international oil prices and first full year of
production of the Montes del Plata pulp mill are expected to have counteracted the fall in price of
key Uruguayan commodity exports as well as the economic slowdown in principal trading partners.
Staff projects a CAD of around 4 percent of GDP in 2016, as the outlook for Uruguay’s commodity
export prices remains negative (albeit less so than in 2015), and given the economic difficulties
facing Brazil and Argentina, even as import demand in Uruguay slows together with domestic
activity.

FDI continues to fully finance Uruguay’s current account deficit but other financial and
portfolio flows have receded in 2015. Continuing the trend of the past decade, FDI inflows of
4¾ percent of GDP in 2014 comfortably financed the CAD. In the first half of 2015, despite slowing
slightly relative to the same period in 2014, FDI inflows of US$1.4 billion were still more than
sufficient to cover the CAD of US$1.1 billion, and are estimated to have done so for the year at large.
On the other hand, net portfolio investment inflows to Uruguay have abated recently, slowing to
2½ percent of GDP in 2014 after averaging 4 percent of GDP from 2011–13. In 2015, portfolio flows
in the first half were supported by the issuance of a U.S. dollar denominated global bond by the
government; however, the second half of the year saw net portfolio outflows with a switch in
portfolios by Uruguayan pension funds towards U.S. dollar denominated assets, as well as some
nonresident selling of short-term local currency public securities. Furthermore, an increase in
domestic deposit dollarization in 2015 has contributed to an increase in net other investment

outflows, as banks have sought to offset their rising domestic U.S. dollar liabilities with increased
U.S. dollar assets abroad.
The peso has seen a marked depreciation against the U.S. dollar, broadly in line with the trend
among emerging markets (EMs). After depreciating by 14 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2014, the
peso has depreciated further, by 22 percent, in 2015. Pressures on the peso, largely in line with the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar across all EMs, intensified in the second half of 2015, with the
portfolio and other investment outflows mentioned above. The central bank of Uruguay
accommodated these financial outflows in the second half through interventions in the foreign
exchange market, slowing the pace of depreciation, with the aim of curbing excessive volatility and
disorderly market conditions in the relatively small domestic foreign exchange market.

account model (based on results from September 2015) indicated a cyclically-adjusted current
account norm of -2.8 percent of GDP, somewhat larger than the -2.4 percent of GDP cyclicallyadjusted current account deficit (CAD) estimated for 2015, suggesting a 1 percent undervaluation.
The contribution of policy variables to the small gap between the projected cyclically adjusted CAD
and the norm was minimal.3 Calculations based on the EBA external stability approach, on the other
hand, suggest a 5½ percent overvaluation, as a CAD of -1.2 percent of GDP would be required to
stabilize Uruguay’s net foreign assets to GDP ratio in the medium-term, while staff’s medium-term
CAD projection currently stands at -3½ percent of GDP.
Uruguay: Gross International Reserves

External stability risks for Uruguay remain
contained. The flip side of the central bank’s extensive
intervention in the foreign exchange market in 2015 has
been a decline in gross reserves of US$2.6 billion since
June. Despite this, reserves remain well above the upper
bound of the IMF reserve adequacy metric range, and
various other prudential benchmarks. An illustrative
exercise, simulating a 2002-type situation indicates that
a similar run on foreign-currency denominated deposits
and repayment of short-term external debt in Uruguay
would currently cost about US$9 billion, corresponding

to 56 percent of the latest reserves numbers. Furthermore, the sum of the foreign assets of the
central bank and commercial banks exceeds the sum of foreign currency denominated bank
deposits (resident and non-resident) and short-term external debt. Given this strong level of
reserves, and the financing of the CAD through relatively stable FDI inflows, external stability risks
remain contained. Finally, although the net international investment position has worsened since
2007–11, this has primarily been due to an increase in FDI liabilities.

Annex II. Uruguay—Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Uruguay is a particular case among emerging market economies as it is one of very few countries to
report debt figures on a consolidated basis for the whole public sector, excluding public commercial
banks but including the central bank. This broad institutional coverage yields public gross financing
needs and debt ratios that are higher than the DSA benchmarks for higher scrutiny countries.4 Under
the baseline scenario, gross debt of Uruguay’s public sector is projected to increase from 61.3 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 64.7 percent in 2020. However the long average maturity and favorable currency
composition of the debt, as well as the high level of liquid financial assets of the public sector—
26.4 percent of GDP at end-2014—mitigate short-term financing risks.
The gross debt of the public sector has a wide coverage. It includes:







Central government debt, which stood at 39 percent of GDP at end-2014. The average maturity
of central government debt exceeds 14 years and about 52 percent is local-currency
denominated.
Central bank debt, at 17 percent of GDP at end-2014. The debt of the central bank mostly
consists of short-term securities issued to manage liquidity. About 83 percent of central bank
debt is denominated in local currency.
Public enterprises’ debt, which stood at 5 percent of GDP at end-2014.
And the debt of local governments and other public sector entities (such as Banco de Seguros del
Estado), which represented less than one percent of GDP at end-2014.

Overall, more than 56 percent of the debt of the public sector at end-2014 was in local currency,
64 percent of which was in CPI-indexed units.
The public sector holds sizable gross financial assets (including international reserves),
amounting to 39.3 percent of GDP at end-2014. In addition, the government has access to
contingent credit lines from multilateral institutions which represented 3.5 percent of GDP in 2014.




4

The total financial assets of the central bank (including foreign reserve assets, at 32.5 percent of
GDP) reached 34 percent of GDP at end-2014. About 13 percentage points of GDP in reserves
were the counterpart to reserve requirements on foreign currency bank deposits.
The financial assets of the non-financial public sector amounted to 5.2 percent of GDP at end2014, most of which held in liquid instruments (e.g., securities and deposits), in line with the
government’s prefunding policy of holding enough liquid assets to cover at least 12 months of
debt service.

See IMF, Staff Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market-Access Countries, May, 9 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

URUGUAY

The net debt of the public sector, defined as gross debt minus liquid assets, stood at
34.9 percent of GDP at the end of 2014.


The stock of liquid assets of the public sector is computed as total gross public sector assets minus
the required reserves held by banks at the BCU against foreign currency deposits. This stock
stood at 26.4 percent of GDP at end-2014.

Baseline scenario
The simultaneous reduction in both the central bank’s assets and debt in 2015 has a significant
effect on the path for both gross and net debt of the public sector. Sales of foreign reserves and
other debt management operations by the government and the central bank are estimated to
reduce gross debt by about 4.3 percent of GDP between 2014 and 2015, limiting the overall increase
in gross debt to 0.6 percent of GDP in that year, despite the adverse valuation effect of the
depreciation. The gross and net public debt ratios then slowly increase over the projection horizon.
Gross public debt grows from 63.1 percent to 64.7 percent of GDP between 2016 and 2020. Net
debt increases faster, from 38.6 percent to 41.3 percent of GDP, as the 2015 sales of reserves reduce
the initial stock of liquid assets and, hence, subsequent valuation gains stemming from the
continuous appreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the peso. Public gross financing needs decrease
in 2016 before rising again over the medium term, as global interest rates increase and gross debt
rises.
Assuming that real GDP growth, real interest rates, and other identified debt-creating flows remain
at the level projected for 2020, the debt-stabilizing primary balance is estimated at about 1 percent
of GDP, about ½ percentage point of GDP above the projected medium term level of the primary
balance.
The baseline assumptions are broadly plausible. Staff forecast track record is not systematically
biased, as reflected in projection errors generally not being consistently on one side. The median
forecast errors for inflation and primary balance over the period 2006–14 are broadly in line with
those observed in other countries. Uruguay’s growth forecast errors are often higher than the interquartile range of the distribution of past forecast errors for other countries, implying that growth in
Uruguay has tended to surprise on the upside in the past. The projected fiscal adjustment is
consistent with experiences across surveillance countries.
The fan charts show limited uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the symmetric fan chart,
estimated at around 15 percent of GDP, illustrates a certain degree of confidence for equalprobability upside and downside shocks.
Alternative scenario
A “historical” scenario, assuming that the key macroeconomic variables behave as in the last decade,
yields a downward-sloping debt path, since Uruguay experienced high growth rates and exchange
rate appreciation as it recovered from the 2002 financial crisis.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

Vulnerability of the financing profile
Public sector’s financing needs do not imply near-term vulnerabilities. The share of public sector
debt held by non-residents and total external financing needs are slightly above their respective
benchmarks, but refinancing risks are limited by the presence of high liquidity buffers, including the
sizable liquid financial assets of the public sector and the access to contingent credit lines. These
considerations also apply to the assessment of external debt sustainability (Annex III).
Stress tests
Debt dynamics are moderately sensitive to shocks. In a stylized downside scenario that combines a
permanent 20 percent exchange rate depreciation (relative to the baseline) with a temporary drop in
growth and primary balances, and a permanent

Annex III. Uruguay—External Debt Sustainability Analysis
After holding steady during 2010–14 (at an average of 42 percent of GDP), Uruguay’s gross external
debt is projected to have risen to 50 percent of GDP in 2015, mostly due to the significant
depreciation of the nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. Under staff’s baseline scenario,
gross external debt is projected to rise slightly further over the medium term, to 51 percent of GDP
in 2020, largely driven by price and exchange rate dynamics. Gross external financing needs (which
averaged 16 percent of GDP from 2010–14) are also projected to have seen a notable uptick to 20
percent of GDP in 2015, but are expected to moderate towards the historical average in the medium
term.
Stress tests indicate that the standard growth and interest rate shocks would have a minimal impact
on external debt. Shocks to the non-interest current account and a combined shock (to the real
interest rate, growth and the current account) would weigh more on external debt, albeit still
moderately. Exchange rate shocks would pose the biggest risk to Uruguay’s external debt
sustainability, as shown in the charts. Nonetheless, given Uruguay’s sizeable gross international
reserves and liquidity buffers, risks to external debt sustainability remain limited.

1/ External debt includes non-resident deposits.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2015)
The Inter-American Development Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved in December
2015 a new Country Strategy with Uruguay (2016–2020). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under
the new program is expected to reach approximately US$1.8 billion, which is considered to be
consistent with Uruguay’s five year budget. The program includes additional non reimbursable
financing for technical assistance and analytical work. Approved lending under the previous Country
Strategy (2010-2015) reached approximately US$1.9 billion in sovereign guaranteed loans1 and
US$1 billion in non-sovereign guaranteed loans.
The objectives of the Country Strategy for 2016–2020 are to: (i) boost productivity and
competitiveness by promoting innovation, improving productive infrastructure, and supporting an
integrated and coordinated policy for international positioning; (ii) promote equity and social
inclusion by strengthening the human capital and employability of the population, supporting
health care reform, improving habitat, and supporting the early childhood and youth segments of
the most vulnerable population groups; and (iii) strengthen public sector management by
supporting greater efficiency in public institutions and strengthening urban and departmental
management.
As of October 31st 2015, the Bank’s portfolio in execution in Uruguay includes 37 sovereign
guaranteed loans for US$1.8 billion. Of this total, 34 are investment loan operations totaling
US$1.3 billion, and 3 are policy-based loans for US$550.8 million with a deferred drawdown option.
The main sectors comprising the active public sector portfolio are: export and investment promotion
(31%); water, sanitation, and solid waste (18%); energy (16%); urban development and security
(13%); science and technology (5%); agribusiness (4%); transportation (4%); public management and
finance (4%); education and job training (3%); and social protection (2%). The active private sector
portfolio is composed of 27 loans totaling US$842 million, primarily concentrated in the energy
(64%) and agribusiness (32%) sectors.

This includes US$366 million approved under the Reallocation Program and US$50 million from the China Cofinancing Fund.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 29, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.

National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005)
and adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993. However, national accounts
statistics still have some shortcomings: limited coverage of the enterprise survey, partial
update of business register, poor quality source data for some components of GDP,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. Longtime series are not available on the BCU website. There is no regular schedule for updating the
base year of the national accounts. The causes of the current revisions to the quarterly national
accounts are not explained to users. For the national accounts there is a need to plan adoption
of the 2008 SNA and updating of the base year.
Prices: The new base period for the consumer price index is December 2010 = 100. The CPI
has national coverage and includes more than forty thousand price quotations. It does not
cover either the implicit rent or the net acquisitions of owner-occupied dwellings. For the CPI,
reselection of the sample of detailed products has not been done for an extended period. The
base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Producer price indices (March
2010 =100) for national products have been recently disseminated. The PPI does not cover
utilities, construction, business and other services and exported output. For both the CPI and
PPI, statistical outputs/intermediate results are not validated with available information from
alternative sources. The CPI and PPI would benefit from a more regular and frequent schedule
of weight updates.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state
enterprises and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems
with the timeliness of the data for local governments. There are also problems with the
timeliness of financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical
publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data
respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central
government and total public sector, but no information is reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics. The information reported for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on revenue and expense for the consolidated
central government (data on revenue and expense for local governments have not been
reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations on financial assets and
liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in
accordance with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). The authorities
report monetary data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial
corporations (OFCs) using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the
OFCs are limited to off-shore financial institutions. A mission could be fielded to expand the
institutional coverage of OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full institutional coverage.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS), Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) databases. However, only annual FSIs data from 2009 through
2013 have been reported, and the authorities have not responded to requests for more current
data. FSIs on nonfinancial corporations, households, market liquidity, and real estate markets
are not available. The BCU disseminates FSIs for individual banks on a monthly basis and
generates FSIs for the banking system weighting individual bank FSIs by their asset share.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and international investment position (IIP)
statistics are compiled and published on a quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual., Uruguay
disseminates the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data template, submits
quarterly external debt statistics to the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, and
participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS). There is room to improve the timeliness of CDIS data submission.
The Central Bank of Uruguay is currently working on improving the quality and coverage of its
services and direct investment related statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in
February 2004 and is in observance.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The authorities do not provide trade
price and volume indices for publication in the IFS.
Annual GFS are regularly reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. No high frequency GFS are reported for publication in the International Financial
Statistics.
Uruguay reports to STA balance of payments and IIP data for publication in the IFS and the

Statement by Mr. Chodos, Executive Director on Uruguay,
and Mr. Vogel, Advisor to Executive Director
Board Meeting
February 8, 2016

In 2015 Uruguay completed its thirteen consecutive year of positive growth, despite
heightened global uncertainty and a marked regional slowdown. The staff report notes that
“[the country] has become a bastion of stability in a volatile region”. Not long ago,
recessions experienced in Uruguay’s biggest neighbors systematically spilled-over to the
country—more often than not with amplified effects. Yet over the last few years Uruguay has
been able to differentiate itself. Of course, there are substantial challenges and risks lying
ahead in the short and medium term; nonetheless, it is clear that Uruguay is facing them from
a position of strength. What are the factors that may explain the country’s resilience? What
are the significant challenges looking forward? This Buff statement will try to elaborate on
some of them.
Economic and Social Achievements Go Hand in Hand
Uruguay exhibits the lowest poverty rates and inequality indicators in Latin America.
According to the latest figures, in 2014 extreme poverty was 0.2 percent (1.4 percent in
2006) and poverty continued to fall to reach 6.4 percent (24.2 percent in 2006). Meanwhile,
the Gini coefficient declined to 0.38 (0.46, eight years earlier). The Uruguayan authorities
have repeatedly underlined a concept of global stability, which comprised economic, social
and political stability. Growth can and should be accompanied by better conditions for
society as a whole, and these social achievements have in turn provided the societal
consensus to undertake a critical path of sound policies and deep structural reforms. On this
issue, the Uruguayan authorities would like to congratulate the Fund for its increasing
attention to social issues, particularly inequality and its effects on growth.
Mercosur and Beyond
Not long ago, exports to Mercosur countries represented roughly half of Uruguay’s external
sales. This has substantially changed over the last decade, as the economy opened up and
diversified itself into new markets and products. As a result, Uruguay today sells goods to
about 150 countries, and sales to Mercosur are less than a quarter of the total exports of

2
goods. The authorities have repeatedly stressed that Mercosur should not be an objective by
itself; instead, this regional trade block should serve as a platform for further integration with
other regions and the world in general.
The Selected Issues’ chapter on “Boosting growth through diversification” provides a helpful
perspective of the country’s developments and challenges, although it also has some caveats,
for instance, when including an analysis on Uruguay’s linkages with Argentina based on data
for the period 1980-2014; facts and links substantially changed over that long period, and
thus an updated analysis that takes into account the structural changes that occurred during
this time could be warranted.
From the Achilles Heel to an Essential Factor
Investment used to be one of the weakest sides of Uruguay’s economy and a drag for growth.
Nevertheless, policies, reforms and the country’s investment law have allowed a reversal of
the situation; investment is currently at about 24 percent of GDP and its allocation spreads
across a number of sectors (involving goods and services) of the Uruguayan economy,
constituting a key driver for diversification and growth. As a special case, it is worth noting
that foreign direct investment (in terms of GDP) is—along with Chile—among the highest in
the region, and continues to fully finance the current account deficit.
Mitigating Risks
Based on Uruguay’s traditional pillar of fulfilling commitments and honoring debts, the
country’s policies over the past decade have driven the country to substantially reduce its
debt-to-GDP ratio; as noted in the staff report, the country’s net public debt-to-GDP exhibits
a considerable decline when comparing current levels with the average in the period 2004-12.
Meanwhile, the work of the Debt Management Unit, created a decade ago, drastically
reduced financial risks in Uruguay’s debt portfolio, increasing the percentage of the Central
Government debt denominated in local currency to 45 percent (vs. 11 percent ten years ago);
the average time to maturity is one of the highest in the world (15.3 years, from 7.9 percent
in 2005); and the composition of fixed-rate debt is 94 percent (vs. 78 percent).
Liquidity Buffers
The staff report refers to “Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers” and to “the BCU’s ample gross
reserves” that “could help cushion severe external shocks”. Indicators related to gross
international reserves, published in Annex 1 of the staff report, lead to the same conclusion.
Until 2014, amidst strong appreciation pressures of the domestic currency vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar, the BCU’s interventions aimed to moderate excessive volatility, which resulted in a
considerable increase of international reserves and also, as a counterpart, in an increase of

3
fiscal deficits and gross public debt (it is worth highlighting the first paragraph of Annex II of
the staff report which states that “Uruguay is a particular case among emerging market
economies as it is one of very few countries to report debt figures on a consolidated basis for
the whole public sector, excluding public commercial banks but including the central bank”).
Thereafter, global circumstances changed and emerging-market currencies came to be under
depreciating pressures. Thus, once again, Uruguay’s central bank has intervened in order to
smooth excessive exchange rate volatility and reduce the likelihood of an eventual
overshooting. In any case, exchange rate flexibility is seen by the authorities as essential and
there has not been any policy or movement that goes against fundamentals (indeed, Annex I
on External Stability Assessment concluded that “the real effective exchange rate remains in
line with fundamentals”). It is important to mention that the BCU recently used reserves to
reduce its costly short-term debt, which is leading to a strengthening of Uruguay’s balance
sheet (thus, figure 2 of the staff report would benefit from a more nuanced analysis regarding
the factors that explain the recent drop, when simply saying that “reserves are well above
prudential norms despite a recent drop due to central bank intervention”).
Low or Prudent?
Over the past decade, Uruguay has made critical reforms to its financial system; among
which, it is worth highlighting the substantial transformation of the Banco de la República
Oriental del Uruguay (BROU) as well as critical changes to the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks. The Selected Issues’ chapter on “Bank lending and completion in the banking
sector” points out that “at just 25 percent of GDP in 2014, Uruguay’s private credit
intermediation is among the lowest in the Latin American region”. At the same time, we can
state that this relatively low credit indicator is to a good extent the consequence of Uruguay’s
prudent approach (from lenders, borrowers and the Superintendency of Financial Services)
which allows the country to exhibit a sound financial system with, for instance, the lowest
non-performing loans (in percent of total loans) among the region (at 2.3 percent).
In any case, the Uruguayan authorities share the assessment that there is a significant scope
for financial deepening and, in fact, they have been establishing additional reforms, such as
the financial inclusion law, which constitutes a major structural transformation established in
2015, and will entail relevant effects on credit, growth, and social inclusiveness. The
authorities fully agree with the staff’s comments that the expected changes will require
“ongoing upgrades in Uruguay’s solid regulatory framework”.
There has been some increase in domestic deposit dollarization, but as noted in the staff
report, a relevant part of the explanation is related to valuation effects. With regard to credit
dollarization, paragraph 4 of the chapter on bank lending provides a clear picture of the
situation: of the credit extended to households, only 4 percent was U.S. dollar denominated,
while regulations significantly prevent currency mismatches among firms.

Consistent Objectives and Policies
The current slowdown presents a number of macroeconomic challenges; the reduction of
inflation (under control but, admittedly, at higher rates than envisaged), the preservation of
competitiveness, maintaining a sustainable path of fiscal accounts, and the continuation of
the soundness of financial stability constitute high priorities for the Uruguayan government.
In order to attain them, the Central Bank has kept a firm contractionary monetary policy
stance (as said, in the context of a flexible exchange rate system); the five-year budget
envisages a reduction in the fiscal deficit and a sound trajectory of the public debt; the
authorities are fully committed to improving the efficiency of public enterprises and,
particularly, restoring the financial position of the public oil distribution company.
Furthermore, the government’s guidelines for the new round of wage council negotiations are
fully in line with the above-referred objectives.
Institutional Quality
Uruguay’s solid institutions constitute a key factor when explaining the confidence that
Uruguay enjoys from the investment community. In this regard, we could cite a few recent
indicators that may mirror the country’s institutional quality.
According to the 2015 report of Corruption Perception Index published by Transparency
International, Uruguay ranks as the 21st country with the lowest level of corruption among
168 countries, and with the lowest corruption levels across all emerging markets (and many
advanced economies).
In addition, the Democracy Index (The Economist Intelligence Unit) categorizes Uruguay as
a full democracy (which implies an absolute respect for civil liberties and representative
governance). Furthermore, the latest Latinobarometro’s annual report enquired about the
functioning of democracy; 70 percent of Uruguayans responded that they are satisfied or very
satisfied (compared with an average of 37 percent in Latin America).
Looking Forward
Global, regional and domestic circumstances pose critical challenges and risks and, of
course, the authorities will face them through their usual perspective: consistency among
objectives and policies; substantial efforts to attain higher equality of opportunities, better
income distribution and poverty reduction; and more structural changes. As also noted,
Uruguay is facing this new situation from a solid position; amidst a very complicated
regional situation, the country has been able to exhibit an expansion of its economy, have
further upgrades in its sovereign debt ratings, and show steady sovereign spreads; the staff

report speaks about “the ongoing differentiation by international investors between Uruguay
and other countries in the region”.
However, the authorities are keen to emphasize that there is no room for complacency at all.
Good results are just positive stimulus to face the future. The macroeconomic challenges of
the new circumstances are substantial; and significantly more efforts are needed on many
sides: a further integration with the world and other regions is critical; a deep change in the
education system is vital; infrastructure must accompany the country’s developments; the
investment climate should continue improving in order to keep attracting productive
investment; and public enterprises must be consistent with the efforts made by the public
sector as a whole. The Uruguayan authorities will continue working on all of these issues and
would like to thank the Fund for the positive and constructive tone of the staff report and its
relevant comments and suggestions.
