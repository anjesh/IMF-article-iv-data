Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Adam Bennett and Thomas Dorsey
March 24, 2010

Executive Summary
Focus: The impact of the global crisis; and policies needed to move Montenegro to a more
sustainable post-boom growth model and to return quickly to potential growth.
Context: Strong inflows prior to 2009 delivered robust growth but also large imbalances and
vulnerabilities that became a serious problem during the global crisis. The unwinding of imbalances
has triggered a credit crunch and a sharp contraction in economic activity.
Outlook: The economic contraction appears to be dissipating but there are scant signs of imminent
recovery. Domestic demand is expected to decline further as balance sheets are repaired. In the
medium term, growth could rebound to some 4 percent, on average, on the back of the global
recovery and improved competitiveness.
Policy discussions: Staff recommend higher savings, from both the government and the private
sector, and efforts to improve competitiveness, in order to cut the current account deficit to
sustainable levels. In addition, policies need to be geared to safeguarding financial stability. In the
euroized policy framework, this calls for further strengthening of the banking system, making public
finances more sustainable, and advancing with growth enhancing structural reforms, especially in the
labor and product markets. The authorities agreed with staff recommendations in principle, and point
to relevant policy efforts already initiated. However, they believed that imbalances will largely self
correct in the context of a relatively benign economic environment.
Montenegro does not issue its own currency, but has been using the euro as legal tender since 2002.
Montenegro has accepted the obligations under Article VIII. Montenegro maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions except with respect to pre-1992 blocked foreign currency savings accounts and
restrictions maintained for security purposes that have not been notified to the Fund.
Team: Messrs. Bell (head), Gagales, Yamada (all EUR), Lundback (MCM) and Kapsoli (FAD)
visited Podgorica during January 21–February 2, 2010. Mr. Tomic (OED) also joined the
discussions. Meetings took place with the Prime Minister, the Ministers of Finance and of Labor and
Transportation, the Governor of the Central Bank, senior officials of the administration,
parliamentarians, labor unions, the private sector, and academics. Staff held a press conference at the
end of the mission.

I. CONTEXT: A BRIEF HISTORY OF SHOCKS
1.
In its brief history since independence in 2006, Montenegro has been buffeted by
strong, and sequentially opposing, external shocks.


The post-independence boom, triggered by bold reforms and favorable
assessments of the economy’s potential, was nevertheless narrow-based and
aggravated underlying vulnerabilities. Very high levels of FDI and credit growth
financed surging domestic demand and have raised average annual GDP growth to
8 percent since independence in 2006. FDI targeted primarily the tourism and
financial sectors, triggering a cycle of wealth effects, as real estate became more
valuable, was used as loan collateral, with loans in turn again funding construction
activities. To the extent that FDI targeted other sectors it was either negligible or
dependent on exceptionally favorable commodity prices and subsidies. As a result,
imbalances have been created and vulnerabilities have increased: rapid credit growth
has compromised the quality of banks’ portfolios; real estate prices soared beyond
fundamentals; private sector debt swelled; a large output gap has emerged;
competitiveness has been eroded; and the current account deficit ballooned.



The sharp deterioration in the external environment post October 2008
triggered a severe contraction of economic activity. While FDI remained buoyant,
the burst of the global asset bubble in the fall of 2008 quickly affected Montenegrin
assets and spilled over into stress in the banking system and difficulties in the
corporate sector. The size and abruptness of the swing also left little time to redress
the domestic vulnerabilities accumulated during the boom.

2.
Throughout the period, the policy framework has been challenged. While
euroization was very successful in anchoring expectations, it proved ill-suited for sterilizing
massive capital inflows or checking the rapid credit growth, a situation that was further
aggravated by a more expansionary monetary policy stance in the euro area than appropriate
from Montenegro’s cyclical perspective. Euroization also limits the scope for lender-of-lastresort (LoLR) operations, which is particularly relevant for domestic banks which lack
foreign parent support. Prudential regulation has been strengthened but supervision lacked
effective instruments and independence to intervene in banks. Finally, with the benefit of
hindsight, it became clear that fiscal policy had been too loose, thereby leaving little fiscal
space for countercyclical action in the event of a severe downturn.
3.
The authorities are maintaining the reform momentum. Their overriding goal is
to establish a business friendly, open economy with low taxes and minimal state interference
and to integrate the country in Atlantic-European structures. Last year Montenegro applied
for EU candidate status and recently submitted answers to the questionnaire on conformity
with the acquis communautaire. Despite some delays in structural reforms and occasional
difficulties in building consensus, the authorities remain pro-reform; early elections in 2009
provided the government with a significant parliamentary majority.

II. THE IMPACT OF THE POST OCTOBER 2008 GLOBAL CRISIS

that have drained liquidity and tested the
resilience of the banking system (Annex I). Apart from liquidity, loan quality also
deteriorated as a large share of credit had gone to consumption and real estate—
where collateral values have been correcting sharply and collateral execution is
lengthy. Banks’ efforts to clean up their loan portfolios and tighten credit risk
management, and initial bank undercapitalization further reinforced the credit crunch.
In the earlier stages, foreign parent banks (which own the bulk of the banking system)
provided substantial liquidity support to their subsidiaries, mitigating the contraction
of credit. But after deposits started reflowing in April 2009, they clawed back their
earlier support, leaving bank credit on a declining path.



Depressed external and domestic demand with strong negative effects on
economic activity. Weaker interest by foreign investors for real estate in Montenegro
and negative wealth effects—dropping asset prices, weaker balance sheets and
reassessment of growth prospects—have triggered a sharp decline in construction
activity (Figures 2–4). Moreover, in the important tourism sector, overnight visits
declined, notwithstanding an actual small increase in the number of visitors and
higher capacity having come on stream.



Large negative terms-of-trade shocks
have undermined the viability of the
Aluminum Complex (KAP), the largest
employer in the country, and the Steel
Smelter. The drop of the aluminum
price below KAP’s break-even level has
prompted severe production cuts, the
built-up of arrears and NPLs, and
reopened the public debate regarding
KAP’s medium-term viability.

These channels reinforced each other via feedback effects through the banking
system, as mounting arrears and NPLs further weakened banks and aggravated the
credit crunch.

5.
Given the size of these shocks, but also reflecting Montenegro’s initial
vulnerabilities, economic performance weakened more than elsewhere in the region
(Figure 5).

7


GDP dropped sharply with the contraction particularly pronounced in industry,
construction and financial services. From the demand side, the contraction of
economic activity is evident in the drop of tax revenue (VAT and real estate taxes)
and plummeting imports and exports (Figure 2). On the positive side, foreign
investors remained attracted by Montenegro’s potential. For the year as a whole, staff
estimates GDP to have dropped by 7 percent, a 15 percentage point deceleration that
has eliminated a large

sectors.



A substantial deterioration in employment was masked by special factors.
Throughout much of 2009, headline employment and unemployment statistics
depicted a strong labor market. However, this masked underemployment (especially
in KAP), rising part-time employment and the substitution of domestic for foreign
labor. In effective terms, employment is estimated to have dropped by 14 percent on
an annual average basis; going forward, KAP restructuring could have a further
significant negative impact on employment.



The downturn has eased the upward pressure on inflation and wages. Although
lags have kept year-on-year CPI inflation considerably above the euro area average,
the differential has been narrowing. More importantly, nominal wages moderated and
even declined during 2009—especially in sectors most affected by the downturn—
helped by tax cuts that mitigated the effect on net wages.

6.
While the economic contraction is contributing to the restoration of internal and
external balance, it also revealed the true extent of the underlying structural fiscal
deficit. Staff estimates that the GDP contraction in 2009 mostly eliminated the large positive
output gap. The external current account deficit is projected to halve to some 27 percent of
GDP, with the adjustment reflecting a larger drop of imports than exports. On the other hand,
the import correction is revealing the structural fiscal revenue decline.

8
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The economic contraction appears to be dissipating but there are scant signs of
an imminent recovery. 2010 is likely to be another challenging year in light of still
unwinding imbalances, the planned downsizing and restructuring of the metal and mineral
sector, and the fragile external environment (linked also to developments in Greece). Credit
growth is likely to be very low given banks’ reduced risk appetite, and ongoing restructuring,
for example of the Hypo Group Alpe Adria (HGAA). Also, with a potential private-sector
debt overhang, balance sheets are a drag on demand.1 Finally, tourism and FDI are also likely
to be held back in this environment. Staff projects GDP to register a small further contraction
of some 1¾ percent, in the process opening up a small negative output gap and trimming
inflation and wage growth. While the Central Bank broadly concurred with staff’s
assessment, the government was more sanguine, projecting growth of 0.5 percent.
8.
With the right policies, Montenegro’s medium-term outlook should be bright.
Starting 2011, building on the progress in unwinding of imbalances and improving
competitiveness, the economy could enjoy a more vigorous recovery and participate in the
projected global upswing. Though still short of what was seen in the boom, staff and the
authorities project medium-term growth to rebound on average to some 4 percent per annum.
With savings recovering from their very low level, the current account deficit is projected to
decline to 9 percent of GDP and inflation to hover around 3½ percent over the medium term.
9.
This outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty, but the risks are broadly
balanced. The prospects for KAP’s restructuring and its longer-term viability remain fluid;
the financing for the large infrastructure projects could encounter problems; and a weakened
financial sector, problems in parent banks, and impaired private sector balance sheets could
prove a drag on the recovery. On the positive side there is foreign investors’ interest in
electricity generation and infrastructure projects, with substantial upside, reflecting
Montenegro’s untapped potential and small size. Even a handful of projects could turn
around economic conditions very rapidly. However, staff stressed that this upside should not
be taken for granted.
10.
While formal evidence on external competitiveness provides a mixed assessment,
improvements are needed to bolster medium-term sustainability. CGER-type estimates
are highly uncertain (Box 1) and the large current account deficits reflect primarily an
overheated economy and low savings,2 while the relative resilience of tourism suggests that
competitiveness may not be a problem for the time being. On the other hand, rapid wage
growth—well above productivity—over the past few years is a concern, and the region as a

The private sector carries some 60 percent of GDP of liabilities to foreign-owned banks. Recession and
possibly deflation could aggravate the associated debt servicing burden.

whole faces the task of rebuilding a competitive advantage going forward. Competitiveness
gains will also allow the required further external adjustment to rely increasingly on export
expansion and import substitution, rather than on outright domestic demand contraction,
thereby also propelling a more healthy and balanced recovery as domestic demand growth is
likely to play a less prominent role in future growth.

IV. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Apart from the immediate task to secure a fast economic turnaround,
discussions centered on ways to strengthen the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
A small and highly open economy like Montenegro is inherently more exposed to global ups
and downs. The policy framework therefore needs to allow for sufficient buffers to mitigate
the domestic fallout from global shocks. Euroization, while anchoring expectations, poses
greater demands on fiscal policy which is de facto the only tool for macroeconomic
management and also needs to substitute for the absence of a LoLR. In order not to overload
the fiscal policy tool, a high degree of flexibility in the economy is imperative, as is a
proactive and effective banking sector policy.
12.
Against this background, a comprehensive strengthening of the strained policy
framework was discussed. The structural fiscal deficit is undermining the ability to raise
financing and has left little space for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Problems in the young
banking system have been testing the capacity of bank supervision and have exposed critical
weaknesses in relevant legislation. Meanwhile, the flexibility of labor and product markets
could be further improved, as evidenced by the drawn-out restructuring in the mineral sector.
13.
The authorities’ program would need to combine adjustment with additional
external financing. But the authorities have not yet decided on the possibility of using Fund
resources. They are exploring a number of financing options, including a debut Eurobond.

The authorities pointed to their prompt response to the financial turmoil. To
bolster confidence, the government announced a blanket deposit guarantee; provided
emergency support (€44 million, repaid by October 2009) and subsequently steered
privatization-related deposits to Prva, the largest domestic bank; and also prepaid loans in an
effort to boost bank liquidity. The Central Bank (CBCG) meanwhile reduced required
reserves to 10 percent. Foreign parents have also stepped in with substantial liquidity

12
infusions to their subsidiaries while the CBCG pressed effectively for capital injections
(more than €100 million have been raised since the outbreak of the crisis) and stepped up its
surveillance, including mandating diagnostic audits and stress tests for all banks. At the same
time, loan classification rules were relaxed and in Prva, where the problems were diagnosed
to run deeper, the CBCG has prohibited new lending, demanded the installation of new
management and commissioned an independent external audit. Finally, work on
implementing FSAP recommendations continued apace.

16.
There was agreement that the fluid and complex situation required continued
vigilance. Staff suggested that a sustainable resumption of financial intermediation required
actions on a wide front:


Stepped-up supervision; Lagged effects from ongoing asset price corrections and the
economic downturn would likely further weaken banks’ portfolios and profitability.
Staff underscored that banks needed to strengthen their risk management capabilities
and urged CBCG to continue to monitor closely loan classification and provisioning
as well as the implementation of recent counter-cyclical regulatory changes. Existing
central bank interventions in weaker banks would need to remain in force and be
tightened as appropriate. Finally, the newly established Investment Development
Fund should be prudent in its operations and brought under Central Bank supervision.



Legislative action; The authorities, with Bank-Fund assistance, are well advanced in
the process of amending the Law on Banks, Law on Bank Bankruptcy and the Central
Bank Law. The objective is to, inter alia, improve the effectiveness of interim bank
administration and ensure that the judicial review process does not unduly constrain
the effectiveness of the CBCG. The authorities explained, however, that ensuring
consistency of the amendments with Montenegro’s legal traditions and constitution
had been a challenge. Staff welcomed the preparation of new deposit insurance

13
legislation but cautioned that coverage should remain affordable. Staff also welcomed
the issuance of supporting guidelines for the new AML/CFT law, noting that no
serious cases had been reported.


Replacing temporary fixes; For example, the placement of public sector deposits
with the largest domestic bank would need to be followed with more permanent
solutions to safeguard financial stability while limiting fiscal risks.



Support by shareholders and foreign parent banks; the situation surrounding
HGAA—the third largest bank—imparts some uncertainty, while the largest—also
foreign-owned—bank is working out a weak loan portfolio. Staff advocated
continued support from parents and supported the CBCG’s efforts to encourage banks
to raise capital cushions well above the minimum requirements, also with a view to
bolster confidence.
B. Regaining Fiscal Policy Buffers

The large structural deficit that expanded during the boom is a key vulnerability
and limits room of maneuver. Staff estimates the structural deficit at some 6 percent of

The authorities pointed to their swift fiscal adjustment in 2009. In the fall
of 2008, a stimulus package, consisting of bank support and increased public investment, was
launched. Accordingly, the 2009 budget projected continued vigorous growth. However, as
the full extent of the global crisis became evident and revenues plummeted, the government
quickly reversed course with a view to containing budget financing requirements. A mid-year
revision of the state budget and

While welcoming the recent budget adjustments, staff nevertheless cautioned
that the clouded fiscal outlook and heightened risks called for further and sustained
action. Staff welcomed the 2010 budget’s focus on current expenditure control but noted that
its weaker macroeconomic projection would widen the general government deficit further to
7 percent of GDP. Moreover, on current policies, the deficit would remain elevated over the
coming years, leading to a further increase of public debt, which is projected to peak at
56 percent of GDP in 2014. There was additional risk to debt dynamics from contingent
liabilities (Annex IV). These derived from uncertain but sizeable restitution obligations,
accelerating aging-related unfunded liabilities, and recently stepped up loan guarantees.
Moreover, the elevated private sector debt burden poses fiscal risks, for example in the
context of future enterprise restructuring and potential budgetary obligations from

There was agreement on the needed medium-term consolidation path but staff
noted that the required policies remain to be articulated. The authorities intend to
eliminate the headline fiscal deficit by 2012, an objective endorsed by staff, with both sides
noting the political economy difficulties. While welcoming the authorities’ intention to
undergo a comprehensive review of public expenditure with a view of “doing more with
less,” with World Bank assistance, staff noted:


Fundamentally, the sizeable structural fiscal deficit reflects an inconsistency
between low tax rates and the large size of the public sector. VAT and especially
income tax rates, at 17 and 9 percent, respectively, are low by international standards,
whereas government expenditure, at 48 percent of GDP, is above average for an

16
emerging market economy (Figure 6). Staff noted that given the low base, small tax
increases should not undermine Montenegro’s competitiveness and may even raise its
attractiveness as a business location if concerns about the sustainability of the tax
regime are removed. In turn, the authorities expected that past tax cuts generated
supply-side effects and reduced tax evasion, thereby helping both economic activity
and public finances.


The social transfer system imposes a heavy burden on the budget and on cost
competitiveness. The authorities observed that in contrast to income tax rates, social
contribution rates were quite elevated, and had recently been raised further. Staff
noted that this reflected a high transfer

while still protecting the neediest in society.



Sizeable “below-the-line” operations aggravate the financing constraint. Regular
and early repayment of frozen foreign currency deposits, restitution payments, and
settlement of arrears all serve to increase financing needs. In order to lessen such
needs, staff advised against further debt prepayments and buybacks and encouraged
reconsideration of the generous restitution scheme. Concerning the latter, the current
pace of disbursements could well exhaust the legal limit of 10 percent of GDP. This
could create inequities as claimants whose claims still have to be ruled upon may
have to go without any compensation for lack of funds. Staff also advocated strict
control of loan guarantees and of the Investment and Development Fund.



The wage bill is high by international standards, reflecting above average public
employment (Figure 7). Rationalizing public employment could also make room for
meeting EU requirements for institution building, while wage adjustment could well
set an example for the private sector that needs to bolster competitiveness.



A longer-term fiscal rule could help adjustment and credibility. The authorities
saw merit in a “Golden Rule” whereby the capital budget exceeded the headline
deficit and structural revenue covered current spending. Staff in turn underscored that
the effectiveness of fiscal policy in a euroized environment required low debt. Staff
also reiterated past advice to adopt a net-debt anchor, in particular noting the

3

17
undesirable current situation where policy buffers needed to be rebuilt in a downturn,
thus placing further drag on economic recovery. However, because of the uncertain
and potential large contingent liabilities and potential bank restructuring outlays, staff
concurred with the authorities that setting a specific debt target would in practice be
difficult. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ approach of embedding annual budgets
within rolling three-year budgets. Staff advised that these budgets should be based on
conservative projections because of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the
macroeconomic framework and asymmetric costs of fiscal over- and
underperformance. Staff also recommended better integration of central and local
government budgets and close monitoring of contingent liabilities and guarantees.
C. Structural Reforms—the Key for Boosting Competitiveness
21.
Staff noted that structural reforms had to be ambitious to substitute for the lack
of the exchange rate instrument. Given the pressures for nominal convergence for prices
and wages, the flexibility of labor and product markets and the adaptability of the
institutional framework will be essential for safeguarding external competitiveness and for
mitigating the adverse effects of shocks. While agreeing with the authorities that Montenegro
fared relatively well in international comparisons of market flexibility and openness, staff
noted that there was an unfinished agenda.


Additional labor market flexibility. With just one year since its enactment, it is
early to draw definitive conclusions about the new labor law. The authorities found
the experience so far positive but agreed that opt-out clauses from the collective
bargaining agreement, or at least a separate one for the public sector, would benefit
labor market flexibility and public sector reform. Staff observed that severance
remained expensive, discouraging job creation and longer-term employment
contracts, and welcomed the shortening of the unemployment benefits period.



Building on recent progress in the electricity sector. The unbundling of generation
and distribution has been completed, the electricity utility’s (EPCG) capital increased,
and the state has effectively transferred 40 percent of EPCG to a strategic foreign
investor (with the latter having an option to raise its holding to a majority stake). The
authorities have also started granting licenses for electricity production with
renewable sources of energy and are exploring options for greater integration into the
European electricity grid. Staff welcomed steps to reduce cross subsidization of
electricity prices and the replacement of remaining cross-subsidies with direct budget
subsidies.

18

Box 2. How Flexible are Nominal Wages in Montenegro?
In 2009, nominal gross wages declined in sectors strongly affected by the downturn. The very high
growth of wages in the preceding period suggests that the correction of wages may take some more time.
In fact, several neighboring economies with pegged exchange rates and at a more advanced stage in the
business cycle have registered larger nominal wage drops than in Montenegro. In economies with more
flexible exchange rate arrangements, the benefit of the wage declines on competitiveness has been
reinforced by exchange rate depreciations.

Tackling the mining and minerals sector. A recent agreement between KAP’s
owners and the government aims to address serious debt and overstaffing problems to
help the company return to profitability. It comprises a social package (mainly
incentivized voluntary early retirement) for cutting employment by half, an electricity
subsidy (negatively related with the aluminum price) and state guarantees for old and
new bank credits. Staff welcomed the commitment to transparently account for all
subsidies and guarantees in the budget. However, given the magnitude of the subsidy
(¾–1 percent of GDP) and the large fiscal risks (4½ percent of GDP) from state
guarantees, staff has urged the authorities to carefully assess KAP’s longer-term
viability and the costs/benefits of continued subsidization.



Cutting red tape, particularly at the municipal level. The authorities explained that
despite progress, infrastructure bottlenecks remained an issue, especially in the area
of transportation, water supply and waste management. Significant progress had also
been made in finalizing land use regulations at the municipal level. Staff welcomed
plans to set up a Council for the Elimination of Business Barriers and address redtape issues in the law on foreign investment, and also encouraged the authorities to
continue with their efforts to redress perceived weaknesses in corruption, building on
Montenegro’s favorable international ranking in relevant surveys. Progress in
Montenegro’s EU candidacy will also be important.

19
22.
There was agreement that a regular and transparent flow of high quality
macroeconomic information is a prerequisite for policy-making, transparency,
accountability, and informed public debate on economic policy. Areas for future action
include (i) national accounts statistics (currently incomplete and released only with long
delays); (ii) expenditure deflators and quarterly national accounts (currently unavailable);
(iii) international trade statistics (where exports may be systematically under-recorded);
(iv) the compilation of IIP statistics; and (v) making more detailed high-frequency
information on the budget publicly available.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
With the right policies in place, the economy of Montenegro should be able to
recover from the sharp recession in 2009. In 2010, imbalances are expected to continue to
unwind and in the context of a still fragile external environment, GDP is projected to contract
again (by a more modest 2 percent). But with good policies, growth should rebound in 2011
and could average some 4 percent in the medium term. However, while there is a substantial
upside from Montenegro’s large untapped growth potential, it cannot be taken for granted.
24.
The immediate policy challenge is to manage the still needed balance sheet
corrections. In addition, sustained efforts are required to further strengthen the banking
system, to make public finances more sustainable, and to undertake growth-enhancing
structural reforms, especially in the labor and product markets.
25.
Domestic savings need to increase and competitiveness must improve. Higher
savings, from both the government and from the private sector, are needed to cut the current
account deficit to sustainable levels. While the adjustment has already begun, it needs to be
supplemented by export expansion and import substitution. Improved competitiveness will
be crucial if Montenegro is to take advantage of the projected global recovery. With
euroization precluding adjustment of the nominal exchange rate, competitiveness gains
depend upon cutting costs and raising productivity.
26.
The financial sector must remain subject to close and effective supervision. A
sustainable resumption of financial intermediation calls for large capital buffers and a more
effective framework to swiftly deal with problem banks in distress. The authorities have
acted promptly to tackle problems in the banking system. Yet their effectiveness would be
further strengthened by the expeditious adoption of new legislation on banks and bankruptcy
in accordance with international best practice, and a revised Central Bank Law. Existing
central bank interventions in weaker banks need to remain in force and be tightened as
appropriate, while the implementation of recent counter-cyclical regulatory changes needs to
be carefully monitored and kept under constant review. The Investment Development Fund
should be prudent in expanding its operations and be brought under central bank supervision.
27.
Public finances should be tightened for a number of reasons. The fiscal borrowing
requirement must be aligned with available financing. Euroization leaves fiscal tightening as
one of the few remaining tools available to support the required improvement in

20
Montenegro’s competitiveness. Additional fiscal reserves are required to safeguard financial
stability. Finally, the experience of 2009 underscores the importance of building up fiscal
space that could be used the next time adverse external shocks hit the economy.
28.
To meet these challenges, fiscal adjustment efforts need to be sustained and
placed in a medium-term perspective. The downturn revealed a large structural fiscal
deficit which could not be clawed back in a single year. The authorities have appropriately
adopted a medium-term fiscal framework, targeting a balanced budget by 2012. The time has
now come to articulate the required policies. In this context, the inconsistency between the
relatively high level of public expenditure and relatively low tax rates needs to be urgently
resolved. The adjustment to the current account already underway implies that revenues from
import-related taxes will remain below the levels seen during the boom. The loss must be
made up from expenditure cuts or other revenue sources, and a reconsideration of past tax
cuts should therefore be on the agenda. Beyond taxation, the budget has an important role to
play in boosting competitiveness by alleviating pressures on wages and reducing distortions,
including from extensive transfer programs, which could be better targeted. Finally, prudence
is called in issuing state guarantees and there is need for a proactive approach towards the
large unfunded longer-term pension liabilities.
29.
Additional labor market deregulation would be helpful. The new labor law
addressed some shortcomings, but others remain and would best be redressed by allowing
opt-out clauses from collective bargaining arrangements; easing rules on labor redundancies;
and reducing disincentives to hiring. Given the need for adjustment in the public services, a
separate public sector collective bargaining agreement could be useful.
30.
There is also a need to improve the business environment further. Tackling red
tape, especially at the municipal level, and infrastructure bottlenecks are important, as is
redressing perceived weaknesses regarding corruption. Progress in Montenegro’s EU
candidacy will also be important.
31.
Weaknesses in economic statistics hamper economic analysis and policy.
Notwithstanding notable progress, annual national accounts remain weak and appear with
long delays, quarterly national accounts are not compiled, the external accounts are weak,
and high frequency indicators have serious gaps.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Regional Experiences with Recent Deposit Withdrawals and Credit
Contraction1
The sharp reductions in both deposits and credit to the private sector seen in Montenegro in
the last 1–1½ years stand out in a regional comparison. The decline in deposits has been,
moreover, much more prolonged than in most other countries. These recent negative
developments are the mirror image of developments during the boom years.
The sharp reduction in deposits seen in Montenegro stands out even in a regional
comparison. In the period from August 2008, just as the current global crises took off, until
October 2009 declining deposits were observed in a number of South Eastern, Eastern and
Central European countries, but the drop was by far the sharpest in Montenegro. Only two
other countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Latvia) witnessed declines in the double digits;
and on an unweighted average basis, the other countries registered a slight increase in
deposits of about ½ percent.2
Another important difference compared to most of the countries is that the bottom was
reached much later. While the median country saw a rebound already in late 2008, deposits
continued to decline through April 2009 in Montenegro.
The adverse deposit developments were reflected in credit to the private sector. Looking
at the same period, the decline in credit was the sharpest in Montenegro, although the
difference in percentage points to other countries is less. Only three other countries (Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Estonia, and Lithuania) actually registered a decline, and the unweighted
average for all the countries was an increase of credit by about 7½ percent. The general
picture is not altered when looking at slightly different time periods.
These negative developments in the past 1–1½ years in Montenegro are the mirror
image of developments during the boom years. While deposit growth and credit expansion
in 2003–07 were very fast in most countries, they were significantly faster in Montenegro
where both deposit and credit expanded by more than 50 percentage points of GDP.
However, it is worth noting that the link between credit and deposit growth follows a similar
pattern as in other countries. All countries saw higher, or, in some cases, much higher credit
growth than deposit growth.

A country comparison suggests that the exchange rate regime has had an impact on
deposits and credit. While many factors affect deposits and credit, there are clear-cut
similarities in the recent deposit and credit development for countries with the same
exchange rate regime classification.3 Countries with an independent float (Albania, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland) or managed float (Romania, Serbia) had notably higher growth
in both deposits and credit, than countries with a peg (Croatia, Latvia, Macedonia) or a
currency board (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania).4 While
Montenegro’s experience follows a similar—though more pronounced—pattern to the one in
the latter groups, the experience of Kosovo, the other country using the euro is quite
different.
The extent of current account deficits in the years before the global crises also seems to
have had an effect. The five countries with the largest current account deficits on average
in 2003–07 (Latvia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, and Estonia)5 have
subsequently since the beginning of the crisis had the weakest growth in both deposits and
credit.

For countries with an independent or managed float, this is more than just the valuation effect on the level of
foreign currency deposits and credit from changes in the exchange rate. Looking only at domestic currency
deposits it is still the case that countries with more flexible regimes have seen increases in deposits, and even
when total deposits are calculated at a constant exchange rate, there has still been an increase.
5

Extending the sample to 2003–08 does not change the country composition.

38
The policy responses have naturally varied across countries, but there are some
common themes.


Most, if not all, countries increased the ceiling for insured deposits or publicly
guaranteed that deposits would be safe. In Montenegro, a temporary blanket
guarantee was issued in late 2008.



In many cases, including Montenegro, parent banks abroad provided funding, or at
least committed to support their subsidiaries and not to leave.



Several countries also lowered reserve requirements, including e.g. Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Lithuania, and Serbia, as well as Montenegro.



Countries with a more flexible exchange rate regime could more easily respond by
simply increasing the amount of available liquidity. This was the case in e.g. Albania
and Serbia.

39
Annex II. Estimates of Potential Growth and Output Gap in Montenegro1
The GDP contraction in 2009 appears to have practically eliminated the accumulated
overshooting during the past few years of strong growth. A small negative output gap is
projected to emerge in 2010–11 and to close in the following years. There is considerable
uncertainty surrounding the estimates as the rapid transformation and small size of the
economy as well as a weak statistical base pose serious challenges in assessing potential
growth and economic slack in Montenegro.
GDP growth in Montenegro has been very volatile, imparting considerable uncertainty
in disentangling the cyclical component of growth. The recovery of economic activity
from its very depressed levels in the 1990s, the massive structural changes during the past
decade, and the strong post-independence boom (which was exacerbated by the global real
estate boom) make it difficult to accurately estimate potential growth and the cyclical
component of GDP, especially in real time. Crude calculations suggest that in 2008 real GDP
returned to its 1990 level (Figure 1). But notwithstanding some difficult legacies (notably the
aluminum complex KAP), the profile of the country and its potential are now very different
from what they were only five years ago. This weakens the relevance of distant history (and
long statistical series) for prediction. Ocular inspection of the data suggests that the average
growth rate has increased from 2½ percent in 1999–2003 to about 4 percent since then. These
rates represent a good first approximation of potential growth in these two periods.

Growth projections are indispensable for assessing potential growth and the output
gap. They are needed to mitigate the end-of-sample problem in estimating HP filters and
help incorporate important nonsample information in the estimations. The GDP projections
below are based on the production function approach and the following assumptions:




investment will recover, after a brief slump, to its pre-recession level (Montenegro
has untapped potential in tourism, energy and transportation);
labor force participation (which is currently low by international standards) is
expected to increase, partly due to the substitution of domestic for foreign labor;2
TFP growth should pick up due to cyclical and temporary factors (e.g. higher capacity
utilization in recently completed investments).

To better measure the impact of (i) the massive drop in the number of foreign workers in 2009 and, at the
same time, (ii) the tendency to have longer contracts following the rise in the fixed cost of employing
foreigners, foreign employment is estimated in effective terms. A similar adjustment is made in domestic
employment to capture circumstantial evidence that an increasing number of domestic workers have been asked
to take unpaid leave or work shorter hours.

41
The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP) is ill-suited for estimating potential output in small
economies experiencing large transitory shocks (vast FDI inflows, fast financial
deepening etc). The problem is that HP (i) imposes a smoothness constraint on potential
GDP, an untenable assumption for small economies where the law of large numbers does not
work and even a single large project could radically change the course of the economy, and
(ii) is not designed to filter out middle-frequency transitory shocks—such as a protracted FDI
boom—that may well not be correlated with the business cycle.
These shortcomings introduce bias in potential growth estimates. First, the estimates for
the early 2000s are biased upwards by high GDP growth rates in the subsequent years. These
potential growth estimates remain high even after extending the GDP series backwards
(using Vuketic’s estimates for pre-2000 GDP) to minimize sample-end problems. The
reduction of the smoothness parameter (λ) from 100 to 20 mitigates but does not eliminate
the problem of high potential growth estimates in the early 2000s. A second problem with the
HP estimates for Montenegro is that they imply that the economy was operating at potential
in 2006 despite strong evidence (large current account deficit and high inflationary pressures)
that in that year GDP was clearly above potential. This biases downwards the output gap for
a number of years.

The HP filter suggests:


The weakening of potential growth during the 2009–10 downturn and also in the
medium-term. The weakening (but also the volatility of potential growth) is more
pronounced when the smoothness parameter (λ) is set at 20. Looking forward,
potential growth recovers to 4 percent and is consistent with the output gap closing
by 2015.
The elimination of the output gap in 2009 and the opening of a significant
negative gap of -4 ½ percent in 2010 that is gradually eliminated by 2015.



The regime switching methodology (RS) is more suitable for estimating potential
growth in Montenegro. This approach replaces the smoothness constraint with the
assumption that the economy alternates over time between a number of states, say “low
growth” and “high growth.” The states of nature cannot be observed directly. Observables
are actual GDP growth (which is a noisy indicator of the underlying growth rate) and other
ancillary indicators. These can be used to estimate the probability of being in any given state
and transition probabilities of moving across states. The short sample period precludes a
meaningful formal estimation of such probabilities, but circumstantial evidence suggests that
the switch from low to high growth (driven by massive FDI inflows and financial deepening)
occurred around 2006. As a first approximation, potential growth is set at 2.5 percent for the
period before 2006 (the average growth rate in 1999–2005) and 4 percent since (the average
growth calculated with the production function approach). An open question (that can only
be answered in probabilistic terms and, with confidence, only after a few years) is whether
the GDP contraction in 2009–10 represents a switch to the low growth regime or a tail (low
probability) event in the high growth regime.3 Given the projected short duration of the
downturn in the staff projections, it would not be unreasonable to assume that the economy
remains in the high growth regime.
The RS methodology suggests:




3

A constant potential growth. The higher actual than potential growth over the
medium term (2012–15) ensures that the output gap is closed by the end of the
projection period.
A positive output gap of 3 percent in 2009 and a narrower, compared to the HP
methodology, negative gap of 2½ percent in 2010. The difference mirrors HP’s
overestimation of potential GDP in 2006. Correspondingly, RS suggests the widening
of the positive output gap in 2008 to 15 percent, compared to 10 percent in the case of
the HP filter.

The first case implies that the current recession has no permanent impact on GDP and, eventually, the
economy evolves along the pre-recession growth path. The second case, on the other hand, implies a downward
shift in the growth path and, hence, a permanent output loss.

There is a subtle difference between the HP and RS estimates of potential GDP. The
former suggests that the recession will cause a permanent GDP loss, which is reflected in the
downward shift of trend GDP. The latter implies no output losses, as trend GDP remains
unchanged.
A key question with important policy ramifications concerns the most appropriate
estimate of potential GDP for calculating the structural fiscal balance. The preceding
analysis suggests that in the near term RS has the advantage of being less affected by
transitory shocks. In the medium term, however, both methodologies suggest roughly the
same level of potential GDP and a zero output gap and, as a result, lead to the same mediumterm assessment of the structural fiscal balance.

Annex III. Estimating the Structural Fiscal Balance in Montenegro1
Alternative methodologies are used to estimate the structural fiscal balance in Montenegro.
While the estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty and handicapped by short time
series and data quality problems, they all point to the presence of a large structural deficit
which in turn reflects the fundamental inconsistency between low tax rates and a large size of
the government.
A. Background
The fiscal balance is subject to a multitude of transitory factors that complicate the
assessment of the structural fiscal position. There are three broad groups of factors that
create a wedge between the actual and the structural balance: cyclical, transitory and
accounting. The business cycle is positively related with revenue and negatively with some
expenditure, and these automatic stabilizers result in a more favorable fiscal position during
periods of strong economic performance. Transitory factors (for example, asset booms and
one-off events) and accounting practices (for example, the treatment of arrears and
contingent liabilities) can also distort the underlying fiscal situation. The conventional
approach is to calculate the structural balance by subtracting the impact of these factors from
the headline balance using the output gap as a proxy for the cyclical position.
A complication in the case of Montenegro is that the output gap is subject to significant
uncertainty and is not a sufficient statistic of the cyclical position of the economy
(Annex 2). Separating the cycle from the trend is complicated in transition economies, which
are subject to low frequency (permanent) shocks, and this complication is compounded by
the lack of observations for a full business cycle and the elevated uncertainty surrounding
real time estimates of the output gap. In addition, the output gap does not capture adequately
the imbalances in the economy and in particular, the excess of spending over production.
In 2009 the output gap was practically closed which, other things being equal, would imply
that the structural and actual fiscal balances coincide. At the same time, imports (and
consumption and indirect taxes) remained well above their “normal” level suggesting a large
cyclical component. Thus, using the output gap as the only proxy for the cycle distorts the
cyclical component of the fiscal balance.
This annex constructs alternative estimates of the structural fiscal balance. In addition to
the standard methodology, which is based solely on the output gap, an augmented
methodology is presented that uses two gaps: the gap between actual and “normal” imports
as a proxy for the transitory component of the tax base for indirect taxes (mainly VAT) and

46
the output gap for the rest items in the budget.2 Moreover, alternative output gap estimates
are used to gauge the robustness of the structural balance. The next section discusses the
standard approach, section C, discuses the augmented methodology and section D concludes
with a sensitivity analysis.
B. The Standard Approach of Estimating the Structural Fiscal Balance
The standard approach uses the output gap to eliminate the cyclical component from
revenues and expenditure. While the relationship between revenues and the economic cycle
is fairly straightforward, it is not the same in the case of expenditures.




When the economy is growing, profits and income tax are up. Moreover, strong
consumption boosts revenue from VAT and excise taxes; it also boosts imports and
taxes related to international trade. If there is a real estate boom, real estate taxes and
property taxes also rise above their normal level.
The relationship of expenditures with the business cycle is not clear cut. The typical
correction used in Fund analyses is applied to unemployment benefits (see
Hagemann, 1999). If this is the case, expenditures will be corrected by the ratio
between actual and natural (NAIRU)3 unemployment rate. Although Montenegro has
some expenditures linked to employment, these are negligible compared to total
expenditures.4 Therefore, this analysis considers all expenditures to be structural in
nature, obviating the need for cyclical adjustments to expenditure.

Transitory shocks and measures need to be excluded from the structural balance.
Though potentially controversial, this adjustment is in line with the consensus in the
literature. The European Commission, for example, has established guidelines to limit
discretion in the calculation of one-off adjustments (EC, 2006). According to these
guidelines, to be considered as one-off, a measure must: (i) have a significant impact in the
budget (at least 0.1 percent of GDP), (ii) have a limited temporary impact and (iii) be
nonrecurrent. In Montenegro, the €44 million loan to Prva bank—that was included as
budgetary net lending in 2008, and reversed in 2009—is considered to be one-off.

2

This is somewhat related to a Keynesian view of the economy where output could move for long periods
driven by demand fluctuations that work on top of the neoclassical factors stressed in the production-function
determination of potential output (Scacciavillani & Swagel (2002) discuss this issue). The analysis here allows
for the fact that demand pressures affect various taxes differently.

Nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, defined as the unemployment rate consistent with full
employment general equilibrium.
4

Transfers related to the employment fund are only 4% of total transfers.

47
The standard approach to estimating the structural balance requires estimation of the
output gap and the elasticity of revenues and expenditures with respect to the output
gap. Starting point is the definition of the structural balance
(1) BS = RS – E
where BS and RS denote respectively the structural balance and revenues and E stands for
expenditures net of one-off items. The structural revenues are defined as:5


Y 
(2) RS   P  R
Y 

where Y and YP denote actual and potential output, R stands for total revenues and  is the
elasticity of revenue with respect to the output gap. Using (2) in (1) and, expressing all terms
as a percent of potential output:6


BS  YP 
(3)
 
YP  Y 

R E
  

Subtracting interest payments, the primary structural balance is:

The fiscal impulse (a measure of the impact of the budget to aggregate demand) is then
defined as the change in the structural primary balance:
 PBS PBS

(5) FI  

(t  1)
YP
 YP


The elasticity of revenues with respect to output is close to unity. While annual data
since 2001 and 2006 weights suggest an elasticity of 1.12, this is essentially because of the
import boom. Since this is adjusted for separately, a unitary elasticity with respect to
potential output is subsequently assumed. In view of this and to avoid unnecessary
complications, the ensuing calculations assume unit elasticity.

5

To simplify, lagged effects of the cyclical output gap on the budget (see Hagemann, op. cit. for a complete
version of the model) are not included.

6

For a discussion of the appropriate scaling variable, see Fedelino, et al. (2009)

48
Given the uncertainty surrounding the measurement of potential output, alternative
estimates are used in the calculations. As discussed in Annex 2, the popular HodrickPrescott filter is not reliable for economies that are taking off after a long period of
stagnation. For completeness it is used in the calculations, but greater reliance is given in a
simple regime-switching model that postulates two states, a “low growth” and a “high
growth” state.
The standard methodology suggests a sudden deterioration of the structural balance
in 2008, largely caused by an increase in expenditures. The calculations show a significant
deterioration in the structural balance during the economic boom. A period of structural
surpluses ended in 2008. This is basically explained by the sharp increase in recurrent
expenditures, in particular, wages and pensions, and cuts in income tax rates and
contributions to the pension and health funds.

The standard methodology of estimating the structural balance could have important
shortcomings when applied to episodes characterized by an absorption boom. As
noticed in IMF (2007), during absorption booms, domestic demand grows much faster than
production, resulting in temporary import and current account deficit surges and an
associated revenue windfall, especially from indirect taxes related to consumption (VAT and
excise) and imports (tariffs and duties). This effect is not correctly captured with the standard
methodology that adjusts only for the output gap and not for the external imbalance, which is
underlying the absorption boom.
This shortcoming is especially relevant for Montenegro where almost two thirds of total
revenues come from indirect taxes, and where the economic boom was led by runaway
absorption. During the boom years 2006–07 VAT grew at 40 percent annually, reflecting
surging consumption and domestic demand, as absorption on average rose to 130 percent of
GDP (2006–08) from some 100 percent of GDP in the previous period.

C. An Augmented Methodology of Estimating the Structural Fiscal Balance
A more refined methodology of estimating the structural fiscal balance considers
separately the effects of internal and external imbalances. For this, total revenues are split
between indirect taxes and other revenues. Structural indirect taxes are related to the
deviation of actual imports from normal imports while other structural revenues are
explained by the output gap:
(6) R = RI + RD
(7) RS = RIS + RDS
1

M 
(8) RIS   P  RI
 M 
2

Y 
(9) RDS   P  RD
Y 

where RI are indirect taxes, RD are other revenues, M are imports, MP is “normal” level of
imports and 1 and 2 are income elasticities of indirect and other taxes, respectively.
Implementing this methodology poses the challenge to estimate the “normal” level of
imports. Imports soared in the past few years as a result of the demand-led boom and the
opening up of the country. The short observation period and the confluence of these two
shocks make it difficult to identify statistically the trend from the temporary effect. This will
be possible with confidence only when the transitory effects unwind. However, using as a
benchmark the experience of other countries one can assume that “normal” imports will
permanently increase and then taper off.7
7

An alternative approach used in IMF (2007) adjusts for the absorption gap that is defined as the difference
between the actual current account balance and the current account norm. However, this imposes the additional

The augmented methodology results in a larger structural fiscal deterioration. The
structural fiscal balance in percent of potential GDP is now given by:

The calculations, based on unit elasticities, imply a higher structural fiscal deficit than in the
standard approach; and a structural deficit for several years, even during years in which the
standard approach suggests a structural surplus. The deficits are more consistent with the
fiscal relaxation that hit a peak with the 2008 stimulus package.

D. Sensitivity Analysis
As described, the calculation of the
structural fiscal balance involves a
considerable degree of uncertainty. The
methods presented here are basically
restricted by Montenegro’s limited data
availability (partly reflecting its short
history as an independent country). In the
future, when the history gets longer and
statistical quality improves, other
estimation methods may be implemented
and the precision of the measures may
improve. In the meantime, and to give an
idea of the range of the estimations, the

challenge of identifying the current account norm, estimates of which tend to be heavily sensitive to identifying
assumptions. Moreover, in Montenegro, current account data have in the past been significantly revised,
imparting an additional uncertainty. The proposed adjusted based on imports steers largely clear of these
uncertainties.

Annex IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Coverage
This debt sustainability analysis includes gross public debt that is recognized by the
authorities and covers the general government.2


Liabilities related to restitution are included. In 2004, the government issued a Law to
tackle the problem of restitution of property seized or expropriated by the former
communist government. Article 22 limits the annual payments under this program to
0.5 percent of GDP and the stock of total obligations potentially recognized to
10 percent of GDP. In 2009, the stock of liabilities of this program was €100 million
and the legal medium term cap €400 million.



In 2009 the remaining stock of arrears with pensioners was €48.5 million.



Under the legal framework, the government is to compensate savers whose savings
were confiscated during the Milosevic government. The total amount for this
obligation (old foreign exchange savings) is now €108 million.



Debt of municipal governments is estimated at €62 million.



On the external side, negotiations related to debt inherited from the former
Yugoslavia continue. These disputed obligations include credits from the
governments of Libya, Kuwait, Czech Republic and Slovakia and API bonds issued
within the London Club during the restructuring of debt and owned by UBS bank.
According to estimation of the Montenegrin Ministry of Finance the total amount of
these unresolved obligations could reach 1 percent of GDP.



Debt from public enterprises is not included in this analysis as they are not part of the
general government. At the end of 2009 total debt of public companies was
€130 million or 4.4 percent of GDP.



As of December 2009 deposits of the Ministry of Finance were €151.9 million
(including gold’s valuation of €29.6 million) and deposits of funds3 were
€44.9 million which brings the net debt to 32.1 percent of GDP.

The actual coverage includes spending units under the Montenegrin republican budget, social funds
(employment, health and pensions) and local governments.

Results
Under the baseline scenario which reflects authorities’ fiscal plans and measures, the gross
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 56 percent of GDP in 2014. Although the baseline
scenario is based on authorities’ medium term fiscal plan that virtually freezes public
expenditures to the level of 2009, the debt stock is shifted by compensation liabilities that are
projected—in line with the debt dynamics published by the Ministry of Finance4—to reach
10 percent of GDP. Also, the scenario assumes the repayment of the remaining obligations to
pensioners by 2011 and a substantive reduction in obligations related to old foreign currency
savings, as around €14 million would be paid annually.
The financing requirement continues to grow as most of new credits will have short
maturities. Interest expenditures are projected to reach some 3 percent of GDP as nonmarket
debt is replaced by market debt. Privatization proceeds are expected to decline and gradually
tend to zero.
The standard stress tests were performed using the methodology adopted in July 2005
(Information Note on Modifications to the Fund’s Debt Sustainability Assessment
Framework for Market Access Countries http://imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2005/070105.htm)
but with modifications due to data constraints. They exacerbate the near-term baseline trend
of increasing debt. The stress tests also show that the public debt path is particularly sensitive
to growth shocks and contingent liabilities.

Montenegro has accepted the obligations under Article VIII. Montenegro maintains two
exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. The first restriction
arises because non-residents of Montenegro are not permitted to freely transfer abroad any
balances that could represent the proceeds of current international transactions that were
maintained in frozen accounts and deposited not earlier than six months before the accounts
had been frozen. The second restriction arises because the authorities have yet to notify the
IMF (in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)) of those UN
resolutions to which it gives effect in its domestic law and which would give rise to an
exchange restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.”

Annex II: Statistical Issues
(As of February 26, 2010)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in national accounts and balance of payments. While the
quality and timeliness of data reporting vary across sectors, international reporting
standards have been adopted for monetary and balance of payments statistics. Reporting
of fiscal data has improved but coverage is limited. The quality of the labor and wage
indicators is relatively good but there is little information on foreign employment. The
business register is being expanded and a general census is scheduled for 2011.
The authorities have created a statistical council to coordinate efforts to improve data
quality. These efforts need to focus on developing comprehensive source data for
national accounts, improving concepts and classification of government finance statistics,
strengthening the coverage of balance of payments transactions, and introducing sound
classifications in compiling monetary and financial statistics.
National Accounts: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles real
sector data. MONSTAT has started to adopt the 1993 System of National Accounts as a
framework for compiling national accounts estimates. However, the scope of the
accounts is limited to compiling the annual production account in current and in previous
year prices. The accuracy of the data sources needs to be improved and breaks in the time
series eliminated by revising historic data. Business statistics are still following the
material system product concepts, collecting data mainly on quantities produced. The
national accounts estimates depend solely on bookkeeping data. The coverage of the
informal sector is not exhaustive. On the expenditure side, there are no data on changes in
inventories and the quality of investment and merchandise trade data is unsatisfactory.
MONSTAT switched from general to specific trade statistics in an effort to better capture
imports; however, there are indications that exports might be seriously under-recorded,
resulting in a corresponding under-estimation of GDP. National accounts data are also
undermined by the lack of sound techniques to account for nonobserved activities. Some
work has been done on measuring informal activity in construction, retail trade, hotels
and restaurants, but a more comprehensive approach needs to be developed. Statistical
techniques for deriving volume measures of GDP are constrained by the lack of suitable
price and volume indices.
Preparations are advancing for the compilation of quarterly national accounts.
Price statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates monthly consumer and producer
price indices, which broadly follow international standards. However, in both indices, the
“carry-forward” technique for treatment of seasonal goods, new goods, and missing items

5
are used, resulting in downward bias New consumer price indices, monitoring more items
and with a broader geographic coverage, started to be compiled in 2010 and the EU
harmonized consumer price indices are scheduled to be released in 2011.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) based on a new GFS institutional classification, and since early 2006, include data
for the social security funds and local governments. The chart of accounts introduced in
2001 has been implemented at the local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting
suffers from frequent re-classifications, especially at all levels of local government and
social funds. The MOF has established a unit responsible for data collection for stateowned enterprises (SOE), but a satisfactory compilation of the public sector fiscal
balance requires significant further effort. Data on enterprises owned by municipalities
are rarely available. Data on the stock of local government arrears need to be
strengthened.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank
of Montenegro (CBM), broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and
valuation methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).
Dissemination practices meet the recommendations of the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly
Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and
surveys for the CBM and the commercial banks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBM. The
external sector statistics have benefited from improvements undertaken by MONSTAT to
improve coverage, valuation, and classification of merchandise trade statistics.
Merchandise trade debits (imports) are valued at CIF, rather than FOB prices. Data on
imports and exports in the BOP are based on the general trade system. There is evidence
that general trade imports are seriously under recorded, prompting MONSTAT to switch
from general to special trade statistics in the national accounts. There are also indications
that exports are underestimated, an issue MONSTAT is currently investigating. In the
meantime, there is an inconsistency between balance of payments statistics, which are
based on general trade data, and national accounts, which are based on special trade data.
The CBM has not developed acceptable methodology to estimate the value of insurance
and freight on imports, which should be deducted from the CIF value.
Weaknesses remain, due primarily to the paucity of source data and the shortage of staff
to undertake the data collection and compilation processes. The CBM has made progress
in improving the recording of transactions in the ITRS by refining the transactions coding
system and increasing interaction with the commercial banks; however, the ITRS remains
inadequate for recording a broad range of balance of payments transactions such as

6
reinvested earnings and trade credits. Further, the ITRS records transactions on a cash
basis, whereas balance of payments transactions should be recorded on an accruals basis.
The CBM still needs to undertake a small number of direct surveys of enterprises to
supplement the data received through the ITRS, and prepare comprehensive
documentation on compilation methods and data sources.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Montenegro does not participate in the
No data ROSC is available.
GDDS
C. Reporting to STA
A page for Montenegro in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was introduced in the
March 2007 issue.
Montenegro does not report government finance statistics for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or IFS.
The CBM does not yet report monetary data in the format of Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). To avoid duplication of effort, the CBM will need to decide whether to adopt the
European Central Bank’s framework for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary
data or the STA-developed SRFs, either of which will provide monetary data that accord
with international standards.

Annex III: Relations with the World Bank Group
Montenegro declared independence in mid-2006, joining the World Bank Group and IMF
about half a year later in January 2007. However, even under the umbrella of the state
union of Serbia and Montenegro, the Bank had effectively established a functional
relationship with Montenegro.
World Bank Group Strategy
On June 12, 2007, the Bank’s Board endorsed a joint World Bank-IFC Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Montenegro, covering FY07–10, to support the
government in reaching its overarching objective of eventual EU membership, with
projects and support to (i) enhance sustainable economic growth, through increasing
economic freedoms and strengthening the role of the private sector; (ii) build institutions
and strengthen the rule of law; and (iii) improve the standard of living of citizens, through
efficient education, health and social protection systems. The CPS Progress Report was
presented to the Bank’s Board in early 2009.
Cooperation with the IMF has been strong, particularly the areas of macroeconomic and
financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams have closely coordinated comments on a
set of (organic) financial sector laws, scheduled to be presented to parliament in early
2010. The World Bank Group, through its ongoing and planned operations, as well its
complementary economic and sector work, will continue to provide input on issues such
as (i) labor market reforms; (ii) energy sector reforms; (iii) public expenditure, pension,
and health reforms, and (iv) an appropriate framework to regulate concession
arrangements and potential public/private partnerships, with a view to encouraging
investment in a way that would ensure that the government does not accumulate
significant contingent liabilities. The Fund is part of the review process for the third
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), scheduled to be published in late
2010.
Total outstanding debt of Montenegro towards the various part of the Bank, as of
February 22, 2010, was US$323.1 million (of which US$76.5 million for IDA). In 2007,
the government prepaid €60 million.
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
The lending program is on track. As of January 2010, the portfolio had seven active
IBRD and IDA projects, totaling US$80.5 million, with the total lending envelope
staying within the envisaged CPS envelope of US$70–90 million (see table below). Of
those, four new projects in energy, energy efficiency, land administration, and
agriculture, together with one additional financing in health, were delivered during the
current CPS period up until end-January 2010. In addition, a US$2.6 million GEF

9
program supporting the environmental management of Lake Skadar/Shkodër was
approved in FY08. During the current CPS period, an FY02 energy project was closed in
FY07, together with an FY05 education project and an FY07 sustainable tourism project,
which both closed in FY10.

In line with CPS expectations, Bank non-lending assistance has provided policy advice
on key fiscal and economic challenges. An FY07 Debt Sustainability Analysis assessed
country debt under different reform and growth scenarios. The FY07 Report on
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) analyzed financial auditing and reporting
standards against EU requirements, and recommended reforms integrated into a financial
reporting strategy and a law on accounting and auditing (the current law on accounting
and auditing was amended in late 2008 to achieve partial harmonization with EU
legislation). In the area of financial reporting, Montenegro participates in the REPARIS
Program, seen as an essential instrument for ensuring that reforms are undertaken that are
consistent with the acquis communautaire and help to pave the way for the eventual
negotiation of EU membership. The FY09 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
(PEIR) and Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA)
analyzed fiscal and economic risks and provided related policy advice; a follow-up PEIR,
to be published in FY11, is currently being prepared. An FY08 Poverty Update and an
FY10 Crisis Response Survey have helped to build capacity in poverty analysis and
monitoring.
A joint assessment of Montenegro’s business environment was conducted in late 2007 by
IFC, MIGA, and the World Bank. With support of the World Bank’s Global Road Safety
Facility (GRSF), an assessment of Montenegro’s capacity in road safety management was

10
undertaken with a view to addressing high rates of accidents and motor vehicle fatalities,
while the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) is assisting the
Podgorica and its Water and Sewer Company in their plans to upgrade and expand the
water and waste water services, possibly with private-sector participation. In FY08, the
Swiss Consultant Trust Fund supported an assessment of the University of Montenegro’s
progress on quality assurance measures and education standards under the Bologna
European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), as well as a clinic on ECTS
requirements. In FY09 and FY10, grant assistance from the Financial Sector Reform and
Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) provided support to assess banking sector risks and
update the regulatory framework for banking supervision according to international
standards.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
As of December 31, 2008, commitments by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
totaled $US25.6 million. IFC invested €10 million in the Mall of Montenegro to support
the development of a mixed-use shopping mall in Podgorica. This public-private
partnership between a Turkish sponsor and the Municipality of Podgorica will introduce
new retail standards and best practices, provide a model for local investors and property
developers, and help catalyze foreign investment and private-public partnerships in
service delivery. In addition, IFC has invested about US$190 million in regional projects
to support micro and small businesses, the development of commercial property, landfill
and waste management, and equity investments in Southeast Europe including in
Montenegro.
With respect to advisory services, IFC is taking a leading role in helping the Government
to restructure the energy sector and has entered into an advisory mandate for the Morača
river hydro-power generation projects. IFC is also advising the Government on one of its
largest transport investments, the Bar–Boljare highway. IFC supported implementation of
a sub-national competitiveness project in three pilot municipalities (Bar, Bijelo Polje, and
Nikšić) to streamline business regulations and increase their transparency. IFC also
worked with the Ministry of Justice to support the opening of a second Mediation Center
in Podgorica. As part of this activity, judges were trained in mediation, and 110 cases
with legal claims totaling €4.5 million have been successfully resolved. The Balkan Hotel
Market Access Program is active and contributing to opening Montenegro to the lucrative
independent travelers’ market. Finally, IFC participated in a joint mini-diagnostic of
Montenegro’s investment climate focusing on tourism and potential synergies with
upstream activities. Officials subsequently approved an action plan, which is being
implemented.
Through its PEPSE infrastructure program, IFC will continue to provide advisory
services to the Government to structure and execute PPPs in the power and transport

11
sectors. In addition, IFC will consider supporting infrastructure projects through debt and
equity financing. In tourism, IFC will continue its efforts to support private investors
through financing and advisory services as well as invest in tourism-related infrastructure
and ecologically sustainable projects. IFC will continue to look for opportunities to
support small and medium enterprises through loans to local banks or selective
investments in well-performing local companies. As in other countries in the region, IFC
will bring an array of advisory services, such as its International Standards, Alternative
Dispute Resolution, and Municipal Simplification
Programs, all subject to adequate donor funding.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Montenegro
On April 28, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Montenegro.1
Background
Montenegro has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. Contagion and concerns about the
robustness of the banking system have triggered large deposit withdrawals and a credit
crunch. Moreover, the unwinding of the real estate boom has generated strong negative
wealth effects that depressed demand. Finally, adverse terms of trade shocks have strained
the industrial sector. As a result, GDP contracted sharply in 2009 and unemployment inched
up. Meanwhile, upward pressures on wages and inflation have eased.
The economic contraction has been contributing to the restoration of internal and external
balance, but it has also revealed an underlying fiscal deficit. The heretofore sizeable positive
output gap has practically been eliminated and the sharp drop of imports has halved the very
high external current account deficit. On the other hand, fiscal revenue plummeted revealing a
substantial fiscal deficit that reflects the fundamental inconsistency between low tax rates and
the large size of the public sector. Public debt has reached 38.8 percent of GDP and could rise
further due to unfavorable debt dynamics, uncertain contingent liabilities, and population aging.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The authorities have taken wide-ranging measures to stabilize the financial system and
rekindle lending activity. These included a blanket deposit guarantee; early repayment of
government loans; emergency liquidity support and the placement of state deposits with Prva
(the largest domestic bank); and the reduction of required reserves. Foreign parents have also
stepped in with substantial liquidity infusions while the Central Bank of Montenegro has
pressed effectively for capital injections and stepped up its surveillance. Moreover, the
revamping of banking legislations is at an advanced stage, and the authorities have issued
guarantees for lending supported by International Financial Institutions. On their part, banks
have made progress repairing their balance sheets and overhauling their credit risk
management systems. Deposits started to reflow in mid-2009.
The authorities have reacted swiftly to the fiscal deterioration. A mid-year revision of the state
budget and similar adjustments at the local level stipulated large cuts in capital expenditure,
goods and services and the wage bill limiting the actual cash deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP. In
their three-year budget plan, the authorities envisage the phasing out the deficit by 2012 but
measures remain to be articulated.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that strong capital inflows prior to 2009 had supported rapid
economic growth. However, the global crisis exposed the vulnerabilities that had built up,
leading to a credit crunch and a sharp contraction in economic activity when those flows
reversed. Given the limited policy flexibility, Directors emphasized the need to reduce the large
fiscal and external imbalances and to strengthen competitiveness through structural reforms.
Directors stressed the need to reduce the large structural fiscal deficit. They noted that, with
euroization, fiscal tightening is critical to support reforms to improve Montenegro’s
competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’ adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework
that targets budget balance within the next few years, and encouraged early adoption of
policies to support this objective. Directors emphasized the need for both expenditure cuts and
revenue measures. They saw merit in reconsidering past tax cuts, rationalizing the extensive
transfer programs, exercising prudence in issuing state guarantees, and adopting a proactive
approach in dealing with the large unfunded longer-term pension liabilities. They considered
that budget borrowing requirements should be better aligned with available financing, and
encouraged the authorities to rebuild fiscal reserves to safeguard future stability.
Directors commended the authorities’ prompt response to the financial turmoil by enhancing
liquidity in the banking system and providing deposit guarantees. They also welcomed the
authorities’ implementation of the recommendations made by the Financial Sector Assessment
Program. They stressed the need to further strengthen supervision, and welcomed the

3
authorities’ intention to adopt new legislation on banks and bank bankruptcy in accordance
with international best practice, as well as a revised Central Bank Law. It will also be important
to closely monitor private sector debt developments.
With the need to lower the current account deficit to sustainable levels, Directors considered it
critical to improve competitiveness through structural reforms. They welcomed the recent
reform efforts, and recommended additional labor market deregulation, including opt-out
clauses from collective bargaining arrangements, easing rules on labor redundancies, and
reducing disincentives to hiring. They also underlined the need to improve the business
environment further by reducing red tape and infrastructure bottlenecks, and addressing
governance weaknesses.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve macroeconomic statistics to facilitate
economic analysis, and supported Fund technical assistance in this area.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Montenegro is also available.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Montenegro
and Yuri Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director
April 28, 2010
Impact of the crisis and the actions by the authorities
1. Small and very open economies, with short or non-existent time series and
with frequent structural changes, are not easy for surveillance. In a time of
crisis, when uncertainties are exacerbated, the task is even more complicated.
Against such a background, the authorities of Montenegro would like to thank
staff for their efforts, and for the fruitful discussions during the Article IV
Mission. Fund analyses and prognoses attract a lot of interest from various
stakeholders, and the importance of the staff papers is hard to overestimate.
Bearing this in mind, and fully devoted to complete transparency, the
authorities continue the practice of consenting to the publication of the staff
report.
2. Despite the sizeable fiscal surplus amounting to almost 7% of GDP in 2007,
and swift actions to counter the impact of the crisis, the Montenegrin economy
was severely hit, particularly exposing missed opportunities to reform the real
sector during the boom years. Industrial production decreased substantially,
credit activity slowed down, deposit withdrawal was sizeable, imports
plummeted, terms of trade deteriorated and the housing market experienced
downward adjustment, all adding to the pressures on the banking system’s
balance sheet. Economic growth in 2009 was negative anywhere in the range
of -4.1% (as seen by EBRD) to -7% as seen by the IMF.
3. Against such backdrop, the authorities acted decisively: a blanket deposit
guarantee measure was introduced, as well as a zero marginal rate of reserves
on monthly deposit growth. Fiscal reserves were partly used to extend
financial assistance to the banking sector as the crisis was unfolding. Parent
banks continued providing financing to their subsidiaries in Montenegro.
Although after initial withdrawals deposits have started flowing back to the
banking system, they remain below pre-crisis levels. On the fiscal side, faced
with a revenue shortfall as a direct consequence of reduced activity, the
government adopted a supplementary budget decreasing non-essential capital
expenditures and the wage bill. The authorities remain fully aware of the need
to preserve fiscal prudence, particularly bearing in mind euroization and a
limited ability to provide liquidity to the financial system with monetary
policy instruments.
Financial sector challenges
4. Despite recent improvements, partly as a response to the process of EU
integration, the crisis, as in other countries, exposed remaining weaknesses in

2
the banking supervision legal framework. The independence of the Central
Bank, however, has not come into question at any time. Indeed, all measures
the CB should and could take under the current legal framework, such as
banning a troubled bank from issuing new loans until the capital ratio is
brought in line with the requirements, have been taken. Public statements
from the Central Bank have been clear regarding future actions as well.
Certainly, the authorities do remain committed to improving the legal
framework, and they are ready to adopt best international practices in financial
supervision. Several laws are pending, with technical assistance from the Fund
and the World Bank. A new Central Bank Law will provide legal prerequisites
for the harmonization of the status, objectives and functions of the Central
Bank with the Constitution in such manner to enhance governance and
management, while preserving Central Bank independence. New amendments
to the Banking Law will extend new powers to maintain financial stability,
particularly with regard to interim administration and better protection of
depositors. In addition, new amendments to the Bank Bankruptcy and
Liquidation Law will provide for more efficient bankruptcy and liquidation
proceedings.
Real sector performance and fiscal policy response
5. Substantial changes have taken place in the structure of the economy and
employment in the last five years. Steps have been taken to ensure that
inherited hidden unemployment in the industrial sector is removed. At the
same time, Montenegro offered better prospects for employment than
neighboring countries, and had attracted a relatively sizeable foreign labor
force. Nevertheless low activity and participation rates are a major source of
concern. Staff’s recommendation on the need to further enhance labor
regulation, potentially also through a decentralized collective bargaining
agreement and opt-out clause, is welcome. The authorities will pursue further
labor market reforms and open labor market policies, as exemplified by the
willingness to accept and register foreign workers.
6. With a view to making the economy more investment friendly, the Council for
the Elimination of Business Barriers was recently established. Based on
several international indexes and assessments, Montenegro ranks favorably
compared to neighboring countries. The authorities, however, are not satisfied
with the existing impediments for investments and are determined to further
improve the business environment. The authorities believe that this will help
broaden the export base.
7. With the economy heavily dependent on tourism and exposed to volatile
trends, the government remains determined to help the restructuring of the

3
Aluminum Plant (KAP). This is also relevant for related industries, such as
energy production and railways; the existence of one large consumer makes
the profitability of investments in the energy sector more predictable. Sizeable
untapped potential exists, particularly in renewable resources. The recent
recovery of aluminum prices will help reverse the trend in terms of trade and
could result in KAP restructuring under less pressure than originally expected.
8. Staff notes that a relatively high expenditure to GDP ratio is in contradiction
to the relatively low tax rates. This is due to high employment in the public
sector, subsidies and transfers. The picture gets slightly better once the ratio of
wages and transfers is compared to public investment; the result - proxy for
quality of public expenditures - exceeds that in most of the countries in the
region, driven by the high share of public investment in total expenses. The
timing and pace of expenditure to GDP reduction will depend on the recovery
from the crisis, as a too abrupt reduction could further depress economic
activity.
9. The presented comparative data on tax rates are helpful, particularly once
mature European economies are taken out, and some neighboring countries
added, as it reveals that the Montenegrin tax rates are comparable to the
regional levels. The government wants to maintain an attractive tax environment
and rightly priced government services. With this in mind options for removing
the lower VAT tax rate, introduction of a modern property tax and a new
arrangement for intergovernmental revenue sharing between central and local
government are discussed.
10. Notwithstanding considerable uncertainty surrounding the estimates of the
output gap and the structural fiscal deficit, the authorities remain determined
to achieve fiscal balance by 2013. The authorities have a slightly different
view on the timing of the downturn: the Ministry of Finance estimates that the
output gap turned negative already in 2009 and foresees an even bigger gap in
2010. Consequently, in the authorities’ view, the structural deficit is lower
than projected by staff. In any case, measures envisaged for 2010, including
wage restraint measures introduced at the end of 2009, should be sufficient to
keep the headline deficit at an acceptable level, probably lower than the staff
estimate of 7%. The authorities closely monitor fiscal developments and have
imposed strict limits on discretionary spending during the first half of 2010.
They plan to make these restrictions permanent around midyear, with a view
to limiting the budget deficit, in a worst case scenario, to just above 4 percent.
Revenues during the first three and a half months have been higher than
expected, especially with respect to VAT and personal income taxes, that have
both been larger than planned.

Going Forward
11. The crisis impact was hard but did not reduce the growth potential. The fact
that despite the crisis, net FDI, mostly in the energy sector, booked a record
high in 2009, and continued with a positive trend during the first quarter of
2010, reinforces the belief that a small economy, with a huge untapped energy
potential will be able to return to the pre-crisis growth rates in the medium
term. That said, the authorities are not taking recent positive signs for granted
and continue to explore the options for increasing the speed of recovery in the
short turn. In order to close the financing gap for this and next fiscal year, the
authorities are considering tapping the international market. At the same time,
the advice of the Fund is important and the authorities are looking forward to
future, potentially even closer, cooperation.
