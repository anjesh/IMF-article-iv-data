I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In its first year in the European Union, Poland has shown its mettle. Export
growth remained buoyant and FDI picked up sharply—rendering a solid external position
stronger. Policymakers successfully coped with accession-related price and demand shocks.
And international financial markets, helped by ample global liquidity, reacted positively:
market access improved; spreads on external debt narrowed, and the zloty appreciated.
Looking ahead, the prospect of euro adoption promises to provide an anchor for economic
policies. The convergence plan should make macroeconomic policies more forward-looking
and strengthen the medium-term orientation of fiscal policy. Access to structural funds and
agricultural subsidies should enhance growth potential and reduce large regional differences
by upgrading infrastructure and modernizing agriculture.
2.
Nevertheless, overall economic performance remains disappointing relative to
the promise of the early transition years and the most dynamic emerging markets.
Economic growth has slowed significantly since the Russia crisis, employment has fallen,
and, under the burden of rising fiscal deficits, public debt has increased sharply. Thus,
despite low inflation, the local currency risk premium on the zloty is higher than on most
other EU8 currencies (Text Figure 1). This, together with a falling investment ratio and
employment rate over the period, suggest investor concerns about policies and structural
impediments to growth

Fragmented politics have been largely responsible for repeated failures of
reform efforts and market uncertainties. The disintegration of the senior party in the
ruling minority coalition has continued since the resignation of the Miller government in
May 2004. Prime Minister Belka, who then formed a government to bridge to general
elections due by fall 2005, submitted his resignation in May to prompt early elections. But
President Kwaśniewski rejected the resignation, opting for elections in September. Polls put
two center-right parties—which plan to form a coalition and have broadly pro-reform, though
not fully convergent, economic policy agendas—in the lead, but are unclear on whether they
will secure a majority. Populist parties with significant support generally oppose public
finance reforms and euro adoption. The mission held discussions with leaders and economic
advisors of the leading opposition parties.
II. BACKGROUND
4.
A surge in growth in the run-up to EU accession dissipated in the second half of
1
2004. One factor behind this profile was a bunching of inventory accumulation prior to tax
and regulatory changes accompanying accession in May (Text Figure 2). Nevertheless, and
despite the fact that annual growth reached almost 5½ percent, the sharp deceleration of GDP
in the second half of the year dampened hopes of pushing growth potential up to 5 percent in
the ongoing recovery (Table 1). Both domestic and external demand contributed to the
slowdown. Whereas consumption and inventory accumulation had supported output growth

as the contribution of net exports diminished, by mid-2004 these sources of demand growth
also slackened. Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2005 show falling domestic
demand—mostly owing to drops in inventory accumulation and highly import-intensive
investment—but with some rebound in output growth as net exports recovered sharply.
5.
Even as the contribution of net external demand fell in 2004, exports had
remained strong. Export growth, which led the recovery, hit a soft spot in mid-2004, but by
end-year had rebounded to rates of about 40 percent (quarter-on-quarter annualized) (Text
Figure 3). This pick-up was particularly impressive in view of slackening demand in Western
Europe and the appreciation of the zloty during the second half of the year. Exporters
appeared strongly motivated to price to market, especially as domestic demand softened.

Private fixed investment has lagged the cycle, indicating that potential investors
remained cautious. Staff analysis (see Selected Issues) shows that corporate fixed
investment growth has been significantly lower than model-based projections since 2000.
This is corroborated by a rather steady increase of capacity utilization since early-2002 to
historical highs by early 2005 (Figure 1). Thus, strong corporate profitability since 2002
translated mostly into an accumulation of financial assets, while bank credit to the corporate
sector fell—indicating a considerable unrealized capacity to invest (Table 2). A slow
recovery of fixed investment during 2004 lost pace in early 2005.
7.
The recovery has started to produce jobs, but the employment rate remains low
owing to structural rigidities and demographic changes. The Russia crisis and the large
appreciation of the zloty in 2001 created two waves of job destruction just as a baby-boom
generation entered the labor market. Job creation was stymied by supply side problems—

skill mismatches, immobility between regions, and disincentives to work—while demand
was weakened by the cycle, poor infrastructure particularly in high unemployment regions,
and high non-wage costs of employment. Thus, the employment rate, which was close to the
euro area average in 1998, is now 52 percent—the lowest in the EU. The gap is particularly
large for young workers while the long-term unemployment rate is one of the highest in the
EU (Text Figure 4). These developments have their counterpart in impressive productivity
gains during the recovery and, as high unemployment has kept wage growth low, falling unit
labor costs.

have escalated, but banks continue to
hold a large share of assets in government bonds. With limited scope for further cuts in
household savings rates, future growth will depend on stronger investment in job-creating
capacity both to push up household incomes and to ease potential supply constraints.
9.
Thus far, however, resource constraints have not been evident in inflation or the
current account. A pickup in nominal wage growth, rising oil prices, and an increase in food
prices as agricultural exports were

(Table 3).

Fiscal policy continued to drift in 2004. Adding EU-accession related spending to a
cut in the corporate tax rate and upward drift in non-discretionary spending resulted in a
procyclical (though lower-than-initially projected) rise in the general government deficit
(Text Table 1 and Table 4). Despite strong efforts of the Belka government to secure
Parliamentary approval of fiscal reforms (Hausner Plan), only about a third (in terms of
potential savings) of the plan was implemented. Some key reforms—to limit coverage of the
farmer pension scheme, close social security contribution loopholes and better target
disability programs—were not implemented, although pre-retirement benefits were reined in
and pension indexation rules were changed. Notwithstanding the large deficit, a renewal of

in the debt ratio in four years.

interest rate differentials vis-à-vis
the euro and the dollar, the zloty appreciated through early 2005.

12.
The authorities thought that past IMF policy recommendations had been apt,
although political constraints had hindered their full implementation (Box 1).
Box 1. Implementation of Previous Recommendations
Despite the government’s efforts, fiscal reforms, long supported by staff, have been slow.
However, the government used a window of opportunity immediately after its formation
last year to accelerate privatization, also a longstanding staff recommendation. Staff views
on monetary policy have been well received and were seen as on the mark in managing
the price shock last year. Similarly, the NBP and its supervisory arm have acted
forcefully, also consistent with staff views, to step up prudential regulation and
supervision of foreign exchange-denominated loans. Staff’s concerns about the changes in
the regulation on loan classification, however, turned out to be unnecessary as the changes
have had the benign effects the authorities expected.

- 11 -

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
13.
After a successful first year in the EU, the authorities were for the most part
confident about the medium term. Pointing to potential gains from EU membership for
FDI and institutional and infrastructural development, most expected growth to increase to
5–5½ percent in 2006–07. They were puzzled about why investment had not taken off in
2004, but felt that underlying conditions (competitiveness, preparations for absorbing EU
funds, and high capacity utilization) were conducive to a significant strengthening in 2005.
They acknowledged, however, the importance of an electoral outcome that would give a
strong base to a pro-reform government. Reversing the rising public debt ratio, reining in
social transfer spending, and reducing and simplifying taxes would be key for a favorable
growth scenario.
14.
Job creation, a special focus of this year’s consultation discussions, was seen as
critical for raising growth, easing strains on the pension system, and reducing poverty
(Box 2). Analyses by government, opposition advisors, and staff (see Selected Issues),
identified many influences constraining job growth, with no obvious ranking of importance.
The discussions therefore explored a variety of possible actions. Views on the likely response
of job creation to policy change, however, differed. The more optimistic expected a sharp
rise in employment and indeed foresaw pockets of labor shortages over the medium term.
Others felt that high and persistent structural unemployment was a legacy of the transition in
which social transfer schemes had been used to effectively remove many affected by
restructuring from the labor force. On either view, the authorities were concerned that longterm unemployment and persistent regional differences in employment were depriving many
of the benefits of Poland’s prosperity.
15.
Preparations for euro adoption were another focus of the discussions. The
government had targeted euro adoption in 2009–10. Formally, this would require entering
ERM2 by mid-2006-mid-2007 and meeting the Maastricht criteria by mid-2008-mid-2009.
The authorities viewed the major hurdle as reducing the fiscal deficit and aimed to get it
significantly below the Maastricht criterion of 3 percent of GDP. The criteria for inflation
(below about 2½ percent) and general government debt (below 60 percent of GDP) were
viewed as well within reach. Looking beyond the Maastricht criteria, the authorities were
also examining structural aspects of the economy—such as the flexibility of the labor market,
structural characteristics that influence monetary transmission, and any challenges for bank
supervision—that could impact the success of euro adoption. Staff welcomed the ambitious
policy goals and underscored that fiscal and structural reforms needed to secure strong
growth were also critical for a safe journey to euro adoption.
A. Economic Outlook
16.
All forecasts envisaged a pick-up in growth from the low end-2004 rates, but
views on its strength differed. Staff saw several influences that would constrain the
rebound. Weak demand in Western Europe and the zloty appreciation should slow exports.

- 12 -

Box 2. The Interactions of Labor Market, Fiscal, and Poverty Trends
Negative employment trends have contributed importantly to a deterioration of the
financial position and coverage of the pension system (see Selected Issues).
Projections in 1999 (when a pay-as-you-go system was replaced by a three-pillar mixed
private-public scheme) showed a small, transitory deficit followed by long-term
sustainability of the state-managed first pillar. However, owing to unfavorable labor
market developments, combined with changes in the parameters, and generous pension
indexation since 1999, official projections now show a significant deterioration relative to
the 1999 projections. Declining employment has also limited the accumulation of savings
in the privately managed second pillar, increasing the likelihood of future claims on the
budget to support those who will not accumulate sufficient pension rights. The authorities
were discussing the possibility of setting up a National Actuary Office to safeguard the
pension system. Staff welcomed this plan.
Long-term joblessness, persistent regional differences in unemployment and poorly
targeted social benefits have marginalized an increasing part of society. The share of
people living below the existence minimum rose from 5.6 percent in 1998 to 11.7 percent
in 2003. Social spending relative to GDP is among the highest in the OECD, but the social
support system is uneven and poorly targeted (Table 5). Almost 30 percent of social
benefit recipients live in deep poverty, while families headed by old-age pensioners have
one of the highest per capita incomes.

Moderating export growth and political uncertainties are likely to delay a full-scale recovery
of investment—a projection supported by the drop in Q1 2005 investment reported after the
mission. The planned withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2005, mostly from postponement of
pension indexation, should counterbalance the impact of increasing employment on private
consumption. Staff, thus, projects growth of 3.7 percent in 2005, with the current account
deficit staying at about 1½ percent of GDP. Risks to these forecasts were evenly balanced:
export growth could continue to surprise on the upside, while political uncertainty could
lower investment growth. The authorities, especially the NBP, were more optimistic on
investment and labor income growth and therefore expected growth of about 4 percent.
17.
Staff saw a range of possible medium-term outcomes, depending on the
resolution of uncertainties about the political situation, economic policies, and timing of
euro adoption. The authorities and staff agreed that, supported by strong fiscal and structural
policies and a competitive parity, euro adoption would be a significant impetus to
investment, trade, and growth. With a strong coalition after the elections committed to early
euro adoption and the required reforms—most importantly expenditure-reform-based fiscal
adjustment—average growth should be above 5 percent. Without fiscal reforms, however,
staff projected growth to stay at 3½–4 percent (Table 6): market concerns about the deficit
could produce persistently high interest rates and modest investment, locking the economy
into a sub-par growth equilibrium characterized by moderate current account deficits, but low
employment and sluggish private consumption. The authorities saw the danger in continued
postponement of reforms and agreed that investment would be crucial for rapid income
convergence.
B. Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities viewed the 2005 budget as a first step toward rapid fiscal
consolidation. Parts of the Hausner Plan that had been implemented—particularly a shift
from annual pension indexation to indexation only in years after cumulative inflation reached
5 percent and reductions in defense spending and support to employers of disabled people—
would contribute to the projected cut in the general government deficit from 6.1 percent of
GDP in 2004 to 5.7 percent in 2005. In fact, the authorities hoped that tight expenditure
control, lower-than-assumed interest rates, and higher-than-planned dividends would reduce
the deficit below target. Staff agreed with the assessment of revenue and interest costs, but
felt that these would just compensate for the loss from elements of the Hausner plan that had
not received parliamentary approval but had been assumed in the budget. Looking ahead,
staff questioned the basis for assuming further adjustment. Indeed, in view of the need to
index pensions for 2005 and 2006 inflation, staff projected that without new measures the
general government deficit would rise above 6 percent of GDP in 2006.
19.
Building on the envisaged reduction in the deficit in 2005 the authorities planned
to leave the next government an ambitious 2006 budget proposal. A new strategy, termed

- 14 -

Plan B, would reduce the deficit in 2006 to 4.6 percent of GDP and in 2007 to below
3 percent.2 The authorities explained that the strategy, still in early stages of definition and
obviously subject to post-election changes, would rely on the initiative of spending units to
identify savings and efficiency gains, entailing an array of small measures. Also, an overhaul
of cash management was expected to generate savings relative to GDP of up to 1 percentage
point. Tax reform was another key element. A central plank also of the opposition’s platform,
the new tax regime would have a uniform-rate (provisionally set at 18 percent) PIT, CIT, and
VAT phased in over three years. The authorities stressed that these changes would be
revenue neutral and would provide an impetus to growth through the elimination of
distortions.
20.
Staff welcomed the ambitious fiscal targets and tax reform plan, but doubted the
durability of fiscal consolidation without fundamental expenditure reform. As concrete
steps to rein in spending had not been developed, it was not possible to assess the feasibility
of the targets. Nevertheless, in staff’s view, such ambitious fiscal targets would require
measures to reduce poorly-targeted social transfer spending—the root of the fiscal problem.
These would cut the deficit not only directly, but also indirectly by strengthening incentives
to work and raising employment. Measures to improve cash and expenditure management
could be important supplements, but savings would accrue over time and with large
investments in information systems. Noting that the simplification of the tax system would
strengthen enforcement capacity and nurture a compliance culture, without major negative
distributional effects, staff supported a move to single-rate taxes carefully designed to ensure
revenue neutrality.
21.
In discussions with the government and opposition leaders, staff focused on the
immediate post-election opportunity for introducing fiscal reforms. It emphasized that
under present policies and historical average growth rates, public debt would continue to
grow and public finances would become more vulnerable to shocks (Table 7, Box 3). Indeed,
with such debt dynamics, assuming growth at the historical average would be optimistic, and
dynamics could look even worse. Staff therefore urged four immediate post-election
initiatives for fiscal policy.
•

2

Establishment of targets for reducing the public debt ratio and for deficits
consistent with this goal. Based on an analysis of fiscal risks and distribution of
fiscal burden across generations (see Selected Issues), staff suggested that public debt
be reduced below 40 percent of GDP. To achieve this level in the medium-term, the
general government deficit should be reduced to about 2 percent of GDP by 2008.
This would also support exchange rate stability in ERM2 and allow Poland to adopt
the euro from a strong position.

These targets refer to ESA95 deficits (excluding privately-managed pension funds), the
measure for the Maastricht deficit criterion. Because historical differences between cash
(GFS) and accrual (ESA95) deficits will not persist, staff projections for the two are
identical.

- 15 -

Box 3. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Although favorable developments in 2004 lessened immediate concerns about public
debt, medium-term trends remain worrisome. After a ten-percentage point increase in
2002-03, public debt (excluding guarantees) relative to GDP fell in 2004 owing to zloty
appreciation, strong growth, and large privatization receipts. In staff’s baseline scenario,
however, without a sizable cut in the deficit and with average output growth of 3¾ percent,
public debt rises to 63 percent of GDP in 2010 and stabilizes at above 65 percent after
2014.
More importantly, with staff’s projected debt profile, the vulnerability of public
finances to shocks would be high. As detailed in previous staff analysis (Country Report
No. 03/187), real shocks pose a major risk: a two-year slowdown in output growth in 2006
similar to that in 2001–02 (a 2¾ percentage point-drop), reversed in 2008, would push
public debt to 75 percent of GDP by 2010 (Box Figure). An increase of this magnitude
could lead to strong market reactions and, thus, necessitate a large procyclical fiscal
adjustment—further exacerbating the negative impact of the real shock (Table 8). A 300
basis-point increase in the average interest rate on public debt in 2006–07 (returning to the
baseline afterwards) would increase public debt relative to GDP by some 3¼ percentage
points only.

Macroeconomic risks from external debt are much smaller. Although the gross external
debt ratio has risen in the past few years, much of the increase was due to increased
non-resident holding of the stock of domestically issued public debt. Under the baseline
assumption, a current account deficit of 2–3 percent of GDP over the next five years,
external debt would remain below 50 percent of GDP—leaving an ample safety margin for

Formulation of a plan for reducing spending on social transfers focused on
improved targeting. Measures included in the Hausner plan needed to be
pressed again and supplemented by further reforms of agricultural and disability
pensions and containment of the wage bill, particularly in education. The
reforms should be adequate to both achieve deficit targets and create scope for
cuts in the tax wedge.

•

Implementation of a tax reform, moving to single rates in a revenue neutral
manner.

•

Introduction of a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) with three elements. First,
as a standard for discipline and message to markets, a fiscal rule should be
established. The difficulty of calculating structural balances and the aim of
avoiding procyclical behavior argued for a rule in the form of annual current
expenditure ceilings for a 4-year electoral cycle. Expenditure management
should also be strengthened to support medium-term budgeting. Second, to
enhance transparency, the law should introduce expert independent assessment
of macro assumptions and fiscal projections in annual budgets and the mediumterm framework Third, to ensure efficient planning, the law should mandate
detailed rolling 3-year budget projections alongside each annual budget.

22.
The authorities and opposition leaders and experts saw merit in these
recommendations. All parties to the discussion supported deficit reduction. The objective of
lowering debt to 40 percent of GDP, while seen as ambitious, commanded attention. The
government, fresh from a bruising battle over the Hausner Plan, was not optimistic about the
chances for reform of social transfers. Some of the key opposition experts, however, viewed
such reforms, particularly to disability pensions, as essential for a lasting fiscal adjustment.
Some were concerned, however, that this may create room for populist fiscal policies later
on. Tax reform had become a common goal and questions centered on phasing and selection
of rates. Both the authorities and opposition experts saw the merits of a FRL.
C. Monetary Policy
23.
The MPC considered that the monetary policy response to the inflation upturn
in 2004 had been appropriate. The combination of brisk output growth and a strong pickup
in wage growth, followed by oil and EU accession-related price increases had called for
preemptive interest hikes in mid-2004 to avert second-round effects and anchor expectations
(Text Figure 8). The second-round effects had, in fact, been contained—a development some
MPC members attributed to the rapid policy response and others also to increased credibility
of monetary policy. Staff queried whether last year’s success had made inflation expectations
more forward-looking and better anchored to the target. The MPC was not unanimous on this
issue; some saw expectations as still highly adaptive and others felt they were becoming
better anchored. The strong appreciation of the zloty following the rate hikes surprised some

- 17 -

MPC members and was viewed as a factor that helped lower inflation faster than they had
expected. Staff felt that the credibility of monetary policy had been reinforced, and this
should allow future price shocks to be handled with smaller interest rate changes.

24.
The NBP and MPC thought that the inflation outlook was benign but leaned
toward a cautious approach to policy in the run-up to the elections. Together with staff
they expected inflation to drop to the lower half of the target range (2½ ± 1 percent)
(temporarily perhaps even below that) in the rest of the year and revert toward the target in
2006. In the discussions (prior to the second 50-basis point cut in April) MPC members
thought that a benign inflation outlook provided room for further rate reduction. But views
on the extent of possible future rate cuts differed. Some MPC members thought, and staff
agreed, that a sizable estimated output gap, low projected inflation, falling inflation
expectations, and risks of speculative inflows if interest rate differentials remained sizable,
left ample room for reductions: others saw several risk factors. The MPC cut the policy rates
again at its April meeting by 50 basis points and adopted a neutral stance, widely interpreted
as indicating that the easing cycle might have ended or that future changes would be small.
25.
The monetary authorities viewed the uncertainties surrounding future fiscal
policies as the main medium-term risk for inflation. They welcomed indications that the
next government would pursue fiscal consolidation. But they felt that a connected monetary
policy response would need to await evidence of commitment to the necessary structural
fiscal reforms.
26.
The monetary authorities felt that approaching ERM2 and euro adoption also
warranted caution. As the Maastricht inflation reference rate was likely to be 2½ percent or
lower, some advocated an effort to stay consistently below that rate. Noting the increased
credibility of monetary policy, however, staff cautioned against an asymmetric approach to
the 2½ percent policy target, which would put undue upward pressure on the exchange rate
and risk misalignment approaching ERM2. Thus far, the authorities did not hold firm views

- 18 -

on the appropriate parity or the best method for determining it. For the immediate future,
staff and the authorities agreed that export and profitability developments suggested that the
zloty was in a satisfactory range. Staff noted, however, that empirical work focusing on the
medium to long term was turning up a wide range of views, few suggesting that the zloty was
undervalued and more that it was either appropriately- or over-valued. Staff underscored the
importance, for investment and income catch-up, of entering ERM2 and adopting the euro at
a competitive rate.
27.
The authorities felt that inflation targeting would serve Poland well until ERM2
entry. Noting that market participants were concerned about policy surprises and conflicting
signals from MPC members, staff asked the MPC whether they saw a need for changes in the
way future policies were signaled. Staff also asked whether the MPC could better
communicate views on future inflation through a fanchart endorsed by the MPC rather than
the statement of a policy bias. The authorities felt that the current arrangement—whereby the
inflation projections and the associated fanchart were given by the NBP staff—was
appropriate and that the policy bias was an effective way to communicate future policy
intentions. With an eye to ERM2, the authorities were developing capacity for foreign
exchange market intervention, but agreed with staff that it should not be used as an active
policy instrument before ERM2 entry.
D. Financial Sector Risk and Vulnerability
28.
The authorities viewed recent developments and prospects in the banking sector
as favorable. Since the late 1990s the number of banks had fallen by about a third and
employment by about 20 percent, while real assets had increased sharply (Text Figure 9).

classified in total loans, from
22.2 percent in 2003 to 15½ percent in 2004, resulted from improved loan quality. The
change in the loan classification rules played only a minor role; moreover, owing to changes
to the rules for collateral valuation, the banks had not released any sizable amount of
previously accumulated provisions.

29.
The authorities pointed to risks inherent in a strong cyclical upturn and
institutional weaknesses as challenges for the financial sector. Although the share of
foreign exchange-denominated and -indexed loans declined in 2004, the authorities thought
that borrowers’ foreign exchange risk remained significant owing to the large stock of such
loans. Regarding cyclical risks, the authorities had detected some signs of banks relaxing
credit standards to maintain market shares, mostly in the fastest-growing mortgage lending
market. To address this issue and strengthen foreign exchange risk assessment, banking
supervisors had issued new recommendations on mortgage lending and focused on- and
off-site inspections on assessing such loans. On institutional weaknesses, they thought that
the inefficiency of the commercial court system seriously hindered banks’ capacity to call
loan collaterals and, thus, made collateral valuation uncertain and banks potential losses
higher. The NBP had initiated a project with the World Bank to address this problem. Staff
agreed that legal reforms to speed up case resolution and improve contract enforcement were
essential, also to improve the overall business climate. The mission stressed that bank
supervision should address any sign of excessive easing credit standards during the upturn.
E. Structural Policies
30.
The authorities had taken several measures to reduce unemployment but results
were mixed. Recognizing that young and old-age workers, particularly with low skills, were
the most vulnerable to joblessness, the authorities had concentrated their efforts on these
groups. The most successful initiative of the First Job program, which started in 2002 and

- 20 -

aimed to strengthen incentives for labor market entrants to seek employment, was a
traineeship program: about 40 percent of participants had found permanent jobs. Information
centers set up in municipalities to promote regional mobility had also been effective, but
more were needed. Other efforts had been less effective. The authorities regretted that the
50+ program, which started in 2004 and offered financing to projects by labor offices and
NGOs to raise the labor force participation of old-age workers, had had little success. More
generally, the authorities were pleased with the 2002 Labor Code revision, which they felt
had eliminated most administrative barriers to job creation. Moreover, the recent rapid
growth of temporary employment, subject to less strict regulation than permanent
employment, had introduced additional flexibility.
31.
The government was preparing a number of initiatives to amplify the beneficial
effects of the cyclical upturn on the labor market. They explained that proposals were
being prepared to provide tax relief to low wage-earning new labor market entrants and to
freeze the minimum wage for two years. They, however, were uncertain about the prospects
for parliamentary approval, especially in light of a recent proposal by MPs to raise the
minimum wage by 50 percent over three years. The authorities also had plans to provide
incentives to bring grey economy employment into the legal economy. They projected an
unemployment rate of 16½ percent by 2006.
32.
Staff commended the authorities for their efforts to raise employment but
emphasized that stronger efforts were needed on all fronts to achieve a breakthrough.
Staff agreed that reducing the tax wedge, particularly for low-skill and young workers,
lowering the minimum wage relative to the average, and reducing disincentives to work for
young people would be beneficial. Based on its analysis (see Selected Issues), however, staff
stressed that reforms should also aim to differentiate the minimum wage across regions and
for young workers; increase the flexibility of regular labor contracts; improve public
education, particularly vocational training; increase regional mobility; and reduce regional
differences in infrastructural development. Such initiatives would also be crucial for a
successful experience in the euro area. Staff acknowledged that the flexibility of Poland’s
labor market compared well with most euro area countries but emphasized that large labor
market imbalances necessitated exemplary flexibility.
33.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to rapid privatization. Receipts had
reached 1.2 percent of GDP in 2004, significantly above the target. The successful IPO of
PKO BP (the largest commercial bank), originally planned for 2001, also gave a strong
impetus to capital market development and foreign investment. The authorities felt that
privatization was the only way to secure the viability of most public companies in the
competitive environment since EU accession. They thought that state-ownership should be
confined to a handful of activities where the private sector cannot operate efficiently.
Privatization was also important to provide quality investment opportunities for pension
funds. They, therefore, thought that privatization should progress on many fronts, including
the energy sector, the railroad company, and the postal service. Staff welcomed the
achievements in 2004, strongly supported the authorities’ strategy, and urged swift

- 21 -

completion of privatization, including of PKO BP and PZU, during the term of the next
government.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Poland’s first year in the EU was a success. Businesses met the challenge of
increased competition inside the EU, and the MPC successfully stabilized inflation
expectations following an increase in prices. Markets reacted positively to these
accomplishments and to the government’s efforts to gain Parliamentary approval of fiscal
reforms, resurrect privatization, and improve debt management. Domestic interest rates fell
toward euro area levels, albeit with some delay and to a smaller extent than in some other
new members of the EU. Reflecting positive market sentiment, greenfield and privatizationrelated FDI increased, offering critical support for future growth.
35.
Indeed, EU membership adds to other attributes that should stand Poland in
good stead for strong growth. The current account deficit is small, and low inflation
commands increasing credibility. External debt is modest, although public debt, having risen
sharply in recent years, could become a source of vulnerability to changing market
sentiments if allowed to rise further. High corporate profitability, modest wage growth, and
ample corporate liquidity suggest strong investment potential. A large and young labor force,
combined with an institutional framework strengthened by EU membership, should sustain
foreign investors’ attraction to Poland. EU transfers promise to promote an upgrading of
infrastructure and modernization of agriculture.
36.
The stalling of growth momentum in recent months, however, suggests
remaining impediments to growth. Insofar as underlying conditions remain broadly
favorable, the recent slowdown is likely to be temporary—the result of a bunching of
demand prior to accession, a dip in EU growth, and a delayed investment response. Helped
by the recent reductions in policy interest rates, GDP growth should rise through 2005
alongside low inflation and only a small increase in the current account deficit. But the loss
of momentum from the heady growth rates of a year ago cooled hopes that Poland had
entered a period of substantially higher investment and output growth, sufficient to make a
serious dent in its strikingly low employment rate. Rather, such a shift is likely to require the
resolution of uncertainties about political leadership and a commitment to fiscal conservatism
and structural policies to strengthen incentives to work and invest.
37.
The immediate post-election period offers a window of opportunity for
consolidating public expenditure and reversing the increase in public debt. The most
important macroeconomic challenge for the next government will be to set clear goals in
these areas and secure political support for them. This will involve, first, committing to
sound targets for public debt (ideally about 40 percent of GDP) and associated general
government deficits (falling to about 2 percent of GDP). Second, a strategy should be
articulated for reducing the deficit, focusing on poorly-targeted social transfers, the key
excess in the fiscal accounts. Third, a tax reform to simplify the system would contribute to

- 22 -

reducing administrative costs and eliminating distortions. Consideration of single-rate
personal and corporate income and value-added taxes is a good starting point for reforms.
38.
Backing these commitments with the enactment of a fiscal responsibility law
would buttress political resolve and bring forward beneficial effects. Such a law should
encompass a fiscal rule—ideally in the form of a multi-year ceiling on primary current
spending—to supplement the current constitutional limit on debt; a requirement to
supplement annual budgets with rolling 3-year budget projections; transparency requirements
including norms for expert independent assessment of macroeconomic assumptions and
fiscal projections in the annual budgets and medium-term projections. Such laws, with
sufficient political support, have proved effective elsewhere in accelerating the medium-term
benefits of fiscal adjustment—lower interest rates, higher investment, and stronger
confidence.
39.
Alongside fiscal reform, a multi-pronged approach to job creation is essential to
realize output potential and ensure that all parts of the population benefit from higher
growth. Fiscal actions encompassing a revenue-neutral tax reform that reduces the tax wedge
and social benefit reforms to remove disincentives to work, particularly for those receiving
disability and pre-retirement benefits, would be an important first step. Other important
initiatives include infrastructure improvements in regions with low employment; education
reforms, particularly in vocational schools, focused on equipping workers with marketable
skills; and regulatory reforms. Although the OECD ranks labor market regulation in Poland
relatively favorably, addressing the low employment rate will require exemplary regulatory
conditions. In this vein, freezing the minimum wage to make it less binding for low-skill
workers, differentiating the minimum wage across regions and for young workers; and
eliminating remaining impediments to job creation (particularly undue regulation of regular
labor contracts) would help increase labor demand. Labor offices should focus on improving
job matching and the flow of labor market information among regions.
40.
The next government should also complete privatization. With limited scope for
state-aid and more intense competition in the EU, this is the only way to ensure the long-term
viability of most public companies. Setting a timetable for the full privatization of PKO BP
and PZU is of particular importance.
41.
Credible commitment to early euro adoption could amplify the potential benefits
of these policies. Provided the fiscal deficit is well below the Maastricht limit, the
conversion rate affords strong competitiveness, inflation is low, and labor market flexibility
has been improved, euro adoption should bring substantial benefits for trade and output
growth. But the risk of moving ahead without adequate preparation could be substantial. The
new government, therefore, should work closely with social partners and the NBP to reach an
agreement on a timetable for euro adoption and secure broad support for required reforms.
42.
Strong monetary policy credibility and a sound policy framework provide a
good basis for euro adoption. The decisive monetary response to the inflation fillip in 2004
was effective, and the inflation outlook is now benign. The MPC has appropriately reduced

- 23 -

the policy rate and shifted its policy bias to neutral. Developing capacity for foreign
exchange intervention is an important preparation for ERM2, but continuing to avoid such
intervention in the interim is appropriate. Looking ahead, the MPC should avoid any
temptation to aim for inflation in the bottom half of the target range as an insurance against
missing the Maastricht inflation criterion. Rather, gearing interest rate decisions toward
keeping inflation within a symmetric band around the 2½ percent inflation target will help
limit any undue upward pressure on the zloty in the approach to ERM2. Near-term
considerations indicate that competitiveness is in an acceptable range, but careful assessment
of the medium-longer term outlook, including growth potential and the evolution of
competition in global markets, will need to feed into the ongoing assessment of
competitiveness.
43.
Recent improvements in banking sector performance are welcome, and
prospects for their continuation are encouraging. The fruits of restructuring and
consolidation since the late-1990s together with the cyclical upturn are apparent in
strengthening bank profits and loan portfolios. Also, lower zloty interest rates and zloty
depreciation have stopped the trend rise in foreign currency lending—a key concern in recent
years. Potential problems to watch for are easing lending standards and a renewal of foreign
currency lending—issues which the NBP seems well-prepared to monitor and address.
44.
Although EU accession brought many improvements in statistics, further efforts
are needed to strengthen quarterly national accounts and fiscal accounts for the general
government.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

I. Baseline Projections

2006

1/ Public sector gross debt (Polish definition, excluding the risk-weighted stock of guarantees).
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent euro and 45 percent
U.S. dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl1 equaling old

- 35 -

APPENDIX I

Zl10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a
preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around
the central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially
appreciated by about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate
was allowed to appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the
central parity was raised by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual
exchange rate to appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of
crawl was reduced to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its
upper limit, the newly-formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band
from ±7 percent to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from
one percent to 0.8 percent per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of
depreciation was cut from 0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly
rate of depreciation was reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys
trading band was widened to 12.5 percent. On March 1, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was
widened to ±15 percent, and the rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On
December 31, 1999, the official rate was Zl4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the crawling
band regime was abolished and the zloty has since floated freely.
Poland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed
by Poland solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been
notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). Those
exchange restrictions are contained in the following legal instruments:
•

Council Regulation (EC) No. 2488/2000 of November 14, 2000, as amended
(freezing of funds and economic resources of former Yugoslav President Slobodan

APPENDIX II

POLAND—WORLD BANK ACTIVITY
46.
Poland rejoined the World Bank in 1986 and World Bank lending to Poland started in
1990. Since then the Bank has committed loans totaling US$5.4 billion equivalent. Total
loans outstanding and disbursed amount to US$1.9 billion as of the end of 2004. At the end
of 2004 eleven projects are under implementation, with an undisbursed balance of
US$297 million. In addition, the World Bank is administering three Global Environmental
Facility operations totaling US$33 million in commitments, with US$8.5 million
undisbursed.
47.
Since 1990, the Bank has financed projects in a variety of areas including in
agriculture, coal sector restructuring, enterprise and financial restructuring, environment,
energy, forestry development, health, housing, railway sector restructuring, ports, roads, and
rural development. These include the Krakow Energy Efficiency project (US$15 million,
also co-financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)), which aims at improving
energy efficiency of the city's district heating systems and end-users; a Railway
Restructuring loan (US$101 million), which is financing restructuring of the Polish State
Railways' (PKP) to increase efficiency, improve finances, and privatize selected activities
within a sound regulatory framework; a Rural Development Project (US$120 million), which
has the objective of rural restructuring and employment creations through promotion of
non-farm rural activities, strengthening of local governments and other institutions, financing
infrastructure investments, and improving rural education; and the Szczecin-Swinoujscie
Seaway and Port Modernization Project (US$38.5 million), which aims to promote Poland's
trade by developing an efficient administrative/managerial structure and improving physical
facilities. Other ongoing projects being financed by the World Bank are for flood
management, roads, Gdynia and Gdansk ports, water supply and development of geothermal
resources. More recent loans include the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan
(US$200 million), and a companion Coal Mine Closure Loan (US$100 million) which aim at
supporting the government’s Coal Reform Program (2003–06), specifically by mitigating the
negative effects associated with the further reduction of employment levels, and supporting
closure of uneconomic production capacity in a safe and environmentally sound manner,
respectively; a EUR 100 million loan for Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads almost
fully implemented in calendar year 2004, and a follow-up loan approved by the Board of the
World Bank on March 29, 2005 (EUR 100 million) for implementation mostly during
calendar year 2005. Smaller institutional development grants are currently financing
activities to strengthen the processes of land administration and registration and accounting
and auditing.
48.
The World Bank in consultation with the Polish government prepared in 2005 a
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with three key priority areas; promoting fiscal adjustment
and reversing negative debt dynamics through restructuring of expenditures; promoting
convergence through an improved investment climate and enhanced competitiveness; and
reducing poverty, encouraging social inclusion and bringing employment closer to the
Lisbon targets.

- 41 -

APPENDIX II

49.
The Bank’s Executive Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy in March
2005. The CPS is open-ended in terms of duration, and flexible in terms of its lending and
non-lending program, which is defined in annual business plans. As indicated in the CPS,
yearly lending is expected to be in the US$350–400 million range in the earlier years of the
strategy with amounts to be determined in the above mentioned annual business plans. Areas
for potential lending during FY05 and FY06 include support for road infrastructure, flood
prevention in the Odra river basin and rural development.
50.
In addition to its lending program, over the years of its involvement in Poland the
Bank has prepared a series of economic and sector work reports and policy notes that provide
advice on various poverty-related, institutional and structural reform issues. In 2004 World
Bank staff prepared with Government and non-Government counterparts a Living Standards
Assessment, a Knowledge Economy Assessment and an Investment Climate Assessment.
Preparation of Quarterly Economic Reports for the 8 new EU members in Central and
Eastern Europe (EU8) started in March 2004. Work has also started in the preparation of two
multi-country (covering EU8 countries), multiyear reports focusing on public finance reform
and on labor market issues. The World Bank is also cooperating with Polish authorities in the
process of review and consultation of the National Development Plan 2007–13. Other work
which has been completed in the past couple of years includes a Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (2003), development policy assessment (2001), health and social sector
reviews and policy notes (1999–2001), a labor market review (2001); rural land, labor and
capital markets (2001), and a study on trade and foreign direct investment (2000). In 2000, a
Financial Sector Assessment on the Poland financial system was carried out under the joint
IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program.

APPENDIX III

POLAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
51.
Poland has a comprehensive macroeconomic database that has been improving in
recent years. The authorities publish a full range of economic and financial statistics, and
cooperate fully in providing information to the Fund. Data on the core indicators are
available on a timely basis (see the attached table on core statistical indicators). Consistent
with its commitment to providing a comprehensive set of high quality data, in an open
manner; Poland subscribes to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics
52.
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles a wide range of real sector statistics,
most of which are published promptly in the monthly Statistical Bulletin. The main problems
for users include (i) the short span of comparable data series, reflecting the upheavals
associated with the transition to a market economy, (ii) inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data, reflecting differences in weights and differences in coverage, and
(iii) lack of easy electronic retrieval of these data.
53.
The national accounts follow the concepts and definitions of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which is based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA
1993). The GUS compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates by production and
expenditure approach in current and constant prices, a full sequence of accounts by
institutional sectors, supply and use tables, input/output tables, annual financial accounts and
regional accounts. The statistical techniques are basically sound. The constant price estimates
are compiled in average prices of the previous year, using deflation techniques that generally
follow international standards. However, national accounts data still have some problems—
the subannual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking techniques have been delayed.
54.
The concepts and definitions of the CPI follow the ESA 95 standards and Eurostat’s
requirements for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index. Polish CPI does not cover the
services related to owner-occupants dwellings. The weights for the index are obtained from
the average annual expenditures primarily taken from the national Household Budget Survey
(HBS) of the previous calendar year, and are updated annually. From 1999 onwards, the
national classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP). The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural
areas. Historical series are constructed using a chaining method. Time series data are
available for the index with reference periods of 1990 and 1998.
55.
The producer price index (PPI) is based on the 1993 SNA concepts and definitions for
recording and valuation of product prices and weights. Its scope includes mining and
quarrying, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Output price indices are also
calculated for agriculture, construction, and business services such as transport, storage, and
communication. Since 2000, the index is classified by the Polish Classification of Activities

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

based on the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities within the European
Community, first revision (NACE, Rev.1), the Statistical Classification of Products by
Activity in the European Community, and the List of Products of the European Community.
The PPI does not include any estimation for missing prices and quality and seasonal
adjustments are not made.
Government finance statistics
56.
The authorities provide detailed state budget data to the Fund every month. In
addition, government finance statistics are reported to the Fund on a regular basis. Data,
recently submitted for inclusion in the 2005 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), were for the first time compiled according to the framework of GFSM 2001. The
authorities provided comparable data, compiled on an accrual basis, for 2001–03. This
submission followed the creation of a General Government Statistics Working Group
(GGSWG), comprising officials of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the Central
Statistical Office. This working group has the responsibility to implement the European
System of Accounts 1995 and harmonization with fiscal data presented in the framework of
GFSM 2001. Although the classification of transactions in the official data still needs
improvements, a recent STA mission in February 2005 noted many advancements in fiscal
data compilation. However, several areas need further development to fully comply with
international guidelines. In the meantime, the staff makes adjustments to the official data.
57.
The annual consolidated general, central and local government data are available in
the GFSY. Monthly data on consolidated core operations of the central government are
reported in IFS. The main weaknesses in data reporting are the following: (i) high frequency
data have only partial coverage of units of central government. All the extrabudgetary units
at central government level, and a part of the social security sector are left out. GFS data on
the missing entities are only available either on semi-annual or annual basis and at timeliness
from three to 10 months; (ii) fiscal source data for state budget and local authorities are
reported on a cash basis. Calculations and estimates are therefore needed to adjust the data to
an accrual basis; (iii) the budgetary classification does not institute concepts and systems
focused on economic balances; (iv) the sectorization of the general government sector is not
yet finalized, with the treatment of both the Open Pension Funds and the public health care
institutions still under consideration; and (v) the reporting of annual fiscal data on the general
government sector is sometimes incomplete due to delays in reporting of data on certain
entities such as health care and cultural institutions.
58.
Work on the implementation of GFSM 2001 framework is well under way, although
full implementation may take several years. The work done by the GGSWG will in future
improve the transparency of compilation methods and improve the quality and consistency of
reported data. Similarly, the development of electronic accounting and reporting systems
within the MOF could improve the compilation and availability of fiscal statistics.

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary statistics
59.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) reports analytically useful data on a regular and
timely basis to the Fund with minimal delay. High-frequency data (every ten days) on the
central bank balance sheet and the monetary survey are also available with minimal delay. As
a member of the European Union, Poland is in the process of adopting the recommendations
of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the compilation of its monetary statistics. The
monetary statistics from March 2002 are generally consistent with the ECB framework. The
authorities have also revised the historical data to December 1996.
60.
The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
mission to Warsaw in January 2003 found that the concepts and definitions used by the NBP
to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the guidelines outlined in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Nevertheless, the following concepts
and principles underlying valuation and classification of financial instruments deviate from
the MFSM: (i) financial derivatives are indistinguishably recorded under other assets/other
liabilities; (ii) accrued interest on loans and deposits are included as part of other assets/other
liabilities, but not with the respective underlying instruments; (iii) similarly accrued interest
on securities other than shares issued by the depository corporations are included as part of
other liabilities; (iv) loan-loss provisions are classified as special reserves under capital
accounts and reserves; and (v) valuation of shares and other equity on the asset side of the
balance sheets of the NBP and other depository corporations are not in market prices.
Notwithstanding the fact that the first three practices noted above differ from the MFSM
guidelines, the compilation of monetary statistics are in conformity with the ECB
framework.
61.
The data presented on the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository
corporations provide an insufficient breakdown of the claims on, and liabilities to, the
government and other resident sectors. It is impossible to derive net claims on general
government or central government on a consistent basis from the published data. Similarly,
interbank positions between the NBP and other depository corporations cannot be identified.
There are material differences between government finance statistics, financing data and the
corresponding monetary data. The data module ROSC mission recommended that the NBP,
in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, reconcile monetary and government finance
statistics and carry out the reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
External sector statistics
62.
While improvements have been made in the balance of payments data, some issues
need to be addressed. While there are valid differences in definitions between the customs
(GUS) and payment-based trade data compiled by the NBP, the two data sources need to be
cross-checked for broad consistency. The NBP now reports net foreign assets (NFA) rather
than the net international reserves (NIR) previously shown in the monetary survey. In
contrast to NIR, NFA includes less liquid foreign assets and liabilities. Finally, the coverage

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

and reporting of the stock of external debt, especially at maturities up to one year, could be
improved.
63.
The 2003 data module ROSC mission recommended that Poland move to a
transaction-based monthly balance of payments, include interest on an accrued basis, make
explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of payments statistics,
separate insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b. adjustment, publish on a
regular basis a reconciliation table between international merchandise trade statistics and
“goods” in the balance of payments, and undertake periodic revision studies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Susan Schadler
July 20, 2005
1.
This statement reviews developments in Poland since the preparation of the staff
report for the 2005 Article IV consultation. The additional information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Economic developments continue to present a mixed and rather difficult to
interpret picture.
•

The deceleration of exports of goods and services (in US$) continued in May. Exports
increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized (quarter-on quarter) rate of 3.7 percent
in the three months through May (down from 13.9 percent in April), while imports
grew at 8.1 percent (on the same basis). The slowdown in exports is somewhat more
pronounced than projected by staff.

•

Industrial sales (in real terms), however, picked up strongly in the three months
through June, increasing at a seasonally adjusted annualized (quarter-on quarter) rate
of 11.4 percent (up from -1.4 percent in May). Manufacturing sales and construction
activity showed similar rebounds.

•

CPI inflation was 1.6 percent in the three months through June (seasonally adjusted
annualized quarter-on quarter), slightly lower than projected by staff.

•

Labor costs in the corporate sector jumped in recent months, but it is too early to tell
if this is due to one-off effects, delayed adjustment to decelerating inflation and
production (until May), or genuine wage pressures. Nominal unit labor costs in
manufacturing increased at a seasonally adjusted quarter-on quarter annualized rate of
12.2 percent in the three months to May, up from about 7 percent in the three months
to March. Nominal wages in the enterprise sector rose at a seasonally adjusted
quarter-on-quarter annualized rate of 5 percent in the quarter to June, up from
2.7 percent in the quarter to May.

-2-

•

Unemployment continued to fall in May, dropping to 18.4 percent (seasonally
adjusted). Seasonally adjusted employment in the enterprise sector, however,
remained unchanged during February through June.

3.
In June, the MPC cut policy rates by 50 basis points for the third time this year
and adopted an easing bias. The central policy rate now stands at 5 percent. Despite the cut,
the zloty remained broadly stable against the euro. Financial markets are pricing in further
reduction in interest rates amounting to about 75 basis points by the end of 2005.
4.
In a pre-election environment, several pieces of legislation have been passed by
one of the houses of Parliament and if they survive the rest of the legislative process,
they would have negative economic and fiscal implications. Legislative actions initiated
by MPs, and opposed by the government, would: change the formula for indexing the
minimum wage with the aim of gradually raising the minimum wage to half of the average
wage; cap the interest and other costs lenders can charge on loans, despite opposition from
the NBP; postpone the planned curtailment of access to early retirement (official estimates
put the total cost to the budget of this change in 2007-10 at about 1½ percent of GDP); and
allow individuals to reclaim part of the VAT paid on construction and refurbishment
materials to compensate for the increase in the rate following EU accession (the MoF
estimates that the total cost of this legislation would be about ½ percent of GDP in 20062009, when the refunds could be claimed). None of these pieces of legislation has entered
into force pending approval by both houses of Parliament and the President.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Poland
On July 22, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.1
Background
In 2004 annual growth reached 5½ percent, with a surge in growth in the run-up to EU
accession dissipating in the second half of 2004. Both domestic and net external demand
contributed to the slowdown. Consumption and inventory accumulation had supported output
growth as contribution of net external demand diminished, but by mid-2004 these sources of
demand growth slackened. Private fixed investment has lagged behind the cycle, indicating
that potential investors remained cautious. Strong corporate profits thus translated mostly into
an accumulation of financial assets and a reduction in bank credit to the corporate sector.
Export growth, which led the 2002–03 recovery, hit a soft spot in mid 2004, but by end-year
had rebounded to annual rates of about 40 percent despite the slackening demand in Western
Europe and the appreciation of the zloty during the second half of the year. Preliminary official
data for the first quarter of 2005 show flat domestic demand, mostly owing to a decline in
highly import intensive investment and inventory—with little immediate negative effect on
domestic production.
The recovery has started to produce jobs, but the employment rate remains low owing to
structural rigidities and demographic pressures. The Russia crisis and the rapid appreciation of
the zloty in 2001 created two large waves of job destruction as a baby-boom generation
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

entered the labor market. Job creation was stymied by supply side problems—skill
mismatches, immobility between regions, and disincentives to work—while demand was
weakened by the cycle, poor infrastructure particularly in high unemployment regions, and high
non-wage costs of employment. Thus, the employment rate, which was close to the euro area
average until 1998, is now 52 percent—the lowest in the EU. These developments have their
counterpart in impressive productivity gains during the recovery, and, as high unemployment
has kept wage growth low, falling unit labor costs.
Resource constraints have not been evident in either inflation or the current account. A pickup
in nominal wage growth combined with a sizable upward shift in food prices resulting from the
full liberalization of agricultural exports and high oil prices created price pressures. Monetary
policy reacted swiftly with a cumulative 125-basis point rate hike during June-August. This,
together with apparently tame inflation expectations, a deceleration of demand, contained
inflation and wage increases. Meanwhile the current account deficit narrowed for the year as a
whole. Against export growth which on average was strong, import growth picked up modestly
with investment.
Fiscal policy remained adrift in 2004. Adding EU-accession related spending to a cut in the
corporate tax rate and upward drift in non-discretionary spending resulted in a sizable (though
lower-than-initially projected) procyclical rise in the general government deficit . Despite strong
efforts of the Belka government to secure Parliamentary approval of fiscal reforms (Hausner
Plan), about a third (in terms of potential savings) of the plan was implemented. Some key
reforms—reform of the farmer pension scheme, closing social security contribution loopholes
and reining in disability programs were among the unsuccessful—though pre-retirement
benefits were reined in and pension indexation rules were changed. Notwithstanding the large
deficit, a renewal of the privatization program alongside the zloty appreciation and strong
growth resulted in the first drop in the debt ratio in four years.
Despite low inflation, long-term interest rates rose sharply in mid-2003 and a two-year
depreciation of the zloty persisted following the announcement of an expansionary 2004
budget. But the simultaneous EU accession, formation of the pro-reform Belka government,
and signs of stronger-than expected budgetary developments (including privatization) turned
financial markets strongly positive during 2004. Thus despite narrowing interest rate
differentials vis-à-vis the euro and the dollar, the zloty appreciated through early 2005.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They congratulated the Polish
authorities on a successful first year in the European Union. They noted the positive market
reactions to the government’s efforts to contain the budget deficit and gain parliamentary
approval of fiscal reforms, reinvigorate privatization, and improve debt management. Directors
agreed that the many strengths of Poland’s macroeconomic position provide a basis for
sustained high growth in the future.
At the same time, Directors noted that the stalling of growth momentum since mid-2004 might
reflect remaining impediments to growth. While the slowdown from the heady growth rates a
year ago is likely to be temporary if underlying conditions remain broadly favorable, it had
dampened hopes that Poland had entered a period of substantially higher investment and

-3-

growth sufficient to make a serious dent in its strikingly low employment rate. Directors
therefore emphasized that more needs to be done to enable the economy to achieve its full
potential, building on the steps already taken in recent years. This requires a strong
commitment to fiscal and structural reforms aimed at ensuring long-term sustainability of public
finances, enhancing the flexibility of the economy, particularly in the labor market, and
improving the business climate. These steps should also help secure a favorable setting for
euro adoption.
Directors felt that the immediate post-election period offers a window of opportunity for fiscal
consolidation and expenditure reform. They encouraged the authorities to consider further
steps to keep the fiscal deficit and the public debt ratio on a downward track, while protecting
investment plans envisaged in the convergence program. In this regard, Directors stressed
that the most important macroeconomic challenge for the next government would be to set
clear medium-term fiscal policy goals and secure parliamentary support for them. Achieving
these targets in a manner that would enhance growth potential requires a well-formulated
fiscal strategy, focused on a restructuring of poorly-targeted social transfers, as well as the
reform of the farmers’ pension scheme and the disability program. The positive economic
impact of such reforms could be further supported by a well-designed tax reform, aimed at
simplifying the tax system in a revenue-neutral manner. The proposals for single-rate personal
and corporate income and value-added taxes from both sides of the political spectrum provide
a good starting point. Directors urged the authorities to resist the adoption of recent preelection legislative initiatives that would hinder fiscal consolidation in the medium term.
Directors agreed that a fiscal responsibility law would help buttress political resolve and bring
forward the beneficial effects of fiscal consolidation. Such a law should encompass a fiscal
rule, ideally an expenditure rule, to supplement the current constitutional public debt limit; a
requirement to supplement the budget with rolling three-year budget projections; and
transparency requirements, including norms for independent assessment of macroeconomic
assumptions and fiscal projections.
Directors emphasized that a multi-pronged approach to job creation is essential to address
Poland’s persistently high unemployment rate. On the fiscal front, Directors stressed the
importance of reducing the tax wedge on labor and reforming the social benefit system to
remove disincentives to work. In the labor market, Directors called on the authorities to further
enhance flexibility and increase labor participation, particularly by making the minimum wage
less binding for low-skill and young workers, differentiating it across regions, and removing
unduly restrictive regulation of regular labor contracts. In this context, they expressed concern
about the recent legislative initiative to increase the minimum wage relative to the average
wage.
Directors considered it imperative that the new government complete the process of
privatization, particularly for the financial and energy sectors, to ensure the long-term viability
of companies within the competitive environment of the EU. They welcomed the progress
made in privatizing the largest commercial bank and attached particular importance to setting
a timetable for its full privatization.
Directors felt that a credible commitment to early euro adoption could amplify the potential
benefits of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. They also agreed that euro adoption

-4-

would bring substantial benefits for trade and output growth, provided that the budget deficit
remains well below the Maastricht limit, the conversion rate affords strong competitiveness,
inflation is low, and labor market flexibility improves. Directors stressed that the new
government should work closely with the social partners and the National Bank of Poland to
reach an agreement on a timetable for euro adoption and secure broad support for required
reforms.
Directors commended the authorities for their timely action to stabilize inflation expectations
following the inflation fillip in 2004. Given the benign inflation outlook, they considered the
recent interest rate cuts as appropriate. Looking ahead, Directors agreed that the inflation
targeting framework continues to serve Poland well until ERM2 entry. They encouraged the
authorities to gear interest rate decisions toward keeping inflation within a symmetric band
around the inflation target to limit undue upward pressure on the zloty in the approach to
ERM2. The Monetary Policy Council was also advised to improve the communication of its
views and future policy intentions to markets. Directors noted steps to develop capacity for
foreign exchange market intervention in preparation for ERM2, but stressed that such
intervention should be avoided in the interim period. While agreeing that Poland’s
competitiveness is not a problem for the near term, Directors underscored the importance of
basing ongoing assessments of competitiveness on a careful analysis of the medium- to
longer-term outlook.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in banking sector performance and noted the
encouraging prospects for their continuation. They also welcomed the halt in the trend
increase in foreign currency lending. To preserve these achievements, they encouraged the
authorities to continue to carefully monitor trends in foreign currency lending and banks’
lending policies and to take early action if necessary. Efforts to address institutional
weaknesses, including in the commercial court system, should also help improve the
soundness of the financial sector.
Notwithstanding the improvements EU accession had brought about in statistics, Directors
encouraged the authorities to make further efforts to strengthen quarterly national accounts
and fiscal accounts for the general government.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Andrzej Raczko, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Poland
and Marcin Piatkowski, Advisor to Executive Director
July 22, 2005

We would like to thank staff for the high quality report and background papers and for the
excellent cooperation with our authorities. We share staff’s opinion that the first year of
Poland’s membership in the European Union was a success. Economic growth returned to the
long-term path, exports surged, inflation – aside from the one-off post-accession spike – was
low, unemployment went down, and FDI went up. As a result, the past year significantly
contributed to advancing the income convergence with the EU. Nonetheless, our authorities
are aware that the long-term convergence will crucially depend on maintaining
macroeconomic stability and implementing further structural reforms. Broadly in line with
staff’s recommendations, the authorities are hence committed to pursue further fiscal
adjustment, continue structural reforms, increase employment, and accede to the euro zone as
soon as the preconditions have been met.
Recent economic developments and prospects
After the economic slowdown in 2001-02, in 2004 the recovery further strengthened. Despite
weaker growth in the euro zone, GDP expanded by 5.4 percent thanks to buoyant exports,
rising private consumption, and growth in gross capital formation. The first half of last year
was particularly strong, as enterprises accumulated inventory in anticipation of price
increases upon EU accession. However, growth slowed in the second half of the year owing
mainly to lower growth in inventory accumulation.
The modest pace of GDP growth continued in the first quarter of 2005 due to slower-thanexpected acceleration in growth of fixed investment. Given the historically high capacity
utilization, high corporate profitability and accumulated savings, declining interest rates, and
lower corporate tax burden, the behavior of fixed investment remains somewhat of a puzzle.
Nonetheless, we agree with staff that the growth in fixed investment should significantly
strengthen in the second half of 2005 because of a reduction in political uncertainty upon the
formation of a new government, decline in interest rates, more stable exchange rate,
increasing FDI, and continued improvement in relative unit labor costs. As noted by staff,
growth in fixed investment should also be helped by the cyclical rebound after the period of
underinvestment in 2000-02, the launching of infrastructure projects supported by EU
structural and cohesion funds, and the new law on public-private partnerships.
Growth in fixed investment, complemented by a steady increase in private consumption and
the continuation of double-digit growth in exports, is projected to contribute to a GDP
growth rate for the whole year 2005 of slightly below 4 percent. Going forward, a robust
growth rate exceeding 4 percent a year is projected for 2006 and 2007. It will be underpinned
by rising private consumption and growing fixed investment. Private consumption, which has
held a remarkably stable 3 percent growth rate since 1999, will be additionally stimulated by
increasing employment, rising real wages, and growing consumer borrowing spurred by
historically low interest rates and low level of household debt. The contribution of net

-2exports is projected to gradually decline, as recovery in fixed investment will stimulate
imports.
However, the current account deficit will remain low at below 3 percent of GDP in 2005-06.
It is projected to be fully financed by inflows of FDI, portfolio capital, and EU funds.
Official foreign reserves in 2005-06 will remain at a sufficient level, covering more than four
months of imports. Comfortable external position is underpinned by an easy access to
international capital markets, best evidenced by several successful bond transactions in the
first half of 2005 (for a total value of about USD10 billion), including the recent placement
of a 50-year EUR500 million bond yielding only 38 bps over mid-rate euro swaps.
Fiscal policy
While the headline general government deficit (according to ESA-95) increased from 4.5 in
2003 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2004, this increase mainly reflected the direct budgetary
impact of EU accession, i.e. the contribution to the EU budget and co-financing for EU
funded projects, which added almost 1.2 percent of GDP to the overall deficit. The budget
deficit in 2004 turned out to be lower than projected thanks to the economic recovery but also
due to such factors as strict control over the expenditures, simplification of the tax system,
improved debt management, and lower payments on state guarantees. Lower deficit has been
achieved despite large uncertainty as to the impact of EU accession-related change in the
VAT settlement, loss of customs revenue, and the implementation of significant tax reforms
(reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 27 to 19 percent and extension of the flat
CIT rate to business income earned by individuals).
In 2004, the authorities succeeded in implementing a number of fiscal measures stipulated in
the Hausner Plan. These measures resulted, among others, in the reduction of costs of public
administration and lower spending on defense. The Program also improved long-term fiscal
sustainability by reforming disability payments and implementing an important change in the
pension indexation formula by linking it to the increase in CPI. The implementation of the
Hausner Plan, although falling short of the government’s expectations due to insufficient
political support, has contributed to stabilizing public debt and helped advance the fiscal
adjustment that is indispensable to allow Poland to exit from the EU’s excessive deficit
procedure and thus meet the relevant Maastricht criterion by 2007. Despite somewhat less
favorable macroeconomic environment, the implementation of the 2005 budget is broadly on
track thanks to the continued spending discipline and lower costs of public debt, rising
corporate tax revenue, and higher revenue from dividends. Based on the performance of
budget revenues and expenditures so far in the year, it is even likely that the deficit for the
whole year will be by about 0.2 percent of GDP lower than budgeted. This is noteworthy
given the political pressures of the election year.
The assumptions for the 2006 budget set the state budget deficit in the range of 28-34 billion
zloty, down from the 35 billion zloty budgeted for 2005. This translates into a decrease in
budget deficit by 0.3 to 0.9 percent of GDP, keeping Poland on the fiscal adjustment path
stipulated in the Convergence Program.

-3The public debt to GDP ratio declined between 2003 and 2004 thanks to faster growth,
revenues from privatization, and appreciation of the zloty. In 2005, public debt is projected to
reach about 53 percent of GDP (based on the very conservative Polish definition of the debt).
According to the Public Finance Law, when the public debt exceeds 50 percent of GDP, the
government is obliged to submit a budget with a ratio of the budget deficit to revenues that is
not higher than in the preceding year. The assumptions for the 2006 budget fully meet this
requirement. If the public debt exceeds 55 percent, in line with the fiscal rule imposed by the
Public Finance Law additional fiscal measures would have to be implemented to reach a de
facto primary budget surplus. The ensuing fiscal adjustment would stabilize public debt
below the 60 percent threshold stipulated in the Polish Constitution.
Nonetheless, the authorities are aware of the vulnerability of public debt to shocks, as shown
in the staff report. The DSA scenario, however, is based on assumed shocks whose
probability of occurring is low given the economic outlook. The assumed 2.75 percent drop
in the growth rate in 2006-07 does not seem probable. Also, the staff's projections do not take
into account the expected positive impact of the convergence process on the interest rates and
the authorities’ response to a potential breaching of the 55 percent debt threshold.
Our authorities welcome the staff’s recommendations for the medium-term budgeting
framework, which would strengthen the existing fiscal rules and make fiscal policies more
predictable over time but the decision whether to implement such recommendations will need
to be taken by the new government.
Monetary policy
After a significant decline in 2003, inflation accelerated in the first half of 2004 due to a
temporary impact of EU accession, which resulted in increasing food prices, higher indirect
taxes, and stronger domestic demand. This effect was additionally boosted by increasing oil
prices. To mitigate the risk of second round effects on inflation, the Monetary Policy Council
raised interest rates in the second half of the year by cumulative 1.25 percentage points. As a
result of the dissipation of the EU accession price shock, timely intervention of the MPC, and
strong appreciation of the zloty, inflation declined significantly and recently moved even
below the continuous inflation target of 2.5 percent +/- 1.
In response to slower economic growth in the first half of 2005, and in view of the benign
inflation outlook, the MPC cut interest rates by a total of 1.5 percentage point and adopted an
easing bias. The inflation rate in the remaining months of 2005 and for the whole of 2006 is
expected to stay below the target of 2.5 percent.
With regard to joining the EMU, since 2004 the Working Group established by the Ministry
of Finance and the NBP has been working on a strategy for joining the ERM-II and the euro
area. The feasibility of joining the EMU will largely depend on implementing fiscal
consolidation in line with the Convergence Program. This may require adopting some
additional fiscal adjustment measures, in particular in view of the expiration of the transition
period for the classification of the open pension funds that is envisaged for March 2007. It is
also worth emphasizing that the authorities do not view the Maastricht criteria as objectives

-4in themselves, but rather as useful tools in ensuring fiscal sustainability and sound long-term
growth prospects.
Structural reforms
Poland continues to make progress in structural reforms. Thanks to the full adoption of EU
regulations, implementation of the Economic Freedom Act, which substantially cut
administrative burden on enterprises, and reduction in corporate taxes, the business climate
improved. The World Bank’s “Doing Business in 2005” survey classified Poland among the
top 10 reformers in 2003.
Nevertheless, a number of structural challenges remain to be resolved. These in particular
relate to the high structural unemployment and the low employment ratio. We broadly share
staff’s assessment of the situation in the labor market and their recommendations for policy
actions. In fact, during the last couple of years the authorities have undertaken a number of
initiatives, as described in staff’s papers, which are closely aligned with staff’s
recommendations. Along with faster growth, these initiatives contributed to the decline in
unemployment from 20.0 percent in 2003 to 19.1 percent in 2004, and to projected 17.5
percent by the end of this year.
Going forward, the authorities aim to follow up on the recent initiatives by strengthening the
50+ Program to increase labor participation of older workers and ease labor market entry for
the youth by expanding the successful First Job program. In addition, earlier this month the
lower chamber of the parliament adopted a new bill that should increase employment by
significantly reducing the tax wedge on newly registered self-employment. However, any
further reduction in the tax wedge will be subjected to the overarching goal of achieving the
planned fiscal consolidation.
As a result of these initiatives, the unemployment rate is projected to decrease to 16.5 percent
in 2006 and to 15.0 percent in 2007, while the employment ratio should exceed 53 percent.
These trends will be helped by the improving quality of human capital (between 1991 and
2004 the tertiary scholarization ratio almost quadrupled from 13.1 to 47.0 percent and
exceeded the EU average), fading of the demographic boom (labor supply will decline to 100
thousand in 2006 versus 215 thousand on average per year between 2000 and 2005), slowing
labor shedding in restructuring enterprises, EU-funded improvements in infrastructure, which
should enhance labor mobility, and higher spending on active labor market policies.
Reduction in the access to pre-retirement and disability benefits adopted within the
framework of the Hausner Plan should further add to increasing employment.
The pension reform implemented in 1999, which replaced the earlier pay-as-you-go system
(PAYG) with a three-pillar scheme, should also gradually improve the situation in the labor
market by providing incentives for longer working life. In turn, raising employment is crucial
to improve the sustainability of the new pension system, as shown in the excellent Selected
Issues paper. While the projected deficits of the first pillar will last longer than originally
projected, it needs to be borne in mind that without the reform the fiscal position under the
old PAYG pension system would only deteriorate with time thus undermining the long-term
fiscal sustainability and growth prospects. Contrary to this, the new system promises to start

-5generating surpluses rather than deficits after 2040. Moreover, the pension reform enhances
transparency of the long-term fiscal position by clarifying future public pension liabilities,
provides opportunities for higher return on accumulated pension assets, and contributes to the
development of financial markets and thus – indirectly – to economic growth.
Financial sector
Our authorities welcome staff’s largely favorable assessment of the domestic financial sector.
In 2004, the banking sector’s profitability increased sharply, capital position strengthened,
and loan quality improved. With regard to the issue of household foreign currency
borrowing, in 2004 the share of foreign currency borrowing in total lending decreased for
both the household and corporate sector. Notwithstanding this improvement, banking
supervision encouraged banks to adopt higher collateral requirements for foreign currency
denominated loans, particularly in mortgage lending, and strengthen credit risk analysis.
Together with declining interest rates on borrowing in domestic currency, these measures
should contribute to a further reduction in the share of foreign currency loans in total lending.
Recent legislation of the Parliament
As the staff’s Supplement informs, the Parliament has recently debated a number of its own
legislative initiatives, currently in various stages of the parliamentary approval process,
which could negatively affect fiscal and economic policies. At this stage, given the
uncertainty concerning the final approval of these initiatives by both chambers of the
Parliament and by the President, it is still not possible to assess their fiscal consequences.
The government is strongly against all new legislative proposals that would have large fiscal
consequences and tries to use all available legal means to prevent their final adoption.
