KEY ISSUES
The Swiss economy has regained momentum, but inflation remains close to zero. There
has been no new foreign exchange intervention, but past safe haven inflows have not
yet reversed despite improved market confidence toward the euro area and tapering in
the United States. Notwithstanding policy action, risks in the mortgage market remain
elevated. The large systemic banks have continued to strengthen capital and restructure
their business models, but the financial sector reform agenda is still incomplete.
Exchange Rate Policy: The exchange rate floor remains a necessary element of the
monetary policy framework, as inflation is still close to the bottom of the range
compatible with the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) definition of price stability and renewed
exchange rate appreciation, as might arise from a new bout of safe haven inflows, would
quickly bring back deflationary pressures.
The Mortgage Market: With monetary conditions remaining accommodative and
housing prices growing faster than incomes, measures to curb mortgage demand
especially from the more vulnerable households need to be strengthened.
The Banking Sector: Cooperation agreements with key foreign supervisors need to be
reached to make the large banks resolvable. More resources are required for prudential
bank supervision, and closer oversight and guidance to auditors performing supervisory
audits are necessary. Deposit insurance should be brought in line with emerging
international best practices.

CONTEXT
1.

The Swiss economy has regained momentum, but monetary and exchange rate

conditions have not normalized. While growth is healthy and the pass-through from past
appreciation has mostly run its course, inflation is still only barely positive. Though no foreign
exchange market intervention has taken place since 2012, the currency has remained close to the
floor imposed by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in 2011 to contain deflationary pressures,
notwithstanding improved market confidence toward the euro area and tapering in the United
States. With the policy rate at zero and abundant excess liquidity, imbalances in the mortgage
market continue to build though at a somewhat slower pace than last year.
2.

In the medium term, aspects of the current economic model will be questioned. The

role of Switzerland as a center for global wealth management is being challenged by the progressive
erosion of bank secrecy. Under international pressure, the authorities need to reform parts of the
current system of corporate taxation, which de facto give favorable tax treatment to income from
foreign operations and have helped attract many multinational corporations. A recent popular vote
approved curbs on immigration, putting in jeopardy the free movement of labor agreement and,
possibly, broader cooperation agreements with the European Union (EU), by far Switzerland’s largest
trading partner. Lower immigration would also accelerate population aging.
3.

The large banking sector is resilient and considerable regulatory reforms have been

implemented after the crisis. The size and reach of the financial sector extend well beyond the
Swiss borders, as the country is host to some of the largest and most globalized banks and
insurance companies in the world. The 2014 FSAP Update finds that the position of the financial
sector has improved markedly since the Global Financial Crisis, and recommends additional
measures to strengthen the regulatory framework, prudential oversight, and the safety net to further
improve the soundness and resilience of the system.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. GDP Growth Has Accelerated and Inflation Is Still Close to Zero
4.

Driven by domestic demand, the economy grew briskly in 2013. Output expanded at

2.0 percent in 2013, up from 1 percent in 2012 (Figure 1). Private consumption continued to grow
steadily as wage increases and negative inflation raised real disposable income; construction saw a
strong rebound, while an improving external environment turned the external sector’s contribution
to growth to positive. The lagged effects of the 2012 slowdown pushed the unemployment rate up
to 3.2 percent, still low in international comparison. Labor supply was boosted by net immigration of
some 1 percent of the population, the highest since 2008.

5.

After two years of deflation, price growth is hovering around zero. As the pass-through

from past exchange rate appreciation has abated, negative inflation from foreign goods and services
has been offset by positive inflation from domestic goods and services. Inflation expectations
(measured by consensus forecasts) have come down somewhat but are still well anchored in
positive territory.
6.

A significant and sustained net reversal of safe haven capital inflows has not occurred,

including because of intermittent waves of global financial turbulence. The reduction in euro
area tail risks, accompanied by nascent signs of a Europe-wide recovery, allowed the franc to trade
in a 1.22–1.25 band relative to the euro during
July 2012–April 2013, somewhat above the 1.2 floor.

7.

The banking sector is exhibiting divergent trends. The balance sheets of the two large

banks continue to shrink as the banks strive to meet new regulatory requirements. Meanwhile,
domestically-oriented banks have grown substantially, fuelled by increases in real estate lending,
and becoming increasingly exposed to a possible sharp price correction and higher interest rates.

to-let sector is a source of concern. On the
corporations has remained subdued and there
are no indications of stretched corporate
balance sheets, with default rates and credit
ratings stable.

C. The Fiscal Deficit and Debt Are Low
9.
Anchored in strong fiscal rules and discipline, the fiscal position is healthy. The general
government’s budget was close to balance in 2013, as small deficits at the federal and cantonal level
were offset by a surplus in the social security funds. The federal balance deteriorated somewhat
relative to 2012 because of higher subsidies, grants, and social benefits, but deficits in cantons and
municipalities were reduced from the previous year. Previous reforms to unemployment insurance
and a VAT increase earmarked for invalidity pensions allowed the social security funds to remain in
surplus.
10.
In 2014, the fiscal stance is expected to be broadly neutral. The general government
should record a small deficit largely reflecting the lack of a profit distribution from the SNB and oneoff restructuring contributions towards cantonal pension funds. Going forward, cantonal finances
will be under some pressure because of the continuing need to raise the funding ratio of cantonal
pension funds and changes in the hospital financing scheme. In addition, the corporate tax reform
which is envisaged to enter into force as of 2018 is likely to lead to a revenue loss for cantons (see
below). To prepare for the potential revenue loss as part of the burden sharing agreement with
cantons, the federal government plans to restrain spending and implement a consolidation package.
All in all, the structural balance should remain close to zero beyond 2014, with deficits at the
cantons and communes level offset by surpluses in the federal government and social security
funds. The debt-to-GDP ratio should fall to 44 percent of GDP in 2017 (on a GFSM-basis). From a
medium-term perspective, spending pressures will arise from population aging and peak at about
4 percent of GDP by 2055.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.

The recovery is expected to be robust. Looking ahead, in the baseline scenario recovering

external demand and a stable exchange rate will provide impetus to exports and investment, while
private consumption growth will moderate somewhat in line with modest real wage developments.
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

The economy should grow at 2.1 percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2015, while inflation should
continue to rise gradually and the output gap will progressively close.
12.

Risks to the outlook stem from spillovers from international developments, the

domestic mortgage market, and the large financial sector.1 A strengthening in the global
recovery would bring positive spillovers through higher external demand. Negative spillovers might
arise if exit from UMP is disorderly and causes surges in global market volatility, leading to renewed
safe haven inflows and forcing the SNB to intervene again. Protracted turmoil in emerging markets
might also rekindle the attractiveness of Switzerland as a safe haven, as might a re-emergence of
financial stress in the euro area because of significant policy slippages or adverse economic shocks.
13.

A domestic source of risk is the mortgage market, where imbalances have been

building since 2007 though at a slower pace than in typical housing bubble episodes
(Figure 3). Domestically-oriented banks are especially vulnerable given their high and relatively
undiversified exposure to domestic mortgages. Stress tests performed in the FSAP Update found
these banks to be well capitalized under all scenarios, including a housing crash scenario. However,
the analysis was limited by the lack of access to supervisory data on individual banks, and hence
could not assess individual bank vulnerabilities.
14.

In addition, despite progress the two large banks remain highly leveraged and

interconnected. FSAP stress tests indicate that these banks comfortably exceed capital
requirements under all adverse scenarios when applying the phase-in of Basel III rules, but under the
most severe macroeconomic scenario capital ratios could fall below the 7 percent threshold under a
fully implemented Basel III capital definition.2 As the banks are globally interconnected, they are a
potential source of outward spillovers and vulnerable to inward spillover from instability in global
financial markets. The FSAP analysis finds that these risks are contained at the moment, and outward
adverse spillovers measured as the contribution of the Swiss large banks to the vulnerability of other
global banks have decreased significantly in recent months.3 Possible financial-sovereign spillovers
are also a concern given the large size of the financial sector relative to the economy. In addition,
some cantonal banks have explicit funding guarantees and are large relative to the cantonal
economy. Stress tests conducted as part of the FSAP indicate that existing capital buffers in the
banking sector should be sufficient to absorb losses from severe macroeconomic shocks, suggesting
limited fiscal contingent liabilities. The FSAP analysis also finds that contagion from banks to
sovereign seems contained at present, owing to stronger capital buffers, fading concerns about tail
events in the euro zone, and lower risk aversion among investors. Concerning the risk of illiquidity,
1

Under a fully implemented Basel III capital definition, breach of the CET1 ratio of 7 percent threshold would trigger
the conversion of contingent capital and recovery measures according to the Swiss framework.

almost all banks satisfy the LCR requirement thanks in part to the unusually high amount of deposits
at the central bank.

The authorities’ view
15.

The authorities were more sanguine than staff on the baseline scenario, but agreed

about the main risk factors. Growth forecasts were aligned for 2014, but a stronger acceleration
was envisaged in 2015. The authorities agreed with staff that growth prospects are subject to
considerable uncertainty in light of economic developments in the euro area and emerging markets
against the backdrop of exit from the unconventional monetary policies in major advanced
economies.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. External Sector Assessment
16.

Overall, the Swiss current account surplus remained large in 2013, but its exact size

will not be known until later in the year (Figure 4). Preliminary estimates of the current account
balance for 2013 indicate a surplus of 13 percent of GDP, a 3.4 percent of GDP increase over 2012.
The goods balance improved slightly, consistent

While the assessment remains difficult due to accounting and other anomalies, staff

views the current account as broadly in line with fundamentals. Model-based analysis suggests
that a large the current account surplus is consistent with Switzerland’s high per capita income,
financial center structure, and demographics. In addition, no distortions that would result in
excessive saving or insufficient investment are evident, and, as noted in past consultations, the
surplus is somewhat larger than the norm, but this divergence can be accounted for by various
anomalies that tend to overstate the surplus. For instance, merchant services, i.e. services by
international commodity trading companies based in Switzerland, have become important over the
last decade, contributing around 3 percent of GDP to the current account surplus in recent years,
though some of these companies have only limited activities in Switzerland. Second, Swiss
8

SWITZERLAND

multinationals firms are often partly owned by foreigners through portfolio shares. Thus, a part of
the retained earnings of these companies, which form a large component of Swiss current account
receipts, should be attributed to foreign shareholders, rather than counted as domestic income.
Third, cross-border shopping, i.e. direct purchases by households while abroad or mail/courier
deliveries from abroad, may not be fully reflected in imports. Finally, Switzerland, like other low-tax
financial centers that host large multinational corporations and their affiliates, is susceptible to
attempts by those firms to minimize their taxes by booking profits in the country, which would result
in inflated net exports. However, quantifying this factor is not possible for now.
18.
The franc still remains moderately over-valued, reflecting the legacy of the large real
appreciation during 2008–11. The assessment reflects the estimated 7 percent overvaluation
according to the External Balance Assessment methodology, broadly unchanged since last year. The
REER-ULC has appreciated by 2.6 percent since end-2012, and cumulatively by 1.3 percent since
end-September 2011 (i.e. the first “post-floor” month). With negative inflation differentials vis-à-vis
trading partners disappearing and the nominal exchange rate appreciating in line with the
appreciation of the euro over the last 12 months, the over-valuation is no longer correcting itself.
On the other hand, this moderate overvaluation is no longer having a significant negative effect on
overall external sector performance. If safe haven flows reverse as the crisis effects wane, the real
exchange rate overvaluation should reverse.
The authorities’ view
19.

The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of the current account and

real exchange rate. They agreed that movements in the Swiss current account—due to its special
structure and the various anomalies affecting it—were difficult to interpret and compare with global
norms, and did not necessarily mirror developments in the real exchange rate. They also noted that
the current account statistics will change substantially with the adoption (in June 2014) of the BPM6
methodology. The authorities’ stress that depending on the estimation methodology, the franc’s
overvaluation, which they saw as still burdensome for the export-oriented manufacturing sector,
may be larger than the 7 percent IMF assessment.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
20.

Domestic macroeconomic conditions do not call for a monetary tightening yet and the

risk of resumption in safe haven inflows remains considerable. Although both core and headline
inflation turned slightly positive at end-2013, the recent inflation decline in other advanced
economies and especially the euro area is exerting downward pressures on prices. Also, with the
internationally open labor market stronger domestic activity may not result in wage and price
pressures (though future curbs on immigration may change this in the medium term), while the
money multiplier remains very low. On the other hand, sizable risks remain of renewed pressures on
the franc through a return of safe haven inflows triggered by external events (see Para. 12). Without
the floor, such pressures would translate in a sharp nominal appreciation and a return of deflation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

SWITZERLAND

21.

The floor should remain in place for now to guard against deflationary risks. Going

forward, an appropriate strategy should balance the need to keep inflation expectations well
anchored against the risk of an excessive tightening of monetary conditions through renewed
exchange rate appreciation. Achieving this objective will require careful calibration of
unconventional policy instruments.
In an upside scenario, where the global recovery takes hold and confidence in the euro area



solidifies, past safe haven flows would revert, potentially pushing the franc well above the floor.
In this scenario, concerns about deflation would be muted, so there would be no need for a
large depreciation to drive up inflation. A large depreciation would also be questionable from a
multilateral perspective given the balanced external position. Thus, in this scenario the SNB
should gradually reduce its holdings of foreign exchange reserves, supporting this strategy with
clear communication to avoid market disruption and adverse outward spillovers. As the recovery
takes hold, if inflation threatens to move above comfortable levels, then the SNB should raise
the policy rate. This may become necessary even if the balance sheet has not returned to its precrisis level.
In a more challenging global environment, where exit from UMP by major advanced countries is



disorderly, downside risks to the euro area materialize, or the EM sell-off develops into a fullblown crisis, safe haven inflows may return and a premature exit from the floor would likely
result in a sharp appreciation and renewed deflationary pressures. In this scenario, the SNB
should keep the floor in place and consider imposing a negative interest rate on bank excess
reserves to discourage inflows.
Negative interest rates might also help address deflationary pressures that may arise from



adverse domestic shocks. The impact of negative rates on the economy would need to be
carefully monitored, and macroprudential measures may have to be reinforced to prevent an
exacerbation of mortgage market imbalances.
22.

Risks from the large SNB balance sheet need to be mitigated. These risks were recently

underscored as the SNB announced a sizable valuation loss on gold holdings, triggering the first
suspension of profit transfers to the Confederation and cantons in recent memory. While the buildup of risk provision was stepped up in 2011, it has not kept pace with the increase in the balance
sheet. Going forward, provisioning should receive priority over transfers to the distribution reserve.4

The authorities’ view
23.

The SNB continues to see the exchange rate floor as essential to guarding against the

risk of deflation. It noted the recent multiple downward revisions to its inflation forecast,
4

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

attributing them to weaker euro area inflation and a very protracted pass-through from past
appreciation. The SNB agreed that negative interest rates on banks’ excess reserves were a possible
tool to be deployed if safe have inflows resumed on a significant scale. With regard to the
management of its balance sheet and associated risks, the SNB viewed current profit distribution
arrangements as sufficiently protective of its capital.

C. The Housing Market
24.

Despite measures taken by the authorities, risks in the mortgage and housing markets

continue to build. To address growing imbalances, in 2012 and 2013, the authorities tightened
lending requirements and increased banks’ capital buffers for mortgage risk (Box 1), but the effects
appear to have been small so far. House price increases have slowed down somewhat, as prices for
owner occupied apartments, which had grown by about 6 percent per year on average since 2008,
grew at 4.3 percent (year-on-year) in the second half of 2013. However, limited cooling off effects
can be seen in mortgage lending growth (where mortgages to buy-to-let companies accelerated in
2012–13), or in quantitative lending standards.
Box 1. Measures to Address Developments in the Housing and Mortgage Market
New minimum requirements drawn up by the Swiss Bankers Association recognized by FINMA,
effective mid-2012:


Down payment of 10 percent of the lending value of the property from the borrower's own funds,

which may not be obtained by pledging or early withdrawal of Pillar 2 pension assets;


Mortgages must be paid down to two thirds of the collateral value within a maximum of 20 years.

FINMA tightened rules for risk-weighting new and renewed mortgages for banks applying an internal
ratings-based approach, effective 2013.
Federal Council measures, effective 2013:


Mortgages that do not comply with the new minimum standards are allowed, but subject to a risk

weight of 100 percent;


Mortgages exceeding 80 percent of the property value will have a risk weight of 100 percent

applied to the part of the loan exceeding the 80 percent threshold.
On SNB’s proposal, the Federal Council activated the Counter Cyclical Capital Buffer (CCB). The CCB
applies to risk-weighted positions associated to residential property mortgages in Switzerland. The CCB was
activated to a level of 1 percent CET1 capital by end–September, 2013 and raised to 2 percent in January
2014 (to be fulfilled by end-June, 2014).

25.
The measures taken to address developments in the mortgage and housing markets
are welcome, but have been only partially successful. The recent CCB hike was appropriate, but
its impact may not be sufficient given the comfortable capitalization relative to prudential

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SWITZERLAND

requirements across the domestically oriented banking sector. In addition, existing self-regulation
measures have not been very effective as quantitative lending surveys show no or limited reduction
in debt-to-income ratios (DTIs) or loan-to-value ratios (LTVs). Although the household sector has
substantial financial assets, data on the distribution of wealth and mortgage debt across households
are not available, so there are concerns that vulnerable households may be taking on excessive debt.
26.
Direct regulatory measures targeting affordability and loan-to-value ratios should also
be considered. In an environment where interest rates are likely to remain very low, stronger
measures targeting mortgage demand are needed. If agreement with the industry to tighten selfregulation (in particular, faster amortization and larger cash down payments) cannot be achieved,
then it would be important to introduce direct regulation on maximum DTIs and LTVs.5 Parallel
measures to curb mortgages to income-producing real estate companies should also be put in
place, while supervisors should continue to use Pillar II measures pro-actively to address
concentration and interest rates risks. In addition, tax deductibility of mortgage interest should be
reduced or eliminated.

The authorities’ view
27.
The authorities agree that imbalances have continued to expand though they consider
that the measures taken have had some calming effects. Continued concerns were behind the
recent decision to increase the CCB. The authorities also agreed on the need for further action
targeting the demand side and informed that measures on affordability were under discussion,
including with respect to the buy-to-let segment. If appropriately tight measures could not be
implemented through self-regulation, direct regulation was an option. On the other hand, political
support for a reform of the taxation of mortgage interest was seen as elusive.

D. Financial Stability and Oversight
The TBTF Banks and Cross-Border Resolution
28.
The two large banks continue to strengthen capitalization and restructure their
business models, but the leverage ratios remains low compared to other large global banks. In
2012, both banks stepped up their plans to build high-quality capital, and initiated strategic
restructuring away from parts of investment banking to less capital-intensive wealth management.
The banks are also revising their corporate structure, operations, and business lines to adapt to the
still evolving new regulatory landscape, especially in the U.S. and the U.K., where they have
important activities, and divergent approaches by regulators are an obstacle to the global
management of liquidity and capital. At end-2013 both banks were already above the 10 percent
5

There is cross-country evidence that DTI limits can be effective in curbing real estate and mortgage booms (e.g.;

minimum CET1 capital ratio in the Swiss Too-Big-Too-Fail (TBTF) legislation to be met by 2019. The
progress in increasing the leverage ratio, however, has been slower; both banks are below the fullyimplemented Swiss minimum leverage ratio and lag behind most other large global banks based on
other leverage measures (Figure 5). On the other hand, the liquidity position is strong, with the Basel
III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) exceeded at end-2013. Both
banks were profitable in 2013, but potential costs from various legal risks (e.g. mortgage mis-selling
and aiding tax evasion in the United States, illegal trading activity in LIBOR and foreign exchange
markets) weighed on the results.
29.
Given the special risks posed by their size, the two large banks should rapidly bring
their leverage ratio in line with that of other major international banks. In light of the size of
the two large banks relative to the economy, the authorities should ensure that minimum
requirements in terms of leverage are more ambitious than minimum international standards both
in terms of level and of the quality of capital. For the large banks, the current Swiss total capital
leverage ratio minimum is above the envisaged 3 percent Basel. However, a substantial portion of
the Swiss requirement can be held as CoCos, which are not necessarily Tier 1 capital. In addition, the
ongoing examination by FINMA of how risk-weights in internal models differ from those under the
standard approach is welcome, and model approval decisions should be reviewed in cases where
such differences are large. In this context, FINMA should be commended for demanding higher risk
weighted assets for operational risk from the two large banks.
30.
Making the TBTF resolution regime robust and workable cross-border should be a
priority to ensure financial and economic stability. Work should continue with the banks and key
host authorities to finalize a viable strategy that would make the largest banks resolvable without
government support. Reaching a cooperation agreement with the U.S. and U.K. authorities, the two
key jurisdictions for the Swiss TBTF banks, would be a very welcome achievement.

The authorities’ view
31.
The authorities emphasized that capital regulation will remain tighter than
international standards. On the regulatory leverage ratio, the authorities noted that Switzerland is
ahead of the field as it already has a minimum leverage ratio in place. It was furthermore noted that
as the Basel III definition of leverage is finalized, it will be ensured that the objective of having
tougher rules than international minimum standards will be met. The authorities confirmed that they
are actively working with, the U.K. and U.S. authorities on cross-border resolution under the “single
point of entry” principle, with negotiations for a binding cooperation agreement planned to
commence later this year.
Banking Supervision and Deposit Insurance
32.
Banking supervision, in particular of domestic banks, need to be further strengthened,
including by shoring up resources. The FSAP Update found a high level of compliance with Basel
Core Principles and pointed to significant improvements in recent years. However, it also noted that
FINMA operates with resources well below those of other supervisors. FINMA could usefully provide

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SWITZERLAND

more guidance to external auditors (which conduct most onsite banking supervision) as to what is
needed, ensure greater harmonization across supervised entities, and complement the auditors’
work with more “deep dives” on selected issues. Auditing firms should furthermore be periodically
rotated (at least every five years) and not be paid by the supervised entities, but rather from a
FINMA-administered fund. Increased resources for FINMA are needed so it can intensify its
supervision of smaller and medium-sized domestically focused banks, particularly in light of risks
from large exposures to the domestic mortgage market.
33.
The Swiss deposit insurance system needs substantial reform. The FSAP Update
indentified a number of weaknesses, and proposed several areas for improvement to bring the
system in line with emerging international best practices, including greater transparency to
depositors on coverage conditions, commitment to faster payouts, ex ante financing in a dedicated
fund, and the fund to have powers to take action other than bank closure when there is a cheaper
alternative.

The authorities’ view
34.
The authorities believe that supervision is adequately funded and executed, and saw
prospects for deposit insurance reform as limited. FINMA stressed that the track record
demonstrated that the currently applied risk-based approach to performing supervisory reviews with
experienced and skilled staff had been successful. There was nonetheless agreement that
domestically oriented banks deserved close attention, and in this context it was pointed out that
Pillar II measures had been taken on an individual banks basis, including capital surcharges for
institutions with higher interest rate or concentration risks. On deposit insurance, the authorities
agreed that aspects of the current system could be improved, but pointed to a recent reform effort
that failed to muster sufficient political consensus.

E. Medium-Term Prospects: Immigration, Population Aging, and
International Initiatives on Corporate Tax Compliance and Bank Secrecy
35.
Despite opposition by the government and many business organizations, a popular
vote recently approved the re-establishment of quotas on immigration. The Federal Council
now has three years to put in place a quota regime. The free movement of labor was part of a
broader set of cooperation agreements reached with the EU in 1999, and contributed to the
acceleration in Swiss economic growth in the 2000s (Annex 2). Immigrants account for a large share
of the work force in many important sectors. Uncertainty as to the ability to recruit the needed
personnel in the future may discourage new investment in these sectors. Additional uncertainty may
arise as some other key cooperation agreements with the EU may be called into question. A rapid
resolution of this uncertainty would be important to underpin the economic recovery. On the
positive side, reduced immigration should take some pressure off the housing market.
36.
Slower immigration will increase the challenges of an aging population, and the
new legislative pension reform proposal is welcome. To tackle the long term fiscal challenge
arising from population aging, the government unveiled the pension reform proposal “Pension
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

2020.” The objective is to ensure sustainable financing of Pillar I and Pillar II pensions while
maintaining current benefit levels. The main measures include: (i) harmonizing the reference
retirement age for men and women at 65; (ii) facilitating a flexible transition to retirement from the
age of 62 and cutting benefits for early retirement; (iii) introducing a sustainability rule for social
security funds, which requires reversible automatic increases in contributions or cuts in benefit
indexation in case measures proposed by the Federal Council to the Parliament fail to prevent the
funding ratio from falling below 70 percent and deficits exceed 3 percent for two consecutive years.
In addition, for Pillar II pensions the reform would reduce the minimum conversion rate from
6.8 percent to 6 percent and redefine the minimum interest rate at the end of each year when the
achieved investment performance is known. A two percentage point increase in the VAT and higher
social security contributions would finance the cost. Staff stressed that aligning male and female
retirement age is appropriate, and placing the social security funds under a fiscal rule, as are most
cantonal budgets and the federal budget, should reduce fiscal risks going forward.
37.
The tax treatment of corporate income on foreign activities is coming under
international scrutiny. Among several factors that make Switzerland attractive to multinational
corporations is a favorable corporate income tax regime in many cantons, while bank secrecy has
been an important factor for the wealth management sector. Responding to international pressures,
the authorities are developing a strategy to reform special tax regimes that give more favorable tax
treatment to income from foreign operations than income from domestic operations while
maintaining Switzerland’s attractiveness to international firms. The reform is envisaged to enter into
force as of 2018.6 Staff welcomed this plans and recommended that, in designing a new regime, the
authorities take into account international efforts to counter base erosion and profit shifting in
corporate taxation.
38.
In parallel, international initiatives to address tax evasion and money laundering
are eroding bank secrecy. This presents potential challenges to parts of the Swiss wealth
management business and staff stressed the need to closely monitor this sector during the likely
process of downsizing to avoid possible risks to financial stability. To protect the integrity of
Switzerland as an international financial center, the authorities are also encouraged to forcefully
implement the FATF and Global Forum standards in particular with respect to criminalization of tax
crimes as predicate offences to money laundering, the transparency of legal persons, and due
diligence requirements for politically exposed persons.

The authorities’ view
39.
The authorities considered that it was early to assess the possible effects of the
referendum on immigration, but were optimistic about succeeding with pension reform. They
agreed that uncertainty over the final outcome was not helpful to growth and noted that the Federal
Council was moving forward speedily to develop possible strategies. On pension reform they
6

See http://www.efd.admin.ch/themen/steuern/02720/index.html?lang=fr.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SWITZERLAND

stressed the importance of reforming Pillar I and II together and noted that the parliamentary
process was likely to be protracted, with enactment of the reform expected by 2020. On corporate
income tax reform, they stressed their goal of maintaining international competitiveness, and
informed that buffers were being built in the federal budget for possible burden sharing of the
revenue losses with the cantons. On the wealth management sector, the authorities do not expect
large adverse effects as competing financial centers will also adopt the new standards. The
authorities also informed on progress in implementing international AML-CFT standards. A draft bill
for implementing the revised 2012 Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF) was
approved by the upper house and should be taken up by the lower house later this year. An FATF
Evaluation will start in the fall of 2014 and be finalized in 2016.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The exchange rate floor continues to be a necessary element of the monetary policy
framework. Inflation is still close to the bottom of the range compatible with the SNB definition of
price stability, and, renewed exchange rate appreciation, as might arise from a new bout of safe
haven inflows, would quickly bring back deflationary pressures. Thus, monetary conditions need to
remain expansionary and the exchange rate floor needs to remain in place. Negative interest rates
on banks’ excess reserves may need to be introduced in case of renewed strong pressures on the
franc. The SNB balance sheet is likely to remain extended for a prolonged period with large
fluctuations in mark-to-market profits, and provisions need to be strengthened to bring capital in
line with risks.
41.
Stronger policies to curb the demand for mortgages are needed to reduce the risk of a
sharp adjustment down the road. The recent hike in the CCB is welcome, but its impact may not
be sufficient as capital is not a constraint across the domestically oriented banking sector. More
aggressive policies to discourage vulnerable households from taking on too much mortgage debt
need to be put in place. To this end, existing self-regulation measures should be tightened, for
example to speed up loan amortization. Parallel measures to curb mortgage growth in the buy-tolet segment should also be put in place. However, given the limited effect of self-regulation so far,
stricter direct regulation may be necessary, including mandatory affordability caps and maximum
loan-to value ratios. This would be an appropriate time to phase out tax incentives that encourage
borrowing to finance home buying.
42.
A rapid resolution of uncertainty related to future immigration policy would be
important to underpin the economic recovery. The recent referendum to move away from the
free movement of labor with the EU has increased uncertainty about medium-term economic
prospects. Immigration has increased the labor force by about one percentage point per year since
the free movement of labor accord with the EU came into force. Immigrants account for a large
share of the work force in many important sectors. Uncertainty as to the ability to recruit the needed
personnel in the future may discourage new investment in these sectors. Additional uncertainty may
arise as some key cooperation agreements with the EU could be called into question.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

43.
Slower immigration will increase the challenges of an aging population, and the new
legislative pension reform proposal will help in meeting these challenges. The proposal aims at
placing first and second pillar pensions on a sustainable financial basis in light of population aging.
Aligning the retirement age of women with that of men is appropriate, and placing the social
security funds under a fiscal rule, as are most cantonal budgets and the federal budget, should
reduce fiscal risks going forward.
44.
Plans to reform the corporate income tax to make it internationally acceptable are
welcome. Specifically, the authorities are seeking to eliminate the favorable tax treatment on
income from foreign activities granted to corporations by cantons. This initiative is welcome and the
authorities are encouraged to put in place a new regime taking into account international efforts to
counter base erosion and profit shifting. The strategy to build buffers in the federal budget for
possible burden sharing of the fiscal costs with the cantons should facilitate this reform.
45.
Continuing the financial sector reform agenda will strengthen the soundness and
resilience of the financial system. The latter is important for global financial stability given the
prominent role of the Swiss banking and insurance sectors. In line with the FSAP update
recommendations, the authorities are encouraged to:


Press the large banks to continue efforts to rapidly bring their leverage ratios into line with those
of other major international banks, ensure an ambitious minimum leverage ratio requirement,
and improve transparency as regards risk weights.



Continue discussions with international counterparts to reach agreement on measures to make
the large banks resolvable without public sector support.



Increase resources available to FINMA for banking supervision, in particular so it can extend its
intensive supervision in the sector beyond the largest banks. Refine FINMA’s use of external
auditors for onsite supervision of the banks, including through periodic rotation of auditing
firms, ensuring auditors are paid from a FINMA-managed bank-financed fund, and providing
more guidance on their supervisory focus.



Overhaul the deposit insurance scheme to bring it into line with emerging international best
practices and the schemes being established in the region. This involves greater transparency to
depositors on coverage conditions, commitment to faster payouts, ex ante financing in a
dedicated fund, and the fund to have powers to take action other than bank closure when there
is a cheaper alternative.

1/ Based on parent company consolidation. This consolidation basis equals the CBDI approach defined in FSI compilation guide plus foreign bank
branches operating in Switzerland, and minus overseas deposit-taking subsidiaries.
2/ Until 2004, general loan-loss provisions were made; as of 2005, specific loan-loss provisions have been carried out.
3/ From 2008 onwards broader criteria pursuant to national accounting regulations (FINMA-RS 08/2 Art. 228b) has been applied for defining nonperforming loans.
4/ As percent of total credit to the private sector.
5/ Mining and extraction, production and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water, financial intermediation, social security, ex-territorial bodies
and organizations, other.
* These ratios were calculated from numbers that originate from the Basle I as well as from the Basle II approach. Therefore, interpretation must be
done carefully since they can vary within +/- 10%.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Switzerland’s attraction as a safe haven was re-affirmed during recent bouts of global

financial turbulence. The heightened market volatility following the May 22, 2013 Fed “taper talk”
saw the franc strengthen against major EM
currencies, the euro, and the U.S. dollar. The latter

3.

Switzerland could slip into deflation/recession in an adverse global scenario. The simulations
consider a scenario of disorderly unwinding of UMP, coupled with geo-political tensions in Europe,
resulting in a 100 basis point increase in the sovereign risk premia of stressed euro area economies
and EMs over 2014–17. The associated safe haven inflows appreciate the franc by an average of
5 percent against the euro (and in real effective terms) during 2014–15, unwinding by 2018. With the
policy rate bound at zero, the simulations show Swiss inflation falling below zero in 2014–15 and
output losses peaking at 1.6 percent in 2015 (relative to staff baseline). The Swiss outcomes turn out
to be worse than for the euro area and the United States, as those two areas avoid deflation. These
results help underscore the pivotal role of the exchange rate floor in the Swiss monetary framework,
as a necessary buffer against another major currency appreciation-deflation-recession cycle.

Annex 2. A New Approach to Immigration?1
1.

A recent popular initiative, approved by a narrow majority through a referendum, calls

for new restrictions on immigration. The vote reflected public concerns about the pressure placed
by high rates of immigration on transport, infrastructure, the housing market, education services,
and local employment.
2.

Switzerland has experienced a new immigration wave since the enactment of the Free

Movement of Persons Treaty (FMP) with the EU/EFTA in June 2002 gradually led to the full
liberalization of immigration from these countries. During 2002–12, total population growth was
0.94 percent per year and net immigration contributed 0.88 percentage points to the total. The
share of foreign born inhabitants in total population increased from 20 percent in 2001 to
25 percent in 2012, one of the highest among OECD countries. The share of foreign born in the
labor force was 29 percent in 2012. In 2002–12, EU citizens accounted for 60 percent of net
immigration, while there was virtually no net immigration from the EU in the previous decade, with
Germany the most represented country. About a third of the foreign-born population is highly
educated, a higher proportion than the native population.
3.

The recent popular vote creates uncertainty to medium-term economic prospects.

Highly skilled immigrant workers are important for sectors such as finance, pharmaceuticals,
and health care, while lower-skilled ones play an important role in construction. Immigration
restrictions may hamper recruitment, which may in turn affect investment and location decisions by
firms. In addition, slower immigration would cause old-age dependency to rise, with adverse effects
on the social security funds. Lower long-term growth would also lead to less favorable public debt
dynamics. A recent OECD study assesses the fiscal benefits of immigration in Switzerland at about
2 percent of GDP, among the highest in the OECD countries.
4.

Finally, the FMP is part of a bundle of seven bilateral agreements with the EU covering

free movement of goods and services as well as agriculture and public procurement. These
treaties may be called into questions by the EU and may need to be renegotiated, creating
uncertainty for a numbers of economic activities.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is
determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank
(SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at
free market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per
euro to stop the appreciation of the franc and committed to defending the limit by buying foreign
currency in unlimited quantities. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange
transactions in its annual accountability report. In 2013, the SNB’ commitment to defending the
minimum exchange rate remained unchanged. After a short period of volatility, the Swiss franc has
followed an appreciating trend within a 2 percent band against the euro since end-May, 2013.
Therefore, the de facto exchange rate has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from other
managed, effective May 29, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS requirements, and
it is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of production index data (for
periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and earnings data (for periodicity). The Swiss Federal
Council has come out in favor of Switzerland participating in the IMF’s new, extended statistical
standard SDDS Plus. Implementing the requirements of SDDS Plus in Switzerland—a task in which
an interagency working group(SIF, SNB, FSO, FFA, FSIO, SECO, and FINMA) is to play an active role—
will take several years. However, a number of statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly
reflecting a lack of resources and the limited authority of the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) to
request information:


reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due to
delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;



pension statistics are published with a long lag;



GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag.

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
2.
Progress has been made in the area of balance of payments (BOP) statistics. In 2013,
the content-related revision of surveys in connection with financial flows (investment BOP) was
completed. Reporting institutions will submit data according to the new concept for the first time
for 2014 Q3. The new surveys aim, among other things, to meet the requirements of the bilateral
statistical agreement between Switzerland and the EU. This means in particular that more details on
the breakdown of financial flows by country will be collected. To date, the presentation of
Switzerland’s BOP has been based on the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5). In 2013, preparatory work was undertaken to place the publication of the BOP on the
methodological basis of the sixth edition (BPM6) as of 2014 Q1. The SNB will reclassify the old data
series in line with BPM6 when publishing the BOP data for 2014 Q1, in order to ensure that new and
old data are comparable and that long data series are available.
3.
Switzerland has continued to provide data on Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs)
and participated in the 2009 Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. The data and metadata for
both these initiatives have been posted on the IMF website. In addition, reporting banks submitted
data for the revised locational banking statistics and consolidated banking statistics surveys for the
first time in 2013. Both surveys are conducted in collaboration with the BIS. Also in 2013, the SNB
began to transmit FSB Data Gaps Initiative related data to the central data hub specially set up for
this initiative and hosted by the BIS. In the field of statistics on cashless payment transactions, the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

various surveys are currently being thoroughly revised. The prime aim of the revision is to enable a
full reflection of the technological innovations of the past few years in the area of cashless payment
transactions. Reporting institutions are obliged to submit the revised surveys for the first time as of
December 31, 2014 (reference date).
4.
The FSO has taken various steps in 2013 to improve core business statistics. In
November 2013, new business census results were published for the first time since 2008, based
mainly on administrative data. As expected, the new approach led to a significant extension of the
statistical universe and enabled the FSO to take into account small business units which were below
the thresholds in the census in the past. The FSO also initiated the revision of the job statistics in
order to integrate the new universe in the survey. The FSO plans to publish results according to the
2008 version of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) in September 2014. The timeliness of
dissemination of national accounts data will improve sequentially and data on the sequence of
accounts should be disseminated at t+10 beginning in 2016.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May XX, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Switzerland
On April 30, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Switzerland as well as the country’s 2014 Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA).
The growth of the Swiss economy has gathered pace, but inflation nevertheless remains close
to zero. The recovery is expected to continue and inflation should rise gradually while the
output gap will progressively close. The fiscal position is healthy, with a broadly neutral
stance projected for 2014, and government debt is low.
There has been no new foreign exchange intervention to support the exchange rate floor, but
past safe haven inflows have not yet reversed and the balance sheet of the Swiss National
Bank (SNB) remains large. Despite improved market confidence toward the euro area and
tapering in the United States, the exchange rate has remained close to the floor. For 2013, the
SNB reported a large valuation loss on gold holdings, triggering the first suspension of profit
transfers to the Confederation and cantons in recent memory.
Expansionary monetary policy and ample liquidity have contributed to push real estate prices
and mortgage debt to historic heights, with prices of owner occupied apartments rising by
6 percent per year on average since 2008. Mortgage lending has grown by about 5 percent
per year since 2009, and mortgage debt recently reached an all-time high of over 140 percent
of GDP. The authorities have taken several measures to contain risks, including raising the
countercyclical capital buffer and adopting prudential measures to tighten lending standards
and conditions.
The financial sector has continued to restructure to adapt to the more stringent regulatory
environment. The 2014 FSAP Update finds that the position of the financial sector has

improved markedly since the Global Financial Crisis, but gaps remain in the regulatory
framework, prudential oversight, and safety net.
The current economic model faces some medium-term challenges. International initiatives to
address tax evasion and money laundering are eroding bank secrecy. The tax treatment of
corporate income on foreign activities is coming under international scrutiny. A recent
popular vote approved curbs on immigration, which has been an important contributing
factor to the acceleration in Swiss economic growth in the 2000s.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Swiss economy has regained momentum and growth is
healthy, but monetary and exchange rate conditions have not yet normalized, and risks
relating to deflation, the domestic housing market, and spillovers from external developments
remain. In the medium term, some aspects of the current economic model might be
challenged.
Directors noted that domestic macroeconomic conditions do not call for a monetary
tightening yet and that the risk of a resumption of safe haven inflows remains considerable.
They generally agreed that the exchange rate floor remains necessary to guard against
deflationary risks. Directors underscored that an appropriate strategy going forward should
seek to keep inflation expectations well anchored while avoiding an excessive tightening of
monetary conditions. When conditions permit, a return to a flexible exchange rate would be
desirable.
While recognizing the need for caution in calibrating unconventional policy instruments,
Directors recommended contemplating alternative measures. In particular they encouraged
the authorities to consider introducing negative interest rates on excess bank reserves in case
of deflationary pressures resulting from appreciation. However, it would be important to
carefully monitor their economic impact and reinforce macroprudential measures as needed.
In an upside scenario, the authorities should also gradually reduce their holdings of foreign
exchange reserves. More broadly, Directors noted that the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB)
balance sheet would likely remain extended for a prolonged period, and encouraged the
authorities to step up SNB’s provisions.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to contain risks in the mortgage and real estate markets,
including the increase in counter-cyclical capital buffers. They advised the authorities to
continue to monitor price developments in the housing sector, and to lay the groundwork for
stronger policy actions to curb the demand for mortgages, potentially including tax reforms,
and direct regulatory measures targeting affordability and loan-to-value ratios.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors welcomed the implementation of considerable regulatory reforms. Noting
remaining gaps, they encouraged the authorities to follow up on the FSAP update
recommendations. In particular, they advised the authorities to encourage the large banks to
achieve leverage ratios tighter than international standards. Directors also underscored the
need to reach cooperation agreements with key foreign supervisors to make the large banks
resolvable. They generally called for reforms to the deposit insurance system, including to
make it more transparent and universal across all banks. In general, they also considered it
important to increase resources for prudential bank supervision, provide closer oversight and
guidance to auditors performing supervisory audits, and seek to improve the governance of
the cantonal banks.
In light of the recent popular vote, Directors agreed that a rapid resolution of uncertainty
related to future immigration policy will be important to support economic recovery. They
welcomed the new legislative pension reform proposal as well as plans to reform aspects of
the corporate income tax. On the latter, Directors encouraged putting in place a new regime
taking into account international efforts to counter base erosion and profit shifting.

Statement by Daniel Heller, Executive Director of Switzerland, and Jérôme Duperrut,
Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
April 30, 2014
General
On behalf of the Swiss authorities, we would like to thank staff for their reports, which
provide a thorough analysis of macroeconomic developments and the financial sector. In
many aspects, we share staff's views on the challenges going forward. We would like to
extend our appreciation to staff for their policy recommendations, which add significant
value to policy discussions in Switzerland. While many of these recommendations are in line
with policies that are already being implemented in Switzerland, others, in particular those
linked to the FSSA, deviate to a varying extent from the views of our authorities.
Outlook
The Fund’s outlook for the Swiss economy is broadly in line with our authorities’ forecasts.
The Swiss economy continued to grow robustly in 2013. This growth was mainly driven by
domestic sectors such as construction, investment and household consumption. High
immigration and low interest rates were the key factors for the strong domestic demand. The
export sector, which previously suffered from a weak external environment, is showing signs
of recovery. Our slightly higher forecast for growth in 2015 is close to staff’s and reflects the
considerable uncertainties around future external developments. We also share staff’s
assessment of the risks faced by the Swiss economy, especially those associated with the
imbalances in the housing and mortgage markets.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
The SNB fully shares staff’s view that monetary conditions need to remain expansionary and
that the exchange rate floor needs to remain in place. Even though the SNB has not had to
buy foreign currency to enforce the floor for more than a year, the floor remains necessary to
avoid an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions. The Swiss franc continues to be
overvalued, the policy rate (3M-Libor) is at the zero lower bound, and inflation – having
been negative for two years – is just returning to zero. Renewed exchange rate appreciation
due to safe haven inflows would quickly bring back deflationary pressures. The SNB also
concurs with staff that in such a scenario, negative interest rates on bank excess reserves
would be an option.
As the SNB has stressed several times, if necessary, it is prepared to buy foreign currency in
unlimited quantities in order to enforce the minimum exchange rate. This takes precedence
over any other considerations regarding the accumulation and investment of its foreign
exchange reserves. The SNB currently has no plans to unwind or limit its foreign exchange

2
reserve accumulation. While staff refers to the risks arising from the large balance sheet of
the SNB, the SNB has stepped up provisioning to strengthen its balance sheet, as also noted
by staff.
Fiscal policy
Overall, fiscal policy remains on solid ground in Switzerland. The general government is
expected to record a small budget surplus in 2013 (0.3 percent of GDP), as the small deficit
of the Confederation and the sub-central entities is compensated for by a surplus in the social
security funds. In 2014, the general government balance is expected to turn slightly negative
(-0.2 percent of GDP), mainly due to a lack of profit distributions from the SNB and further
one-off restructuring contributions towards cantonal pension funds. However, fiscal
indicators are expected to improve considerably in the years thereafter, with general
government recording solid surpluses. Accordingly, the general government debt should fall
further to 44 percent of GDP in 2017.
Financial sector policies
We welcome staff’s positive assessment of financial system stability and the observance of
standards and codes in Switzerland. We appreciate staff’s recognition of Switzerland’s
considerable progress in implementing the 2007 FSAP recommendations, the timely
adoption of the Basel III framework, the swift introduction of measures addressing the toobig-to-fail problem, stricter liquidity requirements, a countercyclical capital buffer and
focused measures addressing a potential overheating in the Swiss residential real estate
market. We also take good note of the high overall compliance with the Basel Core
Principles (BCPs) and Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The positive results of the stress
testing exercises confirm the resilience of the Swiss financial sector. Moreover, we
appreciate that staff acknowledge the progress Switzerland has made in addressing the
recommendations from the last IOSCO assessment and support the current reforms in the
area of securities regulation. This being said, we would like to comment in greater detail on
some important aspects of the key FSAP recommendations.
FINMA’s supervisory effectiveness and resources
We welcome staff’s recognition of the strength of the Swiss supervisory approach including
the institutional setup of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) as an
integrated supervisory authority. We also appreciate staff’s conclusion that employing
external resources from audit firms is a reasonable and valid supervisory approach, in
particular given the global operations of large Swiss banks and the limited availability of
highly-specialized supervision experts in Switzerland. It is further acknowledged by staff that
FINMA has successfully put in place important enhancements to its own supervisory
processes and practices, especially with regard to big banks. Finally, we value staff’s

3
assessment regarding the appropriateness, also in terms of resources, of Swiss G-SIB homesupervision.
Effective supervision carried out by FINMA has contributed to the increased robustness and
resilience of the Swiss financial sector, as recognized by staff. We are not of the opinion that
there are “significant weaknesses in supervision”. We would like to remind that since 2008
no important Swiss bank has had difficulties, multiple institutions have left the market
without affecting creditors or clients, and the Swiss deposit insurance has not dispensed
funds over this period. We do not believe that staff’s recommendation to improve the process
towards mandating external audit firms is a sufficient justification to conclude that there are
significant weaknesses in supervison, in particular given the assessors’ general
acknowledgement of this supervisory approach. We also would like to stress that the wording
“significant weaknesses” is not consistent with staff’s careful and more constructive
assessment in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the same issue.
Our authorities think that FINMA resources are appropriate to fulfill its mandate. They
remain of the opinion that staff’s assessment grade for the relevant BCP is not justified,
especially as staff came to the conclusion that this issue is only valid for a very limited area the supervision of small and medium sized banks. With BCP 2 primarily geared towards the
process of obtaining and allocating resources in order to avoid political pressure which could
undermine supervisory independence, our authorities’ views is that FINMA’s budgetary
independence is clearly anchored in the law, as acknowledged in the FSSA. FINMA’s
current level of resources can thus be adjusted flexibly. Furthermore, the narrow focus on
FINMA’s internal resources available for bank supervision completely omits the important
contribution of external audit firms to successful supervision. Accounting for these firms,
Switzerland’s resources allocated to bank supervision are well within the range of
comparable jurisdictions.
Capital requirements and leverage ratio on banks
Switzerland has introduced a leverage ratio for large banks in addition to risk-weighted
capital requirements well ahead of the envisaged Basel standard and a comprehensive “toobig-to-fail” (TBTF) regime which is explicitly based on parallel requirements, including
capital, leverage, liquidity and resolution measures. Our authorities therefore disagree with
staff’s statement that “early focus on regulatory bank capital has not been matched by equal
focus on other measures of bank strength, particularly the leverage ratio”. However, we agree
with staff’s view that the two large Swiss banks need to further improve their leverage ratios.
Mortgage and housing markets
Our authorities are well aware of the risks associated with developments in the mortgage and
housing markets. In order to address these risks, measures have already been taken in 2012
and 2013. These measures include (i) the activation of the countercyclical capital buffer with
a focus on residential property mortgages, (ii) prudential measures taken by FINMA, (iii) a

4
revision of self-regulation guidelines for mortgage lending, and (iv) the Federal Council’s
decision to increase the countercyclical capital buffer requirements, effective in June 2014.
Our authorities will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage and housing markets
closely, and will reassess the need for an adjustment to the CCB on a regular basis.
Moreover, given the potential overheating of the Swiss mortgage market, discussions are
currently taking place about the design and implementation of further measures directly
targeting the banks’ risk-taking.
Resolution regime and use of deposit insurance funds
The current Swiss TBTF-regime does not include an ex-ante funded resolution scheme. This
reflects a deliberate policy decision to avoid wrong incentives and moral hazard. Instead,
Swiss banks are required to issue a minimum amount of contingent convertible debt which is
the functional equivalent of an internalized, institution-specific resolution fund. Our
authorities are not convinced by staff’s key recommendation to make deposit insurance funds
available to finance resolution measures.
Swiss Solvency Test for insurers
Our authorities appreciate the support expressed by staff for various areas of improvement in
the regulation and supervision of insurers, including with regard to group supervision and the
Swiss Solvency Test (SST). The latter was introduced in 2010 and is a fully risk-based,
market consistent solvency regime for insurers, considerably ahead of other comparable
international instruments. Since staff raised certain concerns regarding the SST adjustments
permitted in 2013 to accommodate the persistent low interest environment and the late
introduction of the Solvency II framework in the European Union, it is important to note that
these measures are transparent, temporary (they are due to expire at the end of 2015),
carefully designed and targeted to avoid wrong incentives, and apply only to existing
business. Further, they are intended for and have been used primarily by life insurers who
have been hit the most from the low interest rate environment and an uneven international
playing field.
Financial Markets Infrastructure regulation
Full implementation of the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures
(PFMIs) by the systemically important financial market infrastructures in Switzerland is a top
priority for our authorities. Substantial progress has been achieved and financial market
infrastructures are expected to be compliant with most requirements by Summer 2014. The
staff highlights some of the challenges in implementing the PFMIs, including an environment
focused on efficiency and subject to competition. It should be noted that the situation in
Switzerland is similar to many other countries with regard to these challenges.
