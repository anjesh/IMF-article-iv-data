EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Good macroeconomic management and market-oriented reforms have placed Tunisia’s
economic performance over the past decade among the best in the region, with real GDP
growth averaging almost 5 percent in a stable macroeconomic environment. Tunisia’s key
challenge is to create enough jobs for the rapidly increasing number of university graduates.
This is the overarching objective of the recently released XIth Plan, which seeks to boost
annual growth to more than 6 percent during 2007–11 by continuing to move the Tunisian
economy toward a knowledge-based, high value-added economy, while deepening its global
integration. Policy discussions centered on how to achieve higher growth and enhance the
flexibility and resilience of the Tunisian economy.
Authorities’ View
The authorities noted significant progress in debt reduction, and tax administration and
policy reforms; recent measures should eliminate the deficit of the social security system
over the coming years, pending its comprehensive reform.
They are making progress toward their objective of full capital account liberalization, a
free-floating exchange rate, and an inflation targeting framework.
The authorities have adopted a comprehensive strategy, based on the 2002 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) and its 2006 update, to strengthen the financial system,
including the adoption of a dual target of reducing the nonperforming loans (NPLs) ratio to
15 percent and increasing the provisions-to-NPLs ratio to 70 percent by end-2009. The
authorities noted that their strategy has produced positive results with the NPLs ratio
declining from 24 percent in 2003 to 19.2 percent in 2006.
Staff Recommendations
Fiscal consolidation should continue in order to address growing budget pressures,
particularly from demographic changes and declining receipts from privatization and trade
liberalization. In particular, the authorities should move ahead with the planned overhaul of
the social security system.
Increased autonomy and adequate information to market participants are necessary to
develop money and foreign exchange markets. The research and forecasting capacity of the
Central Bank of Tunisia (Banque Centrale de Tunisie, BCT) should be strengthened.
Additional measures—including an injection of new capital in public banks—may be needed
to attain the BCT’s dual objective and yield a dynamic and efficient financial system that
supports the objectives of the XIth Plan.

4
I. BACKGROUND AND KEY POLICY ISSUES
1.
Effective economic management has led to strong growth and macroeconomic
stability, placing Tunisia among the leading performers in the region and contributing to
sociopolitical stability. This good performance has been recognized by international
organizations such as the Davos Forum, which recently ranked Tunisia as the most
competitive country in the region, and the Japanese agency R&I, which raised Tunisia’s
sovereign rating from BBB+ to A- in 2007.
2.
Nevertheless, Tunisia faces a common challenge with its neighbors—high
unemployment, especially among the youth. To bring the unemployment rate below
10 percent, annual growth must rise from 4¾ percent over the past decade to 6¼ percent over
the next. This will require both a significant increase in private investment and total factor
productivity. The XIth five-year Plan sets forth the authorities’ medium-term strategy
(Box 1).

Box 1. Main Elements of the XIth Plan
Objective:

•

Accelerate annual growth from 4.8 percent during the past decade to 6.1 percent during 2007–11,
while lowering the unemployment rate from 14.2 percent in 2006 to about 13.4 percent by 2011.

Strategy:
Keep moving the Tunisian economy toward a knowledge-based, high-value-added economy by:

•

Consolidating Tunisia’s macroeconomic position. Reduce public debt and improve its structure,
control the budget deficit by further rationalizing current expenditure and widening the tax base.
Strengthen the financial system.

•

Continuing the gradual opening-up of the economy. Extend the Association Agreement with the
European Union (EU) to services and agriculture; continue trade liberalization through WTO and
regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). Advance preparations for full convertibility and
flexibility of the dinar.

•

Stimulating private investment, particularly in high value-added sectors. Improve the business
climate, attract more FDI, encourage public-private partnerships, and rationalize investment incentives.

•

Reforming education and training systems to reduce skill mismatch in the labor market.

3.
For this strategy to be successful in the context of the ongoing deeper integration
into the world economy, Tunisia would need to consolidate its fiscal position,
strengthen its monetary and exchange rate policy framework, and address the
remaining weaknesses in the financial system to enhance the economy’s flexibility and
resilience:

5
•

While prudent fiscal policy over the past decade has contributed to macroeconomic
stability, further consolidation is necessary to maintain long-term fiscal sustainability.
Fiscal pressures, including from population ageing, are mounting and Tunisia’s public
debt—which stood at about 54.0 percent of GDP at end-2006—is still high relative to
that of other emerging market economies with a similar sovereign rating.

•

The preparations for moving to inflation targeting should be intensified in view of the
increasingly open capital account. The authorities aim for full capital account
liberalization and a free-floating exchange rate regime over the medium term.

•

A sound and competitive financial system is essential for harnessing the full potential
of the Tunisian economy. Despite a significant improvement in the past few years, the
banking sector still suffers from relatively high NPLs—19.2 percent of total loans at
end-2006. The authorities have been implementing a comprehensive strategy based on
the key recommendations of the 2002 FSAP and its 2006 update.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

4.
Over the past two years, the Tunisian economy has shown resilience in the face of
surging prices of oil and other imported commodities, sustaining relatively strong growth
while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
•

Real GDP growth accelerated from 4 percent in 2005 to 5.4 percent in 2006 owing to a
rebound in agricultural output, expansion of nontextile manufacturing, and vitality of the
services sector. Robust income growth and abundant liquidity boosted domestic demand.
The unemployment rate, however, remained unchanged at 14.2 percent in 2006.

•

Inflation has declined rapidly, after a spike in the first half of 2006. The inflationary

•

Asset prices are rising. Equity markets have posted substantial gains—the TUNINDEX
increased by 60 percent from January 2006 to mid-June 2007. Similarly, anecdotal
evidence seems to suggest that real estate prices have also increased significantly,
although lack of data hinders a proper assessment.

•

There are no obvious signs of exchange rate misalignment. The depreciation of the
dinar since 2002 reflects mainly worsening terms of trade, severe droughts, a sharp
decline in tourism receipts following the events of September 2001 in the United States
and April 2002 in Djerba, and tariff reductions resulting from trade liberalization. Market
share analysis, current account dynamics, and staff’s econometric analysis do not show
evidence of a significant misalignment (Box 2). The BCT’s exchange market
interventions are mostly liquidity injections reflecting the structural trade and current
account deficits and remaining restrictions on capital transactions. In addition, these
interventions have declined significantly since 2000. The recent increase in reserves to
about five months of imports of goods and services is largely due to privatization
receipts, which are earmarked for debt reduction and infrastructure expenditures.

•

The current account deficit
widened in 2006 due to rising
petroleum prices, but the balance of
payments recorded a large surplus
owing to the partial privatization of
Tunisie Télécom. At end-2006,
international reserves represented five
months of imports of goods and
services. Total external debt fell from
65.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to
59.1 percent in 2006. A debt
sustainability analysis did not detect
any significant vulnerability (Table 6
and Figure 2).

•

Fiscal policy remained prudent. The
fiscal deficit for 2006 is 2.9 percent of
GDP, well below the 3.6 percent budget
forecast, owing to improved nontax
revenues and restrained nonsubsidy
expenditure. Using a portion of the
privatization receipts for early debt
repayment should reduce public debt
from 58.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to
52.5 percent in 2007.

Box 2. Assessment of the Real Effective Exchange Rate Level
There are no clear signs of exchange rate misalignment. While estimates suggest that the real effective
exchange rate appears to be somewhat undervalued relative to its longer-term equilibrium, the difference is
not statistically significant.1 Furthermore, the model does not take into account the ongoing reduction in
effective tariffs—about 16 percentage points between 2002 and 2005.2 Despite the trend depreciation during
2002–06, Tunisia’s competitiveness did not improve markedly, as evidenced by its declining export market
share and structural deficits in its trade and current accounts—respectively, 8.6 percent and 2.4 percent of
GDP for the 2002–06 average.

9
III. OUTLOOK
5.
The short-term outlook is positive. Growth is projected to accelerate to about
6 percent in 2007 owing to strong agricultural output, recovery in textiles and clothing, and
buoyant services exports. This growth acceleration is presaged by a substantial increase in
imports of capital goods and commodities at end-2006 and in early 2007. After decelerating
rapidly to 2.2 percent on a year-on-year basis in May 2007, inflation may increase somewhat
due to seasonal factors and the recent 6.3 percent increase in domestic prices of petroleum
products but should remain around 3 percent in 2007. The fiscal and external deficits should
remain broadly unchanged.
6.
The balance of risks is tilted to the downside. The positive short-term outlook
hinges on agricultural output returning to trend, oil prices remaining below $70 a barrel, and
growth in the EU—Tunisia’s main export market—not faltering.
7.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable. Potential growth over the medium
term is estimated at about 6¼ percent, assuming continued effort with structural reforms.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The policy discussions centered on how to strengthen Tunisia’s macroeconomic
position and advance structural reforms to achieve higher growth and lower unemployment
in the context of deeper integration to the world economy. More specifically, the discussions
focused on: (a) consolidating the fiscal position; (b) adapting the monetary and exchange
rate policy framework to the gradual liberalization of the capital account and transition
toward inflation targeting; and (c) strengthening the financial system.

Fiscal discipline has been
maintained. Despite the surge in prices
of oil and basic commodities, the budget
deficit was significantly lower than the
budget forecast in 2006. Public debt
over GDP declined significantly in part
due to privatization receipts—two-thirds
were earmarked for early debt
retirement—but it still remains above
the average of countries with a similar
sovereign rating.

10.
Further fiscal consolidation is necessary to counter mounting budget pressures
as a result of demographic changes and declining revenue resulting from privatization and
trade liberalization.

Fuel subsidies continue to weigh heavily on the budget, despite the cumulative price
increase of 51 percent since 2005. The authorities are aware of their inefficiencies and
intend to gradually phase them out. However, they have not as yet specified a date for
their removal.

1996

Considerable progress has been made in tax administration and policy. These
reforms reflect most of the recommendations of the 2005 IMF technical assistance (TA)
missions. Key measures include reducing the corporate income tax from 35 percent to
30 percent for most economic sectors, closer alignment of onshore/offshore regimes with
exporters taxed at a 10 percent rate, simplifying the VAT rate structure by eliminating the
maximum rate of 29 percent, establishing a large taxpayer unit, and the ongoing
restructuring of the tax administration.

•

1994

Given the sizable budgetary impact of medium- and long-term demographic
changes, it is important to develop a fiscal framework that allows forward-looking
analyses of these issues. The authorities agree that a medium- and long-term outlook can
be more effectively incorporated into fiscal policy provided they move from cash to
accrual accounting, extend the horizon of fiscal projections, and examine periodically the
budgetary impact of demographic changes.

B. Continue Adapting the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Framework
11.
The tightening of monetary policy in the second half of 2006 has eased
inflationary pressures, with inflation expected to remain in its historical range of
2–3 percent in 2007, barring another spike in oil or basic commodity prices. The authorities’
monetary program for 2007 aims at significantly reducing broad money growth. Concerning
the planned large infrastructure projects, the authorities noted that they would be phased in
gradually to avoid fueling inflationary pressures.

11
12.
The authorities are pursuing a gradual transition toward an inflation targeting
framework and free floating exchange rate in the context of capital account
liberalization:
•

The transition toward inflation targeting continues. The BCT has adopted a broad
money (M3) targeting framework with reserve money as its operating target and has
increased its reliance on indirect monetary policy instruments, such as repos and openmarket operations. The amendment to the BCT law in 2006 strengthened the central
bank’s independence and defined price stability as the main objective of monetary policy,
hence establishing the legal framework for inflation targeting. The recent Fund TA
mission assessed progress and outlined the remaining challenges toward an inflationtargeting framework (Box 3).

Box 3. Key Recommendations of the Fund TA Mission
•

Enhance the de facto autonomy of the central bank.

•

Clarify the role of the exchange rate in the monetary policy framework.

•

Strengthen the central bank’s research and forecasting capacity.

•

Reduce the share of administered prices in the CPI (currently about one-third).

The authorities are mindful of the need to strengthen human resources capacity, develop
appropriate statistical tools, and build necessary databases for the implementation of
inflation targeting.1 The BCT noted that it is in the process of strengthening its research
and forecasting capacity, including through recruitment of staff with the requisite
expertise.
•

The authorities intend to continue increasing the flexibility of the exchange rate in
both directions in view of the gradual liberalization of the capital account. They
concurred with staff’s assessment of the exchange rate level, and on the need for
clarifying the role of the exchange rate in the monetary policy framework and
coordinating more closely monetary and exchange rate policies.

•

Deep and well functioning money and foreign exchange markets are essential for an
efficient and flexible monetary policy. The BCT understands the importance of

1

The issues related to capacity building and development of appropriate statistical tools and databases for
inflation forecasting were discussed extensively during a seminar on inflation forecasting and exchange rate
pass-through presented by staff during the mission (see the Selected Issues Paper).

12
enhancing the autonomy of the money and exchange markets for their development by
allowing interest and exchange rates to better reflect market conditions. In particular, the
decline in the BCT’s fine-tuning operations since launching the Real Time Gross
Settlements system in November 2006 has increased interbank activity, as evidenced by
the enhanced variability of the money market interest rate (TMM). Similarly, the BCT
noted that the volume of its interventions on the foreign exchange market has declined
markedly, and are mainly for liquidity management.
C. Strengthening the Financial System
13.
The financial sector is expected to play a key role in the implementation of the
XIth Plan. The financial system plays a fundamental role in a country’s economic growth via
its direct influence on investment through project financing, and on productivity through the
selection of quality projects. Therefore, the BCT’s effort to reduce the stock of NPLs is of the
utmost importance. While the FSAP Update concluded that they pose no systemic risk to
financial stability, large NPLs dampen economic growth as they inhibit investment—by
increasing financing costs—and delay productivity enhancing economic reforms.
14.
The authorities have recently adopted several measures to strengthen the legal
framework (Box 4). The authorities’ strategy reflects the main recommendations of the
FSAP and its update. A new banking law was adopted in 2006 designed to promote good
governance and improve the credit culture. Furthermore, since 2004, the BCT has prohibited
the distribution of dividends by banks that are inadequately provisioned. In addition, the BCT
will soon require banks to provision new NPLs at a rate of 70 percent, independently of the
collateral value.

Box 4. Government Strategy for Strengthening the Financial Sector
Objective:
•

Achieve 70 percent for the provisions-to-NPLs ratio and 15 percent for the NPLs-to-total loans
ratio by end-2009.

Key measures:
•

Ban on dividends distribution if provisioning is deemed insufficient.

•

Ensure full tax deductibility of provisions.

•

Streamline legal procedures for collateral realization.

•

New banking law to improve governance by expanding the authority of boards of directors and
requiring the creation of an executive credit committee.

•

New financial securities law to enhance transparency and reliability of accounting.

13
15.
This strategy has already produced positive results (see table below). Prudential
indicators show a significant improvement in 2006 compared to 2003, with the NPLs ratio
declining from 24 percent to 19.2 percent, the provisioning ratio rising from 43.1 percent to
49.2 percent, and capital adequacy ratios remaining at comfortable levels. This improvement
was recorded by both private and public banks.

16.
The authorities remain confident that both of their objectives will be achieved by
2009, particularly the objective of a 15 percent NPLs ratio. They acknowledged, however,
that the goal of 70 percent provisioning ratio will be more difficult to attain without an
increase in capital, especially in public banks. Box 5 proposes additional measures that could
support the authorities’ strategy.
17.
The authorities are carefully monitoring the significant increase in asset prices
but do not believe it poses a systemic risk. The appreciation in the equity market poses no
systemic risk for the financial system—total capitalization represents only 14 percent of GDP
and P/E ratios average 16. The risk could be more important in the real estate market,
although the existence of administered prices benefiting a substantial part of the population
would limit the impact of a potential correction.

14

Box 5. Suggestions to Support the Authorities’ Strategy
Additional measures from FSAP Update:
•

Develop a strategy for restructuring the tourism sector NPLs, on the basis of a realistic
assessment of borrowers’ debt repayment capacity.

•

Reduce delays in judicial proceedings and increase reliance on out-of-court settlements.

•

Allow full tax deductibility for partial write-offs.

•

Strengthen management of public commercial banks and consider privatization and mergers
of former development banks.

•

Promote creation of private credit bureaus.

Other measures:
A key challenge is that the banking sector’s current profitability and capital are insufficient to
support adequate provisioning of NPLs or their sale at an appropriate price. Given the cost of
carrying NPLs, the following actions could be considered:
•

Ease capital constraints, including through issuance of tier 2 capital.

•

Revitalize the credit culture of the banking sector by developing internal rating systems to
enhance the selectivity of their lending policies, ensuring appropriate pricing of their risks,
and enhancing the monitoring of their portfolios.

•

Open up debt collection firms’ capital to nonbank investors to enhance their capacity to
absorb NPLs.

•

Banks should prepare for the de-indexation of their balance sheets to the TMM by enhancing
their risk management systems.

•

Further enhance financial transparency, particularly through the Balance Sheet Register.

D. Other Issues
18.
The authorities continue their efforts to integrate the Tunisian economy
regionally and globally:
•

Tunisia is actively involved in the discussions on the integration of Maghreb countries.
Tunisia participated in the high-level conferences on trade facilitation and on financial

15
integration in the Maghreb, and will host the third conference on the Role of the Private
Sector in Economic Development and Regional Integration in November 2007. The
Agadir Agreement, signed in 2005 with Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco, was implemented
in March and a number of bilateral FTAs were recently concluded.
•

The Tunisian industry is ready for the tariff dismantling on manufactured products
scheduled for 2008 in the context of the free trade agreement with the EU. The
restructuring program initiated in 1995 and the steady reduction of customs duties have
allowed the Tunisian industry to adjust. The maximum customs duty on imports of
manufactured products from the EU is now 5 percent, compared to over 100 percent in
1995. The authorities noted that the Tunisian industry withstood its biggest shock in 2005
with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement. Despite the recent 3 percentage point
cut to 29 percent, average MFN tariffs remain significantly higher than preferential
tariffs, which could lead to trade diversion.

•

The gradual liberalization of the capital and current accounts continues. New
measures were adopted since the beginning of 2006, including authorization to
nonresidents to purchase up to 10 percent of the obligations issued by rated or listed firms
and to buy land in industrial and tourism zones; liberalization of medium- and long-term
external borrowing for listed firms; increase in the amounts transferable without
restriction by exporters for their investments abroad; increase in allowances for personal
and business travel; relaxation of restrictions on foreign exchange accounts; and closer
alignment of onshore and offshore regulatory regimes.

19.
In addition to strengthening Tunisia’s macroeconomic position and financial
systems, the authorities agreed that reforms in the following areas are also essential for
maximizing the benefits of economic integration:
•

Enhancing labor market flexibility. Mounting empirical evidence highlights the
importance of complementary policies in maximizing the benefits of economic
integration. The welfare gain from trade reforms under flexible factor markets can be as
much as six times the gain under rigid ones.2 The authorities observed that 1995–96 labor
code reforms have greatly improved labor market flexibility.

•

Improve the investment climate. The authorities announced a series of measures in
addition to the ongoing efforts to simplify administrative and tax regulations, enhance the
efficiency of customs administration, and improve the road and telecommunications
infrastructure.

Allen Dennis, (2006), “Trade Liberalization, Factor Market Flexibility, and Growth: The Case of Morocco and
Tunisia,” World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3857.

16
•

Continue liberalizing the services sector. The services sector—the main engine of
growth under the XIth Plan—remains heavily regulated as well as largely closed to
foreign participation. The authorities noted that some sectors, including the financial
sector, have been liberalized and opened up to foreign investors and that progress in other
sectors is underway.

20.
The authorities are pursuing their efforts to combat money laundering and the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The discussion of the World Bank assessment report at
the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) plenary in
April 2007 resulted in some upgrades of Tunisia’s ratings. Tunisia highlighted its continuing
progress between the date of the assessment and the MENAFATF plenary. Tunisia continues
to implement its AML/CFT regime, particularly in the banking sector through training and
adoption of detection and internal control systems. Tunisian banks have formed AML/CFT
compliance units, are planning to set up the needed internal processes and IT, and are
undertaking adequate training for the effective implementation of the AML/CFT
requirements. To help with implementing these improvements, the authorities requested TA.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Skillful macroeconomic management and an outward-oriented development
strategy have contributed to placing Tunisia’s economic performance over the past
decade among the best in the region. This good performance notwithstanding, Tunisia
faces a common challenge with its neighbors—relatively high unemployment, especially
among university graduates. To boost growth and employment, Tunisia has to accelerate the
pace of reforms, particularly in the financial sector, and strengthen its macroeconomic
position to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the Tunisian economy as it pursues
deeper integration into the world economy.
22.
Fiscal policy has been prudent but further fiscal consolidation is necessary to
maintain long-term fiscal sustainability, in view of growing budget pressures, particularly
from population ageing and declining nontax and tariff receipts. Therefore, fiscal
consolidation through a broadening of the tax base, more efficient spending, and early debt
retirement should continue. In particular, the costly fuel subsidies should be phased out given
that oil prices are expected to stay high in the medium to long term.
23.
Staff welcomes the recent measures to restore the financial position of the social
security system over the medium term but recommends accelerating its comprehensive
reform. The health insurance reform and the raise in pension contributions should help
eliminate the social security deficit over the coming years. However, the system’s long-term
viability hinges on its comprehensive reform planned for 2010. In view of the increasing
importance of medium- and long-term demographic-related budgetary issues, it is important
to continue developing a more forward-looking fiscal framework where these issues can be
more effectively analyzed.

17
24.
The short-term monetary policy stance remains appropriate but some risks of
overheating exist. The BCT should remain vigilant considering the increase in petroleum
product prices in May, the likely structural nature of excess liquidity, and the impact from
sizable infrastructure investment projects. Close coordination of fiscal and monetary policies
will be necessary.
25.
There is no clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment and macroeconomic
policies are consistent with external stability. The recent depreciation of the real effective
exchange rate reflects a significant terms of trade deterioration and a structural, but
sustainable, current account deficit.
26.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue enhancing the flexibility of the
exchange rate and the autonomy of the money and foreign exchange markets. While the
volume of interventions has declined, the flexibility of the exchange rate remains limited,
particularly considering the move to inflation targeting over the medium term. In addition,
money and foreign exchange markets development would benefit from improving liquidity
management in order to better anticipate the impact of volatile treasury operations upon bank
liquidity, eliminating the requirement that banks transfer daily foreign exchange balances to
the BCT (nivellement), and delaying the quotation of the daily exchange rate as a first step
prior to eliminating this practice. Ultimately, the de-indexation of bank assets and liabilities
from the TMM should give the BCT greater flexibility in using it as a policy instrument.
Accordingly, it is important to continue informing economic agents—particularly banks—of
these changes and their implications to ensure adequate preparation.
27.
The BCT’s objective of moving toward inflation targeting over the medium term
requires strengthening the research and forecasting capacity of the BCT. Preparations
should be accelerated given the time lags necessary to build adequate human capacity and
develop the required statistical tools.
28.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ comprehensive strategy based on the FSAP and
its update to strengthen the banking sector, yet believes that additional measures may
be needed to attain simultaneously the BCT’s dual objective set for 2009 and the
objectives of the XIth Plan. If the decline in the NPLs ratio continues at its present rate, the
authorities’ objective of 15 percent by 2009 should be achievable but additional capital is
likely to be needed, especially in public banks, in order to reach 70 percent provisioning
ratio. Furthermore, a dynamic and efficient banking sector is crucial for higher growth and
full capital account liberalization. The authorities are encouraged to consider the additional
measures proposed by staff.
29.
The authorities’ efforts to integrate the Tunisian economy regionally and
globally are laudable. Staff supports further progress in simplifying and reducing MFN
tariffs.

18
30.
Some complementary reforms are critical for maximizing the benefits of
economic integration. Further labor market flexibility would help improve the
competitiveness and flexibility of the Tunisian economy and facilitate labor reallocation in
response to structural change. In particular, dismissal rules remain cumbersome and should
be relaxed further. Regarding the investment climate, staff welcomes the ongoing efforts and
encourages the authorities to continue increasing transparency, improving governance, and
facilitating access to financing for SMEs. Finally, the services sector remains heavily
regulated and largely closed to foreign participation. Therefore, the preparatory work for
liberalizing trade in services with the EU is encouraging.
31.
Staff welcomes the progress in the implementation of the AML/CFT report
recommendations and supports the authorities’ goal of moving toward full compliance.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Debt-stabilizing
noninterest
current account 6/

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in
U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(ε >0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent
of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on executing
payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after maturity of
existing commitments; and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions which are
subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144 (52/51).
Since March 1, 1994, the market rates are determined in an interbank foreign exchange
market. On June 21, 2007, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar was
$1=TD 1.3071, equivalent to SDR 1= TD 1.97266.
Article IV Consultation
Tunisia is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were held
in Tunis from December 5 to 19, 2005 and the consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on May 24, 2006.

ANNEX II. FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of May 31, 2007)
1.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia has a total of 18 active operations and
118 closed loans, of which 10 International Development Agency (IDA) credits amounting to
$75.2 million net of cancellations. Cumulative net commitments represent $5.1 billion. Of
this total, $3.8 billion has been repaid. Net commitments for the 18 current operations
amount to about $0.8 billion.
2.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board on June 3, 2004.
It proposes to assist the Government of Tunisia (GOT) in addressing three key challenges:
(a) strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more competitive,
internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy; (b) enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a knowledge
economy; and (c) improve the quality of social services through enhanced efficiency of
public expenditures. The CAS progress report is currently being prepared, with a Board
presentation scheduled in end-August 2007. It notes that, while the CAS is overall on track
and remains fully relevant for Tunisia’s key development challenges, the low level of private
investment constitutes a major concern, threatening growth and job creation.
3.
Bank lending is a mix of long-term investments in infrastructure and social sector
financing, and development policy lending to support reforms at the sectoral and
macroeconomic reforms. Recent loans include: Tunis West Sewerage ($66.8 million)
approved in July 2006 and Sustainable Solid Waste Management ($22.0 million) approved in
March 2007. This latter project is the first of its kind in Tunisia, which will incorporate, as
part of a Bank investment project, a component on carbon emission reduction and provide
Bank assistance in accessing the emerging global market of carbon finance under the Clean
Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. An additional financing of $6.0 million is
scheduled to be approved in July for the Export Development II project.
4.
Preparation is ongoing for the following projects: Water Sector Investment II, Energy
Efficiency and Capacity Building Rural Development.
5.
Despite the fact that the quality of the portfolio is satisfactory, cumbersome
procurement procedures and slow implementation pace—especially in the rural development
portfolio—are affecting the portfolio performance. A Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) was carried out in May 2005 with special focus on procurement issues. An action
plan was designed to address the key constraints identified and is being implemented jointly
by the Bank and counterpart teams.
6.
Past analytical work includes studies of employment challenges, poverty trends,
private participation in infrastructure, public debt management, and tourism. The last
Development Policy Review (DPR) was prepared in 2003 in order to assess Tunisia’s key

32
challenges and policy priorities in the years ahead. It provided the analytical basis for the
current Country Assistance Strategy. GOT has requested a new DPR for FY08.
7.
Recent work includes Country Financial Accountability and Procurement
Assessments, a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), audit and
accounting module, and analytical work in education, health and agriculture. An update of
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted jointly with the IMF has just
been completed. Three subregional Maghreb studies (covering Tunisia, Morocco, and
Algeria) were completed in 2006 and 2007. These studies focus on: (a) the textiles and
clothing sector and the impact of MFA dismantling; (b) economic diversification; and (c) a
subregional study on Maghreb regional economic integration and on the link between policy
reforms in the service sectors and economic performance in the region.
8.
Ongoing analytical work includes studies on service liberalization and export
competitiveness, small and medium enterprises (efficiency of technical centers, access to
land and access to finance), firm competitiveness (survey of firm leaders) and on skills
development, social insurance and employment.
9.
In addition, the World Bank is providing technical assistance on a regular basis on
issues such as public debt management, performance-based budgeting, the promotion of the
knowledge-based economy and productivity analysis. The Bank also provides multi-year
support on employment and labor market issues as part of a Programmatic Economic and
Sector Work.

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Overall, available economic and financial data are adequate for surveillance and have
generally been provided to the Fund on a regular and timely basis. Most of those data are also
made available to the public. Tunisia subscribed to the SDDS in June 2001 and its metadata
are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC was
published in August 2006, following a mission that took place in April 2005.
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Data on GDP by economic sector are disseminated at current and constant prices.
Work is well advanced toward the full adoption of the System of National Accounts 1993
(1993 SNA). Statistical techniques are adequate for the annual accounts but need some
refinement for the quarterly estimates. Source data for the quarterly national accounts could
be further diversified to improve coverage. Currently, an outdated base year (1990) is used
for the constant price series. A new series using 2000 as base year is expected to be released
in the near future.
3.
Data provided for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) on real
sector developments is satisfactory and most data are reported in a timely manner, although
export and import price and volume indices are reported with a long lag. Data on
employment, unemployment, and wages should be collected and reported on a more frequent
basis.
Government Finance Statistics
4.
In addition to the information reported in the SDDS, government finance data are
collected by the staff at the time of the Article IV consultation mission. Regarding data for
publication, GFS cash data up to 2006 have been published in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook 2006. Data cover budgetary central government and consolidated central
government. Tunisia does not report monthly or quarterly data for publication in the IFS.
External Sector Statistics
5.
Statistics for balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP)
are compiled by the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT), following the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, (BPM5). The BOP statistics are prepared on a
quarterly basis and the IIP on an annual basis, complying with SDDS requirements.
However, Tunisia does not report quarterly data for redissemination in IMF publications. The
CBT issues preliminary monthly statistics, mostly prepared on the basis of banks’ settlements
with nonresidents. BOP statistics are generally adequate for annual surveillance, although
greater detail on the financial account would be desirable. However, the 2005 data ROSC
mission noted that remittances of Tunisian workers abroad are classified as income instead of
current transfers in national publications (while they are correctly classified in data reported

35
to STA), and that reinvested earnings of foreign direct investments are not recorded in the
balance of payments. As an SDDS subscriber, Tunisia reports reserves data following the
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity—Operational Guidelines (Reserves
Template) since June 2001.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by the CBT are broadly based on the 1984 Guide to Money and
Banking Statistics in International Financial Statistics. Although monetary statistics meet
SDDS requirements, there is room for improvement. For example, banks’ claims on the rest
of domestic sector (other than central government and financial corporations) are not fully
sectorized; monetary gold is valued at a fixed price; and accrued interest on deposits is not
included in the outstanding value of these deposits. The CBT has initiated a plan to migrate
to the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).
The CBT reported to STA test data on 1SR, which is the Standard Report Form for central
bank data for December 2004 and October 2005. For publication in International Financial
Statistics-Supplement, the CBT also could report to STA the Standard Report Forms (at least
forms 1SR, 2SR, and 5SR) on a regular monthly basis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 9, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the Article IV
Consultation with Tunisia
On August 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
Effective economic management and an outwards-oriented development strategy have
contributed to placing Tunisia’s economic performance over the past decade among the
best in the region, with real GDP growth averaging almost 5 percent in a stable
macroeconomic environment. Over the past two years, the Tunisian economy has
shown resilience in the face of surging prices of oil and other imported commodities,
sustaining relatively strong growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Real GDP growth accelerated from 4 percent in 2005 to 5.4 percent in 2006 owing to a
rebound in agricultural output, expansion of nontextile manufacturing, and vitality of the
services sector. Robust income growth and abundant liquidity boosted domestic
demand. However, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 14.2 percent in
2006. Inflation declined rapidly after a spike in the first half of 2006, following the
monetary policy tightening by the Central Bank of Tunisia’s (BCT) in the second half.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the August 3,
2007 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
The current account deficit widened, but the balance of payments recorded a large
surplus owing to privatization receipts, which helped reduce total external debt from
65.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to 59.1 percent in 2006. Fiscal policy has been prudent.
Strong nontax revenue and expenditure restraint reduced the 2006 budget deficit to
2.9 percent of GDP, significantly lower than the 3.6 percent budget forecast.
Prudential indicators significantly improved in 2006 relative to 2003 with nonperforming
loans (NPLs) as a ratio of total loans declining from 24 percent to 19.2 percent and
provisions-to-NPLs ratio increasing from 43.1 percent to 49.2 percent.
The short- and medium-term outlook remain positive. Real GDP growth is projected to
continue to accelerate to reach about 6 percent in 2007, owing to strong agricultural
output, a recovery in textiles and clothing, and buoyant services sector exports. Inflation
should remain subdued and the fiscal and external deficits would be broadly unchanged.
However, the positive short-term outlook hinges on agricultural output returning to trend,
oil prices remaining below $70 a barrel, and growth in the EU—Tunisia’s main export
market—not faltering.
Tunisia’s key challenge is to create enough jobs for the fast-growing university graduate
population while reinserting the already large number of unemployed. This is the
overarching objective of the recently released XIth Plan which seeks to boost annual
growth to more than 6 percent during 2007–11 by continuing to move the Tunisian
economy toward a knowledge-based, high value-added economy while deepening its
global integration.
Tunisia continues to improve the quality and dissemination of statistical data and
increase the transparency of its economic policies. Tunisia has published all Executive
Board documents and staff mission statements in recent years.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
Tunisian authorities for their skillful macroeconomic management and commitment to
structural reforms, which contributed to Tunisia’s strong economic performance over the
past decade. Growth has been steady, inflation has been contained, financial sector
vulnerabilities are being addressed, and the public debt has been placed on a
downward path. In the period ahead, the key challenge will be to reduce the relatively
high level of unemployment, particularly among university graduates. Directors agreed
that the authorities should continue their efforts to accelerate the pace of reforms and
further strengthen the macroeconomic position, in order to raise growth and reduce
unemployment, while enhancing the economy’s flexibility and resilience as it becomes
more integrated into the world economy.

3
Directors assessed the short- and medium-term outlook as positive, and the current
macroeconomic policy mix as appropriate and consistent with external stability. They
encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to risks of overheating considering the
recent increase in the price of petroleum products, the likely structural nature of excess
liquidity, and the impact of sizable infrastructure projects. Close coordination of fiscal
and monetary policies is important.
Directors praised the authorities for their prudent fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation
should continue in order to maintain long-term fiscal sustainability in the face of growing
budget pressures, particularly from population ageing and declining nontax and tariff
receipts. Accordingly, the tax base should be broadened, more efficient spending
promoted, and early debt retirement pursued. Given expectations of persistently high oil
prices in the medium to long term, increasingly costly fuel subsidies should be phased
out.
Directors welcomed the recent measures to restore the financial position of the social
security system over the medium term, and noted the importance of accelerating the
planned comprehensive reform of the system. They observed that a more forwardlooking fiscal framework would assist in the analysis of medium- and long-term
budgetary issues related to population ageing.
Directors considered that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate.
In view of the plans to move to inflation targeting over the medium term, Directors called
on the authorities to continue enhancing the flexibility of the exchange rate and
promoting development of the money and foreign exchange markets, by reducing the
central bank’s role in these markets. They also advised further price liberalization as the
relatively high share of administered prices in the consumer price index could
complicate the conduct of monetary policy, particularly in the context of an inflation
targeting framework. Finally, Directors encouraged the central bank to continue
informing market participants of the reform process and its implications, and to
strengthen its research and forecasting capacity.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ comprehensive strategy to reform the financial
system based on the Financial Sector Assessment Program and its update, which has
already had positive results. They supported the objectives of reducing the incidence of
nonperforming loans and increasing provisioning on remaining nonperforming loans by
end-2009, although the latter may require some bank recapitalization. A dynamic and
efficient banking sector will be essential for higher growth and sound transition to a fully
liberalized capital account. Directors encouraged the authorities to consider additional
measures to strengthen bank management, revitalize credit culture, improve risk
management, and further enhance financial transparency.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in integrating the Tunisian
economy into the regional and global economy. They looked forward to further progress
in simplifying and reducing multilateral tariffs. Continued efforts to make the labor market

4
more flexible, liberalize the services sector, and improve the investment climate would
strengthen the economy’s competitiveness and overall flexibility, and help Tunisia take
full advantage of the benefits of trade liberalization.
Directors welcomed the progress made in implementing measures to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and supported the authorities’ request for
Fund technical assistance in this area.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Tunisia will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Tunisia
and Sadok Rouai, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
August 3, 2007
Our Tunisian authorities wish to thank staff for the balanced report and the insightful
Selected Issues Paper (SIP) and express their gratitude for the valuable support and guidance
they have received from the Executive Board, management and staff. As usual, the
authorities consent to the publication of the staff papers. The 2007 Article IV consultation
discussions coincided with the final stage of the adoption of authorities’ medium-term
strategy under the XIth five-year Plan covering the period 2007–11 (detailed in Box 1) and
allowed a mutual assessment of the progress achieved and the challenges ahead.
Macroeconomic and financial developments in 2006 are encouraging and short- to mediumterm outlook is favorable. GDP growth reached 5.4 percent in 2006, reflecting a more
resilient and diversified economy, and is projected to accelerate to 6 percent in 2007,
benefiting from strong export performance, including in the textiles and clothing sector
which is performing reasonably well despite strong world competition since the expiration of
the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. Inflation has been brought back to below
2.5 percent for the first half of 2007 following tightening of monetary policy by the Central
Bank of Tunisia (Banque Centrale de Tunisie, BCT) in the second half of 2006. Prudent
fiscal policy and improved nontax revenues contained the fiscal deficit under 3 percent
despite high oil prices. Using the bulk of privatization receipts to prepay external debt
in 2006/07 has been helpful in improving debt indicators and the assessment by rating
agencies of Tunisia’s external position.
In recent years, the Fund’s surveillance agenda has been aligned with the authorities’
medium-term reform program. The overriding objectives of the authorities, reiterated in the
XIth Plan, are job creation for an increasing number of university graduates and improvement
in living standards. To reach these objectives, the authorities’ strategy centers on
safeguarding macroeconomic stability and on continued implementation of comprehensive
structural reforms, particularly financial liberalization, to promote private investment and
further integrate Tunisia into the world economy. Since the completion of the 2002 FSAP,
discussions between the authorities and staff have been focused on three major policy areas
i.e. fiscal consolidation, modernization of the monetary and exchange rate policy framework,
and strengthening the banking sector. These discussions are being complemented by targeted
technical assistance for which the authorities are grateful.
Within the context of better than projected fiscal position, progress in tax reform and
administration, gradual oil prices adjustments, and improvement in debt indicators, the
discussions on fiscal policy centered on medium- to long-term issues, in particular social
security reform. The authorities agree with staff on the importance of ensuring long-term
financial sustainability for the social security funds in view of the rapid demographic changes
and population aging as well as their objective of raising the coverage from 90 percent of
active population in 2006 to 95 percent by 2009. Given the complexity of the reforms

2
required to reestablish the long-term sustainability of the system, the authorities have adopted
a two-pronged strategy. First, to eliminate the recent deficit of the social security funds, the
authorities have taken a number of corrective measures including an increase in pension
contributions and the adoption by Parliament of an ambitious health care reform package
designed to contain health care costs and improve the delivery of health services. These
measures should eliminate the deficit over the next few years. Second, the authorities have
undertaken a consultative process with all stakeholders to agree on a package of reforms that
will ensure the viability of the system through 2030.
The BCT will continue to conduct monetary policy with a tightening bias to ensure that
monetary expansion remains manageable and inflation under control. Concomitantly, the
BCT is pursuing its strategy of gradual move toward full capital account liberalization, freefloating exchange rate, and an inflation-targeting framework. The Fund’s contribution in
these areas were very helpful, including a recent MCM technical assistance mission to help
the BCT progress toward an inflation-targeting framework and a workshop conducted by
staff in the context of the Article IV consultation discussions based on the background
studies to the staff report. The authorities consider that the recent amendment of the BCT law
to set price stability as the main objective of monetary policy and to strengthen the
independence of the central bank are important steps that need to be consolidated along the
lines of staff recommendations summarized in Box 3 of the report. They also recognize the
need to develop their technical capacity in the areas of research and forecasting. The
authorities share staff’s assessment regarding the exchange rate level and agree that, going
forward, there is a need to clarify the role of the exchange rate in the monetary policy
framework. It is important to note that discussions on exchange rate regime and policies
between the staff and the authorities have always been characterized by analytically-based
and candid exchange of views and relevant data. The authorities consider that the current
managed float as an intermediate step toward a floating exchange rate regime and are
committed to strengthen their analytical capacity and to increase the flexibility of the
exchange rate in both directions consistent with their medium-term strategy of gradual capital
account liberalization.
To build on the significant improvement in banking soundness indicators of the past few
years, including the trend reduction in the level of NPLs, the authorities remain committed to
banking sector reform in view of the importance and contribution of this sector to the
promotion of private investment and the increasing integration of the economy into global
financial markets. They agree with staff that the level of NPLs remains relatively high. They
consider, however, that under the policies agreed upon in the context of the 2006 FSAP
update, as detailed in Box 4, the intermediate objective of reducing NPLs to 15 percent of
total loans by 2009 is achievable. They recognize, however, that further efforts are needed to
raise the provisioning ratio to 70 percent but consider that the growing role of private banks,
including through further privatizations, will contribute to strengthening the banking sector.
Finally, the authorities consider that improvement in the investment climate and additional
investments in infrastructure are important to support the private sector and the further
opening of the economy. In this regard, while they are gratified with the ranking received
from international organizations, such as the World Economic Forum, and the first rating

3
upgrade to A- by the Japanese agency R&I1, they see room for further improving the
competitiveness of the economy and promoting private investment. Thus, they are seeking to
improve their ranking in the World Bank’s “Doing Business.” A high-level interdepartmental committee has been set up with the objective of reviewing scores and rankings
by international organizations and proposing the necessary reforms to the government.

The BCT took advantage of this upgrade to sell recently 30 billion yen in 3.2 percent
20-year Samurai bonds.
