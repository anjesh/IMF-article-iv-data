IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Timor-Leste

On May 11, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV Consultation with Timor-Leste.1
Non-oil real GDP growth is estimated to have declined to 4.3 percent in 2015 from 5.5 percent in
2014, due to weaker government spending. Both headline and core inflation eased to below
1 percent in 2014 and 2015, reflecting lower commodity prices, a stronger U.S. dollar against
Timor-Leste’s trading partners’ currencies, and some improvement in supply bottlenecks.
The fiscal position weakened in 2015 due largely to lower petroleum revenue. Petroleum revenue
fell by 40 percent in 2015 mainly on account of the slump in global oil prices. Staff’s estimate
points to an overall fiscal surplus of 4.2 percent of GDP in 2015, a considerable reduction from
the large surpluses in previous years. Prudent saving of its oil wealth in the Petroleum Fund (PF),
Timor-Leste’s sovereign wealth fund, has provided a financial cushion to help offset revenue
losses. Withdrawals from the PF remained above the level consistent with the estimated
sustainable income, in part to finance front-loaded capital investments. This, coupled with lower
oil receipts and negative net investment returns due largely to foreign exchange valuation losses,
saw the balance of the PF decline for the first time, to $16.2 billion as of end-2015.
The external current account surplus was halved to 25 percent of GDP in 2014 and is estimated
to have shrunk further to 17 percent of GDP in 2015. This is largely due to lower income from
declining oil and gas receipts and weak investment returns on the PF portfolio against weak
global equity market performance in 2015. The banking system is highly liquid and well
capitalized. Growth of private sector credit picked up to 10.5 percent (y/y) in December 2015
from 5.5 percent in December 2014. Excess liquidity in the banking system and banks’ overseas
placements of deposits have remained high.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The medium-term growth outlook depends critically on economic diversification and ensuring a
sustainable fiscal position. Average non-oil real GDP growth in the medium-term is projected at
5.5 percent, supported by increasing public spending and foreign direct investment. This hinges
on successful prioritization of government expenditures to facilitate high-return infrastructure
investments in tandem with structural reforms that catalyze non-oil private sector growth.
The main sources of risk over the medium- to long-term are higher fiscal spending, public
investments not yielding adequate returns and enhanced growth, and inadequate mobilization of
domestic revenues.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in nation building and
economic and social development. However, Directors noted that Timor-Leste faces difficult
policy challenges from the fall in oil revenue and the country’s large development needs. Going
forward, they emphasized the importance of achieving fiscal sustainability and economic
diversification.
Directors saw a need for continued fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to
strengthen non-oil revenue, rationalize current spending, and adhere to a medium-term
adjustment plan. Recognizing the need for capital spending, Directors encouraged the
authorities to prioritize public investment plans, focusing on high-return infrastructure projects
through rigorous investment appraisal, so that such spending is in line with implementation
capacity and debt sustainability. Directors stressed that optimizing the composition and quality
of spending to help close Timor-Leste’s infrastructure gap will be key to long-term fiscal
sustainability and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to preserving the assets of the Petroleum Fund.
In this context, they supported higher use of concessional financing for large infrastructure
projects, which would reduce reliance on withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund and support
greater discipline in investment spending. Directors also welcomed plans to introduce a valueadded tax, which will help achieve the government’s target of raising non-oil revenues.
Directors supported the efforts to improve financial inclusion, underscoring the importance of
striking the right balance with safeguarding financial stability. They saw a need for continued
efforts in strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity and improving central bank
functions. Directors called for a strategy to fully resolve legacy non-performing loans.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors concurred that the use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender has served Timor-Leste well.
They supported the authorities’ plan to pursue further financial sector and institutional
development to pave the way for any potential change in the monetary and exchange rate regime.
Directors emphasized that medium-term growth will depend critically on economic
diversification. In this context, they agreed that priority should be given to boosting the private
sector by building infrastructure, improving the business climate and enhancing competitiveness.
Improvement in social conditions and investment in human capital will also be necessary.
Directors called for continued efforts to improve statistical capacity as well as the quality and
timeliness of data, which are crucial for policy formulation. They encouraged the authorities to
further leverage technical assistance from the Fund and other development partners.

TIMOR-LESTE
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 7, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Timor-Leste has been making steady progress in nation building and economic
development. However, adjusting from high oil dependency, large social and
infrastructure development needs, and weak institutional capacity poses considerable
challenges. While prudent saving of its oil wealth in the Petroleum Fund (PF) has
provided Timor-Leste with a financial cushion to help offset revenue losses related to the
recent fall in global oil prices, fiscal trends under existing capital expenditure plans are
unsustainable as the PF will be depleted in the long term at the current rate of
withdrawals. The debt sustainability assessment has deteriorated and points to a
moderate risk of debt distress reflecting the government’s plan to tap concessional
borrowing to finance front-loaded public investments. Restoring fiscal sustainability
hinges on fiscal consolidation and successful prioritization of government expenditures
to facilitate high-return infrastructure projects and catalyze non-oil private sector growth
to achieve economic diversification.
Policy challenges center on achieving fiscal sustainability and economic
diversification. Policy imperatives include:


Fiscal policy. Achieving fiscal sustainability requires scaling back plans to front-load
public investment, rationalizing recurrent spending, mobilizing non-oil revenues, and
adhering to a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.



Debt sustainability. Staff supports the authorities plan to tap concessional
borrowing to finance higher frontloaded capital expenditures, which would help
preserve the assets of the Petroleum Fund as an endowment fund, while stressing
the need to strengthen debt management capacity. Bold fiscal consolidation
measures are also needed to safeguard long-term fiscal and debt sustainability.



Financial policy. Efforts to promote financial inclusion need to strike a balance with
safeguarding financial stability by strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity.



Structural reforms. Continuing effort to develop human capital, boost
competitiveness, and create an enabling business environment is key to economic
diversification and private sector growth.

CONTEXT
1.
A smooth political transition has been achieved with elections due next year. The sixth
constitutional government was formed in February 2015 under Prime Minister (PM) Dr. Rui Maria de
Araújo. Former PM Gusmão remains in the Cabinet as Mentoring Minister and Minister of the new
Planning and Strategic Investment Ministry. Mari Alkatiri, the first elected PM, has been appointed to
head the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Oecusse Ambeno and the Oecusse Ambeno and
Atauro Special Zones for Social Market Economy (ZEESM). The smooth transition to the new
government and strong cross-party cooperation underscored political stability. Presidential and
parliamentary elections are due in early 2017.
2.
Timor-Leste is facing difficult policy challenges due to the sharp fall in oil revenue and
large developmental needs. Highly dependent on oil exports, it is also a fragile low-income
country. According to industry estimates, unless new oil reserves are developed, oil production is
expected to decline further and cease by 2023. The impact of persistently low oil prices on fiscal
spending is limited in the short run due to the buffer provided by the Petroleum Fund (PF), as about
80-90 percent of the oil reserves has been extracted and transformed into financial assets of the PF.
However, over the long run, low oil prices would delay potential investment in new oil fields and
weaken the prospects for developing the petroleum sector. Fiscal revenues will be highly dependent
on the investment returns of the PF (Appendix 1). The deterioration in the global outlook and lower
oil prices weigh on growth prospects and add strain to the fiscal position. Compared to the previous
Article IV consultation concluded in 2014, the projected trajectory of the PF balance is significantly
lower in the outer years, reflecting the higher rate of excess withdrawals. This underscores the
urgency of measures to restore fiscal sustainability. Under the Strategic Development Plan (SDP)
introduced in 2011, Timor-Leste aims to achieve upper-middle income status by 2030, by targeting
infrastructure and human capital development, promoting economic diversification, and reducing
poverty. Infrastructure development needs remain critical and past expenditure results have been
mixed, due largely to low implementation capacity affecting effectiveness. In the presentation of the
2016 Budget, the PM highlighted the need to ensure that public resources are used efficiently and
effectively to provide quality services. The authorities have received intensive technical assistance
from the Fund in the first decade since independence and have made satisfactory progress in
implementing the Fund’s recommendations, although implementation challenges remain, including
on the fiscal reform agenda (Appendix 2).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
3.
Growth has moderated while inflation has fallen sharply. Non-oil real GDP growth is
estimated to have declined to 4¼ percent in 2015 from 5½ percent in 2014, due to reduced
government spending. Total real GDP is estimated to have contracted by 0.6 percent in 2015 due to
declining oil production. Both headline and core inflation eased to below 1 percent in 2014 and
2015 from double-digit levels in previous years, reflecting lower commodity prices, a stronger U.S.
dollar against Timor-Leste’s trading partners’ currencies, and some improvement in supply
bottlenecks (Figure 1, Table 1).
4.
The fiscal position weakened in 2015 due largely to lower petroleum revenue.
Petroleum revenue fell by 40 percent in 2015 mainly on account of the slump in global oil prices.
Despite lower revenues at $1.45 billion (excluding grants), in light of the smaller expenditure outturn
at $1.34 billion (compared with $1.57 billion in the 2015 rectification budget1), staff estimates an
overall surplus of 4.2 percent of GDP in 2015, a considerable reduction from the large surpluses in
previous years. The shortfall in revenue was largely met by a substantial drawdown of the PF. Excess

6.
The external current account position has also deteriorated sharply. The current account
surplus was halved to 25 percent of GDP in 2014 and is estimated to have shrunk further to
17 percent of GDP in 2015. This is largely due to lower income from declining oil and gas receipts
and weak investment returns on the PF portfolio against weak global equity market performance in
2015. Against the backdrop of a significant appreciation of the effective exchange rate and lower
commodity prices, imports is estimated to have declined by 9 percent in 2015. Non-oil exports such
as coffee and tourism remain insignificant. The growth in coffee exports also slowed due to drought
and low coffee prices (Table 4).
7.
Private credit growth has picked up at a moderate pace. Money supply M2 growth
slowed to 7.1 percent (y/y) in December 2015 due largely to an increase in central government
deposits. Growth of private sector credit picked up to 10.5 percent (y/y) in December 2015 from
5.5 percent (y/y) in the previous year. However, the bank lending survey in mid-2015 suggested that
banks are cautious in lending to business enterprises due to credit risks. Credit to individuals
accounted for the largest share at 43 percent, followed by the construction sector constituting
28 percent of total private sector credit as of end-2015. Excess liquidity in the banking system and
banks’ overseas placements of deposits have remained high. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio
declined to 23 percent as of end-December 2015 from 27 percent at end-December 2014 with full
loan-loss provisions. About two-thirds are legacy bad loans with one commercial bank accumulated
during the mid-2000s (Figure 4, Table 3).

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
The medium-term growth outlook depends critically on economic diversification.
Prioritization of government expenditures to facilitate high-return infrastructure investments is key
in tandem with structural reforms that catalyze non-oil private sector growth. Under the baseline
scenario, average non-oil real GDP growth in the medium term is projected to moderate to
5.5 percent, supported by increasing public spending and foreign direct investment. FDI projects in
the pipeline, including a beer and beverage factory, a cement plant, the development of the Tibar
Bay Port and a high-end resort hotel, which are expected to spur private sector development and
create employment opportunities. The impact of persistently low oil prices on fiscal spending is
limited in the short run due to the buffer provided by the PF, but persistently low oil prices would
delay potential investment in new oil fields and hurt the prospects for developing the petroleum
sector. Given that Timor-Leste is fully dollarized and has no independent monetary policy,
adjustments to shocks will need to fall on fiscal policy but fiscal space is constrained by limited
domestic revenue mobilization and the depleting PF balance in the medium to long term (Table 5).
9.
Higher fiscal spending and inadequate mobilization of domestic revenues are the main
sources of risk over the medium-long term (Table 6). Failure to properly conduct feasibility
studies to ensure that public investment is efficient, yields adequate returns, and sufficiently
enhanced growth could amplify risks to fiscal sustainability. Steady depletion of the PF over the
medium-long term due to excess withdrawals to fund existing expenditure plans implies a
heightened risk of fiscal distress unless new non-oil revenues are generated or existing expenditure

plans are revised downwards. Moreover, given the increased share of global equities in the PF’s
portfolio, its investment returns are exposed to the volatility of global financial markets.
Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s outlook and risk assessment. However,
they stressed that frontloaded infrastructure spending is expected to diversify the economy, boost
potential growth, and alleviate capacity constraints. They were also of the view that the current low
inflationary environment provides more space for increasing government spending with little risk of
overheating.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: FACILITATING SUSTAINABLE
GROWTH
A. Fiscal Policy2
11.
The 2016 Budget outlined a
significant scaling up of public
investment in 2017-19, which will strain
fiscal sustainability. The multi-year budget
plan proposed large front-loaded
infrastructure investment in roads, bridges,
ports, and airports, deemed essential to lay
the foundation for private sector-led
development and achieving the 2011-30
SDP goals. This includes the multi-year
development of the Tasi Mane3 project on
the south coast requiring government
investment of $0.8 billion, close to a quarter
of total capital spending in 2017–20. While
frontloading of this investment may be
desirable from the point of view of
development needs, the total capital budget
amounts to US$3.4 billion (130 percent of
GDP) and would entail an overall fiscal
2

For the three scenarios presented in this section, the Budget scenario is based on the authorities ‘ oil prices
assumption which on average is 60 percent higher than the WEO assumption on oil prices used for the baseline and
adjustment scenarios for 2016-21. Assumptions on economic growth, inflation and current account under these
scenarios are shown in Box 1.

Complex and Beaco LNG complex, is designed to form the backbone of the country’s petroleum industry.

deficit averaging 30 percent of GDP. The proposed capital spending of $0.8-1.3 billion per annum
risks stretching administrative capacities, and creating bottlenecks and imbalances in the economy.
On average, the execution rate of capital projects in 2008–14 was 73 percent of planned
expenditures (about US$375 million per annum), and past performance suggests an inverse
correlation between the size of capital spending and the execution rate. Under the budget scenario,
financing will be mainly met through excess withdrawals from the PF, amounting to US$4.6 billion
during 2017-20, or 28 percent of the balance of the PF at end-2015. This would be in addition to the
ESI withdrawals, which would amount to about $2 billion. In staff’s view, these excess withdrawals
will jeopardize the PF’s role as a sovereign wealth fund.
12.
Staff’s baseline fiscal scenario reflects a lower infrastructure spending due to weak
implementation capacity. As staff consider that the budget entails an overly optimistic rate of
project implementation, it used as its baseline a fiscal scenario with infrastructure spending in line
with historical project implementation rates. Under this baseline scenario, staff assumes the
following:


More realistic rate of project execution. Key capital expenditures—about two-thirds of the
planned capital expenditure for 2017–20—are assumed to be spread over a longer period of five
years (compared to the budget assumption of three years).



More stable macroeconomic performance. The baseline scenario is expected to have a
smoother non-oil GDP growth and inflation trajectory and a healthier current account balance
than the budget scenario, reflecting less severe supply bottlenecks and a smaller increase in
imports.



Lower excess withdrawal from the PF, though still at levels above the ESI, meaning a
continued decline of PF. As a result of lower expenditures, excess withdrawal is reduced to
about $3.0 billion or one-third lower than that

Bold fiscal consolidation measures are needed to safeguard long-term fiscal and debt
sustainability. Given the risks outlined above under the baseline scenario, staff advised a set of
measures under an adjustment scenario. Box 1 provides a comparison of the principal
macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes under the budget, baseline, and adjustment scenarios. Under
staff’s proposed adjustment scenario, total spending (excluding grants) should be capped at around
US$1.4 billion per annum between 2017 and 2026 (representing a total expenditure reduction from
65 percent of GDP in 2017 to 29 percent in 2026), and remain broadly constant at 26 percent of GDP
thereafter. The expenditure ceiling up to 2026 is broadly in line with the fiscal envelope of $1.3
billion that was estimated to maintain fiscal sustainability in the Yellow Road Workshop discussion in
May 2013.The proposed lower capital expenditure (which would amount to one-half of the
budgeted amount) would support growth by focusing on high-priority, high-return infrastructure
projects. PF drawdown should be minimized by greater use of concessional borrowing to finance
high-quality infrastructure projects while maintaining debt sustainability. The government should
cease making PF withdrawals in excess of the ESI at the latest by 2026. This scenario recognizes that
an immediate reduction of excess withdrawal would imply limited financing for essential capital
spending (assumed at $325 million per year or 10 percent of GDP) to close the infrastructure gap.
This scenario also reflects the authorities’ reform target to increase domestic tax mobilization
through the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) over the medium term (as discussed below).
Staff projects a tax revenue increase equivalent to about 5 percentage point of non-oil GDP is
needed for tax revenue to reach 13 percent in 2021, and this should be achieved largely through
revenue mobilization by the VAT. The level of fiscal

More could be done to improve spending efficiency. Although the overall allocation to
health and education expenditures has been increasing up to 2015, health expenditure appears low
in comparison to peers, and there is a need to increase the returns on higher education spending.4
More detailed analysis at the sector level on these social spending components and outcomes
would contribute to better resource allocation. The government should also take the lead in
exercising strong wage restraint to avoid losing cost competitiveness. Further, the extension of fiscal
autonomy to Oecusse ZEESM needs to be carefully managed to minimize risks of off-budget
expenditures and the accumulation of contingent liabilities.
15.
Domestic non-oil revenues need to be mobilized urgently. Ongoing work by the Fiscal
Reform Commission to introduce a value-added tax (VAT) regime together with the review of
income tax and other taxes is a step in the right direction to achieve the government’s goal of
raising domestic non-oil revenues from an average of 11 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011–15 to
15 percent of non-oil GDP by 2020. In the near term, focus needs to be given to broadening the tax
base and enhancing tax compliance. While more details in the design and implementation of the
VAT and other taxes still need to be fleshed out, staff recommended the following:


VAT. A single-rate VAT, with exemptions restricted to a minimum and a sufficiently high
registration threshold at the start to exclude most small businesses in consideration of the
limited tax administration capacity, should be implemented as soon as feasible. The choice of
the tax rate should be primarily driven by revenue mobilization needs, and go beyond replacing
current service tax, sales tax, and customs duties.



Other taxes. Staff also recommended raising other taxes to bolster revenue. IMF technical
assistance has recommended that higher excise duties on tobacco and petroleum products and
raising the income tax rate from 10 to 15 percent could yield additional tax revenue of close to
2 percent of GDP. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ plans to review and streamline existing
tax holidays on investment.

16.
The PF is a source of confidence for the economy and should be preserved as an
endowment fund. The authorities remain committed to a transparent and accountable fiscal
framework that has allowed oil revenues to be saved through the PF—an internationally wellregarded institution. The ESI, which functions as a fiscal rule, was intended by the Timor-Leste
government to act as an annual withdrawal limit from the PF, so that the PF assets could be
preserved in real terms and generate a permanent level of investment income to support
government expenditures. While some drawdown of the assets of the PF is justified for infrastructure
investment in order to diversify the economy and boost growth potential, the assets also need to be
preserved at a level that is sufficient to provide adequate investment income for future generations.
The experience of other well-managed natural resource funds suggests that strong fiscal discipline
and binding fiscal rules are needed. In this context, the adoption of the policies under the
4

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

adjustment scenario will facilitate a return to strict compliance of the fiscal rule under the ESI within
a feasible timeframe. At the same time, consideration could be given to revising certain aspects of
the PF legal framework to strengthen the withdrawal rule and reduce room for discretion.
17.
Greater use of concessional loans could help preserve the PF. Staff welcomes the
government’s plans to tap more concessional borrowing to finance large infrastructure projects
instead of just drawing down the PF. The financing gap could be met by external loans, if the
borrowing cost is lower than the opportunity cost of tapping into the PF as measured by the PF’s
expected investment return, and guided by the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). The discipline of
debt sustainability monitoring by creditors may also come with the transfer of knowledge by these
multilateral or bilateral institutions. So far, the government has been very conservative in its
borrowing.
18.
The debt sustainability assessment has deteriorated, and the risk of external debt
distress has increased to moderate. Even though the baseline fiscal scenario does not entail
breaches of any DSA threshold, stress tests resulted in breaches for all but one indicator. The
increased risk of debt distress reflects the authorities’ plan to increase concessional borrowing to
finance higher frontloaded capital expenditures, compared to their plans when the last DSA was
undertaken in 2014. Higher concessional borrowing would however help preserve the assets of the
PF by reducing the need for excess withdrawals. In this context, maintaining a sustainable fiscal
framework (as outlined under staff’s adjustment scenario) is crucial to long-term debt sustainability.
19.
Further strengthening of public financial management (PFM) capacity is needed to
cement progress. The economic and social impact of public investment depends critically on its
efficiency. Recent analytical work by the IMF5 shows that economic dividends from closing the
efficiency gap can be substantial. Improvements in public investment management (related to
planning, allocation and implementation) could increase the efficiency and productivity of capital
spending. The Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) tool developed by the IMF would
help identify reform priorities and develop capacity building strategies. The recently adopted PPP
policy for the Tibar Port could provide a strong template for future PPPs.
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities consider total annual expenditure of US$1.4 billion in the medium
term to be insufficient, given the urgency to develop infrastructure. The government remains
committed to its medium-term infrastructure spending plans as outlined in the SDP as they consider
the infrastructure investments to be essential to economic diversification and raising the potential
growth of the economy. Lower spending would constrain the authorities’ ability to pursue any new
opportunities to boost potential growth. They highlighted the need to improve infrastructure to
attract FDI for achieving economic diversification.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

21.
The authorities concur on the need to ensure the quality of investment spending
through robust feasibility assessments and appraisal of public investment projects. They seek
the Fund’s support to determine the desirable level of infrastructure investment. The authorities also
pointed out that while the Tasi Mane project focuses on facilitating the development of oil and gas
industries, it will also boost general development along the south coast. Further, a significant share
of the government’s total capital spending is channeled towards improving overall infrastructure in
the south coast. They recognized the risk of moving the Tasi Mane project ahead and broadly
shared the staff’s recommendation (see paragraph 31) to remain flexible in the timing and scope of
the project’s implementation, to better manage risks by taking into account changing economic
conditions and opportunities.
22.
The authorities shared staff’s view on the need for timely efforts to mobilize domestic
revenue. Fiscal reform plans in the pipeline include the introduction of the VAT, which will boost
domestic revenues and further bolster fiscal sustainability.
23.
The authorities consider the risk of debt distress to be contained despite higher
borrowing, but see value in further strengthening debt management capacity. The authorities
reiterated their commitment to preserve the assets of the PF and the government’s plan to utilize
more concessional financing for large infrastructure projects. Although the projected external
borrowing to finance the government’s infrastructure spending over the next few years is
considerable, the authorities view the borrowing projections under the baseline scenario as close to
the upper limit of the financing needed. Actual borrowing will be determined by the pace of project
implementation. The accumulated savings in the PF also provide ample buffer against debt distress.
Furthermore, higher growth resulting from infrastructure development is expected to contribute
towards ensuring debt sustainability. The authorities have also expressed interest in Fund TA to
strengthen capacity in debt management.

B. Financial Policy: Safeguarding Stability and Inclusion
24.
Limited progress in financial intermediation is a key constraint on inclusive growth.
There are four banks, of which three are branches of foreign banks (incorporated in Australia,
Indonesia, and Portugal) and one is a locally incorporated, wholly government-owned bank, Banco
Nacional de Comércio de Timor-Leste (BNCTL). BNCTL is the smallest bank but has a predominantly
Timorese customer base, in part because it was a micro-finance institution from 2001 until it was
transformed into a bank in 2011 with an initial capital of $2 million. The banking system is highly
liquid and well capitalized with BNCTL reporting a capital adequacy ratio of 45 percent as of
September 2015, bolstered by a $10 million capital injection by the government in 2014. However, a
very large portion of the economy is cash-based, making payments inefficient and insecure. While
the soundness of banks’ lending remains fundamental, the strong deposit growth and continued
decline in loans-to-deposits ratio suggest that banks are falling short in their role of financial
intermediation. Challenges remain in expanding bank credit to SMEs and rural businesses. Private
sector development is also perceived to be constrained by limited access to long-term credit at
affordable rates.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

25.
The progress in promoting financial inclusion is commendable. Banco Central de TimorLeste (BCTL)’s Financial Sector Master Plan, launched in August 2014, set out a roadmap for financial
sector development to 2025 (Appendix 3). The installation of the Automatic Payment System and
passage of the Law on National Payments System are major milestones towards achieving a more
efficient and secure interbank payments system. Timor-Leste has also adopted a bank-based model
for mobile banking and all four banks are currently in the process of introducing branchless banking
facilities. The recent publication of the Financial System Review by the central bank is a further step
in reviewing the stability of the financial system and monitoring progress towards the sound
development of the financial sector.
26.
Enhancing financial inclusion needs to strike a balance with safeguarding financial
stability. It is commendable that the BCTL is strengthening its capacity in banking supervision,
supported by TA from development partners. A strategy for resolving legacy NPLs (concentrated in
one commercial bank) should be put in place as soon as practical. The BCTL’s aim to enhance its role
as lender of last resort with clear protocols and an appropriate legal framework is commendable.
Although the conceptualization of a development bank is still at an early stage, the authorities
should be vigilant to the risk of contingent fiscal liabilities. International experiences also suggest
that a development bank should have a clear mandate and strong governance structure. Staff and
the BCTL agreed that financial sector entities in the Oecusse ZEESM should remain under the
supervision of the central bank.
27.
Efforts to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework should continue. Timor-Leste has completed the national risk
assessment and the final report is expected to be released in 2016. The BCTL is in the process of
issuing revised instructions for banks and other financial institutions on enhanced due diligence
requirements for high-risk customers in line with the FATF standard.
28.
The use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender remains appropriate in light of institutional
capacity constraints and limited financial development. The current U.S. dollar regime has
served Timor-Leste well, given the country’s high dependence on oil exports. A review of the
exchange rate regime, to study the merits of adopting its own currency as set out in the SDP, will be
conducted by the central bank this year. Staff underscored that financial sector and institutional
developments would be needed to pave the way for any potential exchange rate regime change to
enhance external competitiveness as the economy diversifies away from oil and gas.
Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment of the financial sector.
They noted that banks’ balance sheets are sound, but lending growth has been lagging behind
deposit growth. They shared the staff’s recommendation to resolve legacy NPLs as soon as feasible.
Following the Financial Sector Master Plan, the central bank is working closely with banks to increase
their presence in all the municipalities. The central bank also launched the National Strategic Plan on
financial literacy to provide a framework to raise awareness at the national level. The authorities
recognized that not all international experiences of development banks have been positive, and that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

a development bank should be run in a way that supports market competition and limits contingent
liabilities to the government. They seek the support of development partners in conducting a review
of the exchange rate regime as a longer-term policy option.

C. Structural Reforms: Enabling Private Sector Diversification
30.
Medium-term growth depends critically on economic diversification. Similar to other
small states, the Timorese economy faces impediments to development including low human
capital, poor infrastructure and connectivity, a small domestic market, limited financial sector
development, and high business cost structure. The diversification imperative has gained added
urgency in light of the near depletion of oil production in existing oil fields. The associated reduction
of fiscal resources also implies that the public sector would increasingly have less capacity to boost
growth through government spending and procurements generated from public investment
projects. Continuing efforts to improve health, education, and quality of life, including under the
rubric of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), would also help to lift potential growth
(Appendix 4).
31.
Some degree of government involvement in industrial development is warranted in
cases of missing and incomplete markets. However, this should be well-targeted and
implemented under appropriate risk-sharing arrangements to minimize contingent liabilities. Efforts
aimed at economic diversification present an opportunity to reorient the economy away from the oil
sector. There is concern about the economic viability of the state-initiated development of key
petroleum projects without an agreed commitment with the oil companies to develop new oil fields.
In this context, staff urged the authorities to be flexible in the timing and speed of implementation,
taking into account changing economic conditions and opportunities.
32.
Catalyzing private sector development will need an enabling business environment
and measures to boost competitiveness. Timor-Leste, with its young labor force, is well placed to
take advantage of global and regional integration trends and has applied for ASEAN membership.
To maximize benefits from these opportunities, the private sector should leverage Timor-Leste’s
comparative advantage in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture and tourism through better
branding and marketing, product innovation, and explore niche markets. A recent ADB study6 also
emphasizes the need to build agricultural markets and develop tourism which would require
improving crop quality, productivity (low relative to peers), and supply consistency, while ensuring
price incentives and land tenure arrangements support farm investment and production. Improving
tourism data collection, including market perceptions of Timor-Leste as a tourism destination, is also
key. In this regard, the priority of the government in creating a business and investment climate to
develop a diversified private sector is commendable and the role of the government as a facilitator
could be enforced through increased dialogue and partnership with the private sector. At the same

6

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

time, efforts to increase cost effectiveness are important in order to restore external competitiveness
(Box 2). The mission highlighted the following priority areas. Specifically:


Business climate. Strengthening the enforcement of contracts, resolving insolvency, registering
property, and improving the ease of getting credit, would help to bolster the ease of doing
business (Figure 5). In particular, accelerating the ongoing work on the reform of land law to
clarify land ownership would help to improve the availability of collateral for lending and
facilitate investments.



Wage competitiveness. Relatively high wages in Timor-Leste, in part reflecting the public
service’s minimum wage level, could discourage FDI in labor-intensive sectors (Box 2). Public
sector wages should grow in line with productivity gains. This would also have an important
impact on private sector wages, given that the public sector wage has an important role in
private sector wage determination.



Labor market. Continued emphasis on quality of spending and outcomes in health and
education, including strengthening vocational and technical education, are needed to
strengthen human capital formation (Figure 6 and Appendix 5).

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to further implementing structural
reforms, as set out in the SDP. Currently, the government is reviewing the investment law, and
land and property law to attract more FDI and promote the commercial use of land as collateral in
borrowing/lending. They emphasized that development of essential infrastructure is a priority to lay
the ground for economic diversification.

D. Statistics and Technical Assistance
34.
The timeliness and quality of data continue to pose challenges to surveillance and staff
supports ongoing efforts to improve statistical capacity. With extensive TA from the Fund and
other development partners, much progress has been made in improving statistics. Ongoing key
issues include:


National Accounts. Improvements have occurred in recent years with TA and from donorprovided experts. Improving timeliness and further development of the methodology are
necessary, given source data weaknesses. Continued efforts to close the divergence between
expenditure and production based estimates are needed, including to start the compilation of
producer prices needed for measuring real national product. Staff welcomed the plan to publish
quarterly GDP data and urged closer cooperation and institutional support to the General
Directorate of Statistics for timely compilation of quarterly estimates.

Box 2. Timor-Leste: External Competitiveness
A rising real effective exchange rate (REER) has
led to an erosion of external competitiveness.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has
appreciated by 11 percent since 2014 as gains
from closing the inflation differential with trading
partners have been more than offset by an
appreciation of the nominal effective exchange
rate (NEER) as the U.S. dollars strengthened
against other currencies. While not conducive to
enhancing export performance, petroleum and
coffee—the country’s main exports—are
denominated in U.S. dollars, and the economy is
highly dependent on imports. The medium term
current account deficit is projected to widen, due
mainly to an increase in imports related to capital
spending accompanied by falling oil and gas export
receipts.

Structural reforms remain crucial to boost
external competitiveness. For the development of
the non-oil private sector to gain traction, greater
efforts are needed to diversify export products and
improve the business climate to increase global
competitiveness. Ensuring the minimum wage is in
line with firms’ productivity and regional norms will
also help boost export competitiveness and attract
foreign direct investment. The wage gap between
Timor-Leste and regional peers has narrowed
recently due largely to an increase in minimum
wages in comparators. However, Timor-Leste faces
strong competition from its comparators at
comparable wage level in attracting investors to
expand or relocate labor intensive production to a
frontier market.

13

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE



Poverty. Regular and timely poverty measurements are needed for poverty analysis and policy
review and formulation. The last official poverty indicators were based on 2007 data. A living
standards measure survey that is underway with support from the World Bank will provide the
basis to update poverty related data.

35.
There is a large need for TA and training to support the government’s reform and
development agenda, and to improve human capital. The IMF is providing TA in areas of its
expertise, in close coordination with other development partners. TAs delivered in 2015 include onsite examination of commercial banks, government finance statistics, and external sector statistics.
The IMF also organized a regional workshop—with the participation of Timorese mid-level
officials—to strengthen fiscal framework and planning capacity. Capacity development initiatives in
the pipeline include TA on debt management, support for assessment of public infrastructure
investment, and the continuation of TA on strengthening financial institution oversight.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Timor-Leste is facing difficult policy challenges due to the sharp fall in oil revenue and
large developmental needs. Against the backdrop of low oil prices and a weakening external
environment, growth has moderated and inflation is subdued. However, low oil revenue and plans
to significantly frontload public investment are leading to a significant deterioration in fiscal and
external positions. While savings in the PF have provided some cushion to the reduction of oil
income, the authorities’ spending plan is unsustainable, as at the current rate of withdrawals, the PF
will be depleted in the long term. At the same time, large infrastructure and social development
needs require efficient allocation of public investment.
37.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to safeguard long-term fiscal sustainability. Achieving
fiscal sustainability requires scaling back large front-loaded public investment plans in line with
implementation capacity, rationalizing recurrent spending, strengthening non-oil revenues, and
adhering to a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. In addition, there should be better
prioritization of public investment plans, focusing on high-return infrastructure projects through
rigorous investment appraisal. Optimizing the composition and quality of spending to help close
Timor-Leste’s infrastructure gap is key to long-term fiscal sustainability. The assets of the PF need to
be preserved to provide adequate investment income for future generations. Higher utilization of
concessional financing for large infrastructure projects would reduce reliance on excess withdrawals
from the PF and support greater discipline in investment spending. The introduction of the VAT will
be instrumental in achieving the government’s target of raising non-oil revenues to 15 percent of
non-oil GDP by 2020 and help reduce reliance on the PF.
38.
Medium-term growth depends crucially on economic diversification through
catalyzing private sector development. The diversification imperative has gained added urgency
in light of the near depletion of oil production in existing oil fields and the associated reduction of
fiscal resources. Catalyzing the development of the nascent non-oil private sector will need an
enabling business environment, improvement in social conditions, and investment in human capital

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

to improve competitiveness. The private sector should leverage Timor-Leste’s comparative
advantage in sectors such as agriculture and tourism through better branding and marketing,
product innovation, and exploration of niche markets.
39.
Financial inclusion will help enhance economic growth but needs to strike an
appropriate balance with safeguarding financial stability. The progress in promoting financial
inclusion is promising. The financial sector is developing and is sound but continued effort in
strengthening regulatory and supervisory capacity and improving central bank functions is key. A
strategy to fully resolve legacy NPLs should be put place as soon as practical.
40.
The use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender has served Timor-Leste well. Going forward,
financial sector and institutional developments would be needed to pave the way for any potential
change in the monetary and exchange rate regime.
41.
Continued efforts are required to improve statistical capacity, as limitations in this
area continue to pose challenges to surveillance. Further work is needed to increase the quality
and timeliness of data, which are crucial to policy formulation. The authorities should further
leverage TA from the Fund and other development partners to this end.
42.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Timor-Leste will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Table 6. Timor-Leste: Risk Assessment Matrix 1/
Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood
(high, medium or low)

Expected Impact if Realized
(high, medium or low)

Low/Medium
This could be due to (i) significant China
slowdown in 2016-17; and/or
Medium
(ii) turning of the credit cycle generating
disorderly deleveraging in large emerging
economies and potential spillbacks to
advanced economies.
Medium
Sharp asset price adjustment as investors
reassess underlying risk and response to
unanticipated change in growth and
financial intermediation; Fed policy rate
path, and increase in U.S. term premium,
with poor market liquidity amplifying
volatility.
High
A further surge in the U.S. dollar boosting
non-U.S. trade but creating balance sheet
strains for dollar debtors.
Medium
Low oil and gas prices triggered by global
supply factors reversing only gradually
and due to continuing weak global
demand.

Medium/Low
These could lead to lower global trade
and weak demand for oil, adversely
impacting revenues. The impact is limited
by the insulating role of the Petroleum
Fund (PF) and low levels of non-oil trade
and capital account integration.

Expenditures plans need to be
scalable and efforts to raise
non-oil revenues need to be
intensified..

Medium/Low
PF would gain from higher global interest
rates but could incur capital losses on its
bond portfolio.
Renewed global shocks that affect
international banking operations could
impact local liquidity conditions.
No crisis management or contingency
planning frameworks are yet in place.
Prolonged weakness in credit supply
would limit private sector growth and
diversification efforts.
Medium
Low energy prices delay investment
decisions in new oil fields and investment
may become not profitable. The scope for
government spending is reduced,
lowering GDP growth.

The BCTL’s regulatory and
supervisory framework and
crisis management toolkit
need to be enhanced, with
support from TA donors.

4.Higher inflation

Medium
Inability to moderate public expenditures
raises inflation as the absorptive capacity
of the economy is limited.

Medium
High inflation adversely affects the poor
and vulnerable. Higher transfers to
compensate and higher public sector
wages add to spending pressures.

Fiscal policy needs to be
adaptable to maintain macrostability, preserve
competitiveness and better
protect the poor.

5.Over investment
in projects with
low returns

Medium
This could arise due to the
implementation of capital-intensive
projects with ambitious cost-benefit
analysis.

High
Capital-intensive projects that have
limited linkages mean that job creation
and poverty reduction is limited while
depleting PF and risk fiscal sustainability.

6.Failure to secure
inclusive growth

Low/Medium
Discontent could be triggered by public
perception that oil wealth is not trickling
down and not reducing poverty.

High
Higher rent seeking behavior and more
pressures to raise expenditures and that
may lower the quality of public
investments. Foreign investment, vital for
private sector growth, may be
discouraged.

Projects should be subject to
transparent and realistic cost
benefit assessments and risk
analysis, and only go ahead if
the social returns are higher
than the opportunity costs.
Sound policy frameworks and
governance structures to be
reinforced, especially through
more transparency and
accountability.

2. Tighter or more

Policy Recommendations

As for 1 above.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent; “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent; and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

Appendix I. Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund: Cornerstone of Fiscal
Sustainability
The oil and gas sector has long been the mainstay of the Timorese economy. It accounted for about 70 percent
of GDP and almost 90 percent of total government revenue during 2010–15. In recent years, oil and gas have been
produced in two oil fields—Bayu Undan and Kitan—although under the baseline scenario, all production is expected
to cease by 2023 as reserves become depleted. Prospects for the development of the Greater Sunrise fields remain
uncertain amid unresolved issues over maritime borders and a revenue sharing agreement with Australia, as well as a
bearish outlook for the global energy markets. Therefore, the Greater Sunrise project has not been factored in by the
authorities and Fund staff into the calculation of the wealth of the Petroleum Fund (PF), the estimated sustainable
income (ESI), or in any macro projections.
The PF was set up under the Petroleum Fund Law in 2005 for the management of petroleum revenue. It helps
to smooth the spending of temporarily high petroleum income, shield against the volatility of petroleum prices, and
safeguard the sustainable use of public finances to ensure intergenerational equity. The PF Law requires that all
petroleum revenues are transferred to the PF and invested abroad in financial assets. The PF’s only outgoings are
transfers back to the central government budget based on parliamentary approval. The PF law defines the Estimated
Sustainable Income (ESI) as 3 percent of the total petroleum wealth, which includes the current PF balance plus the
net present value of expected future petroleum revenue.
The ESI could be seen as a form of fiscal rule but without a rigid fiscal ceiling. Actual withdrawal may exceed the
ESI as long as the government provides detailed explanation to the parliament why doing so is in the interest of the
country. The PF is expected to peak in nominal terms in 2016 and declines thereafter if annual PF withdrawal remains
at about US$1.3 billion for the next 10 years against an average projected ESI of US$537 for 2015–20.
Oil prices for estimating ESI are projected under prudent assumption required under the PF Law. This is based
on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) long-term forecasts of the Brent crude oil prices using an
average of the EIA low and reference cases. In recent years, falling oil prices have limited the build-up of the PF to its
original targeted balance. However, the risk posed by low oil prices is becoming less significant as around 80–90
percent of the PF are already in the form of financial assets.
Petroleum Fund Investment Allocation, End-2015
The Central Bank of Timor-Leste undertakes the
operational management of the PF. It invests the Fund’s
capital according to guidelines established by the Ministry of
Finance and mandates developed by the Investment
Advisory Board. Management of parts of the portfolio is
delegated to external investment managers. The PF was
initially invested only in bonds, although an amendment to
the PF Law in 2011 allowed up to 50 percent allocation in
equities to better achieve the real return target. As at end2015, 40 percent of the PF’s investment was invested in
equities. PF wealth declined for the first time in 2015 on
account of valuation losses.

Appendix III. Advancing Financial Inclusion and Safeguarding
Stability
Financial inclusion increases economic growth at initial stage of financial development. Defining financial inclusion
as the access to and use of formal financial services by households and firms, IMF (2015) found the initial levels of
various types of financial inclusion indicators have a positive impact on 10-year growth. Nevertheless, determining the
direction of causation between financial inclusion and economic growth remains a challenge. The study also points to
evidence that financial stability risks increase when access to credit is expanded without proper supervision.1

Central de Timor-Leste (BCTL)’s Master Plan for Financial Sector
Development. The Master Plan aims to increase the proportion of adult population with bank accounts to 90 percent by

At the same time, mitigating the potential risks to financial stability from an unchecked broadening of access to
credit is needed. Sustainable financial inclusion requires balancing opportunity and innovation in financial markets with
the establishment of safeguards to prevent excesses in both the supply of and demand for credit. The BCTL is making
progress in enhancing its supervisory capacity for both on-site and off-site examination of banks in line with recent
technical assistance. The BCTL is also expected to resume oversight of the non-bank financial sector which includes
credit unions and microfinance in the near future, with TA support from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre

Appendix IV. Transition to Sustainable Development Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are replacing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Broader in scope than the MDGs, the SDGs aim to achieve high and sustainable growth economically, socially and
environmentally. A working group led by the Prime Minister’s office is reviewing the Strategic Development Plan
(SDP) for any adaptation needed to align with the SDGs. Timor-Leste played a key role in adopting SDG 16 (peace,
justice, and strong institution) by its efforts and engagement at the global level through coordinating with g+7

Some progress in achieving the MDGs. Timor-Leste is
on-track in promoting gender equality, reducing child
1
mortality, and combating malaria and other diseases.
Notably, infant and child mortality rates have declined
sharply by 50 percent during 2001-09. However, TimorLeste continues to face challenges in improving other
social indicators. Raising the level and efficiency of
health and education spending is essential. The
government has taken initiatives to promote inclusive
growth through various social programs.

* Saude da Familia (Family Health): to classify all households as healthy, at
risk, sick or in rehabilitation by November 2016. Data will be available on the
Ministry of Health website to assist program planning and implementation.
* Servisu Integradu Saude Komunitariu (Integrated Community Health
Service): to ensure all communities have access to health services within an
acceptable walking distance.
* The environmental/public health program: to focus on nutrition and
communicable diseases through programs that deal with tuberculosis, HIV,
and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
2. Education
* Key targets for next two years
- Enrolment of all children in the first year of basic education at the proper age
- Reduction of school dropouts
- Acquisition of minimum literacy and numeracy skills
- Implementation and monitoring of the new base national curriculum for the
1st and 2nd cycles of basic education.

revenues mobilization would create the fiscal space to
increase social and pro-growth spending. Financial inclusion through expanding financial access well supported by
legal, regulatory, and institutional framework would help narrow income and gender inequality. Continued data
enhancements are crucial to monitor and assess progress.

Appendix V. Remittances and Labor Flow Dynamics
Remittance outflows from Timor-Leste have increased since 2006,1 reflecting the reliance on foreign workers for
high-skill managerial jobs. The 2014 Enterprise and Skills Survey shows that the number of foreign workers is
relatively high in managerial and professional positions, especially in oil and gas sector. This suggests the existence of a
skill gap, with the demand for workers with specific qualifications and skills not being met by the supply from local
workers. According to the 2013 Labor Force Survey, a small percentage of the labor force has either a
vocational/polytechnic diploma (5.3 percent) or a university degree (8.9 percent). More generally, human resource
constraints remain severe as 40 percent of the population over 15 years old has not had any education.2
Also, remittance inflows have increasingly become an important income source for households, albeit from a
low base. Outward labor flows provide employment opportunity, while the private sector in Timor-Leste is developing.
According to the UN statistics, migrants from Timor-Leste are currently estimated at around 33,000 (3 percent of the
population).

Reliable data on remittance flows is key to monitoring
external balance, labor market dynamics, and their impact on households’ standard of living. Further
improvement in recording compensation of employees and personal transfers from Timorese residents and national
working abroad in the balance of payments statistics based on available information from financial institutions is
currently being reviewed by the BCTL with the support of Fund TA.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The exchange rate arrangement (de jure and de facto) is an exchange arrangement with no separate
legal tender. On January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of then East
Timor by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This arrangement
has been maintained after Timor-Leste’s independence on May 20, 2002. At present, the monetary
authority does not undertake foreign exchange transactions; they are handled by commercial banks
on the basis of rates quoted in the international markets. Timor-Leste has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultations
Timor-Leste is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
September 15 , 2014. The press release may be found at

Technical Assistance (TA) and Training
TA has been provided by HQ based staff and experts in collaboration with the Pacific Financial
Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), in close collaboration with development partners. Significant

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

TA has been provided in areas of public financial management, including on critical calculations for
Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI). TA on statistics is continuing including on the Government
Financial Accounts. In addition, a large multi-year TA work program is being developed with the
BCTL to support the BCTL’s Financial Sector Development Master Plan. Current and planned
technical assistance is described in more detail below:
FAD: Significant TA has been provided to the Ministry of Finance on treasury and expenditure
management and developing non-oil revenues. Recent TA has focused on the ESI calculation. This is
a key input to the budget and IMF assistance in this area has an important role in maintaining the
credibility of the fiscal rules-based approach.
FAD/ICD/PFTAC: Representatives from Timor-Leste participated in a high-level dialogue in June
2015 that was co-hosted by the IMF and the Government of Fiji in Nadi, Fiji, which focused on
strategies and policies to make Pacific Island economies more resilient to natural disasters. It was
preceded by a three-day workshop on fiscal framework organized by the IMF and PFTAC with
funding from the Australian Government. The workshop was designed to give mid-level officials
responsible for fiscal planning an overview of key elements of the fiscal planning process, with a
focus on strengthening the linkages between policy formulation, planning and execution.
MCM: Recent TA has focused on the financial sector and on the Petroleum Fund as it develops its
investment strategy to encompass a wider range of investments. In November 2013, an MCM TA
mission to the BCTL assessed gaps in institutional capacity in key areas—banking supervision, crisis
management, payments system, and research and analysis. This laid the basis for a multi-year TA
work program on financial sector issues that is currently being discussed with the authorities and
development partners. There is also scope for follow up work on enhancing the Petroleum Fund’s
investment strategy.
MCM/PFTAC: Two missions to Timor-Leste were conducted by PFTAC’s Financial Supervision
Sector during the first half of 2014, aimed at reviewing the status of the country’s non-bank
sector. This was followed in 2015 with the drafting of a Credit Union Act, with the assistance of the
IMF Legal Department. An on-site examination program was initiated in mid 2015 with the support
of a short term expert who provided training with on-site examination preparedness and provided
support with the execution of the on-site examination of a commercial bank. In consultation with
the Central Bank of Timor-Leste (BCTL), PFTAC will continue to provide technical support to the
Supervision Department by implementing a banking supervision training program in 2016, aimed at
providing the staff with the tools required to adequately perform the examination of a financial
institution. The credit union program will resume in 2016 with the staging of a workshop on credit
union financial reporting. This will also include a training component for the staff of the BCTL on
how to adequately perform the oversight of the credit union sector.
STA/PFTAC: Recent missions have focused on: (i) government finance statistics as part of an ongoing project regarding the compilation of fiscal data for operational and statistical purposes—
based on the GFSM 2001 framework—and publishing Timorese data in the International Financial
Statistics; and (ii) balance of payments including on ensuring compliance with the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The national accounts statistics
have been supported in the last two years by donor-funded experts and the Australian Bureau of

MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS/PFTAC :
STI: Government officials from Timor-Leste attend IMF training courses on macroeconomic and
financial policies including statistics and legal issues offered by the STI, both in Singapore and in the
region. In 2014–15, a total of 15 participants from Timor-Leste attended STI training courses in
Singapore.

WORLD BANK—IMF COLLABORATION
The Bank and Fund country teams for Timor-Leste, led by Ms. Bolormaa Amgaabazar (World Bank
Country Representative) and Ms. Yu Ching Wong (IMF mission chief), are cooperating closely on
macroeconomic and macro-critical structural reform issues. The Bank’s country economist, Mr. David
Knight, participated in the 2016 Article IV consultation mission.
The two teams have worked closely on the following:


Macroeconomic developments and economic updates: There has been close dialogue
throughout the year on macro policies and economic developments. There is regular sharing
of information and development of common policy recommendations.



Growth prospects and economic diversification: The teams exchanged views on potential
areas of diversifications and key policies to support diversification away from the oil sector.
The Bank’s forthcoming East Asia Pacific Update will contain a special feature on ‘diversified
development’ on resource-rich countries in the region, including Timor-Leste.



Fiscal sustainability and investment management: Both teams highlighted longer-term
fiscal sustainability as a major challenge facing Timor-Leste, particularly in light of recent
adverse global market conditions in the petroleum sector. Following the Infrastructure Public
Expenditure Review published in March 2015, the World Bank is working on a medium-term
expenditure pressures note for the health sector and is preparing to start work on a public
expenditure review of the agriculture sector. The Fund and the Bank stand ready to provide
further support on fiscal policy and public expenditure analysis.



Revenue mobilization: Both teams have discussed domestic revenue mobilization potential
and policy reforms underway. The Bank is has provided ad-hoc support to the fiscal reform
including by advising on non-tax revenue legislation and mining legislation. Both institutions
stand ready to provide further assistance to support the implementation of key aspects of
the government’s fiscal reform program.



Debt management: The teams have engaged very closely on discussions around the
governments growing debt portfolio and its reforms to strengthen debt management
systems. The Bank and the Fund stand ready to provide complementary technical assistance
upon government’s request. A full DSA was collaboratively updated in February 2016.

The World Bank Group assistance to Timor-Leste is guided by the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) that was approved by the Executive Board in February 2013. The CPS outlines a program that
supports Timor-Leste by utilizing financing available from IBRD and IDA and trust fund resources to
support investments in critical infrastructure that reduces poverty and boosts shared prosperity,
improve service delivery and effective macroeconomic, social and fiscal management.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

Both teams agreed that Timor-Leste’s main macroeconomic challenges lie in developing a
stronger non-oil economy that reduces poverty and in safeguarding long-term fiscal
sustainability. To meet these challenges, Timor-Leste needs to shift to a higher quality and poverty
reducing growth path while ensuring macroeconomic stability. Achieving fiscal sustainability will
require prioritization of public investments through rigorous investment appraisal and further
strengthening of public financial management, mobilizing non-oil revenues, and adhering to a
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. An acceleration of reforms to promote productivity and
competitiveness is also important.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The Table below details the
specific activities planned by the two country teams in 2016-17 period.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 2016)
Timor-Leste joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 2002. The relationship has evolved from
an initial focus on rehabilitation and reconstruction to development of the infrastructure and
institutional capacity needed for growth and poverty reduction. AsDB is supporting the
implementation of Timor-Leste’s Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030 (SDP). A five year country
partnership strategy guided AsDB’s support for the first phase of the SDP and a new strategy for
2016-2020 is now being finalized in collaboration with the government. The new strategy will
support economic diversification by working with the government to remove infrastructure
bottlenecks and institutional constraints, and invest in skills development.
Timor-Leste first accessed the Asian Development Fund (ADF) in 2005. The ADF has provided grants
for road rehabilitation, water supply and technical and vocational education and training projects.
AsDB has worked closely with the government to develop capacity for infrastructure management.
A $15 million six-year technical assistance package, that was co-financed with AusAID, helped plan,
prepare, and execute the Government’s capital development program and train government
officials. Subsequent projects have supported infrastructure management together with policy and
planning for transport, urban water supplies, and the electricity sector.
AsDB is helping Timor-Leste to prepare for membership of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and to develop a competitive financial sector. The AsDB helped establish the Institute of
Microfinance in Timor-Leste, which, in July 2011, became the country’s first locally owned
commercial bank, the Banco Nacional Comércio de Timor-Leste (BNCTL). AsDB continues to
support the growth and commercialization of BNCTL and is also helping the government to
establish a legal framework for bankruptcy and secured transactions. The AsDB provided technical
support for the establishment of the Petroleum Fund and other core elements of public sector
management. It is also supporting the government’s fiscal reform program and helped to design a
new value added tax that could be used to increase domestic revenue collection.
The availability of AsDB resources increased in 2011 following Timor-Leste’s reclassification as a
group B member country. This provides access to AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR), while
retaining access to loans from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Timor-Leste has borrowed $42.21
million of ADF and $135.63 million of OCR since 2011 to finance upgrading of national roads.
Further lending for investment in roads, a seaport, urban water supply and electricity services is
planned for 2016–2018. AsDB continues to promote the provision of a range of infrastructure
services, by the private sector and will help the government to leverage private sector expertise.
The indicative ADF allocation for 2016–2018 is $73.16 million and the indicative OCR allocation
for 2016–2018 is $78.07 million. Actual allocations will depend on demand and on portfolio
performance.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
The enhancement of the General Directorate of Statistics within the Ministry of Finance is an
ongoing priority.
National Accounts: Improvements have occurred in recent years with TA from donor-provided
experts and the Australian Bureau of Statistics and through PFTAC training. Source data weaknesses
for some components continue to hamper improvement of methodology and timeliness.
Price Statistics: Starting 2013, CPI was rebased and basket weights updated using data derived
from the 2011Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). Data are released monthly for Dili,
regions other than Dili and Timor-Leste with a December 2012 reference period (i.e., December
2012=100).
Government Finance Statistics: The compilation of revenue and expenditure is moving toward the
GFSM 2001 approach despite capacity constraints. A three-year TA project financed by the
government of Japan ended in May 2015.
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
The Banco Central de Timor-Leste (BCTL) compiles monetary statistics generally following the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, data are incomplete
because of the absence of official data on public currency holdings—which are difficult to compile
under the current currency regime—and of banks’ positions with public nonfinancial corporations. In
addition, analysis of credit conditions is complicated by the fact that overseas borrowings of
residents are not accounted for.
The BCTL reports detailed monthly monetary data for the central bank and other depository
corporations are using the standardized report forms (SRFs). Data for other financial corporations,
mainly insurance companies, are not compiled. An integrated monetary database meeting the
monetary data needs of the BCTL, APD, and STA is in operation.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Only basic market based indicators are available, and their coverage,
valuation and timeliness vary across such indicators. Data are not sufficiently available to conduct
stress tests of the banking system or Balance Sheet Approach analysis. Cross border exposure data
for financial corporations are not available. Financial soundness indicators are not reported to STA.
External Sector Statistics: While progress has been made, measuring non-Petroleum Fund-related
current account transactions accurately remains a work in progress. Monthly merchandise trade data
are now published regularly but there are significant gaps in the series for 2006 and 2007. Data on
monthly merchandise exports and imports are based on the Automated System for Customs Data

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

(ASYCUDA). Service transactions are largely estimated with data collection largely limited to the
official and tourism sectors. Interest revenue from oil/gas is recorded as primary income.
Quarterly balance of payments data are available for 2006–Q3/2015. While methodology for the
production of basic annual estimates of the balance of payments statistics are in place, further
development is needed to address limitations of existing data sources, in particular, merchandise
trade statistics and service transactions. This includes work to ensure consistency between current
account data and the new National Accounts Statistics, particularly related to the exports of
commodities and imports of services. The coverage of the survey of foreign direct investment
enterprises needs to be expanded, and the exploration and extraction activities in the Joint
Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and in the exclusive territory require additional monitoring.
Currently, there is limited information on remittances from Timorese working abroad and
improvement in the estimation and compilation procedures of such remittances should be pursued.
The October 2015 TA mission on ESS found that important improvements have been made on the
integrated IIP, namely the classification of components; the treatment of changes in prices and
changes in exchange rates; and the treatment of positions of the Petroleum Fund and IMF-related
accounts (reserve position in the IMF, SDR allocations, and SDR holdings). Compilers should improve
the coverage of the FDI survey to include transactions and positions of JPDA companies’ equity
valued at Own Funds at Book Value. Compilers also need to review the current estimates, updating
the information for compensation of employees, and assessing the information on personal
transfers that the financial institutions (banks and money transfer operators) are reporting on a
regular basis to the Bank Supervision Division (BSD).
II. Data Standards and Quality

Timor-Leste began participating in the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System (now the
enhanced GDDS) in 2012, marking a major step
forward in the development of its statistical
system.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA

Data on government finance statistics is available in the GFS Yearbook for the 2013. Timor-Leste do
not report to the Quarterly Public Sector Debt database (QPSD), jointly developed by the World
Bank and IMF. Beginning in February 2008, monetary data have been reported to the IMF for
publication in the IFS. Quarterly balance of payments and IIP data are reported timely to STA for
publication in the IFS.

OF TIMOR-LESTE
April 7, 2016

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Hoe Ee Khor and
Andrea Richter Hume
(IMF) and Satu
Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by Staff of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association1

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Timor-Leste is at moderate risk of
debt distress.2 This represents a downgrade from a low risk of debt distress at the time of
the 2014 DSA. The deterioration in the debt rating reflects a shift in the authorities’
financing strategy, namely to increase the use of concessional borrowing to finance
frontloaded infrastructure spending in order to reduce financing by the drawdown of the
assets of the Petroleum Fund (PF). At end-2015, net public assets (oil-related savings
accumulated in the PF and currently negligible debt stock) stood at over $16 billion. The
DSA suggests that current fiscal spending plans are unsustainable as the PF will be
depleted in the long term given the current rate of withdrawals under existing expenditure
plans. Achieving fiscal sustainability requires scaling back large front-loaded public
investment plans in line with implementation capacity, rationalizing recurrent spending,
and strengthening non-oil revenues. Bold fiscal consolidation measures are needed to
safeguard long-term fiscal and debt sustainability. High fiscal spending and inadequate
mobilization of domestic revenues are the main sources of risk. Feasibility studies to
ensure that public investment is efficient and yields adequate returns would help to
ensure fiscal sustainability.

1

This DSA has been prepared by the IMF staff with input from World Bank Group staff, using the debt sustainability
framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions.

2

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework. See
“Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy implications”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm) and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries:
Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, Policy Implications”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm).

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.
This DSA is based on the macroeconomic framework outlined in the IMF’s staff report
for the 2016 Article IV consultation. Staff projections are for total nominal GDP to contract
through 2016, as oil production declines. Staff projects real non-oil GDP growth to be in the range
of 5–6½ percent in the medium term. This growth is expected to be more private-sector led than in
the past in Timor-Leste, and is lower than previously projected, reflecting a weaker global outlook.
Inflationary pressure is expected to remain low in the medium term due to lower global commodity
prices and continued strength of the U.S. dollar against Timor-Leste’s trading partners’ currencies.
However, compared to the 2014 DSA, the external current account balance is expected to
deteriorate due to a greater decline in oil and gas prices and diminishing oil exports.
Macroeconomic assumptions for this DSA are outlined in Box 1. To illustrate the impact of different
policy options on debt sustainability, three scenarios were considered in this DSA which are outlined
below.
2.
The 2016 Budget scenario assumes full implementation of frontloaded capital
spending in 2017–20. Total capital spending during this period will reach US$3.4 billion consisting
of proposed front-loaded infrastructure investments in roads, bridges, ports, and airport deemed
essential to lay the foundation for private sector-led development for achieving the Strategic
Development Plan 2011-30. On average, 70 percent of the larger financing gap in 2017–20 will be
met by withdrawals from the Petroleum Fund (PF), the bulk of which will consist of withdrawals
above the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI), complemented by concessional borrowing (see text
table).
3.
The baseline fiscal scenario reflects a reduction in capital spending to reflect
implementation capacity. Given capacity constraints and past low implementation rates of large
capital projects, the frontloading of capital spending under the baseline scenario is assumed to be
two-third of the amount for 2017-20 outlined in the 2016 Budget. The investment plans underlying
this scenario (and the adjustment scenario) are proposed mid-sized key infrastructure projects such
as roads and bridges, a subset of the infrastructure plans. The baseline scenario also assumes a cap
on total withdrawal of the PF of US$1.3 billion, broadly in line with the notional budget envelope
proposed during the Yellow Road Workshop discussions of domestic stakeholders that will ensure
fiscal sustainability. Despite lower capital spending, the expected borrowing during 2017–20 is
comparable to that under the 2016 Budget scenario given lower excess PF withdrawal.
4.
Under staff’s proposed adjustment scenario, bold policy actions are adopted to ensure
long-term fiscal sustainability. Under this scenario, the increase in capital spending projected by
the 2016 Budget over 2017–20 is reduced by one-half. Total spending is kept at under $1.4 billion
(excluding donor projects) during 2022–26 and as a constant share of GDP after 2027. This scenario
also assumes domestic revenue mobilization measures including the introduction of a value-added
tax (VAT) in the medium term to achieve the government’s tax revenue goal of 15 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2020. Over the long term, the need for concessional borrowing is lower compared to the

baseline and budget scenarios on account of stronger revenue mobilization. Reliance on excess PF
withdrawals is lower, and ceases beyond 2025. Figure 1 and the text table show the profile of the PF
balance and fiscal funding gaps under the three scenarios.
Box 1. Timor-Leste: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA


Real GDP growth is projected to fall in the medium term on account of declining oil
production. Oil production is estimated to run out by 2023. Non-oil GDP growth is
projected to be in the range of 5–6½ percent over the medium term in part supported by
expected foreign direct investment inflows and to stabilize at around 5.5 percent for 2021–
35. Growth assumptions are lower relative to the 2014 DSA reflecting a weaker global
outlook.



Inflation is expected to increase steadily over the medium term to about 4 percent on
account of some spillovers from public investment activity and is maintained at that level in
the long run.



The current account balance is expected to remain in surplus up to 2016, after which it
moves into deficit, reflecting lower oil and gas receipts and higher imports generated by
infrastructure projects. These current account balance assumptions are substantially weaker
relative to the 2014 DSA on account of lower global oil prices.



The grant element of loans is assumed to decline over the medium term reflecting the
financing needs of frontloaded infrastructure projects and to stabilize at about 40 percent in
the long run after the infrastructure spending peak is over. The average interest rate on
concessional loans for 2021–35 is projected at 1.8 percent.



External borrowing. Given the front-loading of capital expenditure projects in 2017-21
under the baseline scenario, borrowing is projected to decline rapidly from $171 million per
annum in the medium term to $37 million per annum in the long term.

2/ Timor-Leste 2016 State Budget Book 1 (Approved)

5.

The DSA is based on the following:



Timor-Leste has a weak Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) performance rating,
corresponding to the lowest set of indicative debt thresholds.



The DSA framework uses a 5 percent discount rate.



Concessional debt is defined as debt that exceeds a minimum grant element of 35 percent.
Semi-concessional debt has a positive grant element that does not meet the minimum grant
element.



The DSA adopts a broad concept of exports which includes exports of goods and services, as
well as primary oil-related incomes.



Total public sector revenue is defined as non-oil domestic revenue plus the estimated
sustainable income (ESI) from the PF. The funding gap is met by PF withdrawals in excess of the
ESI and external borrowing.



All debt is undertaken by the central government. No off-balance sheet debt is accumulated,
including by state-owned enterprises such as the national oil company, the Timor GAP.



Debt financing contracted by the central government relating to the funding of infrastructure
projects should be on a concessional basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Since the public sector only borrows externally with no domestic liabilities issued and the
Timorese private sector does not incur any medium- or long-term external liabilities, the public
DSA and external DSA are combined.

BACKGROUND
6.
The government currently holds a strong net asset position due to the accumulation of
substantial assets in the PF and limited public debt. However, a combination of higher PF
withdrawals in excess of the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI), lower oil revenues, and negative
investment returns saw the PF balance decline in 2015, for the first time since its creation. At end2015, the PF balance stood at US$16.2 billion or 169 months of imports of goods and services.
7.
The government has adopted a prudent
policy of utilizing the most concessional loans
available to them. External loans signed as of end2015 stood at $240 million (9 percent of GDP),
consisting of concessional loans from the Asian
Development Bank, the World Bank Group, and Japan
International Cooperation Agency, and a recently
signed semi-concessional loan of $50 million from
China EXIM Bank to upgrade Dili’s drainage system.

ASSESSMENT
8.
Timor-Leste’s risk of debt distress has deteriorated from low to moderate since the
2014 DSA. Although the fiscal projections under the baseline scenario do not lead to breaches of
thresholds, stress tests—corresponding to export shock scenarios—resulted in breaches for all but
one indicator (Figure 2). The deterioration in the debt rating is mainly driven by the projected frontloading of infrastructure spending, and the associated increase in public external borrowing via
concessional loans. Nevertheless, under the baseline scenario, which does not assume substantial
fiscal consolidation or domestic revenue mobilization based on new policy, the government will also
continue to draw down on the PF in excess of the ESI, further eroding PF wealth.
9.
Net debt remains negative throughout the forecast period under the baseline scenario,
but is projected to deteriorate progressively reflecting the reduction in PF assets and increase
in external debt. Increased excess PF withdrawals to meet higher financing needs are expected to
heighten the loss in investment income in the medium term, accelerating the depletion of PF wealth
(Figure 1).
10.
Assessment of the adjustment scenario demonstrates that fiscal consolidation coupled
with fiscal reforms could ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Under this scenario, debt ratios
are projected to remain well below indicative thresholds. The lower financing needs associated with
a more moderate pace of infrastructure spending would imply lower external borrowing and less

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

reliance on excess PF withdrawals. With fiscal reforms—including the introduction of a value-added
tax aimed at boosting domestic revenues to 15 percent of non-oil GDP—excess PF withdrawals
could be gradually reduced to zero in the long term. This would allow PF assets to grow, ensuring
the PF’s long-term sustainability. In addition, adopting policies to boost growth potential (through
infrastructure and human capital investment) and enhance competitiveness (in wages and business
conditions), would help to reduce the risks of weaker growth and help enhance fiscal and debt
sustainability.
11.
A strong debt management and asset-liability framework is needed to complement a
prudent fiscal policy focused on long-term sustainability. The increased use of concessional
financing and increased avenues for the government’s exposure to contingent liabilities—for
instance, through higher use of public-private partnerships (PPPs)— are expected to increase the
complexity of the consolidated government balance sheet. Key considerations include:


New debt liabilities. Non-concessional debt should be avoided.



Public-private partnerships. Need to be undertaken with realistic and transparent project
assessments to reduce contingent liabilities.



Off-budget activities. Major capital-intensive projects tend to have complex financing
structures and the cost-benefit of public participation in these projects can be difficult to assess.
All such projects should be transparent and subject to full scrutiny.



Off-balance sheet activities should be avoided. This is particularly relevant for state-owned
companies such as the oil company, Timor GAP, which should avoid undertaking equity
positions in joint venture projects or issue liabilities in overseas markets.



Fiscal autonomy. The extension of a high level of fiscal autonomy to the ZEESM and the
Oecusse SAR raises risks of off-budget expenditures and the accumulation of contingent
liabilities.



Petroleum Fund. The strategic asset allocation away from purely high quality bonds toward
equities with a 50:50 split (60:40 bond-to-equities as at end-2015) may be appropriate from a
long-term intergenerational perspective, but the risk-return trade-offs in inherently volatile
global financial markets need to be carefully considered. The provision to allow the PF to
guarantee government debts (up to 10 percent of the PF’s assets) continues to be potentially
risky and should be avoided.

AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
12.
The authorities consider the risk of debt distress to be contained despite higher
borrowing. Although projected external borrowing to finance government’s infrastructure spending
over the next few years is considerable, the authorities view the projections under the baseline
scenario as close to the upper limit of their expected financing needs. Their view is that actual

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

borrowing will be determined by the pace of project implementation, which may be slower than
projected in the baseline scenario of the DSA. The authorities also pointed out that the accumulated
savings in the PF provide an ample buffer against debt distress. Moreover, the authorities
highlighted the importance of infrastructure development as part of the Strategic Development Plan
to transition Timor-Leste to upper middle income status by 2030. The resulting increase in growth
potential is expected to contribute towards ensuring debt sustainability.
13.
The authorities remain committed to long-term fiscal sustainability. Fiscal reform plans
in the pipeline—which include the introduction of the value-added tax—will boost domestic
revenue and help to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability. The authorities have also expressed
interest in Fund TA to strengthen their capacity in debt management.

CONCLUSION
14.
Timor-Leste’s debt is at moderate risk of debt distress driven by higher external
borrowing. The plan to increase the utilization of external concessional financing reflects the
government’s frontloaded infrastructure spending and strategy to preserve the wealth of the PF. The
PF is a source of confidence for the economy and should be preserved as an endowment fund. The
PF assets should be preserved in real terms and generate a permanent level of investment income to
support government expenditures. While some drawdown of the assets of the PF is justified for
infrastructure investment in order to diversify the economy and boost growth potential, the assets
also need to be preserved at a level that is sufficient to provide adequate investment income for
future generations. Meeting the financing gap through external loans is warranted, especially if the
borrowing cost is lower than the opportunity cost of tapping into the PF as measured by the PF’s
expected investment return, and guided by the DSA. The discipline of debt sustainability monitoring
by creditors may also come with other benefits such as the transfer of knowledge by these
multilateral or bilateral institutions.
15.
Bold fiscal consolidation measures are needed to safeguard long-term fiscal and debt
sustainability. Achieving fiscal sustainability requires scaling back large front-loaded public
investment plans in line with implementation capacity, rationalizing recurrent spending,
strengthening non-oil revenues, and adhering to a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan. In
addition, better prioritization of public investment plans, focusing on high-return infrastructure
projects through rigorous investment appraisal is important. Optimizing the composition and quality
of spending to help close Timor-Leste’s infrastructure gap is key to long-term fiscal and debt
sustainability

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels.)
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Otaviano Canuto, Executive Director for Timor-Leste, Pedro
Fachada, Alternate Executive Director, and Alisson Souza Gasparete, Advisor to
Executive Director
May 11, 2016
1.
On behalf of our Timorese authorities, we thank the mission team for the
constructive dialogue and policy advice during this year’s Article IV consultation. The
authorities highly appreciate the candid discussions with staff and all the support received
from the Fund.
2.
Since independence in 2002, Timor-Leste has achieved enormous progress in
nation-building and social development. Our authorities strongly agree with staff that the
country’s medium-term outlook will depend critically on economic diversification amid
potentially declining hydrocarbon resources. In this regard, they are committed to
improving infrastructure and human capital, providing better education and health
services to the population, and developing private sector entrepreneurship. Such
commitments are underpinned by political stability, credible institutions, and good
governance in the management of public resources.
3.
Our authorities broadly concur with the policy recommendations put forth in the
staff report. However, to fulfill their development objectives and the legitimate
aspirations of the Timorese people, they stress the need to accelerate capital spending.
This may require drawing down on resources from the Petroleum Fund above the pace
advised by staff.
Recent economic developments
4.
The recent fall in global oil prices has weakened overall macroeconomic
prospects of oil exporters. Timor-Leste, however, has been cushioned by the prudent
saving of its oil wealth in the Petroleum Fund. The new oil price environment has not
only reduced petroleum revenues but has also affected investment in new fields. Proven
oil and gas reserves are low and may be exhausted in a few years, although upside risks
should not be disregarded. The authorities are conscious of the international oil market
scenario and fully aware about the need to diversify the economy away from
hydrocarbons.
5.
After expanding on average above 10 percent annually from 2007 to 2012, nonoil GDP growth decelerated to an estimated 4.3 percent in 2015 and is projected to be
close to 5 percent this year. Over the medium-term, both staff and the authorities expect
non-oil GDP to grow in the range of 5 to 7 percent.

6.
The deceleration in non-oil economic activity has been followed by a sharp
decline in inflation, which came down from two-digit figures in mid-2013 to close to zero
in recent quarters. A strong monetary anchor (the dollarization regime), combined with
lower commodity prices and dollar appreciation vis-à-vis other trading partner currencies,
has driven the disinflationary process.
7.
Despite lower than previous years, the current account surplus is estimated at 16.5
percent of GDP in 2015. The Timorese government expects a negative external balance
over the medium-term due to, among other factors, lower petroleum revenues and
increased imports of capital goods. Public foreign assets, however, will continue to
represent a strong external buffer.
Fiscal policy and debt sustainability
8.
Despite the sharp fall in petroleum revenues, the fiscal balance remained positive
in 2015 (4.2 percent of GDP). Current expenditure was 11 percent lower than projected in
the rectification budget presented to parliament in April last year. Capital spending was
almost 30 percent below the budget.
9.
Throughout the years, the Timorese authorities have shown a strong track-record
of responsible use of the oil wealth. Going forward, they remain committed to a prudent
fiscal stance that seeks to preserve the resources of the Petroleum Fund and ensure public
debt sustainability. There is agreement with staff on the need to mobilize domestic nonoil revenues. The Fiscal Reform Commission, a technical body under the Ministry of
Finance, is in charge of broadening the tax base and increasing the efficiency of tax
collection. A value-added tax (VAT) is expected to be introduced once ongoing
consultations with the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders are concluded.
10.
On the expenditure side, the authorities note some room to revise down the 2016
envelope to around $1.4 billion. However, they consider that Timor-Leste cannot afford
to strictly adhere to the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI) of the Petroleum Fund.
Although they recognize that the ESI is an indispensable tool for fiscal planning, it
should not hold back much-needed investment in infrastructure projects. At the same
time, the government believes that tapping concessional borrowing to finance capital
spending may be appropriate, helping preserve the resources of the Petroleum Fund.
Borrowing would only be justified if the costs are lower than the expected investment
return of the Fund.
11.
Staff has revised Timor-Leste’s debt sustainability analysis and underlines a risk
of moderate external debt distress. This seems somewhat exaggerated in light of the low
level of gross external debt under the alternative scenarios developed by staff, as well as
the very comfortable public foreign assets position of the country (equivalent to more
than fourteen years of imports of goods and services, or nearly 640 percent of 2015

GDP). We also consider the recommendation by staff that “bold (emphasis added) fiscal
consolidation measures are needed to safeguard long-term fiscal and debt sustainability”
to be overstated.
Monetary policy and financial sector
12.
Timor-Leste is a dollarized economy. The government considers that the
monetary regime has served the country well, anchoring inflation and neutralizing
overvaluation pressures in times of very high current account surpluses. Since 2014,
inflation has been close to zero and is forecasted to remain low in the medium to long
term. As noted by staff, the Central Bank of Timor-Leste (BCTL) has received a
mandate, under the 2011-2030 Strategic Development Plan, to assess the merits of
adopting its own currency. The authorities concur with staff that any decision on “dedollarization” should be preceded by further financial and institutional development and
by strengthening the BCTL’s operational capacity.
13.
The BCTL has been making efforts to strengthen its capacity in banking
regulation and supervision. The banking system, with only four institutions, is well
capitalized and highly liquid. Three of these institutions are branches of foreign banks.
The fourth bank is a stated-owned institution that plays an important role in providing
banking services to the poor and small businesses, including in rural areas. Contrary to
other small island states in the Asia-Pacific region, de-risking by global banks has not
affected Timor-Leste so far, possibly because the bulk of the banking system is foreignowned and the limited importance of remittance inflows to the country.
14.
Timor-Leste has made significant advances in financial inclusion and all banks
are adapting their services to branchless and mobile platforms. The authorities are also
engaging in fostering financial literacy. A new payments system legislation has been
introduced, aiming at reducing the costs of doing business and the reliance on cash
transactions, and promoting economic growth outside the urban areas.
Structural reforms
15.
The Timorese authorities remain committed to advance their structural reforms
agenda, well aware that it might take some years to bear fruits. Efforts are being made to
attract foreign investment and to foster private-sector job creation. The authorities believe
that the discussions with staff have helped them strike the right balance between carrying
out infrastructure projects and preserving the Petroleum Fund. This trade-off is critical
given that potential investors have repeatedly emphasized that improving basic
infrastructure is paramount to attract foreign investment.
16.
Public investment in infrastructure continues to be the priority. In particular,
improving basic transport infrastructure, including roads, the Dili airport and the new port
at Tibar Bay (to be financed, built and operated under a Public Private Partnership) is

fundamental to promote economic integration across the territory and strengthen links
with the rest of the world. The government is also committed to integrate and develop the
Oecusse district (a remote enclave of Timor-Leste on the north coast of Indonesian West
Timor) through the creation of a Special Zone for Social Market Economy, among other
initiatives.
17.
Given the role of the petroleum sector to the Timorese economy, the authorities
have envisaged the Tasi Mane project as a driver of progress along the south coast of the
country, facilitating not only the development of the hydrocarbons industry but also
manufacturing and tourism. Nationwide, developing the tourism sector in a sustainable
way is another priority under the Strategic Development Plan. The sector is traditionally
labor-intensive, which may contribute to increase formal employment and boost
government revenues. In addition to building infrastructure, efforts are being carried out
to promote the country in tourist centers in the Asia-Pacific.
18.
As documented by staff (Appendix IV), Timor-Leste has made substantial
progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This is particularly
true for the goal to “Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women”, which has been
fully achieved. The country has also made substantial progress in reducing child
mortality and malnutrition, combating malaria and tuberculosis, increasing primary
school enrolment and enhancing access of the population to clean water sources.
Conclusion
19.
Our authorities’ strong commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth and to
careful management of the petroleum wealth is leading Timor-Leste to gradually improve
living standards, develop human capital and overcome lack of basic infrastructure. The
authorities agree with staff that there is still a large need for technical assistance and
training to support their bold reform and development agenda. Once again, they reiterate
their appreciation to the Fund and other development partners for their relentless role in
nation-building and capacity development.
