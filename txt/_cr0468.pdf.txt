EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Since the last Article IV consultation, the Sri Lankan economy has advanced on
several fronts: the ceasefire has held; the economic recovery has taken firmer roots;
external vulnerability has declined; and reforms in several areas have progressed. However,
the effects of the two-decade long civil conflict are yet to be overcome and many
challenges remain. Against this background, the 2003 Article IV consultation discussions
focused on how to turn the ongoing recovery into a sustained high growth, raise
employment, and alleviate poverty.

•

The economic recovery that began in 2002 is becoming broad based. In 2003, exports
and, during the second half of the year, private investment joined private consumption and
tourism as drivers of growth. GDP growth is estimated to have reached 5½ percent in 2003,
and is projected at 6 percent in 2004. Disinflation has been faster than expected, though the
ongoing drought may exert some price pressure in the near term.

•

The external position has continued to strengthen. Strong exports, remittances, and
tourism receipts helped gross reserves rise by $0.5 billion through December 2003 to over
$2 billion (about 2¾ months of imports and 100 percent of short-term debt).

•

Fiscal consolidation has continued, but slower than envisaged. In 2002, the fiscal deficit
declined by about 2 percentage points of GDP, to 9 percent of GDP. Last year, the fiscal
deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 8 percent of GDP (½ percentage point above the
budget target), reflecting severe revenue shortfalls. The 2004 budget aims at a deficit of
6¾ percent of GDP, but staff estimates that the deficit could reach 7¼ percent of GDP, due
to a slower turnaround in revenue and added drought-related expenses. Monetary policy has
steered a careful course, balancing support to the recovery and restraint on inflation.

•

While progress has been made in some areas of structural reform, other key reforms
have been delayed. The privatization program has advanced with the divestment of several
major public corporations. The restructuring of People’s Bank, however, has been delayed.
Also, parliamentary presentation of legislation to create a Revenue Authority, a key step in
the government’s strategy to strengthen revenue collection, has been postponed until after
the April elections.

•

Over the last few months, the political situation has become increasingly unsettled,
constraining the government’s ability to implement critical reforms. In November, the
President dismissed the ministers of defense, interior, and media, citing their mishandling
of the peace process. Without control over these ministries, the Prime Minister has
expressed difficulties in leading peace negotiations with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) and the peace talks have remain stalled. Taking advantage over the political
impasse interest groups have intensified resistance to the government’s reform agenda. In
early February, the President dissolved Parliament calling for general elections on April 2.
Under these political conditions, the government has found it difficult to push ahead with
critical reforms, particularly in tax administration, as anticipated under the PRGF and
Extended Arrangements. Accordingly, the first reviews of the PRGF and Extended
Arrangements have been temporarily postponed.

-4-

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Since the last Article IV consultation, the Sri Lankan economy has advanced on several
fronts: the peace process has moved ahead albeit with interruptions; the economic recovery
has taken firmer roots; external vulnerability has declined; and reforms in several areas have
progressed. However, the economic effects of the two-decade long civil conflict are yet to be
overcome, and many challenges remain. In recent months, heightened political uncertainty
has constrained the government’s ability to push ahead with reforms.
1.
A ceasefire between the government and the LTTE has held since February 2002.
After an initial flurry of peace talks—facilitated by Norway—the LTTE broke off
negotiations in late April 2003 alleging insufficient progress on the withdrawal of government
troops from agreed areas and the lack of spending for development and social needs in the
North and East (the conflict-affected areas). In October 2003, the LTTE presented its plans
for an interim administration. The resumption of peace talks now awaits a response from the
government to these proposals.
2.
During the past two years, the government initiated wide-ranging reforms to
reinvigorate an economy ravaged by 20 years of civil conflict. These reforms, together
with the government’s medium-term economic strategy outlined in its poverty reduction
strategy paper (Regaining Sri Lanka), the rehabilitation and reconstruction plans identified in
the Needs Assessment for the North and East, and the peace process, have received strong
support from donors. Including the pledges made in the Tokyo conference last June, donors
have committed $4½ billion in aid over the medium term (25 percent of 2003 GDP), with
Japan ($1 billion) and multilaterals—AsDB ($1 billion), the World Bank ($1 billion), and the
IMF ($560 million)—providing the bulk of the funds. Much remains to be done to reverse the
economic toll of the conflict, which, in addition to huge loss of human life, disrupted interregional commerce, deepened poverty, deteriorated infrastructure, and weakened public
finances.
3.
Over the past few years, the Fund has been closely engaged in Sri Lanka under
the Stand-By, PRGF, and Extended Arrangements, and through the Article IV
consultations. Fund advice on several macroeconomic and structural reforms—floating the
exchange rate, introducing a VAT system, amending banking laws, and restructuring financial
markets—played a key role in policy development, although the exact shape of these reforms
was determined by the authorities to reflect their social and political concerns (Annex I). In
concluding the last Article IV consultation held in September 2002, Directors highlighted the
need for continued fiscal consolidation, restructuring public enterprises, reforming the
financial sector, improving labor market flexibility, and better targeting social safety
programs. These were also the priorities in Regaining Sri Lanka, and formed the core of the
program under the PRGF and Extended Arrangements, approved in April 2003. Some
progress has been achieved on these fronts, but the agenda remains unfinished. At the time
when the IMF arrangements were approved, the staff took stock of past reforms and assessed
the impact of the civil conflict (IMF Country Report No. 03/107).

-5-

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
In recent months, the already uneasy relationship between the President and the
Prime Minister’s government has become more strained. On November 4, President
Kumaratunga suspended Parliament for two weeks and took control of the ministries of
defense, interior, and media, citing the government’s poor handling of the peace process. This
created a political impasse as the Prime Minister’s government expressed difficulties in
leading the peace talks without control over these ministries. In January, ahead of the
provincial elections then scheduled for late April, the President’s party (SLFP) and the
Marxist party (JVP) formed an electoral alliance. Taking advantage of the unsettled political
situation, interest groups stepped up resistance to the government’s reform agenda. In early
February, the President dissolved Parliament, calling for general elections on April 2. (The
provincial council elections have been postponed.) These developments have markedly
slowed the pace of reform implementation.
5.
Meanwhile, the economic recovery is becoming broad based. In 2002, private
consumption and tourism were the main engines of growth. In 2003, exports were an added
force, and private investment picked in the second half of the year. GDP growth for 2003 is
estimated to have risen to 5½ percent from 4 percent in 2002, as projected under the program
supported by the PRGF and Extended Arrangements. Last year, disinflation was faster than
projected, with average inflation (Colombo CPI) declining to 6⅓ percent from 9½ percent
in 2002, due to good harvests and the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar. The
appreciation was reversed in the last two months of the year reflecting the heightened political
instability (Table 1 and Figure 1).
6.
The external position has continued to strengthen. Improved exports and strong
inflows of remittances and tourism receipts kept the current account deficit lower than
expected, at an estimated 1 percent of GDP. Gross reserves rose by $500 million to $2 billion
through end–December, covering 2¾ months of imports and 105 percent of short-term debt.
News reports indicate that some foreign private investment may have been delayed due to the
recent political uncertainty, although other projects have moved ahead.
7.
The financial sector performed well in 2003, but has reacted nervously to recent
political developments. Until November last year, the equity market had made significant
gains, among the largest in Asian bourses, reflecting rising corporate profits. Since then, the
market has weakened and become more volatile as political uncertainties increased. During
2003, bank profitability increased significantly (including in the state-owned banks), though
nonperforming loans (NPLs) have remained high.
8.
The monetary program has remained on track. Despite the political uncertainty,
interest rates remain low, following their marked decline in 2003. The Central Bank of Sri
Lanka (CBSL) cut repo rates by 275 basis points over the year, but there is still substantial
liquidity in the banking sector. Broad money grew in line with expectations, with private
sector credit picking up late in the year (Figure 2).

-6-

9.
However, the budget remained under pressure in 2003 and fiscal consolidation
was slower than envisaged. In 2002, the deficit was lowered by roughly 2 percentage points
of GDP, to 9 percent of GDP. Last year, the deficit is estimated to have reached around
8 percent of GDP (about ½ percentage point above the budget target), reflecting revenue
shortfalls of around 1¾ percent of GDP, higher post-conflict capital spending, and some
additional restructuring costs. In its first mid-term budget review (mandated by the 2002
Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act—FMRA), the government had acknowledged that
fiscal performance was lagging, and initiated several administrative and tax policy measures
to bring the deficit back on track. Unfortunately, some of the key tax measures could not be
adopted due to the suspension of the Parliament in November. To limit the deficit, the
government resorted to cutting nonpriority capital spending, while protecting PRSP-related
projects. Lower-than-expected interest and pension payments also helped to contain
expenditure.
10.
Since the last Article IV consultation, significant headway has been made on the
structural reform agenda, particularly on the legislative front:
•

On public enterprise reform, the Electricity Reform bill was enacted in
December 2002 to begin the unbundling of the state electricity company (CEB). The
petroleum sector was opened to private participation with the entry of Indian Oil in the
retail market. The government sold a 12 percent stake in Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) in
November 2002, and the telecommunications market has been liberalized. In 2003, the
state-owned insurance company (SLIC) was privatized in April, and the sale of a
40 percent stake in the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment’s retail network was
concluded in November.

•

Amendments to the labor laws streamlining the settlement of labor disputes,
eliminating restrictions on overtime work by women, and increasing penalties for
child labor were implemented in January 2004. Their implementation was delayed by
9 months to allow time to establish additional labor courts and tribunals, a mandatory
compensation formula for laid-off workers, and an unemployment insurance scheme.

•

To strengthen public finances, the FMRA was enacted in December 2002. The FMRA
limits borrowing from the CBSL, sets medium-term fiscal deficit targets, and
mandates “pre-election budget reports” (before parliamentary elections) to discourage
election handouts. The Board of Investment’s (BOI) power to grant tax holidays and
incentives outside the regular tax code was repealed by Parliament in December 2002
(although the repeal still needs to be enacted). To improve tax administration, a draft
Revenue Authority bill—aimed at unifying the Inland Revenue, Customs, and Excise
departments—and its implementation plan has been presented to Cabinet.1

1

Presentation of this bill to Parliament, a structural performance criterion under the program
for June 2003, has been further delayed due to the political situation.

-7-

•

In the financial sector, amendments to the Banking Act to enhance the CBSL’s
supervisory powers and facilitate the entry, exit, and merger of banks, and a Foreign
Exchange Management bill (FEM) that relaxes some longer-term capital account
restrictions, have been tabled in Parliament. The CBSL has introduced a scripless
securities system and a real-time gross settlement system. An Asset Management
Company (AMC) bill to aid banks in restructuring their balance sheets has been
approved by Cabinet.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS

11.
The authorities expect growth of around 6 percent in 2004. Increased investment,
higher tourism and exports, along with domestic private consumption are likely to be the main
drivers of growth. While confident that the growth target could be met, they concurred with
the staff that this would require an early resolution of the political impasse. After the rapid
decline in 2003, inflation should stabilize at around 6 percent. Imports are expected to rise as
investment strengthens, but healthy

Lasting peace and a
deepening of reforms are vital to
unlock Sri Lanka’s medium-term
growth potential. Growth over the medium term is projected to average 6½ percent,
predicated on macroeconomic stability. This will be underpinned by continued fiscal
consolidation; a rebound in public and private investment, particularly in infrastructure, agroindustries, tourism, and commercial fishing (which were adversely affected by the civil
conflict); and a deepening of structural reforms, especially in labor and financial markets,
which should contribute to higher productivity. Higher tourism receipts and remittances, as
well as sizeable donor commitments made at the Tokyo conference have improved the
balance of payments outlook since the last staff report (IMF Country Report No. 03/107).
Despite large reconstruction- and investment-related imports, official reserves should rise to
$3 billion (covering 3½ months of imports) by 2006.

Risks to these projections have increased in recent months. On the upside, a
stronger global outlook should assist in strengthening exports, tourism, and remittances. If
power and infrastructure bottlenecks are eased, tourism, shipping, and telecommunications
could expand faster than anticipated. On the downside, while occasional setbacks are to be
expected, a prolonged impasse in the peace talks could hold back private investment. Ahead
of the general elections, the reform momentum has already slowed down with several critical
legislative initiatives awaiting the reconvening of Parliament to be enacted. If the political
uncertainty is not resolved after the elections and the reform agenda is not brought back on
track, both donor-supported public and private investment will be seriously delayed. The

-8-

ongoing drought could adversely affect agricultural output and power generation. A
combination of these factors could depress growth, raise the fiscal deficit and domestic
financing, and keep reserves at a vulnerable level if donor financing is also reduced.2 Thus, in
line with the Joint Staff Assessment (IMF Country Report No. 03/106), staff encouraged the
government to develop an alternative macroeconomic scenario and discuss plans to mitigate
these risks (including from exogenous factors such as the removal of textile quotas in 2005)
when the PRSP is updated in 2004.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Against the backdrop of a challenging economic and political terrain, the
discussions focused on near- and medium-term policy responses and the reform agenda.
For the near term, the discussions concentrated on the appropriate response to the revenue
shortfall and the conduct of monetary policy in light of the political uncertainties. For the
medium term, the discussions centered around the likely drivers of growth, the structural
reforms needed to foster them, and policy challenges posed by the expected large aid inflows
(Box 1).
A. Fiscal Policy
15.
The authorities agreed with staff that notwithstanding its immediate causes, the
revenue shortfall was symptomatic of chronic weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s tax system.
Among the chief causes of the revenue shortfall last year were poor compliance under the
dual-band VAT system and a

A detailed discussion of the sources of growth and the associated risks, together with an
alternative scenario of lower growth, was presented in Box 3 of the last staff report
(EBS/03/40). While recent developments highlight domestic political risks, the alternative
scenario presented there remains valid.

-9-

Box 1. Sri Lanka: The Challenges of Large Aid Inflows
Over the medium term, Sri Lanka expects to receive significant foreign aid, which
could present an added challenge to macroeconomic policy management.
•

Monetary policy. To the extent that foreign aid is not used for imports, and is
converted into domestic currency, the money supply will increase, exerting
inflationary pressure and forcing the central bank to sterilize the inflows. Such
sterilization operations will need to be coordinated with fiscal policy, especially
regarding the timing of the aid flows, and their likely impact on the monetary base.

•

Fiscal policy. The volatile nature of aid flows, whose timing can be difficult to
predict, can complicate the planning of government expenditure. Thus, spending
plans should be based on realistic projections of the aid that is likely to materialize.
In addition, given Sri Lanka’s high public debt, spending plans will need to remain
flexible, so that shortfalls in aid flows do not necessitate higher public borrowing.

Although the significant inflow of foreign aid could raise concerns of a “Dutch disease”
impact on the Sri Lankan economy, the risks of such an impact are relatively small.
•

The volume of aid flows should be manageable from a domestic liquidity
standpoint. During 2004-2006, net external financing and grants are expected to
average about 3 percent of GDP a year, which is modest compared to receipts by
other developing countries and only about 1½ percent of GDP above recent
experience in Sri Lanka. Moreover, constraints on project implementation capacity
could lengthen the aid disbursement period. In addition, significant external leakage
of the aid flows (e.g., on imports needed for investment projects) and sterilization of
the inflows by the monetary authorities should minimize their impact on relative
prices and the real exchange rate.

•

Most aid will be used to finance projects that should boost productivity across
all sectors of the economy, including the export sector. The PRSP includes
projects in agriculture, roads, ports, and energy. However, aid expenditure on
housing projects and civil service reform could result in some price pressure on the
nontradables sector. Similarly, although the majority of aid flows to the North and
East is destined for infrastructure projects, a significant portion is humanitarian aid
(to support basic consumption needs), which could therefore also have a Dutch
disease effect.

- 10 -

leakages. The continued revenue shortfalls also reflect deep-rooted problems in tax
administration, particularly its weak management and poor governance. These problems have
prevented the tax agencies from making a successful transition from a tax regime based on
high import tariffs and turnover levies to the broad-based income tax and VAT regime
introduced in recent years.
16.
In response to the revenue shortfall, the authorities initiated a number of policy
and administrative measures in 2003. Administrative measures undertaken included
restarting the audit program after the tax amnesty ended in August and increasing the number
of officers in the large taxpayer unit (LTU). Tax policy measures included extending the VAT
to nonbank financial services; raising excise taxes and import duties on select items; and
increasing the corporate tax rate on foreign banking units to that on domestic banking
operations. However, several of the policy measures came into operation only in 2004
(although they have been effective since the second half of 2003), as the suspension of
Parliament in November prevented these measures from being enacted.
17.
The 2004 budget takes further steps to strengthen the tax regime (Box 2). Among
the main measures are: unifying the two-band VAT regime (10 and 20 percent) at 15 percent
and, beginning in July 2004, extending it to the wholesale and retail sectors;3 introducing a
minimum corporate tax to expand this tax base; curtailing tax incentives; and raising railway
and postal charges. In addition, the import surcharge was halved to 10 percent and the number
of custom duty bands reduced to 5 from 6, but a simultaneous adjustment of rates and a
reduction of exemptions has kept these changes revenue neutral.4 The authorities estimate that
the potential additional revenue from these and the delayed measures undertaken after last
year’s mid-term budget review could amount to 1½ percent of GDP. However, they have
counted on only 1 percent of GDP of the increased revenue towards this year’s budget, in
light of weak tax administration and possible disruptions in collection in the initial stages of
establishing the Revenue Authority.
18.
Based on these revenue measures, the 2004 budget targets a deficit of 6¾ percent
of GDP. Total revenue is estimated to rise by 1 percent of GDP to 16.4 percent of GDP, while
overall spending is budgeted to fall by 0.4 percent of GDP, reflecting lower interest payments
and current transfers. Priority spending, however, will rise: post-conflict spending is budgeted
at close to 1 percent of GDP and capital spending is projected to increase by ½ percent of
GDP, balancing reconstruction expenditure across the country.

3

The extension was originally planned for January 2004, but additional time is needed to
design a revenue sharing arrangement with provincial councils (who currently collect turnover
tax) and expand the capacity of the tax authorities to handle the increase in tax files.
4

Staff noted that to enhance external openness, the import surcharge should be eliminated
in 2005 as planned, without offsetting changes in the tariff structure.

- 11 Box 2. Sri Lanka: 2004 Budget
The 2004 draft budget continues the process of fiscal consolidation and debt reduction started in 2002.
It targets a deficit of 6.8 percent of GDP, 1.3 percentage point lower than the estimated 2003 outcome, and
4 percentage points lower than the 10.8 percent of GDP deficit in 2001. Public debt is expected to decline by
over 5 percentage points, reaching 95 percent of GDP at end-2004. However, staff estimates that tax revenue
could fall short of target by 0.6 percent of GDP, given the continued weakness in collection. Additional
spending of 0.2 percent of GDP would be required to finance drought relief. To limit the impact of a higher
deficit on domestic interest rates and remain close to the debt reduction targets set in the FMRA, the overall
deficit needs to be contained to 7.2 percent of GDP through expenditures cuts of 0.4 percent of GDP.
The budget proposes several tax policy measures:
•

The VAT will be unified at a 15 percent rate, with exemptions reduced to basic food and socially critical
items. The retail and wholesale sectors will be included in July. The unification of the VAT rate is
expected to be revenue neutral in the short term, but simplifies the tax system considerably, with
potentially positive effects on collection. However, the authorities need to strengthen the audit program to
address the recent problems with refunds (in particular, VAT refunds should be audited before funds are
released). The unified rate of 15 percent balances the authorities’ concerns over raising the price of
sensitive items with increasing tax efficiency and safeguarding revenue. Staff estimates indicate that the
overall effect on the household expenditure of the poor is likely to be moderate.

•

The import surcharge will be cut from 20 percent to 10 percent, and the tariff structure will be simplified
to a 5-band system, while moving towards the goal of eliminating import surcharges in 2005, and
establishing a three-band tariff regime in 2006. These measures could yield about 0.1 percent of GDP.

•

A service charge of 1 percent on assets or turnover will be imposed on all companies over two years old,
to be offset against income tax obligations. This tax will be phased out as the corporate tax regime is
simplified to a single-rate system, and tax administration is strengthened. Companies under the BOI Act
will be included in the tax net in 2005, after existing contracts are modified. The revenue gain could be
about 0.1 percent of GDP.

•

Other corporate tax measures include: capping carry-forward losses at 35 percent of taxable income;
taxing partnership income at 10 percent; and withholding interest income on the basis of consolidated
accounts. These should yield around 0.1 percent of GDP.

•

Other revenue measures include: increasing excises and duties for certain items; raising railway and
postal fares; charging a fee on cell phone bills; and streamlining exemptions. These are expected to yield
0.2 percent of GDP.

The budget includes higher post-conflict spending, a wage increase for public employees, a targeted
early retirement program, and higher capital expenditures.
•

Post-conflict spending will rise to nearly 1 percent of GDP, from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003.

•

Wages and pensions will be increased, keeping their share with respect to GDP roughly constant
over 2003 levels.

•

Public employment is targeted to decline by 10 percent via a targeted early retirement scheme, which will
cost the budget 0.4 percent of GDP.

•

Capital expenditures will rise by about 0.5 percent of GDP relative to such spending in 2003 .

•

Another 0.2 percent of GDP will be spent on seed money for the unemployment insurance scheme
(funded from inactive accounts of the Employee’s Provident Fund), support to selected industries, and
fertilizer subsidies.

19.
The authorities recognized that attaining these targets required strong collection
efforts and full implementation of the proposed tax measures. The staff pointed out that at least
since 2000, actual revenue had fallen short of budget targets by around 1½ percent of GDP each
year, largely due to continued deterioration in tax administration. Reversing this trend required
fundamental reforms in tax administration, particularly in its leadership, staffing, organization, and
incentives structure. The authorities noted that they were planning to introduce several
organizational changes over the next few months, aided by technical assistance from the IMF.
However, the Revenue Authority was envisaged to provide the legal framework and political space
to introduce professional leadership in the tax departments that would oversee the more
fundamental reforms in resource allocation and incentives. The authorities argued that the present
political impasse precluded presenting a strong Revenue Authority bill to Parliament. Rather than
opt for a weak bill that would appease the interest groups who opposed these reforms, they
preferred to wait until the political climate was more conducive to moving ahead with a strong and
effective Revenue Authority, after the April elections.
20.
The staff noted that there were considerable risks to budget implementation. The
proposed tax policy measures hinge on improvements in collection to yield significant results, and
cannot be enacted until the Parliament is reconvened (though they are effective from January).
Measures that rely on broadening the tax base, such as the minimum corporate tax, typically take
time to yield results. With the Revenue Authority bill being postponed, and in the absence of an
alternative comprehensive strategy, it will be difficult to implement the needed fundamental reforms
in administration. The tax administrative changes that are being undertaken, such as restarting the
audit program, while necessary, will take time to be fully effective. Another risk arises from preelection spending pressures. In January, the government reduced import duties on several food
items in response to public concern about a rise in the cost of living.
21.
Thus, it is likely that tax revenue could fall short of target by ¾ percent of GDP. In
addition, the authorities expected that extra spending of ¼ percent of GDP would be required to
finance drought relief (including emergency power supply). Combined, these would increase the
budget deficit by 1 percent of GDP above the budget target. Such an outcome would put significant
pressure on domestic interest rates (especially if a delay in donor funds increases the domestic
financing requirement), damage investor confidence, and undermine the ongoing recovery. To limit
domestic financing close to last year’s level and remain on track to reach the debt reduction targets
set in the FMRA, the staff noted that the overall deficit should be contained to at most 7¼ percent of
GDP—½ percent of GDP higher than budgeted. This would require expenditure to be cut by
½ percent of GDP. The authorities took note of staff’s concerns, and argued that limiting
domestically financed capital spending to only priority projects (those that are ongoing and those
that are identified in the PRSP) could provide the spending restraint needed to achieve the deficit
target under such circumstances. To guide fiscal policy in the coming months and ensure that
remedial measures are taken early, monthly and quarterly targets for tax revenue have been set. If
revenue fell below these targets, the authorities assured the staff that contingency measures would
be triggered, which could include increases in excises and custom duties, and reductions in tax

- 13 -

exemptions.5 If these failed to generate sufficient revenue, the staff advised that nonpriority capital
expenditures would need to be cut further.
22.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal priorities are to enhance sustainability, while
providing adequate resources for post-conflict and reconstruction needs. The debt-to-GDP ratio
is expected to fall to 95 percent in 2004 from 101 percent in 2003. Although debt dynamics will
remain on a downward trend, the primary balance in 2005 and 2006 needs to be reduced by about
½ percent of GDP per year more than projected under current policies to reach the PRSP and
FMRA target of a debt-to-GDP ratio of 85 percent by 2006. Stress tests indicate that the debt
dynamics, while relatively robust to most shocks, turn unstable if policies return to those of the
late 1990s (Annex II). Tax policy reforms focus on moving toward a single rate corporate tax
regime, further simplifying the tariff structure, and rationalizing tax incentives. The authorities are
working on integrating the post-conflict spending outlined in the Needs Assessment, the funds
committed by donors in the June donor conference, and the capital projects identified in the PRSP
into a consistent medium-term budget framework (MTBF). Aided by the World Bank, sectoral
policy papers are being prepared, as part of the larger MTBF exercise, to serve as inputs in
preparing budget allocations starting with the 2005 cycle. A new Aid and Development Agency is
being planned to streamline selection and improve implementation of donor-financed projects.
However, legislation to establish the agency remains pending. A program to restructure domestic
debt, including by increasing the term structure and converting old rupee loans into marketable
bonds, is underway.6 The public debt management office is being reformed to strengthen its
technical capacity, with assistance from the U.S. Treasury.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
23.
The mission considered the monetary policy stance of balancing support to the
economic recovery with restraint on inflation appropriate. During 2003, the CBSL took
advantage of higher-than-expected foreign exchange inflows to build up official reserves, while
keeping to the programmed reserve money path through sterilization, using government and CBSL
securities. The mission agreed with the authorities that the cuts in policy rates had been cautious and
broadly in line with the pace of disinflation, with real interest rates remaining low but positive. Staff
also welcomed the regular public announcements on monetary policy that began in 2003, which
have greatly increased the transparency of the decision-making process.
24.
The authorities noted that monetary policy would need to chart a careful course in the
coming months. In particular, if political uncertainty deepened and fiscal pressures rose, the
monetary authorities would need to tighten monetary policy to contain inflation and maintain
5

The staff strongly advised that changes in custom duties should be undertaken in the context of the
authorities’ long-term goal of establishing a single-rate duty regime, rather than to meet short-term
revenue needs.

investor confidence. They stressed that exchange rate interventions would remain confined to
smoothing short-term volatility.
25.
The CBSL stressed the need to improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
Open market operations, which began in March 2003, have proceeded smoothly. To improve
liquidity management the CBSL intends to continue expanding its instrument mix to include longerterm repos, secondary market auctions, and direct sales, which should help deepen the capital
market. However, the development of the credit channel of monetary transmission has been slowed
by banking sector weaknesses, notably the high level of NPLs and poor risk management.7
C. Structural Reforms
26.
Turning the ongoing recovery into sustained high growth to reduce poverty and
unemployment is the main challenge facing the government. If lasting peace was achieved, the
business community saw significant opportunities in new outward-oriented services—tourism,
communications, transshipment, and financial activities—and agro-industries, building on Sri
Lanka’s traditional strength of external openness. For such a transformation to take place, they
noted that business costs, which remain high by regional standards, needed to be lowered through
provision of reliable and affordable electricity, better infrastructure, predictable labor market
conditions, deeper financial markets, and a better skilled labor force. The authorities also see these
as key requirements for growth, and therefore focus on reconstructing the dilapidated infrastructure;
reducing state dominance in the economy; restructuring the power sector; strengthening financial
markets; enhancing labor market flexibility; and establishing a rationalized and transparent trade

regime. Over the past 18 months, substantial progress has taken place in advancing the reform
agenda, particularly on the legislative side. However, implementation remains challenging.
27.
Reforms in public corporations have advanced, although the pace has been slow in
some cases. The government has followed a two-pronged strategy to reform public corporations:
divesting or closing down some of the enterprises, while restructuring the remainder to improve
their efficiency. The state petroleum company (CPC) has improved its financial position, and
negotiations to allow a third party in the retail sector are scheduled for completion in early 2004.
The restructuring of the electricity board (CEB), aided by Japan and the AsDB, has been delayed,
with its unbundling, which would create a wholesale electricity market, now slated for completion
in 2004. A lasting solution to CEB’s problems—stemming the continued losses while lowering
tariff charges—lies in securing a low cost source of energy. The authorities plan to commission
three large generation plants over the next 10 years, but their locations are yet to be determined.
Staff stressed the need for an early decision on this matter to avoid power shortages, which
beleaguered the economy two years ago. The government also intends to divest a further stake in
SLT during 2004, for which there is considerable market interest, and continue to sell its shares in
various hotels.
28.
The authorities are modernizing the regulatory framework, which should support
private sector growth. Under the multisector regulatory bill enacted last year, three regulatory
bodies covering utilities, transport, and communications have been set up, and another is planned
for nonbank financial services. Because a lack of skilled personnel has been a major hurdle to
staffing these regulatory bodies, the authorities are expanding training institutes in public-private
partnerships.
29.
Poor lending practices and inefficiencies in the banking sector have kept interest rate
spreads high and restrained private-sector credit growth. Reflecting large legacy NPLs and high
operating costs, interest margins in the two state banks—People’s Bank and Bank of Ceylon, which
account for almost half of total deposits—

lending strategy—limiting corporate loans to blue-chip clients, expanding guardedly into highly
collateralized consumer lending, and holding their excess liquidity with the CBSL.
30.
However, this situation is likely to change. Banks have begun to put risk management
systems in place and introduce new products and services. The CBSL noted that the continued
decline in public borrowing would induce more aggressive competition and increased consolidation,
thereby improving efficiency and reducing intermediation costs.9 In addition, the planned new
AMC law would help banks restructure their balance sheets, while the amendments to the Banking
Act and envisaged new banking laws (to be introduced by end–2004) would facilitate orderly
consolidation. In a recent ruling, the Supreme Court judged a provision of the 1990 Debt Recovery
Act, which accords quasi-judicial power to commercial banks to seize assets of noncompliant
debtors, to be unconstitutional. Although the Supreme Court has no power to annul the original
legislation, the authorities are concerned that the ruling could undermine debt recovery by banks,
and hence have a chilling effect on bank lending. The authorities are exploring options to ensure
that this does not happen, including by legislative means.
31.
In updating the FSAP, staff pointed out that progress had been made in addressing the
key policy priorities identified in 2002. The capital position and management of private banks had
improved, and steps were being taken to promote the healthy consolidation of the banking system.
However, NPLs remain high and provisions are too low, especially in private domestic banks. The

By international standards, Sri Lanka is considered “overbanked,” with 39 banks and 25 finance

overall NPL ratio for the banking system rose from 15¾ percent in December 2002, to 16½ percent
in September 2003, reflecting primarily a tightening of loan classifications, which affected all bank
types.10 An update of stress tests indicate that the banks’ balance sheets were sensitive to credit
quality, but not to interest rate changes. While data were lacking to test for exchange rate
sensitivity, existing limits on net open positions contain these risks. The CBSL is addressing the
weaknesses identified in the FSAP, including by implementing risk-based supervision and
upgrading risk management skills with technical support from donors, including the IMF.
32.
Restructuring of the state-owned banks is underway. The external evaluation of the net
worth of the insolvent People’s Bank is expected to be completed by April, so as to launch its
divestment by June. This process is now expected to be completed by end-October.11 Bank of
Ceylon, which is solvent, met most of its 2002 restructuring targets, including on loan recovery and
return on assets, but bank branches and staffing need to be rationalized.
33.
Domestic capital markets need to be deepened. The corporate bond market remains
shallow, dominated by a few large firms. Market capitalization of listed companies is only about
15 percent of GDP, with few liquid shares and only a handful of new listings over the past few
years. To deepen the corporate bond market, the authorities were issuing more long-term paper so
as to establish a meaningful benchmark yield curve (in October the government issued its
first 20-year bond). On the demand side, public pension funds are the largest institutional
investors—the Employee Provident Fund’s (EPF) assets (almost all in Sri Lankan Treasury
securities) are around 18 percent of GDP. With the improvement in public finances and decline in
interest rates, the EPF will be seeking alternative investments, particularly longer-term instruments,
thereby deepening capital markets. Staff advised that the EPF’s reference portfolio be broadened,
perhaps even selectively easing restrictions on investing funds abroad, and its management
outsourced. The authorities noted that, with the help of an investment advisor, a reform strategy was
being elaborated, with the aim of starting implementation by late 2004.
34.
Both the authorities and the private sector believe that increased labor market
flexibility is key to securing higher long-term growth. The recent amendments to the labor laws
have standardized the mandatory redundancy payments for private sector employees, which in the
past had been subject to the discretion of the Ministry of Labor. The proposed compensation
formula, which is based on past service and years remaining until retirement, provides
15-30 months of salary. In addition, the proposed unemployment benefit scheme, largely funded by
employers, will provide up to nine months of salary. These schemes are generous by regional
standards, but employers considered them a reasonable trade-off for greater predictability in the
resolution of labor disputes. Staff expressed concern that while the reform represented a step in the
10

For state-owned and foreign banks, the increased NPL ratio reflects the reclassification of credit
facilities to state-owned enterprises following the withdrawal of government guarantees or letters of
comfort. For private domestic banks, the increase reflects classification changes for large loans that
were recommended by external auditors.
11

The NPLs of People’s Bank are about ½ percent of GDP, net of provisions, half of which would

- 18 -

right direction, the generosity of the proposed schemes could undermine competitiveness. The
authorities took note of these concerns, but pointed out that the compensation package was lower
than what was typically being offered under the previous system. Under renewed union pressure,
the government has recently indicated that the limit on redundancy benefit to employees might be
raised to 50 months.
35.
The government has unveiled a major civil service reform program in the 2004 budget.
The three-year program will award a 25 percent increase in the wage structure phased in
over 2004-2006, conditional on a 30 percent reduction in employment. In 2004, the aim is to cut
employment by 10 percent through a targeted retirement scheme that will require ⅓ percent of GDP
in additional restructuring costs. Notwithstanding the wage increase, the wage and pension bill will
remain constant in terms of GDP. Wages in subsequent years will be raised if the previous year’s
employment reduction target is met. While supporting the authorities’ aim of streamlining civil
service employment, the mission, along with the World Bank, expressed concern that the scheme
could become too costly, both in terms of its expense as well as in terms of loss of required skills, if
it is not specifically targeted towards those sections of the cadre where redundancy is largest. An
official directive from the government to the line ministries on the details of the scheme, designed
with the help of the World Bank, is expected to be circulated by end-February.
36.
To promote external trade, the government has launched several initiatives. The
free-trade agreement with India has benefited both sides and negotiations for arrangements with
Egypt, Pakistan, and the United States are underway.12 A comprehensive economic treaty has been
signed with India. Recently, the European Union reduced its tariff for Sri Lankan exports by
5 percent. These measures should help cushion the adverse impact on the textile sector from the
removal of export quotas in 2005. Staff analysis suggests that smaller exporters, who are the main
quota users, either would close or be merged, but that larger firms, who contribute the bulk of
exports, would be able to withstand the impact. An anti-dumping legislation is being drafted. Staff
advised that the provisions of the bill restraining the use of anti-dumping measures needed
strengthening. Looking forward, the authorities expected workers’ remittances and tourism to
remain important sources of foreign exchange earnings.13

12

Sri Lanka’s trade regime is moderately restrictive, and frequent changes make it uncertain.
Three new tariff bands were introduced in 2003 along with elimination of tariff exemptions on more
than 1600 commodities, bringing the simple average overall tariff rate to 12 percent, compared with
11 percent in 2002. The 2004 budget revised the tariff structure further, keeping the average tariff
rate broadly unchanged, but widening the dispersion in the rates. Most agricultural imports are
subject to specific tariffs, which are frequently adjusted in line with domestic supply. Export
licenses are limited to a small number of environmentally sensitive items.
13

Chapter II of the selected issues paper focuses on the economic role played by workers’
remittances and tourism receipts.

Poverty in Sri Lanka is mainly rural or conflict related. Preliminary results from
the 2002 household survey indicate that income poverty may have declined in the latter half of the
1990s, and that it remains concentrated in rural and conflict-affected areas. Analyses suggest that,
apart from the two-decade long conflict, inadequate growth in agriculture and lack of opportunity
and isolation of the poor have been the main causes of poverty. These studies also point out that the
incidence of poverty varies little across ethnic groups or gender. Departing from previous policies
of redistributive transfers to alleviate poverty, Regaining Sri Lanka focuses on reducing poverty by
increasing growth and

scheme for government employees and unemployment insurance program for private sector
workers), but a more thorough analysis of the impact is warranted, as envisaged by the PSIA.
38.
Samurdhi—Sri Lanka’s largest welfare program—is being reformed. Over the years,
the program became mired in inefficiencies due to rampant abuse and politicization. By mid-2001
the program covered more than 40 percent of households, but left out many of the truly needy.
Samurdhi is now being reformed under the 2002 Welfare Benefits Act, which sets clear criteria for
eligibility and termination of benefits. A means-tested formula has been designed and a pilot project
to analyze its efficacy is underway. Samurdhi transfers were tightly controlled in 2003 and are
budgeted to remain so this year. However, the program needs to be expanded in the conflict areas,
where poverty is deeper. The authorities are designing ways to expand the program into the North
and East within the framework of the Welfare Benefits Act, while continuing with the ongoing
reforms elsewhere.
D. Discussions on the Reviews of the PRGF and Extended Arrangements
39.
With the current political uncertainty constraining the government’s ability to advance
the reform agenda, completion of the first reviews of the PRGF and Extended Arrangements,
originally scheduled for August 2003, will take some more time. Except for the end-December
performance criterion on net domestic financing, all quantitative performance criteria for June and
December under the program are estimated to have been met. However, end-December indicative
targets for revenue, the primary balance, banks’ net claims on government, and credit to public
corporations are likely to have been missed (Table 7). On the structural front, some progress has
been made, albeit with delays (Table 8). However, as discussed earlier, the government is not in a
position to present the Revenue Authority bill to Parliament—a June 2003 performance criterion—
before the elections. Given the urgency of improving tax administration to raise near- and mediumterm revenue collection—a core element of the program—it was agreed with the authorities to
postpone completing the review until the bill can be presented to Parliament. Another key structural
element of the program—restructuring of People’s Bank—has been delayed due to prolonged
negotiations to appoint an external advisor.
40.
Looking ahead, fiscal and monetary policies over the next few months need to be very
prudent to safeguard macroeconomic stability under the uncertain political circumstances. A
financial program has been set, which, as agreed with the authorities, will be used to measure
performance for the first review. However, both fiscal and monetary policies may need to be
tightened further during the first half of the year if inflationary pressures rise or investor confidence
slackens. Implementing the delayed structural measures, particularly those related to the Revenue
Authority and People’s Bank, are also key to ensure that the objectives of the PRSP are met. In the
second half of the year, the government envisages tabling new Banking and Central Bank bills to
Parliament, initiating reforms to the EPF, and advancing its divestment program—particularly with
regard to SLT and the Hilton Colombo. Preparations to update the PRSP are underway and the
progress report is expected later this year.

E. Other Issues
41.
Sri Lanka’s statistical information is adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring, but reporting weaknesses remain. Aided by technical assistance from the IMF, a
migration plan for reporting fiscal data using the GFSM 2001 methodology is underway, while the
compilation of monetary statistics is being improved. Staff advised that quarterly GDP data from
the expenditure side and retail sales data be compiled to aid surveillance and inform policymaking.
Sri Lanka participates in the GDDS; full compliance with the SDDS is expected by mid–2004. An
update of the fiscal ROSC is planned for this year.
42.
Anti-money laundering legislation is being drafted and is planned for parliamentary
presentation by mid–2004. Staff has provided technical assistance on the drafting of the bill.
43.
The CBSL has made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2001
Safeguards Assessment, as noted by the full Safeguards Assessment in June 2003 (Annex III). The
authorities have committed to implement the staff recommendations.
44.
The staff met with labor unions, NGOs, and parliamentarians, and held discussions on
how best to broaden the consultation process in designing reforms.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Over the past year, Sri Lanka has made gains on several fronts. The economic recovery
has taken root and external vulnerability has declined. Seizing the opportunity provided by
the ceasefire, the government put in place policies and reforms to begin erasing the economic
legacy of the conflict years. The international community has stood firmly behind the peace and
reform process, while foreign investors have started to show renewed interest. However, significant
challenges remain: the political situation is unsettled, the reform agenda is unfinished, and the peace
talks remain stalled.
46.
The ongoing recovery should strengthen in 2004, provided the political uncertainty is
resolved early and peace talks resume soon; however, the risks to this outlook are substantial.
While on the upside, a faster global recovery could boost external demand, an extended delay in
resolving the political impasse and resuming peace talks could depress growth. A further pickup of
growth over the medium term hinges on deepening reforms and securing lasting peace.
47.
Economic management over the next few months will be challenging. Staff supports the
tax policy measures proposed in the 2004 budget, particularly the unification of the VAT rates and
the reduction in VAT and import duty exemptions. It is, however, regrettable that the government
has reversed some of the proposed reductions in exemptions, which will add to revenue pressures.
In addition, the full benefits of the tax policy measures will not be seen until fundamental reforms in
tax administration, particularly in its leadership, staffing, and incentives structure, are implemented.
Staff also regrets that the establishment of the Revenue Authority, which was envisaged by the
authorities to provide the framework to bring about these changes in tax administration, has been
delayed due to the political uncertainty. Weak tax administration is a critical bottleneck to
improving tax revenue—it fell last year to its lowest level (in percent of GDP) in over a decade—
and needs to be addressed urgently. In this regard, the government should be ready to take

- 22 -

corrective revenue and expenditure measures if tax collection falls below the levels required to meet
the budget targets. The authorities should be commended for their control over expenditure in the
last two years, while making available adequate resources for priority spending. Tight control over
spending, particularly ahead of the April elections, continues to be needed.
48.
On monetary policy, the staff commends the CBSL for steering a careful course,
judiciously supporting the economic recovery while restraining inflation. However, if the
current drought continues, inflationary pressures could emerge; if the political uncertainty deepens
and fiscal pressures rise, these pressures could intensify. The CBSL should stand ready to tighten
monetary policy if the need arises. Staff supports the continuation of the flexible exchange rate
regime, which helped to absorb some of the pressure from large services receipts and capital
inflows last year. While open market operations have so far proceeded smoothly, the monetary
transmission mechanism could be made more effective by addressing banking sector weaknesses.
49.
The key medium term challenges remain restoring fiscal sustainability, while making
available adequate resources for priority spending and post-conflict needs. In light of the recent
revenue shortfalls, stronger fiscal consolidation than currently envisaged will be needed if the debt
reduction targets set in Regaining Sri Lanka and the FMRA are to be achieved. This will require
streamlining the tax regime, which remains burdened with a vast array of exemptions; these in turn
have proved difficult to administer and consequently have encouraged avoidance.16 Thus in the
coming years, the tax regime needs to broaden its base, be further simplified, and made more
equitable, including by further reductions in income tax exemptions and incentives. The proposed
early retirement scheme for civil servants, if properly designed, should help to improve governance
and service delivery. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that the scheme does not become
too costly, and that the associated wage increase does not unduly compress the wage structure.
50.
Changing the role of the public sector from a “player” to a “referee” is one of the
pillars of the government’s economic policy to eradicate poverty through private-sector led
growth. To this end, the authorities have privatized several state-owned entities, but in some of the
other larger enterprises, there have been delays in planned divestments. The entry of private firms in
the petroleum market will encourage competition. As the supply of uninterrupted and affordable
electricity is critical for long-term investment and growth, the unbundling of the state electricity
board should be carried out without further delay and locations for the proposed large generation
plants identified early. As the state’s role in commercial activities diminishes, the importance of
efficient regulation is heightened. The staff concurs with the authorities’ emphasis on building
well-functioning regulatory agencies in line with the multi-sector regulatory bill.
51.
The staff welcomes the implementation of the long needed amendments to the labor
laws, which are necessary to increase labor market flexibility. The authorities should make sure
that the predictability these reforms bring to the labor market is not eroded by introducing changes
to the mandatory compensation formula that allows, as before, labor commissioners to have the
discretion to determine the retrenchment package. Raising the upper limits of the compensation
package will also hurt employment by reducing the country’s competitiveness.
16

Chapter III of the selected issues paper assesses Sri Lanka’s tax incentives regime.

- 23 -

52.
The ongoing financial sector reforms should help to improve the sector’s efficiency.
The restructuring of state-owned banks is critically important, particularly that of People’s Bank,
where any further delay should be avoided. The staff supports the CBSL’s recent initiatives to
tighten prudential norms and enhance supervision. The new banking and monetary acts are expected
to further strengthen the CBSL’s powers and along with the forthcoming AMC law, facilitate
mobility and consolidation in the industry. The nonbank financial markets also need to be deepened.
In this regard, liberalizing the EPF’s reference portfolio and outsourcing its management would
help boost demand for corporate bonds and equities.
53.
Staff supports the government’s approach to reducing poverty by removing barriers
that exclude the poor from the benefits of private-sector led growth as laid out in the PRSP.
Increasing the access of the poor to basic services and markets and liberalizing land policy are
needed steps in this direction. The reforms to the social welfare program need to be sped up to
ensure that a well-targeted safety net is in place.
54.
While Sri Lanka’s statistical information is adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring, some weaknesses remain. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to implement the
GFSM 2001 methodology for fiscal data and to comply fully with SDDS in 2004. The compilation
of quarterly GDP data from the expenditure side and of retail sales data, which would aid
surveillance efforts, remains pending.
55.
Sri Lanka has great potential to achieve rapid growth and reduce poverty. What is
needed is a political environment conducive to steadfast implementation of reforms and progress on
the peace front. Staff regrets that completion of the first reviews under the PRGF and Extended
Arrangements will take more time. The government needs to continue advancing the reform agenda
and ensure that macroeconomic policies safeguard the hard-earned improvements in the economy
and investor confidence of the last two years. It is hoped that the policies will be in place and
sufficient progress made on the reform agenda, including the enactment of the tax measures
proposed in the 2004 budget, presentation of the Revenue Authority bill to Parliament, and
advances in restructuring People’s Bank, to allow for an early completion of the first reviews of the
PRGF and Extended Arrangements.
56.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 24-month cycle,
subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Fiscal
Policy

Tax Reform

Deficit
Reduction and
Fiscal
Responsibility

Policy Area

• Establishing a unified revenue authority.

Improve tax administration by
• Establishing a large taxpayer unit (LTU).

• Taxing civil servants income.

• Rationalizing incentives.

• Rationalizing exemptions.

• Extending the VAT to the retail sector.

Broaden the revenue base by:
• Introducing the VAT.

• Legislate a Fiscal Responsibility Management Act
(FRMA) to ensure fiscal transparency, accountability,
and discipline.

• Enhance fiscal consolidation, and aim to reduce the
deficit by about 1¼ percent of GDP per year.

Measure Proposed

• Limited progress. Under the amended Inland Revenue Act, effective
April 2003, civil service emoluments count toward statutory income
thresholds for tax purposes.
• Significant progress. The LTU was restructured in 2002.
Subsequently, all the LTU’s administrative functions were consolidated
under a single commissioner and assigned responsibility for
administering all types of taxes owed by large taxpayers.
• Some Progress. The Revenue Authority bill has been presented to
Cabinet, but presentation to Parliament has been delayed (now expected
in May 2004). The RA will encompass the departments of Inland
Revenue, Customs, Excise and the tax and customs components of the
BOI. The selection process for its management is underway.

• Some progress. In December 2002, Parliament adopted a new Board of
Investment (BOI) law, eliminating BOI’s power to grant tax holidays
and incentives outside the regular tax code. However, this law still
needs to be enacted.

• Significant progress. NSL was merged into GST with a dual rate VAT
(20 percent and 10 percent) in the 2002 Budget. VAT was extended to
the financial sector at the 10 percent rate. A unified rate of 15 percent is
expected to be introduced by March 2004.
• No progress. Although this was announced in the 2003 budget, actual
extension has been delayed until July 2004. Discussions have been held
with provincial councils on revenue sharing.
• Some progress. Additional exemptions were created with the
introduction of the VAT. Some VAT exemptions were lifted in
the 2003 Budget and further exemptions will be removed in 2004.

• Significant progress. Central government fiscal deficit is estimated to
have been 8 percent of GDP in 2003, down from 8.9 percent of GDP
in 2002 and 11 percent of GDP in 2001.
• Significant progress. A Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act
(FMRA) was enacted in December 2002, which sets strict limits on
borrowing from the Central Bank (CBSL), proposes a medium-term
deficit path consistent with reducing the debt stock to 85 percent of
GDP by end-2006, and mandates “pre-election budget reports” to
discourage pre-election handouts. The FRMA also required a mid-term
review of the budget, which was presented to parliament on June 30.

Exchange
Rate and
Monetary
Policies

Expenditure
Reform

Policy Area

• Enhance greater monetary policy instrument
independence for the CBSL.

• Enhance the transparency and credibility of the
reserve money program.

• Adopt a flexible exchange rate arrangement.

• Establishing a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF) by mid-2003.

• Implementing civil service hiring freeze to contain
the wage bill.
• Streamlining the Samurdhi Welfare Benefits scheme.

• Containing defense spending.

Promote expenditure rationalization by:
• Better debt management to contain the interest bill
(the largest expenditure item in the budget).

Measure Proposed

• Significant progress. The rupee was floated on January 23, 2001. The
foreign exchange regulations that were put in place soon after the float
to limit overshooting were eliminated by August 2001.
• Significant progress. Reserve money (RM) is the nominal anchor; the
RM program was put in place at the beginning of the SBA and the
CBSL introduced active open market operations in March 2003 to
strengthen liquidity management, enhance greater control over RM and
reduce volatility of short-term rates. The CBSL has also published on
its website the basic monetary policy framework, including objectives,
targets and instruments; and regularly updates the public on the
assessment of the RM program (actuals versus targets) and releases
monthly review of monetary policy issues and decisions on its website.
• Significant progress. The CBSL’s monetary law act (MLA) was
amended in December 2002, which gave powers to the CBSL’s
Monetary Board to change (by removing statutory limits) and
remunerate statutory reserve requirements (SRRs), if necessary.

• Significant progress. The government has taken measures to
reorganize its debt portfolio, problems with which contributed to the
high interest cost in 2002. It has improved its instrument mix and
reduced significantly the stock of outstanding expensive overdraft at the
2 state banks. A decision has been made to create a new debt office—
the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury are giving TA.
• Significant progress—helped by the current ceasefire. A Defense
Spending Monitoring Committee was established in 2002 to ensure no
deviation from the budget in spending or incurring commitments.
• Significant progress. Hiring freeze has been in place since the 2002
budget and salary increases have been deferred.
• Significant progress. The number of beneficiaries reduced from
1.9 million to 1.5 million. The Welfare Benefits Law that was enacted
in September 2002—which sets clear and transparent eligibility criteria,
provides guidelines for the termination of the benefits, and penalties to
reduce politicization and mistargeting.
• Little progress. Delayed, and to be part of the 2005 Budget. As part of
its program on public expenditure review (PER), the World Bank is
assisting the government in establishing the MTEF.

Reform

Policy Area

• Speed up the general privatization program.

• Bolster private sector participation in key public
corporations.

• Enhance cost recovery by key public corporations to
stem quasi-fiscal losses.

• Modernize the banking act and introduce greater
competition in the banking system

• Bring loan classification and provisioning norms
more in line with international best practices.

• Improve the capital base of banks.

• Improve the mechanism to resolve NPLs.

• Restructure the two state-owned banks.

Measure Proposed

• Some progress. The government has laid out a strategy for the
restructuring of People’s Bank, and an investment consultant (who will
conduct the net worth assessment) has been appointed. Key policy
actions are yet to be taken. Bank of Ceylon is implementing its own
restructuring plan and the World Bank agreed targets are being used to
assess performance. BOC has formulated a VRS to reduce staff costs.
• Some progress. An Asset Management Company (AMC) bill has been
finalized and is expected to be sent to Parliament by end February. The
bill it aims to facilitate bank restructuring, take over large NPLs of
some banks and to recover some of the bad loans through enhanced
powers of collection and enforcement.
• Some progress. The minimum CAR was raised to 10 percent for all
domestic banking units from January 2003 and on a consolidated basis
for all domestic and foreign currency banking units effective
end-December 2003.
• Some progress. The CBSL has started to enforce its current regulations
and has tightened provisioning requirements by discounting the value
of the collateral.
• Significant progress. The amendments to the Banking Act—to
enhance CBSL’s supervision capacity, and facilitate easier entry and
exit into the banking sector—were tabled in Parliament in
November 2003. Work has started on new banking and Central Bank
laws.
• Significant progress. An automatic petroleum pricing formula linked
to international oil prices was established in January 2002. Electricity
tariffs were increased by 35 percent in April 2002.
• Significant progress. A large portion of CPC’s distribution and retail
functions have been sold to Indian Oil Company (IOC). Preliminary
bids have been made for the divestment of an additional 1/3 of outlets.
Following parliamentary passage of the electricity reform bill, the
generation, distribution, and transmission components of Ceylon
Electricity Board are being unbundled into six small CEBs to be run by
private sector management. The sale and transfer of control and partial
equity in the retail network of CWE have been agreed.
• Significant progress. Pelwatte sugar company, Lanka Marine and
12½ percent of Sri Lanka Telecom shares were sold in 2002. Sri Lanka
Insurance Corporation (SLIC) was sold in April 2003. Government
disposed of its holding in NDB in July 2003.

Liberalization

Trade
Liberalization

Policy Area

• Strengthen the external audit mechanism, financial
reporting framework and internal controls systems
of the CBSL.

• Amend the Industrial Disputes Act.

• Ease restrictions on other private capital flows.

• Rationalize the existing tariff structure to a
simplified three-band regime.
• Ease restrictions on inward foreign direct
investment.

• Eliminate the import surcharge.

Measure Proposed

• Some progress. The surcharge was reduced from 40 percent
to 20 percent in the 2002 budget, and was reduced further to 10 percent
in January 2004. The government has committed to eliminating it by
January 2005.
• Some progress. One band was eliminated in January 2004, leaving five
bands in place. However, tariff rates were increased at the same time.
• Significant progress. The restrictions on inward FDI flows have been
significantly liberalized, including in the financial sector. The limit on
foreign ownership of domestically incorporated commercial banks was
raised to 60 percent in 2002.
• Significant progress. The Foreign Exchange Management bill was
tabled in Parliament in November 2003. The bill relaxes restrictions on
some longer term capital account transactions such as foreign
borrowing by the private sector of over five years’ maturity and allows
foreigners to invest in government securities, while retaining existing
controls over other short term capital movements.
• Some progress. An amended Industrial Disputes Act with a timebound rule for settling labor disputes and a new redundancy
compensatory formula to avoid discretionary rulings by the labor
commissioner were enacted in January 2003. The bills were gazetted in
May, but implementation was delayed to January 2004. Preliminary
parameters for the compensation formula have been prepared.
• Excellent progress. The CBSL has implemented almost all the
recommendations in the 2001 safeguards assessment report and has
already initiated the recommendations in the 2003 safeguards
assessment report. Most notably, CBSL has appointed an external audit
firm (Ernst & Young, NZ), appointed an audit committee, the Monetary
Board has adopted resolutions in the areas of accounting and auditing,
the CBSL now prepares its accounts on a full IAS basis and has
strengthened its internal controls system and its internal audit function.

ANNEX II

Sri Lanka—Debt Sustainability Analysis Update
This annex updates the debt sustainability analysis in the last staff report (IMF Country Report
No. 03/140). The broad conclusions of the previous exercise─that while debt is sustainable under the
adjustment scenario, significant departures from the adjustment scenario jeopardize
sustainability─remain valid.
Central Government Debt Sustainability
The updated baseline scenario continues to show a steady decline in central government debt, but at a
slower pace than in the baseline scenario presented in March 2003 (Table II.1). By the end of the
period (2008), the debt-to-GDP ratio falls to 77 percent, a few percentage points above what had been
projected earlier. This reflects a higher fiscal deficit path for 2003-8, reflecting greater difficulties in
raising tax revenue than originally envisaged.
Stress tests demonstrate that most shocks increase the debt stock, but keep debt dynamics on a
downward trend, mainly because of a significant differential between economic growth and the real
interest rate. However, with nearly 50 percent of the debt denominated in foreign currency, the debt
dynamics are vulnerable to large external shocks—for example, a 30 percent nominal depreciation
in 2004 raises the central government debt-to-GDP ratio to nearly 120 percent, and allows it to fall to
only 98 percent by 2008.
The analysis on alternative scenarios shows that a return to pre-SBA policies—proxied by
the 1999-2000 averages of key macroeconomic variables being sustained over the forecast period—is
clearly unsustainable, with the debt-to-GDP ratio steadily rising to over 110 percent of GDP by 2008.
External Debt Sustainability
Under the baseline scenario, consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the staff report, the
external debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to 50 percent in 2008, compared with 60 percent in 2002
(Table II.2). The financing for reconstruction-related needs in the North and East is expected to
average 1.3 percent of GDP in 2004-2008, with about half of it to met by grants. The debt-stabilizing
noninterest current account deficit is estimated at 3½ percent of GDP, a larger deficit than projected
over the medium-term. Estimates of the NPV for total external debt are below their nominal values,
reflecting a grant element of approximately 25 percent on public external debt.
Alternative scenarios suggest that a deceleration of the reform process and its temporary reversal
(Scenarios A1 and A3) would lead to unsustainable debt dynamics. Scenario A1 simulates the effects
of sluggish reforms interrupted by policy reversals, leading to significant variations in economic
growth, high inflation and external vulnerability. Scenario A3 simulates potential implications of the
pre-SBA policies, with slow economic growth, expansionary fiscal policy, fragile external position,
and stalled structural reforms. The debt-to-GDP ratios under Scenarios A1 and A3 would reach
64 percent and 83 percent, respectively, in 2008, compared with expected 55 percent in 2003. The
current account deficit would have to be almost half of that under the baseline to stabilize the debt
ratio. Scenario A2 simulates the impact of low economic growth brought about by a weaker-thanexpected external demand, resulting in the deterioration of the current account and exchange rate
depreciation. The economy is assumed to recover from the shock in 2006. The post-shock debt-to GDP

- 40 -

ratio would exceed that of the baseline by 4 percentage points, but the effects of the shock would taper
off as the economy returns to normal conditions.

Temporary shocks illustrate potential costs of deviations from macroeconomic stability and structural
reforms. Even if shocks are short-lived, the convergence period is long, with post-shock debt ratios
exceeding those under the baseline by about 1–10 percentage points in 2008. Significant currency
depreciations result in unsustainable debt levels—a 30 percent nominal exchange rate depreciation
leads to an immediate increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio of 20 percentage points, and an increase of
16 percentage points for 2008. The effects of the widening of the external current account or real
currency depreciation are less severe, bringing the debt-to-GDP ratio 7–10 percentage points above the
baseline, with the gap narrowing only gradually over the medium term. Real GDP and interest rate
shocks both increase the debt stock, but keep the debt dynamics sustainable, with the debt ratios
exceeding that of the baseline by 1½ percentage points and 5 percentage points, respectively.

ANNEX III

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBSL is subject to a full safeguards
assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement which was approved on April 18, 2003.
The assessment was completed on July 30, 2003 and concluded that the CBSL had made
commendable progress in strengthening its safeguards since the 2001 assessment. As a result,
the risk ratings have been upgraded in four of the five areas of the safeguards framework.
The report found a few remaining vulnerabilities that could be addressed through a series of
measures to further strengthen the CBSL’s operations. Priority recommendations include
(i) completing the full implementation of International Accounting Standards,
(ii) establishing an external audit policy vis-à-vis auditor appointments, and (iii) continuing
to publish the audited financial statements and opinion of the external audit firm.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

Sri Lanka is on a 24-month consultation cycle, subject to the terms of the decision on
consultation cycles (Decision No. 12794-(02/76), of July 15, 2002). The Executive Board
concluded the 2002 Article IV consultation (EBS/02/153) on September 3, 2002.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

•

MFD: Both the FSSA and the FSAP reports have been finalized. A joint Bank-Fund
TA mission visited Colombo between May 6-10, 2002 to provide advice on
restructuring state-owned banks. A joint World Bank/IMF mission visited Colombo
in October 2002 to follow-up on the FSAP and advised the authorities on public debt
management and development of government securities markets. A MFD advisor
visited Colombo in February 2003 for 2 months and assisted in the introduction of
active open market operations. A multisector MFD TA mission visited Colombo
February 18–29, 2003 and helped the authorities in a number of areas including
drafting of a revised asset management company (AMC) law. This mission also
reached agreement with the authorities on TA plans for the second round of
legislative amendments for the CBSL and financial sector laws. Subsequently, the
MFD mission visited Colombo in June 18-30, 2003 to assist in drafting new banking
and central banking laws, and formulate a TA program. A LEG advisor followed-up
on this issues during a mission in October.

•

STA: A data ROSC mission visited Colombo during June 7–22, 2001, and the report

Sri Lanka—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of December 31, 2003)
A. Partnership in Sri Lanka’s Development Strategy
The World Bank leads the policy dialogue in structural and institutional reforms aimed at:
(i) accelerating economic growth and supporting private sector development; and
(ii) strengthening governance in the public sector and improving the welfare system. This
policy dialogue has been ongoing for a number of years and will receive financial support
through a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) designed to support
implementation of some of the structural reforms that are critical for achieving the priority
objectives of the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The Bank’s Board of
Directors approved the first PRSC to Sri Lanka in June 2003.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
A summary of IMF-World Bank collaboration in Sri Lanka is provided in Table 1.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
The policy areas in which the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into the
IMF program/country dialogue include a range of social and environmental interventions as
well as legal and judicial reform. The Bank has led the work to deepen the understanding of
the nature and root causes of poverty in Sri Lanka, with a view to reassessing and
formulating a policy framework for reducing poverty. A Poverty Assessment was finalized in
FY 01 and the Bank is currently assisting the country to update the poverty estimates, as well
as undertake a more extensive poverty analysis of the North East. A Poverty Update is
envisioned for FY 05 and the Bank will provide assistance to strengthen capacity in
monitoring poverty and undertaking social impact analyses.
The Bank has also led the dialogue in the health sector. A recently completed project—
Health Services—helped to address: (i) the remaining major public health problems (malaria,
malnutrition and HIV/AIDS); (ii) new challenges raised by the epidemiological transition
and the increasing importance of noncommunicable diseases of adults; and (iii) key health
policy and financing issues. Following up on this work, the National HIV/AIDS Prevention
project will assist in curbing the spread of HIV infection by: (i) expanding prevention
programs for highly vulnerable groups and the general population; (ii) developing programs
to sustain political and societal commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention; and (iii) strengthening
multi-sectoral involvement and capacity. The Bank has also been working closely with the
authorities in developing a health sector strategy/program (with financial assistance provided
by a PHRD grant). A short sector policy note was completed in FY 03 and the Bank has
begun the preparation of a health sector operation.

In the education sector, the Bank has been leading the dialogue, primarily through two
ongoing projects—Second General Education (GEP II) and Teachers Education and
Teachers Deployment (TETD). The objective of GEP II is to: (i) improve quality, access,
management and financing of existing education programs; and (ii) increase education’s
responsiveness to economic needs and reduce poverty. To achieve these objectives, the
project has supported curriculum development, improving the content/quality/availability of
textbooks, and refurbishing of school facilities, including the provision of quality inputs.
Complementing this, TETD has been supporting the strengthening of teacher training
institutions (including through construction and refurbishing) and the upgrading of teacher
education programs. In November 2002, these two projects were restructured and their
closing dates were extended to support key activities to address three immediate priorities—
promoting English education; enhancing the level of information technology in schools; and
supporting activities in the North East, including repair of war damaged schools. Finally, a

- 48 -

ANNEX IV

dialogue is ongoing with regard to reform of the tertiary sector and Bank financial support is
being provided through the Improving the Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate
Education project.
Given a large presence of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in environment, the World
Bank’s role has been minimal in the sector. The Bank’s involvement has primarily been
through the contributions of staff in the Colombo office who work closely with the ADB
team in supervising their projects. The objective of the one existing IDA intervention—the
Environmental Action project—is to assist the Government in strengthening the institutional
and policy framework for environmental management.
Finally, the Bank has been taking the lead in legal and judicial reform with assistance in
making the existing legal and judicial framework more efficient, transparent and responsive
to the needs of the public at large and of the private sector in particular. The objectives of the
ongoing project are to: (i) modernize the legislative framework; (ii) improve the
administrative, monitoring and regulatory functions of the Company Registration Act; and
(iii) build the capacity of the judiciary and other institutions providing dispute resolution
services.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
The Bank is leading the structural reform dialogue through the first Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC I). As mentioned, the PRSC I––approved by the Board in June 2003––
aims to enhance the effectiveness of the overall strategy for poverty reduction and has two
principal components: (i) accelerating economic growth and supporting private sector
development; and (ii) strengthening governance in the public sector and improving the
welfare system. The first component reflects the fundamental importance given to the
promotion of private-sector led growth in the economic development and poverty reduction
strategy; and the second aims to help address key weaknesses in public administration and
public expenditure management.
Within the context of the first component, the PRSC I focuses on supporting reforms in the
factor markets (labor, land, and financial), power sector and rural economy. Closely
linked to the land reform efforts, through a Land Titling and Related Services project, the
Bank has been supporting the development of broad consensus, methods, framework and
capacity for making sustainable and comprehensive improvements in the land administration
system. Under the second component, the key areas of support include reforms in public
administration and institutional dimensions of public expenditure management and the
welfare system. Accordingly, the PRSC focuses on the development of the legal foundations
of effective public expenditure management. In addition, a number of other operations are
supporting the structural reform efforts, including: (i) the Economic Reform Technical
Assistance credit (discussed below); and (ii) the Distance Learning Initiative that is helping
to strengthen the environment for policy reform and build capacity in the public and private
sectors through the transfer of the latest global knowledge through the establishment and
operation of a Distance Learning Center (DLC).

- 49 -

ANNEX IV

Closely related to this, the Bank is leading the dialogue in the area of public expenditure
review (PER), with four major objectives. First, the PER process will assist the government
in its efforts for preparing a medium term budget framework (MTBF) for 2005-2007 and
more importantly link the Poverty Reduction Strategy (Regaining Sri Lanka) with the budget,
so that growth and poverty reduction policies can be translated into government programs.
Second, it will deepen government’s understanding of the main expenditure policy
challenges by jointly undertaking background policy analysis, whose findings can be
incorporated in the government’s budget policy. Third, it will provide the Bank and the donor
community with an external assessment of the government’s own budget strategy as
summarized in their three year MTBF for 2005-2007. Fourth, provide a framework to the
country team for planning future interventions consistent with the CAS.
Also complementing the above, the Bank has taken the lead in discussing public sector
reform issues with the Government, initially through a number of governance and public
management missions. This work has resulted in policy notes on the size and composition of
the civil service and on establishment of control practices. A model will be developed that
will allow the Bank to explore the fiscal implications of various “right-sizing” strategies,
which will be further refined as more detailed civil service census data becomes available
for 2002. Later—depending on the degree of seriousness with which the issue is being
addressed—the Bank could provide financial assistance to a major public sector reform
effort, including a voluntary retirement scheme. Currently, the dialogue/assistance is
focusing on helping build consensus on and develop a comprehensive reform agenda, along
with some analytic work that would be required prior to initiating comprehensive reform.
The work is being undertaken closely with IMF staff to ensure that the civil service wage bill
will be affordable and sustainable in the long run.
In taking the lead in the area of rural development, the Bank completed a policy note titled:
“Sri Lanka: Promoting Agricultural and Rural Nonfarm Sector Growth.” Following up on
this work, policy dialogue is ongoing and implementation of certain key reforms—including
enhancing productivity and competitiveness of the agriculture sector, and ensuring the
efficient and sustainable use of water resources—will likely be supported through a
subsequent PRSC. Related to this, the Bank has long been supporting the Mahaweli
Restructuring and Rehabilitation project, designed to transform the Mahaweli Authority of
Sri Lanka into a River Basin Management Agency whose primary mission is to ensure
productive and sustainable use and management of the water and land resources of the whole
Mahaweli and adjacent related river basins. A secondary objective of this project has been to
improve agricultural productivity through rehabilitation, improvement and better operation
and maintenance of irrigation facilities.
In the area of peace/reconstruction of the North East (NE), the Bank has played a leading
role since 1999. The NE Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP) has been active in conflictaffected areas supporting community-driven efforts to rebuild economic activity, and the
Land Mine Action Project has been providing support to de-mining. More recently, the Bank
developed a three-phase strategy for comprehensive reconstruction support to the NE. In the
first phase, activities are being focused in those projects which focused on the entire country,

- 50 -

ANNEX IV

but activities could not be carried out in the NE because of the conflict. Approximately
US$15 million was made available through four projects—Teacher Education/Teacher
Deployment, General Education II, Legal/Judicial Reforms and Environmental Action. In the
second phase, certain projects to the tune of US$31 have been restructured to provide
additional urgently needed support to the reconstruction efforts. In the third phase, a longer
term program to meet the development needs of the NE will be addressed in the context of
the current CAS. During the January 2003 round of peace discussions, the World Bank was
selected to be the custodian of the North East Reconstruction Fund (NERF) but the Fund will
likely not become operational until the peace process is back on track. In addition, as part of
the comprehensive needs assessment conducted jointly by the World Bank, ADB and UNDP
for the June 2003 Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka, the
Bank took the lead on the housing assessment and worked closely with UNICEF on the
education assessment.
In infrastructure, the Bank is actively engaged in a dialogue with the authorities and
providing support—through the Economic Reform Technical Assistance (ERTA) Project—
to implement reforms in priority sub-sectors: transport, telecommunications, petroleum,
power, port and airport services and urban water supply and sanitation services. The project
is also supporting the establishment of a multi-sector regulator that will cover the utilities.
Through the Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development (RERED) project, the
Bank is helping to improve the quality of rural life by utilizing off-grid renewable energy
technologies to bring electricity to remote communities and promote private sector power
generation from renewable energy resources from the main grid. In addition, through the
recently approved Second Community Water project, the Bank is supporting the
implementation of demand-responsive and sustainable rural water and sanitation services—
including in the NE—in the context of the newly issued National Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Policy. The Bank’s involvement in infrastructure is generally restricted to policy
and regulatory issues and with the exception of rural water, rural electrification and perhaps
reconstruction efforts in the North East, there is limited Bank involvement in infrastructure
investments.
Areas of shared responsibility
As described above, although the Bank has taken the lead in the structural reforms, the IMF
has a strong interest from both a macroeconomic perspective and from the perspective of
supporting the reform program contained within the PRS. As such, there is close
coordination on all aspects of support to the structural reform program to implement the PRS.
As one example of an area of joint responsibility, the Bank and the IMF are working closely
together in financial sector issues identified under the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) that was finalized in 2002. Complementing this work, through the Central Bank
Strengthening project, the Bank is supporting improvements in: (i) the efficiency and
capacity of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL); and (ii) financial sector policy and
regulatory framework to promote financial sector development. Similarly, the IMF has been
providing technical advice (including long-term consultants) to the CBSL in a number of

- 51 -

ANNEX IV

reform areas, including with regard to drafting/implementing key new legislation and in
beginning to undertake active open market operations.
Sri Lanka has long been known for its comprehensive social protection programs—most
recently, Samurdhi. The Bank and the IMF have shared responsibility for discussing social
protection programs with the Government—including the various options under the 2002
Welfare Benefit Act—and reforming the welfare system to better target the poor and improve
efficiency are important components of both Bank and IMF programs. With regard to
pension system reform, the Bank has long been conducting a dialogue on the topic and
support is being provided under ERTA. The IMF is working closely with the Government on
this issue as they work out a proposal to develop a contributory pension scheme for new
recruits to the public service. Again, in addition to continuing Government commitment,
successful implementation of these reforms will depend upon continued close coordination
between the Bank and IMF.
Finally, given the importance of trade to achieving Sri Lanka’s growth and poverty reduction
objectives, the Bank and IMF have been sharing the responsibility, with each of the
institutions taking on a special role. Analysis by both the Bank and IMF have identified the
trade-related factors—including high protection of basic foodstuffs—that have hurt Sri
Lankan competitiveness. The Bank intends to carry out a comprehensive trade policy
analysis that will help to identify key constraints to Sri Lanka’s further integration into the
multilateral trading system in a manner that is supportive of the PRS. The contribution of the
IMF will continue to be on supporting trade reforms focused on making further progress
toward a simplified and transparent two-band tariff system, including reducing agricultural
protection.
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
As is the case in the majority of Bank/IMF countries, the IMF is taking the lead on
conducting a dialogue with the Government with regard to maintaining overall sound and
flexible macroeconomic policies. Nevertheless, macroeconomic stability remains a
foundation for the successful implementation of the Bank program, especially the proposed
adjustment lending.
The IMF also leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures and other fiscal targets. To achieve the needed consolidation, important
medium-term goals include broadening of the revenue base and re-orienting expenditures
toward priority spending. The IMF is taking the lead on the revenue side and as mentioned
previously, the Bank is taking the lead on the expenditure side.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
The IMF is fully responsible for the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the exchange
rate regime, the balance of payments, and related statistical and measurement issues.

- 52 -

ANNEX IV

C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
The Country Assistance Strategy. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka
was considered by the Bank’s Board on April 1, 2003. The CAS program is designed to
support the PRS and focuses on three core PRS themes: peace, growth and equity. The
rationales for these themes are:
•

Without peace, there is no prospect for development; not only from the difficulty of
creating a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth in such a
situation, but also that the fiscal burden would be likely to become increasingly
intolerable and the most vulnerable poor in today’s society—the conflict-affected and
displaced populations—would not be reached;

•

Growth is the key to prosperity and to creating a bigger cake for distribution; and

•

Equity concerns will remain high in Sri Lanka, not only to permit the expected
attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but more to ensure
balance within the society. While education and health have made great strides,
access varies sharply across the country and quality is a major concern. Furthermore,
the South of Sri Lanka faces many natural disadvantages and growth has lagged
behind other parts of the country.

The Bank’s strategy also envisions an important role for the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), especially through support to the growth agenda.
Programmatic Adjustment Lending. As previously mentioned, the Bank’s program will
heavily use PRSCs to support the implementation of the PRS. At the heart of the PRS is a
program to release the private sector from its constraints and to reorient public expenditure
away from a welfare and control mentality towards an empowerment and service provision
approach. While the PRSC would review the overall progress in the implementation of the
PRS program, there would be annual focus on particular areas of the strategy where deeper
progress would be targeted. Close to half of IDA’s financial support under the CAS is
planned to be in the form of PRSCs.
The first PRSC focuses on factors of production: labor, land, financial and utilities. The
reform of the power sector through greater regulatory capacity and a change in the role of the
state is part of the operation. Last and by no means least, the first PRSC places a strong
emphasis on monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the PRS itself. The second PRSC is
expected to follow in FY 04, and in preliminary thinking this might focus on two key areas
for the poverty agenda: the reform of the welfare system into one which is much tightly
focused on those in need, and reform of the rural economy, in particular to raise the
productivity of farmers, who remain the poorest sector of the economy. In the third PRSC
(FY 05) attention would turn to the public sector itself, with a focus on the reform of public
sector employment systems and structures, and the related structure of public expenditure,
including the issues of decentralization of decision making and revenue-sharing. The specific
theme of the fourth PRSC (FY 06) would be determined on the basis of the outcome of

- 53 -

ANNEX IV

economic and sector work that will be carried out in FY 04/05, but could well focus on the
management and efficiency of public expenditure.
The Base Case Lending Program. The FY 03–FY 06 base case lending program presented
in the CAS consists of about four projects per year for a total of US$800 million in IDA
resources.17 In each year, the lending program is planned to be anchored in a PRSC providing
budget support to the implementation of the PRS. The PRSCs would annually be
complemented by two to four investment/sectoral operations to support key programs in the
focus areas. In June 2003, a 50 percent increase in the IDA allocations for Sri Lanka for
FY 04 and FY 05 was approved, so total commitments for the four year period could reach
US$1 billion.
Bank Assistance Program in Sri Lanka. The Bank’s active portfolio as of
December 31, 2003 contains 15 IDA credits/grants and one Global Environmental Facility
(GEF) grant for a total commitment (net of cancellation) of US$655.3 million (Table 2).
During FY 03,18 five projects were approved: (i) the Economic Reform Technical Assistance
Project in December 2002; (ii) National HIV/AIDS Prevention in December 2002;
(iii) Second Community Water in May 2003; (iv) Improving Relevance and Quality of
Undergraduate Education in June 2003; and (v) PRSC I in June 2003.
Economic and Sector Work. The most recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) is
titled Sri Lanka: Recapturing Missed Opportunities (Report No. 20430-CE, June 16, 2000).
Other recently completed core diagnostic work include a poverty assessment (Sri Lanka:
Poverty Assessment, Report No. 22535-CE, June 26, 2002), the Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR) and the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA).
As mentioned, in the coming years public expenditure analysis will be a continuous process,
and work currently ongoing is concerned with helping to establish a Medium Term Budget
Framework. Going forward, planned economic and sector work includes an Investment
Climate Survey (in both rural and urban areas), a Development Policy Review emphasizing
growth, work on General Education and Financing of Municipal Services, and a Poverty
Update.
IFC’s Activities in Sri Lanka. As of December 31, 2003, IFC’s held portfolio in Sri Lanka
consisted of investments in 10 companies, with a total committed exposure of
US$81.3 million. The latter comprised US$27.6 million in loans, US$31.2 million in equity
and $20.4 million in guarantees. The portfolio is spread over financial institutions, power,
healthcare, manufacturing, ports and telecommunications.

17

Given the intensity of the conflict in Sri Lanka over the last 20 years, a share of the IDA
resources in FY 03 were grants. A significant amount of grant resources will also be provided
during FY 04.
18

No new commitments were approved in the first half of FY04.

- 54 -

ANNEX IV

Contributing to the World Bank Group CAS, IFC’s strategy includes: (i) developing the
country’s financial markets through domestic debt market development, support to SME and
housing finance, by adding value in the ongoing consolidation of financial services, and
supporting the growth of privately-managed contractual savings institutions; (ii) supporting
the provision of private infrastructure services (including mobilization of financing and
assisting with privatization); and (iii) supporting export-oriented manufacturing and service
companies. IFC will explore new opportunities to support the growth of SMEs in conjunction
with multilateral and bilateral partners.

Sri Lanka—Relations with the Asian Development Bank19
(As of December 31, 2003)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) started its operation in Sri Lanka in 1969 and has
provided 115 public sector loans totaling about $3.1 billion and 209 TAs totaling about
$83.4 million. AsDB has also assisted 9 private sector projects (4 loans and 6 equity
investments) amounting $85.7 million.
In 2003, AsDB approved five projects to Sri Lanka totaling $275 million and $4.2 million in
technical assistance grants, to support development and reforms in key areas of the economy.
The AsDB assistance includes Plantation development, aquatic resources development and
quality improvement, power sector development and road sector development.
In 2001, AsDB approved an equity investment of $360,000 in Sri Lanka’s first private sector
housing bank, which will provide loans to low and middle income borrowers. AsDB’s
strategy to enhance private sector development to contribute to growth and poverty reduction
has a two-pronged approach: (i) the promotion of an enabling environment for private sector
activities through AsDB’s public sector operations, and (ii) direct investment in private
sector companies in the form of loan and equity through operations of AsDB’s Private Sector
Group.
On September 9, 2003, the AsDB’s Board of Directors endorsed the Country Strategy and
Program (CSP) for 2004–2008, which envisages assistance of about US$700 million over the
next three years. This CSP is closely linked to the Tokyo Conference for Sri Lanka, held in
early June this year, at which AsDB played a major role. As one of Sri Lanka’s most
important development partners, AsDB pledged support at the conference for the country’s
reconstruction and development of up to $1 billion over the four-year period
from 2003 to 2006. The new CSP program provides both lending and grant assistance for the
remaining three years of the period.
AsDB’s top priorities in Sri Lanka are supporting broad-based economic growth, advancing
social development and supporting improved governance. Emphasis will be placed on poorer
regions and those encountering particular hardship. Out of the total, $400 million will come
from AsDB’s Asian Development Fund (ADF), which supports the sustainable social and
economic development of poor countries in the Asian and Pacific region, and $300 million
will be from ordinary capital resources (OCR). The proposed lending level represents a
$100 million increase over the amount allocated for the last planning cycle (2003–2005), to
answer the country’s reconstruction and development needs as it recovers from the effects of
the two-decade long civil conflict. The timing and magnitude of the assistance program will

Sri Lanka—Statistical Issues
Staff Assessment
Overall, the coverage and timeliness of available data in Sri Lanka are adequate for program
monitoring and surveillance purposes. The authorities supply key data to the Fund on a
timely basis, the Government regularly publishes economic information and data, and daily
information on stock, money, and foreign exchange market developments is readily available
through electronic media. However, as noted below, there are deficiencies in the statistical
base which, if rectified, would improve the ability to monitor developments and formulate
appropriate economic policies. Sri Lanka is a participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) and metadata were posted on the Fund’s DSBB in July 2000. The
authorities expect full compliance on Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) by
mid-2004 (including the data template on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity, and on external debt). Quarterly national accounts and monthly monetary and fiscal
revenue data are published regularly.
Most data ROSC recommendations have been implemented while others are expected to be
implemented in the near future. In particular, most data are now being disseminated in the
Census and Statistics and Central bank websites; a Census of industries is underway while a
Census of Agriculture (including the North and East) has been finalized; a labor force survey
is being conducted on a quarterly basis; the CBSL has issued an advance release calendar and
designated a contact person to assist data users.
Outstanding Statistical Issues
Real Sector
Sri Lanka produces several consumer price indices. The official price measure, the Colombo
Consumer Price Index (CCPI) produced by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS),
uses an outdated consumption basket and weighting system and has become increasingly
irrelevant as a measure of general inflation. The DCS also publishes a Greater Colombo Price
Index (GCPI), including Colombo city and the suburbs. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka
(CBSL) produces a Colombo District CPI (CDCPI) and a Wholesale cum-Producer Price
Index (WPI/PPI).
A technical assistance report by STA (October 1998) recommended that authorities should
produce a single, high quality official CPI, which should cover all households (rather than
just lower-income ones), and include a reliable price indicator for rent and owner-occupied
housing. In response, a new nationwide CPI, covering the second to eighth income deciles, is
being published. STA expects to publish this new index in IFS, following an assessment of
its quality. The authorities plan to make this index official in 2004.
An STA data ROSC mission in June 2001 noted that considerable progress has been made in
meeting most requirements for the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). However,
the mission identified a number of deficiencies, and follow up TA is planned to assist the
authorities implement the 1993 SNA.

- 58 -

ANNEX VI

Fiscal Sector
A government finance statistics mission from STA in May 2003 followed up on the ROSC
recommendation to develop a migration path to compile data in accordance with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). As part of that plan, the
authorities agreed to revise from end–2003 the budgetary classifications and the accounting
structure to match directly the GFSM 2001 categories of all stocks and flows and to apply
that chart of accounts to all general government units.
Central government data regularly provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook cover only
the budgetary accounts and exclude data for the four extrabudgetary funds, and no data for
the provincial and local governments are provided. No sub-annual data are provided for
publication in IFS.
The authorities are planning to reduce the lag in producing monthly expenditure details on
the budgetary central government operations to 45 days, and to revise the presentation of
these data to conform to GFS standards. They have also begun to compile current and
historical data on the budgetary operations of Provincial Councils.
Monetary Sector
Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) are now classified as resident institutions in the
monetary survey (since 1998). To adjust for the proportion of nonresident foreign currency
deposits (NRFC), which are actually held by residents (mainly returning migrant workers),
50 percent of these deposits are reclassified from foreign liabilities to domestic deposits.
The authorities started reporting the adjusted monetary data to STA from January 1999.
A monetary statistics mission from STA in June 2003 followed up on issues raised during
the 2001 ROSC mission. In particular, the mission clarified the methodology in the treatment
of Fund accounts; recommended that repos be treated as collateralized loans (rather than on a
change of ownership basis); and resolved discrepancies between the monetary authorities’
data reported to STA and to APD, which reflected problems in the valuation of Fund
accounts and different methodological treatments.
External Sector
The authorities have recently adopted most of the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, and a plan to develop data on external debt and international
investment position in line with SDDS requirements. An STA mission visited Colombo in
late August 2003 to advise the authorities on international investment position statistics. The
CBSL provides gross and net official reserves and intervention data in U.S. dollar terms on a
weekly basis.

March 5, 2004
Recent Developments
The political situation has grown more tense in the run-up to the April 2 elections.
Several election-related incidents of violence have occurred, and observers remain concerned
about the potential for further violence as the elections near.
Financial markets, while still sensitive to political developments, have stabilized in
recent weeks. The rupee nearly reached Rs 100 per U.S. dollar in mid-February, but has now
returned to a range of Rs 97–98 per U.S. dollar. This reflects a combination of improved
market sentiment and export proceeds, as well as some central bank intervention (about
$40 million since end–2003). Official reserves have been kept stable, and amounted to
$2.1 billion at end–February (equivalent to 2¾ months of imports and about 100 percent of
short-term debt). Equity prices have risen by 20 percent since mid-February, when they
bottomed out at two-thirds of their late-October 2003 levels. Interest rates, which had risen
about 40 basis points between end-October and end-January, have risen a further 20 basis
points since then, reaching 7.7 percent in the most recent 3–month T-bill auction.
Indicators for which more recent data are available suggest that economic performance
has continued to hold up. Inflation moderated further in February, falling to 4.4 percent on
an annualized basis, as food prices remained stable despite the ongoing drought. Tourism hit
a record high in December, growing nearly 40 percent year-on-year, although it could have
been affected since then by recent political developments. In the banking sector, the
nonperforming-to-total loan ratio declined during Q4 2003, from 16½ percent to 14 percent,
reflecting in particular the government’s assumption of nonperforming bank debt owed by a
public sector corporation (Cooperative Wholesale Enterprise).
Policy Implementation
Preliminary data for January indicate that fiscal performance was in line with staff
projections. Total tax revenue amounted to Rs 21 billion, roughly 13½ percent higher than
one year earlier, thanks to higher import duties and VAT (with the latter perhaps reflecting
higher imports as well).
The government recently issued a “Pre-election Budgetary Position Report” for 2004,
as mandated by the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. The deficit target has been
revised upward to 7.3 percent of GDP, from the budgeted 6.8 percent, and includes the cost
of conducting the elections and of recent measures to provide cost of living relief. This
compares with the staff projection of 7.2 percent of GDP. With regard to the outstanding
revenue measures (planned in 2003 and those proposed in the 2004 budget), some have been
implemented (e.g., adjustment in import duties), while others have been adopted through
administrative orders (e.g., unification of the VAT rates) but still require formal enactment.

-2-

Further delays in the commercialization of People’s Bank are likely. In light of the
political uncertainties in the run-up to the elections, the government has postponed the start
of the World Bank-financed investment advisor’s on-site work until May. While off-site
work is continuing, this will delay the restructuring timetable set out in the staff report.
Finalization of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme for the civil service has also been
postponed until after the elections. This should allow sufficient time for the proposal to be
strengthened in line with World Bank recommendations, which aim to limit the budgetary
impact of the reform while ensuring that it is targeted effectively.
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s audited financial statements for 2003 were published
last week. They show substantial progress in implementing recommendations made in the
safeguards assessment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Sri Lanka
On March 5, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka.1
Background
Over the last 18 months, the Sri Lankan economy has advanced on several fronts: the peace
process has moved ahead, albeit with interruptions; the economic recovery has taken firmer
roots; external vulnerability has declined; and reforms in several areas have progressed.
However, the economic effects of the two-decade long civil conflict are yet to be overcome, and
many challenges remain. The government unveiled the needs assessment for the conflictaffected districts in June 2003, which, together with the poverty reduction strategy, Regaining
Sri Lanka, anchors the policies and reforms to enhance growth and reduce poverty over the
medium term. These policies and reforms, as well as the peace process, have received strong
support from the international community. In June 2003, at a conference in Tokyo, donors
pledged about US$4.5 billion in aid over the medium term. Recently, domestic political
uncertainty has increased, reflecting the impasse between the President and the Prime
Minister’s government over the control of the Ministries of Defense, Interior, and Media.
Meanwhile, the economic recovery that began last year is becoming more broadly based.
In 2002, private consumption and tourism were the main engines of growth. In 2003, exports
were an added force, with private investment also picking up later in the year. GDP growth
for 2003 is estimated to have risen to 5½ percent, up from 4 percent in 2002. Disinflation has

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

been faster than projected, due to increased agricultural production and the appreciation of the
rupee against the dollar until late last year, and inflation fell below 6½ percent from 9½ percent
in 2002. Improved exports and strong inflows of remittances and tourism receipts likely
contained the current account deficit at 1 percent of GDP, which was lower than expected.
Gross reserves rose by US$500 million to US$2 billion through end-December 2003, covering
roughly 2¾ months of imports and just over 100 percent of short-term debt. The financial
sector’s performance has improved with the economic recovery. Until early November, the
equity market had made significant gains in 2003, among the largest in Asian bourses.
However, the market subsequently weakened as political uncertainties increased. While bank
profitability has increased markedly, including in the state-owned banks, non performing loans
remain high.
With regard to macroeconomic policy, the monetary program remained on track, but the budget
came under pressure last year. Broad money grew in line with expectations, with higher
reserves accumulation offsetting slower credit growth. Against the background of moderating
inflation, the Central Banks of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has cut repo rates by 275 basis points since
end-2002. Fiscal performance through mid-2003 was weaker than expected, reflecting revenue
shortfalls (particularly in VAT collections) and higher post-conflict capital spending. To bring the
budget back on track, several administrative and tax policy measures were initiated in late 2003.
However, due to disruptions in the parliamentary schedule related to the political events of early
November, not all measures were implemented. Thus, after declining by 2 percentage points of
GDP in 2002 to 8¾ percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit narrowed to 8 percent of GDP in 2003,
compared with the budget target of 7½ percent of GDP.
On the structural front, significant headway has been made in various areas. Sri Lanka’s public
finances are being strengthened through several reforms, including the Fiscal Management
(Responsibility) Act, passed in December 2002, which limits borrowing from the CBSL, sets
medium-term fiscal deficit targets, and mandates “pre-election budget reports” to discourage
election handouts. To improve tax administration, a draft Revenue Authority bill—aimed at
unifying the Inland Revenue, Customs, and Excise departments—and its implementation plan
have been presented to Cabinet.
In the financial sector, several legislative reform initiatives—amendments to the banking law (to
enhance the CBSL’s supervisory powers and facilitate the entry, exit, and mergers of banks)
and a new Foreign Exchange Management bill that relaxes some longer-term capital account
restrictions—were tabled in Parliament in November. An Asset Management Company bill to
aid banks in restructuring their balance sheets has been recently approved by Cabinet.
In addition to these legislative initiatives, financial sector stability is being enhanced through
stepped-up CBSL supervision, higher capital requirements, and other new prudential norms.
Considerable progress has also been made in public enterprise reform, with divestments
completed for several key public corporations. In addition, the telecommunications market has
been liberalized, the state electricity company is being unbundled, and the retail market for
petroleum has been opened to competition. With regard to the labor market framework,
amendments to the laws streamlining the settlement of labor disputes, eliminating restrictions
on overtime work by women, and increasing penalties for child labor were implemented in

-3-

January 2004. At the same time, additional labor courts and tribunals, a mandatory
compensation formula for retrenched workers, and an unemployment insurance scheme were
introduced.
Economic Prospects
Economic growth in 2004 is expected to reach 6 percent, underpinned by increased investment,
higher tourism and exports, and normal monsoon. After the rapid decline during 2003, inflation
should stabilize at around 6 percent next year. Imports are expected to rise as investment picks
up, but improved export growth, tourism, and remittances should keep the current account
deficit around 2¼ percent of GDP. Gross reserves should reach about US$2.25 billion (covering
3 months of imports and 140 percent of short-term debt).
However, the risks to this outlook are considerable. On the upside, if power and infrastructure
bottlenecks are reduced, tourism, shipping, and telecommunications could expand much faster
than anticipated, thus bolstering economic growth. On the downside, while occasional setbacks
were to be expected, a prolonged impasse in the peace process – resulting from the ongoing
political instability – could hold back private investment and delay donor financing. Furthermore,
it could divert increasingly the government’s attention from economic to political issues, thus
slowing the reform momentum. These factors could depress growth, raise the fiscal deficit and
domestic financing, and keep reserves at a vulnerable level if donor financing is reduced.
With regard to the 2004 policy framework, the government plans to gear its policies towards
maintaining macroeconomic stability and advancing key structural reforms. The 2004 budget,
which targets a fiscal deficit of 6¾ percent of GDP, aims to improve fiscal sustainability while
providing adequate resources for post-conflict and reconstruction needs. A number of tax
measures, including the unification of VAT, the introduction of a minimum corporate tax, and a
reduction in tax incentives, will boost revenue. On the expenditure front, there will be an
increased focus on priority needs, with post-conflict spending budgeted at close to 1 percent of
GDP, and capital spending set to increase to 5½ percent of GDP. To improve civil service
performance, a three-year reform has been launched, which targets a significant reduction in
employment (through a voluntary retirement scheme) and increases public sector wages.
Monetary policy is expected to continue to strike a judicious balance between supporting the
economic recovery and restraining inflation, while structural reforms will focus on strengthening
the financial sector, reducing the state’s role in commercial activities, and improving the labor
market framework.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Sri Lankan government’s efforts since the ceasefire to put
in place policies and reforms to sustain strong economic growth and reduce poverty over the
medium term. As a result, investor confidence is returning and exports and tourism are
recovering, contributing to strengthened economic growth and reduced external vulnerability in
an environment of falling inflation.

-4-

Directors observed, however, that the uncertainties in the political situation and the peace
process pose a risk to the implementation of essential further reforms. They stressed that, if
Sri Lanka is to benefit fully from the broadly positive domestic economic developments and the
boost in global demand expected in the period ahead, the authorities will need to make further
progress in establishing a political environment that fosters lasting peace and engenders broadbased popular support for their reform efforts.
Directors considered that the key medium-term challenge remains restoring fiscal sustainability,
while ensuring that there are adequate resources for priority poverty reduction and post-conflict
spending. This will call for improved revenue performance, in particular through simplification of
the tax regime and reduction of exemptions, to increase compliance, improve tax system equity,
and reverse the declining trend in the tax effort.
In that vein, Directors welcomed the tax reforms proposed in the 2004 budget, particularly the
unification of the value-added tax rates and the reduction of exemptions. Over the next few
months, the authorities should press forward urgently with fundamental reforms in tax
administration, not only to arrest the long-term deterioration in revenues, but also to realize fully
the benefits of changes in tax policy. In this regard, several Directors urged that rapid progress
be made following the April elections in establishing the Revenue Authority. Tight control over
spending should be maintained, and further demands for measures to adjust for the increase in
the cost of living should be resisted. Directors emphasized the need to take corrective revenue
and expenditure measures if tax collections fall below the level needed to meet the deficit
target.
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining a stability-oriented, prudent monetary
policy. This, together with the deficit reduction effort, has been key to lowering inflation and
inflationary expectations in 2003. As a result, interest rates have declined, supporting higher
private sector credit growth, thus helping to strengthen the economic recovery. The authorities
should stand ready to tighten monetary policy if the political situation deteriorates or severe
budget pressures materialize, to head off a potential rise in inflation and sharp exchange rate
adjustment. To facilitate the conduct of monetary policy, the authorities were encouraged to
broaden the range of policy instruments. Directors reiterated their support for the flexible
exchange rate regime introduced in 2001, which has greatly helped in reducing external
vulnerability and absorbing capital inflows.
Directors highlighted the importance of strengthening the banking sector to improve the
monetary transmission mechanism and deepen financial intermediation. They viewed the
restructuring of state-owned banks as critical to achieving these goals, and encouraged the
government to move decisively with the restructuring of People’s Bank. Directors welcomed the
recent initiatives to tighten prudential norms and enhance supervision, the Central Bank of
Sri Lanka’s plans to further revamp the banking and monetary laws, and the progress made in
drafting anti-money laundering legislation.
Directors reiterated their support for the government’s strategy to eradicate poverty through
private-sector-led growth. They welcomed the progress made in improving governance and the
privatization of several state-owned enterprises, but noted the delays affecting some of the

-5-

larger enterprises. The restructuring of the power sector—currently a major bottleneck to
growth—should be accelerated. Directors concurred with the government’s emphasis on
establishing high-quality regulatory agencies, as a clear regulatory framework will become
increasingly important in strengthening the private sector’s role in the economy. They endorsed
the government’s strategy to improve the access of the poor to basic services and markets, and
to strengthen land tenure rights. Directors encouraged the government to speed up the
implementation of a well-targeted social safety net, taking into account the results of the poverty
and social impact analysis that is being undertaken with respect to key poverty alleviation
initiatives.
Directors welcomed the recent labor market reforms, which should enhance the flexibility and
predictability of the labor market. However, concern was expressed that the mandated level of
redundancy pay, which is high by regional standards, could hurt Sri Lanka’s competitiveness.
Directors also welcomed the government’s plans to streamline the civil service, although they
stressed that the proposed voluntary retirement scheme should be targeted carefully, and not
unduly burden the budget in coming years.
Directors considered that Sri Lanka’s statistical information is adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring, and looked forward to full compliance with the Special Data Dissemination
Standard in 2004. They commended the authorities for the considerable progress they have
made in implementing the recommendations of the Safeguards Assessment.
Directors noted that political circumstances are delaying completion of the first reviews under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Extended arrangements. They hoped that
sufficient progress would be made on the reform agenda, including the enactment of the tax
measures proposed in the 2004 budget, presentation of the Revenue Authority bill to
Parliament, and advances in restructuring People’s Bank, to allow for completion of the first
reviews at the earliest possible juncture.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka will be held on the 24-month
cycle, subject to the applicable Executive Board decision on Article IV consultation cycles, and
discussions with the authorities.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
