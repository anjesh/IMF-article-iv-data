STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 8, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Latvia’s economy continues to recover strongly as it joins the euro area. The
output gap is now largely closed, and labor market conditions are tightening despite still
high unemployment. The current account is close to balance, while inflation has fallen to
near zero due mainly to declining energy prices. Bank balance sheets are improving but
credit continues to contract. The growth of non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking
system decelerated in 2013.
Challenges: Latvia’s broadly favorable medium-term outlook faces several external risks.
Prolonged weakness in euro area trade partners, or a new episode of global financial
volatility could set back the recovery. Ongoing events in Ukraine and Russia could affect
the economy through both trade and financial channels, especially if there are broader
regional spillovers. Maintaining competitiveness within the euro area will require
sustained reform efforts across a number of areas, such as infrastructure, education,
labor markets and the judicial system.
Staff views: The 2014 budget appropriately continues fiscal consolidation at a gradual
pace, and introduces some welcome measures to strengthen the social safety net, but
recent changes to the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefit should be
reconsidered. Medium-term fiscal sustainability has been underpinned by the adoption
of the Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL). Efforts to revive bank credit should focus on reducing
the private sector’s debt overhang, by improving the efficiency and speed of resolution
procedures. The large size of NRDs in the banking system is a source of vulnerability and
warrants continued vigilant supervision.
Authorities’ views: The authorities largely concurred with staff’s assessment,
notwithstanding some differences on tax and benefit policies. They agreed on the
importance of structural reforms to preserve competitiveness within the single currency
and on the need to maintain higher prudential standards and close supervision of NRDspecialized banks.

CONTEXT
1.
Latvia adopted the euro on January 1, 2014, fulfilling a long-desired policy goal. The
country has taken rapid strides since the crisis, undertaking a large internal devaluation and
addressing severe macroeconomic imbalances. Over the last three years Latvia has achieved strong
economic growth and a substantial fall in unemployment. Market confidence has soared; a 1 billion
euro seven year government bond issued in January was heavily oversubscribed.
2.
The 2012 Article IV consultation supported euro adoption and broadly commended
macroeconomic policies. The staff appraisal recommended continued fiscal consolidation at a
gradual pace; adoption of a medium-term framework to anchor the budgetary process;
strengthening the social safety net; and close supervision of non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the
banking system. Policy making has been in line with these recommendations to a considerable
extent. The 2014 budget cements past fiscal gains while introducing some measures to protect
vulnerable sections of society. The Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL) has been adopted and monitoring and
supervision of NRD-specialized banks further strengthened.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Latvia enters the euro area with the fastest rate of growth in Europe, despite some
leveling-off in the pace of expansion. Growth has moderated from an average of 5.3 percent in
2011–12 to 4.1 percent in 2013. The output gap is now largely closed and remaining unemployment
is largely structural.

However, import growth was even slower—consistent with the investment slowdown—resulting in
an improvement of the trade balance.

5.
Inflation fell sharply. Headline inflation in 2013 was zero, compared with 2.3 percent the
previous year, continuing a sustained decline since the peak of early-2011. The main cause for the
decline was a 1.7 percent fall in energy prices, which has a large weight in the Latvian economy,
partly due to the importance of the transportation sector. Excluding energy, food and non-alcoholic
beverage components, CPI inflation was about 0.6 percent in 2013. Inflation has picked up in the
early months of 2014, with y-on-y CPI rising to 0.6 percent in February, and core CPI to 1.2 percent.
6.
Unemployment, while still high, is falling rapidly. By end-2013, the unemployment rate
had declined to 11.3 percent, relative to 13.9 percent at end-2012, continuing the steep fall from a
crisis peak of about 20 percent in 2010. The improvement is underpinned by strong job creation:
over the same period, employment increased by 2.1 percent, while the participation rate held
steady. Tightening labor market conditions are reflected in rising wages: real wages increased by
about 4.2 percent in 2013, a significant acceleration from the muted pace of earlier wage growth
(1.3 percent in 2012). This is in line with staff analysis suggesting that the cyclical component of
unemployment has largely been eliminated at this juncture; remaining unemployment is mainly
structural in nature.1
7.
Bank balance sheets are improving, but net credit growth has yet to resume. Banks’
return on equity improved to 9.7 percent in 2013 from 8.8 percent the previous year. With the pace
of write-offs accelerating, the NPL ratio for non-financial corporate loans declined to 7.9 percent in
September 2013 from 10.9 percent a year previously, while that of household loans declined from
15.9 percent to 13.4 percent. But the amortization of existing loans continued to exceed the
issuance of new loans, and domestic credit contracted by 5.7 percent in 2013.
8.
Nordic parent banks continue to deleverage from their Latvian subsidiaries. Liabilities
to parent banks declined to 4.2 billion euros by end-2013 from 5.2 billion euros a year ago, bringing
loan-to-deposit ratios to 134 percent from 160 percent a year earlier. Banks report that they are now
generally comfortable with the level of loan-to-deposit ratios, and stand ready to expand their
balance sheets, but that credit growth is restrained by a combination of weak demand and tighter
lending standards. Meanwhile non-resident deposits (NRDs) in the banking system continued to
grow, albeit at a slower pace.2 NRDs grew by 11.1 percent in 2013 compared to 17.1 percent in 2012,
belying concerns of a surge of deposit inflows in the wake of the Cyprus banking crisis.
9.
The 2013 budget target was met despite a large unanticipated government payment
on behalf of the steel firm. The general government deficit outturn of 1.3 percent of GDP was
slightly below the target of 1.4 percent.3 Improved tax administration and reforms to tackle

High structural unemployment characterizes not just Latvia’s economy but that of all the Baltic countries, as
described in the Baltic Cluster Report.

In Latvia the Nordic subsidiaries are responsible for the vast majority of domestic lending, funded by a mix of
parent bank loans and domestic deposits; while a different segment of banks with much weaker links to the domestic
economy specializes in non-resident deposit liabilities (which are mainly channeled into foreign assets). See Appendix
1 of the 2012 Article IV Staff Report for a detailed description of the institutional features of Latvia’s banking system.

underreporting yielded substantial revenue gains. This more than compensated for higher than
planned expenditures caused by the guarantee call on Liepajas Metalurgs (about 0.3 percent of
GDP), and the indexation of small pensions (below 285 euros) from September onwards. Adjusting
for revenue transfers from the government to the privately managed pension pillar (the second
pillar), the 2013 outturn implied a fiscal consolidation of about 0.8 percent of GDP. Separately, the
passage of the Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL)— which constrains the structurally adjusted fiscal deficit to
0.5 percent of GDP or less—ensures that future budgets will be grounded in a medium-term
framework that seeks to avoid pro-cyclicality.
10.
Since the crisis external stability has improved notably, but there are lingering
concerns (Appendix II). From a substantially overvalued pre-crisis starting point, staff estimate that
the real effective exchange rate is now broadly in line with fundamentals. External debt has fallen
substantially but remains high at about 131 percent of GDP at end-2013. While external debt is
projected to decrease by a further 10 percentage points of GDP over the medium term in the
baseline, large shocks to growth and the non-interest current account could impede the adjustment.
Moreover, NRDs are subject to sudden stops in the face of a sufficiently large financial shock,
although the risk is mitigated by the accumulation of liquid foreign assets by and higher prudential
requirements for NRD-specialized banks.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Under staff’s baseline scenario, economic growth will ease slightly in 2014.
Consumption is expected to level off from the rapid pace of last year, but should remain robust,
supported by the continuing tightness of labor markets and a rise in the minimum wage from 280 to
325 euros per month. A rebound in investment and imports is predicated on improved business
sentiment and the release of pent-up investment demand in the wake of euro adoption. Stronger
growth in the euro area and other trade partners should enable more rapid export growth. However,
the downward revision of baseline growth in Russia will have a moderating impact on the rebound
in investment and exports. Inflation should pick up as the downward pressure from commodity
prices recedes and wages continue to rise. The forecast is rather sensitive to the extent of the
investment recovery, which in turn is tied to the prospects of resuscitating credit. Looking further
ahead, with continuing reform efforts and prudent macroeconomic management, growth of about
4 percent per annum—well above the euro area average—should be attainable during the
convergence process.4
12.
There are risks to this broadly favorable outlook (RAM). A prolonged slowdown in
European partner countries would dampen Latvia’s recovery and increase its current account deficit,
while a surge in global financial volatility could affect bank funding. Ongoing events in Ukraine
4

A growth rate close to or greater than 4 percent per annum was achieved by several Central European emerging
markets in the decade before the crisis, as they expanded trade links with West European economies and integrated
into supply chains. Latvia’s own GDP growth rate between 1997–2006 averaged 7.5 percent.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

could generate real and external spillovers. While trade links with Ukraine are minor, Russia accounts
for about 11 percent of exports. A deeper slowdown in Russia would adversely affect trade
prospects, especially if there were broader regional spillovers. As noted by the authorities, ruble
depreciation could depress export margins even if trade volumes held steady. Moreover, the flow of
non-resident deposits (NRDs) to the Latvian banking system from CIS countries could be subject to
volatility. On the domestic front, slow progress on important structural reforms could cause an
erosion of hard-won gains in competitiveness, a resurfacing of imbalances and upward pressure on
external debt ratios. That said, Latvia does have upside potential if it can generate higher levels of
investment, including through additional foreign direct investment, and rapidly implement reforms
aimed at enhancing productivity and improving the business environment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions centered on maintaining competitiveness in the euro area; reviving bank
credit to support investment; ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term while
strengthening the social safety net; and the need for vigilant financial sector supervision.
Taken together, this set of policies would promote external stability going forward, while preserving
internal balance and laying the foundations for robust growth.

A. Maintaining Competitiveness in the Euro Area
14.
Latvia’s medium-term macroeconomic challenge—maintaining competitiveness under
a fixed exchange rate regime—remains unaltered by euro accession. The chief source of past
competitiveness gains was a combination of productivity growth and wage restraint. The resulting
turnaround in the real effective exchange rate enabled an export-driven recovery. But with the
output gap near zero and the labor market tightening correspondingly, wages are inevitably on the
rise. Productivity gains should therefore be the chief driver of competitiveness gains going forward.
The authorities agreed on the importance of structural reforms across a broad range of areas, aimed
at improving productivity, lowering structural unemployment and enhancing competitiveness.
15.
Upgrading public infrastructure could provide an important spur to competitiveness.
As noted in the Baltic Cluster Report (BCR), infrastructure improvements would enhance
productivity, while helping to attract FDI and associated technological knowhow. Staff urged
implementation of the recommendations of the World Bank’s recent comprehensive assessment of
Latvian ports: enhancing connectivity to land transport, and improving governance and
accountability. Reforms to liberalize the electricity sector and deregulate tariffs would encourage
new suppliers to enter the market, over time increasing supply and reducing prices. On a different
front, centralizing SOE management while divesting non-core activities—in line with long-planned
reforms—would improve efficiency and accountability, contributing to an improvement in the
business environment. The authorities agreed with the thrust of recommended reforms in each of
these areas. The World Bank recommendations were being studied with a view to develop an
actionable plan. Tariff liberalization in the electricity sector—initially planned for April—had been
postponed in order to develop better safeguards for low-income households, who would be
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

negatively affected by a rise in tariffs. Legal amendments establishing centralized management of
SOEs are pending in parliament.
16.
Progress on education and training reforms could help Latvia reduce structural
unemployment and move up the product value chain. As highlighted in the Cluster Report,
reforms to higher education—including an independent quality-based accreditation of study fields,
better targeting of public funding to universities, consolidation of higher education institutions and
promoting the use of EU foreign languages in teaching—would build a more skilled workforce.
Reforms to vocational training—including apprenticeship programs and better alignment of training
with employers’ needs—could help reduce skills mismatches and hence alleviate structural
unemployment in the medium-term. The authorities agreed with the need for wide-ranging reforms,
and pointed to progress in a number of areas. A project has been launched with the World Bank to
study a new financing model for higher education. Institutes of higher education are being
encouraged to shift resources from the social sciences towards STEM fields, and to collaborate with
municipalities and the private sector in anticipating the skills demanded by the market. A pilot
project has been launched with technical assistance from Germany under which students from
6 vocational education and training (VET) institutions apprentice at firms with international links. The
program will be studied and potentially expanded.
17.
The Latvian labor market is very flexible, as documented in the BCR, but work
incentives could be further improved. In particular, a more gradual phasing-out of the
guaranteed minimum income (GMI) benefit—which currently phases out one-for-one with income—
would reduce the tax wedge for GMI recipients entering employment. More generally, the BCR finds
that labor taxation is high across the Baltics relative to comparator countries, so measures to reduce
the tax wedge could yield high dividends in reducing

B. Reviving Bank Credit
18.
The continuing contraction of credit is a concern, especially when coupled with the
investment downturn. For several years following the trough of the crisis, productivity growth

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2013

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

remained well above wage growth, allowing firms to finance investment using retained profits. But
the sharp contraction in gross fixed investment in 2013 suggests that the limits to internal financing
of investment may have been reached; with the tightening of the labor market, real wages are now
rising more quickly and profit margins are being squeezed.
19.
Latvia’s creditless recovery is in line with historical experience, but its lengthy duration
makes it an outlier. The Baltic Cluster report finds that sharp boom-bust cycles are often followed
by creditless recoveries, especially if the cycle is accompanied by a banking crisis, as in Latvia’s case.
However, even among the sample of emerging economies that experienced creditless recoveries in
the past, positive credit growth has usually resumed by this stage in the cycle. Staff analysis suggests
that a combination of demand and supply factors is likely responsible for weak credit: private agents
remain burdened with legacy debts, while banks have significantly tightened lending standards since
the crisis. The authorities broadly concurred with the assessment, pointing to the need to ensure
that credit supply to firms is not restricted to only large corporations.
20.
Measures to further reduce the private sector’s debt overhang could help resuscitate
the demand for credit, lower perceptions of credit risk, and underpin a rebound in
investment. While earlier legal amendments have already strengthened the insolvency regime, its
administration and implementation could be strengthened.5 Staff recommended reforms to the
judicial system to speed up the often cumbersome process of debt resolution. A recent measure
allowing the presiding officer of a court to transfer cases to less burdened jurisdictions is helping to
better distribute the backlog of cases, and the number of courts has been increased. The authorities
noted that legal amendments are in train to provide more efficient alternatives to the regular court
system. The system of arbitration courts—which is currently unwieldy and of uneven quality—will be
consolidated and standardized, to increase public confidence in arbitration and encourage its use.
The Law of Mediation is being amended to allow courts to order parties to seek mediation
(replacing the current purely voluntary nature of mediation). Separately, amendments to the Civil
Procedure Law aim at strengthening the role of administrators in authenticating liabilities.
21.
Staff warned against the hasty passage of recent legislative proposals that could act as
a drag on new lending. Proposed amendments to the Personal Insolvency Law—currently with
Parliament—would limit the liability of mortgage borrowers and their guarantors to the value of
collateral.6 The authorities confirmed that they will not support the measure, which is likely to drive
down the supply and raise the cost of new mortgage lending if enacted. They are confident that in
any case the amendment will not be retroactive (which could lead to large-scale write-downs of
banks’ mortgage books).

The current personal insolvency framework provides for eligible debtors to be discharged after successful
implementation of a payment plan over a maximum period of 3.5 years.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

22.
Over the medium-term, encouraging non-bank sources of finance may help reduce
vulnerability to bank-led credit crunches. As detailed in the Baltic Cluster Report, the small scale
of Latvia’s domestic market constrains development of its own capital market. Staff encouraged the
authorities to pursue integration into regional markets in order to access a larger investment pool.
Latvia’s stock market—like those of the other Baltic countries—is already fully integrated with the
Nordic exchanges (within the Nasdaq OMX group), sharing a common trading platform and
supervisory standards. But smaller companies could be encouraged to list on alternative exchanges
such as First North, while regional ratings agencies or credit guarantee schemes—subject to strict
supervision and risk management standards—could be explored to alleviate financing constraints
for SMEs. The authorities pointed to the formation of the Single Development Institute (Appendix I)
as a vehicle for encouraging alternative sources of financing for SMEs. But they noted that
government schemes need to be very carefully designed to avoid moral hazard and market
distortions.

C. Maintaining a Prudent Fiscal Policy
23.
The 2014 budget continues with fiscal consolidation at a measured pace, appropriate
to the economy’s cyclical position and moderate government debt. It targets a general
government deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP, a gradual narrowing from the 1.3 percent deficit in 2013.
The budget is the first to be governed by the new Fiscal Discipline Law (FDL), whose adoption is in
line with Fund advice. After adjusting for transfers from government revenue to the privately
managed pension pillar (the second pillar), the budget is compatible with the FDL’s medium-term
objective of a structural deficit no greater than 0.5 percent.
24.
The budget appropriately “unfreezes” some expenditure areas that have been under
tight control since the crisis, while rearranging some revenue streams. Small pensions were
indexed in September 2013, and the minimum wage has been increased from 285 euros to
320 euros per month. The authorities noted that these measures should be viewed in the context of
substantial wage cuts in 2009–10 and only limited increases in 2011–13. On the revenue side, the
earlier schedule of reductions in the personal income tax rate has been delayed, in line with staff
advice, and replaced instead by a 1 percentage point reduction in social security contributions. To
reduce the tax burden on low-income workers and families, the non-taxable threshold for workers
and dependents has been increased.
25.
While the budget goes some distance to address high levels of inequality, more is
needed. In particular, staff urged reversal of the 2013 cuts to Latvia’s Guaranteed Minimum Income
(GMI) benefit, and a re-centralization of the scheme’s financing, in line with the recommendations of
a comprehensive World Bank study on employment. Social exclusion benefits in Latvia are among
the lowest in Europe (Appendix III), while regional disparities mean that some income-constrained
local governments may be unable to provide even the reduced benefit levels in full. The authorities
argued, however, that higher GMI benefits and centralized financing were only introduced as a crisis
measure, and have been appropriately reversed now that the economy is recovering. They also

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

pointed out that local governments had not faced any constraints in financing the benefit scheme in
2013.
26.
Budgetary planning will need to contend with several potential fiscal headwinds over
the medium-term. Future planned declines in the PIT rate and in SOEs’ payout ratios will act as a
drag on revenue, reducing revenue as a percentage of GDP by about 4 percentage points between
2013 and 2016, and thus requiring corresponding reductions in spending to meet medium-term
deficit targets.7 Staff argued that such large reductions could impede adequate public expenditure
on investment, especially in priority areas like infrastructure. Several options could be considered to
ensure that the fiscal envelope remains adequate. First, the PIT cut should be reconsidered. While
the authorities view this as a measure to improve work incentives, untargeted cuts in the PIT rate are
not first-best from an efficiency or equity perspective.8 Second, revenues from property taxes could
be expanded, in conjunction with cadastre reform. Property taxes are generally non-distortionary
compared with other forms of taxation, and currently amount to only about 0.7 percent in Latvia,
low by international standards.9 The authorities agreed that this could be a promising source of
revenue, but suggested that political consensus—likely to develop only after the October election—
would be required to move forward. Third, measures to broaden the tax base by combating the grey
economy should continue to be pursued vigorously. The authorities pointed to significant progress
in this area as a result of improved tax administration, a crackdown on fictitious companies and
more frequent audits. Various indicators suggest that there has been a reduction in the number of
unregistered businesses and “envelope salaries”, an increase in the number of taxpayers, and an
increase in the rate of recovered tax arrears.

D. Financial Supervision
27.
The level of non-resident deposits in Latvia’s banking system represents a key
vulnerability to the economy, albeit one that is mitigated by some factors. At end-2013, NRDs
accounted for almost half of the banking sector’s total deposits. A sudden stop or reversal in NRDs
could put pressure on the country’s balance of payments, while constituting a significant contingent
fiscal liability (via sovereign backing for the deposit insurance system). However, risks to the
domestic economy are mitigated by the fact that about 82 percent of such deposits are invested
abroad, mostly in liquid instruments.10
28.
Despite widespread concerns about a substitution of NRDs from Cyprus to Latvia in
early 2013, there is little evidence to date of such an effect. If anything, there has been a recent
deceleration in the growth rate of NRDs. But developments so far have occurred against the
7

The PIT rate is scheduled to be lowered by one percentage point in 2015 and again in 2016, while SOE payout ratios
are to be cut from the current 90 percent level to 80 percent in 2015 and to 27 percent in 2016.
8

Better options would include a two-tier PIT system or further increases in the minimum non-taxable allowance.

9

The OECD average is close to 2 percent of GDP.

backdrop of deposit withdrawal restrictions and capital controls in Cyprus. Regulators must remain
vigilant to the possibility of large inflows from Cypriot depositors when controls are eased. The
evolving situation in Ukraine and Russia could lead to capital flight from those countries and a surge
in deposit inflows to Latvia. On the other hand, sanctions targeted against individuals and
businesses in the CIS could cause outflows from the Latvian banking system to jurisdictions outside
the ambit of sanctions. Some smaller Latvian banks also have considerable asset exposure to
Ukraine.
29.
The authorities are keenly aware of the need for vigilant supervision of the NRD
banking sector. They agreed with staff that spillovers from events in Ukraine will need to be closely
monitored, although they did not view as likely any systemic impact. The financial regulator (FCMC)
already imposes higher minimum capital and liquidity requirements on NRD-specialized banks, in
line with staff advice.11 These differential requirements will be continued under the Basel III
framework. The authorities also pointed to several steps that have been taken to strengthen the
AML/CFT regime, including more intensive on-site and off-site checks, larger sanctions levied
against banks for regulatory infractions, and a further strengthening of customer due diligence rules.
The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)—responsible for fighting money laundering, tax evasion and
other financial crimes—has been strengthened with additional staff and comprehensive training
programmes.
30.
Bank supervision responsibilities will evolve as the euro area moves towards a banking
union. By the end of 2014, the ECB will undertake direct supervision of systemic cross-border banks,
including the large Nordic subsidiaries resident in Latvia. But supervision of these banks at a
consolidated level would quite likely be separated from the ECB; with Sweden unlikely to “opt-in” to
the banking union, and Norway not part of the European Union. Existing colleges of supervisors for
large cross-border banks comprise both home and host representation. When the Single
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) comes into effect, modalities should be in place for close consultation
between the Latvian host authorities, ECB regulators and the Nordic regulators of the parent banks,
both on supervision and on setting regulatory requirements (e.g. capital and liquidity requirements).
The authorities concurred with the need for close tripartite communication, noting that agreement
had already been reached on expanding the supervisory colleges to include representation from all
three parties.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
As Latvia joins the euro area, its economy continues to recover strongly. Growth in 2013
is estimated at 4.1 percent, and the output gap has largely closed. Unemployment, while still high,

11

Since mid-2011 the FCMC has required NRD-specialized banks to hold an additional capital buffer. As of end-June
2013, the buffer requirement ranges from 0.4 to 9.7 percent of risk-weighted assets, and depends on both the level
and growth rate of the exposure to non-resident business.

has been declining rapidly and is now mainly structural in nature. A slowdown in investment and
exports was partly compensated by robust consumption demand, supported by rising real wages.
32.
The outlook for 2014 is broadly favorable. Growth is projected at around 3.8 percent,
underpinned by an investment recovery due to the positive sentiment associated with euro
adoption. Exports should be bolstered by higher growth in key European trade partners. The main
risks to this outlook are external. Export prospects could be adversely affected by the impact on the
Russian economy of the ongoing events in Ukraine, especially if there were broader regional
spillovers. Sustained weakness in European partner countries would dampen Latvia’s recovery and
increase its current account deficit, while a surge in global financial volatility could affect bank
funding.
33.
The 2014 budget consolidates past fiscal gains at a measured pace. It contains some
commendable measures to strengthen the social safety net, including a rise in the minimum wage,
indexation of small pensions and a rise in the minimum income tax threshold. However, more
should be done to strengthen Latvia’s Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefit.
34.
Over the medium-term fiscal policy will need to contend with several potential
headwinds. The passage of the FDL is welcome, and should ensure that budgeting is anchored in a
framework designed to avoid pro-cyclicality. It will be important to maintain investment
expenditures in crucial areas such as infrastructure, despite planned reductions in the income tax
rate. Continuing efforts to reduce the scale of the grey economy—which have already yielded
results—could increase the revenue envelope. Reductions in the PIT rate should be reconsidered.
Property tax revenues should be expanded in conjunction with cadastral reform.
35.
Latvia’s basic medium-term macroeconomic challenge—maintaining competitiveness
under a fixed exchange rate regime—remains unaltered by euro accession. With internal
devaluation having run its course and labor markets tightening, the focus must shift from wage
restraint to productivity gains. Progress on a broad range of structural reforms will be needed to
improve the business climate and yield the desired productivity improvements.
36.
Priority reforms include measures to upgrade Latvia’s infrastructure, improve the
system of higher and vocational education, and improve SOE management. The
recommendations of a recent World Bank study of Latvian ports should be implemented as soon as
possible. Plans to liberalize tariffs and introduce greater competition in the electricity sector should
be expedited. Reforms to align higher education more closely with market demand, and to expand
vocational education, would help reduce skills mismatches and hence alleviate structural
unemployment in the medium-term. Centralizing the management of state-owned enterprises while
divesting non-core activities—in line with long-planned reforms—would improve efficiency and
accountability.
37.
Labor market reforms to improve work incentives and lower structural unemployment
should be implemented. In particular, a more gradual phasing-out of the guaranteed minimum
income (GMI) benefit—which currently phases out one-for-one with income—would reduce the tax

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

wedge for GMI recipients entering employment. A system of in-work tax credits and benefits could
also be considered to increase employment of lower skilled workers.
38.
Bank credit continues to contract well into the recovery in Latvia, and in the other
Baltic countries, and could constrain investment going forward. A combination of supply and
demand factors are likely holding back credit. Measures to tackle the private sector’s debt overhang
could help resuscitate both credit demand and supply, and underpin an investment rebound.
Proposed reforms to unclog the backlog of insolvency cases—including legislative amendments to
encourage speedier alternatives to the traditional court system, such as arbitration and mediation—
are commendable.
39.
The growth of non-resident deposits (NRDs) has decelerated in recent months, but
NRDs comprise nearly half of all deposits in the banking system. While the expansion of NRDs is
associated with an accumulation of liquid foreign assets (which decreases the risks of domestic
spillovers), the increasing size of the sector represents a source of vulnerability to external shocks.
The supervision of NRD-specialized banks should continue to be sufficiently intensive and frequent,
including with regard to AML/CFT, given their relatively higher risks and susceptibility to sudden
surges and stops. This is particularly important in the context of elevated risks arising from events in
Ukraine. Appropriately, minimum capital requirements and liquidity ratios on NRD-specialized banks
are already higher than for others.
40.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Latvia: Risk Assessment Matrix
Risk

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

1. Surges in global financial
market volatility (related to UMP
exit), leading to economic and
fiscal stress, and constraints on
country policy settings.

High

Medium
Could affect funding from Nordic
parent banks reliant on
international wholesale funding.
Quicker deleveraging by Nordic
parents would hinder a credit
recovery.

2. Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced economies
in Europe (larger than expected
deleveraging or negative surprises
on potential growth) or emerging
economies (incomplete structural
reforms).

High

Medium / High
The Euro Area remains Latvia’s
single largest trade partner. But
demand spillovers may be
mitigated if Russia and Nordic
countries are less affected.

3. Financial stress in the Euro
Area re-emerges triggered by
stalled or incomplete delivery of
national and euro area policy
commitments.

Medium

Medium
Non-resident deposits are
susceptible to quick reversals in the
face of a sufficiently large shock.

4. Increasing geopolitical
tensions surrounding Ukraine
lead to disruptions in financial,
trade and commodity markets.

Medium

High
Russia is an important export
market. The NRD-banking sector
has large liabilities to CIS countries.

5. Fiscal slippages or failure to
advance on structural reforms.

Medium
Latvia’s new Fiscal
Discipline Law
should limit the
room for fiscal
slippages.

Medium
In the absence of structural reforms
productivity growth and the
business environment would suffer,
harming competitiveness and
employment.

6. Prolonged work stoppage at
Leipajas Mettalurgs.

Medium
Some investors have
shown interest in
acquiring the
company.

Medium
The firm is expected to resume
production sometime in the second
half of 2014. Lingering problems
would slightly alter output and
employment relative to baseline.

Appendix I. Progress on Restructuring
This appendix describes the state of play on several important corporate restructurings,
encompassing both public and private firms. In the case of Liepajas Metalurgs, the bankruptcy of
the company is relatively recent, while in other cases the ongoing restructuring has a longer history.
See the 2013 Article IV Staff Report for further context.
1.
Latvia’ s biggest steelmaker, Liepajas Metalurgs (LM), ceased operations in May
2013 after several quarters of deteriorating performance, and was later declared insolvent.
LM was a major player in Latvia’s economy, with a net turnover of about 2 percent of GDP and
4.4 percent of exports in 2012, employing some 2,300 workers (0.3 percent of the labor force).
The government assumed liability for a loan to LM that was guaranteed in 2009 to support the
firm’s expansion, resulting in a fiscal expenditure of about 0.3 percent of GDP.
2.
LM’s assets have been pledged to the government and the company’s three other
main creditors. A sales plan for the company’s assets was approved by the government in
January, and contains two options: an auction or an international tender. The latter is the
preferred option as it would increase the chances of bundling the assets (which have more value
in combination than piecemeal), maximizing the recovery value and facilitating a speedy
reopening. The authorities are keen to ensure that the sale occurs before the end of the year,
when costs to maintain the equipment will soar again owing to elevated winter heating charges.
It is expected that any new owner would choose a smaller operation size utilizing only the newest
equipment of the deceased company. The authorities are optimistic about eventually recovering
the full amount of their claims on LM––except the costs linked to maintenance and the
insolvency process––but this is not certain.
3.
The sale of the commercial part of Mortgage and Land Bank (MLB) has been
successfully completed. Four bundles of assets accounting for about 60 percent of book values
were sold into the market. The remaining assets––valued at 100 million Latvian lats––were
transferred to a newly formed company called Hiponia, owned by the Latvian Privatization
Agency (LPA) and supported by a loan from the Ministry of Finance.
4.
A Single Development Institution (SDI) was established by the end of 2013. This
institution will merge the non-commercial part of MLB with two other entities: the Latvian
Guarantee Agency (LGA) and Rural Development Fund (RDF). The transfer of MLB, RDF, LGA
shares to the new SDI will be completed in 2014. The SDI will run state support programs mainly
to provide guarantees and intermediation for priority support areas (such as industrial
production, exports and services), and in some cases to provide direct lending to projects that
are credit rationed because of their small size, high riskiness, or lack of related expertise in
Latvian commercial banks to bear the risk.
5.
The sale of Citadele is expected this year. The bank continues to be profitable
following restructuring, under its new management. It is yet to be decided whether the sale will
occur through an IPO or through an auction to large investors; this will be reassessed after a
preliminary road show and the solicitation of non-binding bids. The wealth management arm of
Citadele will be sold together with the rest of the bank to maximize the entity’s market value.

Appendix II. Latvia: External Stability Assessment
1.
Staff estimates that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with
fundamentals. CGER’s External Sustainability and Macroeconomic Balance Approaches both
suggest a small undervaluation of the REER whereas the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)
approach concludes that in 2013, the exchange rate was about 10 percent above its equilibrium
level. In the case of Latvia, the former two estimates are likely more reliable, producing results
close to one another, and consistent with external sector developments. By contrast, the ERER
method is known for its weakness when applied to countries that experienced profound
structural economic changes, and thus breaks in time series trends.

There has been a slowdown in the rate of competitiveness gains. The CPI-based REER
remained broadly stable on average in 2013, reflecting a drop in Latvian prices relative to its
main trading partners that compensated

4.
Latvia’s rapid export growth since the recession has been aided by increasing
diversification, both in terms of products and markets. Heavy reliance on Nordic and some
advanced West European markets has been balanced with increasing export shares to other
Baltic countries, CIS countries and the CESEE, while the technological sophistication of the
product mix has been increasing. However, the impetus to exports from a correction of

A simple measure of export
profitability—the ratio between the
export deflator and nominal ULC—
indicates that recently margins are being
squeezed, after a long period of gains.
Similar patterns hold for Estonia and
Lithuania, suggesting that this is a regional
trend.

macroeconomic imbalances—from a precrisis position of large overvaluation—is
now largely dissipated. Given the limited
room for future competitiveness gains
through REER depreciation, non price
competitiveness gains through structural
reforms should be a priority.

European Union countries (although it
continues to lag behind Estonia and
Lithuania). But other indicators (IMD’s World Competitiveness, 2013) suggest that there is
considerable room to facilitate trade, including through improvements in infrastructure, and the
efficiency of the legal system.
6.
External debt has fallen substantially since the crisis but remains high at about
130.6 percent of GDP at end 2013.
The rapid decline in the debt-to-GDP
ratio is accounted for mostly by the
repayment of liabilities to parent
banks by Nordic subsidiaries. Going
forward, this deleveraging is expected
to level off, but at the same time, the
rate of growth of NRD inflows is
expected to continue to moderate.
FDI was exceptionally low in 2013, as
one component of the general
investment slump, but is expected to
rebound over the medium-term now
that the uncertainty regarding euro accession has been resolved.
7.
External debt is projected to decrease by a further 10 percentage points of GDP
over the medium term, although the debt sustainability assessment shows that growth and
non-interest current account shocks could derail this adjustment. Moreover, NRDs are subject to
sudden stops in the face of a sufficiently large financial shock, as occurred during the global
financial crisis. There are mitigating factors—such as the accumulation by NRD banks of sizeable
liquid foreign assets, and higher prudential requirements for NRD banks—but supervision will
need to remain vigilant.

Appendix III. Inequality and Social Assistance in Latvia
1.
As detailed in a recent World Bank study1 Latvia suffers from high levels of poverty
and inequality, while social assistance benefits are relatively low. Policy action is therefore
needed to strengthen the social safety net.
2.
Latvia has one of the most unequal income distributions in EU. In 2012 Latvia had the
highest at-risk-of-poverty rate, third highest 75/25 quintile ratio and third highest severe
material deprivation rate in the EU. Nearly two-thirds of the poor live in households with low
work intensity, who are either unemployed, inactive or retired.
3.
Social spending in Latvia remains relatively low—amounting to about 15 percent of
GDP compared to an EU average
of about 28 percent of GDP in
2011—and is primarily driven by
social insurance programs.
Spending on social assistance in
Latvia is particularly low, and
poverty-targeted programs
represent a relatively small
percentage of social assistance.
Moreover, the distribution of
social assistance benefits in Latvia
is rather regressive. Less than
Source: Eurostat and staff calculations
20 percent of all social benefits
accrue to the poorest quintile
with the richest quintile receiving almost 27.5 percent, strikingly different from the 40–10 percent
split seen in the EU on average.
4.
The Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefit—the main poverty-targeted
program in Latvia—is well targeted albeit overly restrictive, and does not provide
adequate income support. The GMI program has virtually no leakage to the upper quintiles
with 91.3 percent accruing to the poorest quintile. However, despite increased coverage during
the crisis, in 2010 it still reached only 13.7 percent of the poor. Further, the GMI contributes very
little—only around 10 percent—to the incomes of those in the poorest quintile, leaving most
beneficiaries (75 percent in 2010) at risk of poverty. Low coverage follows from low-income
thresholds, other restrictive eligibility criteria, and limited financing due to decentralization to
municipalities.

REPUBLIC OF LATVIA

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of January 1, 2014, the currency of Latvia is the euro, which floats freely and independently against
other currencies. Prior to 2014, the currency of Latvia was the lat, which was introduced in March 1993
to replace the Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lat was re-pegged to the euro at
the rate €1=0.702804 lats, and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM II, maintaining the previous band
width. Latvia maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the payments or transfers for
current international transactions. Exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons have been
notified to the Fund for approval most recently in January 2013 (see EBD/13/3, January 28, 2013).
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Latvia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
January 23, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/28). The Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2013/pn1311.htm.
Safeguards Assessment:
The safeguards assessment completed on July 8, 2009 concluded that the Bank of Latvia (BoL)
operates robust internal audit and control systems. The assessment recommended clarifying the
respective roles of the BoL and the Treasury in holding, managing, and reporting to the Fund audited
international reserves data. It also recommended amendments to the mandate of the BoL’s audit
committee and improvements to the financial statements' disclosures. The authorities have already
taken steps to implement these recommendations, notably by establishing a formal arrangement
between the BoL and the Treasury, revising the audit committee charter and expanding the existing
accounting framework.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of Latvia’s
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
February 14–28, 2001. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was discussed at the
Board on January 18, 2002, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report (Country Report No. 02/10).
An AML/CFT assessment mission took place during March 8–24, 2006, and the report was sent to the
Board on May 23, 2007. A joint IMF-World Bank mission conducted an FSAP Update during
February 27–March 9, 2007. A World Bank mission conducted an FSAP development module during
November 8–18, 2011. Moneyval conducted a follow-up assessment during May 9–13, 2011, and the
mutual evaluation report was adopted on July 5, 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is classified as adequate (A). Latvia is a
subscriber of the SDDS (Special Data Dissemination Standard) and a link to Latvia’s metadata is available at the
IMF’s website for the DSBB (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board).
National Accounts: The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts with the production and
expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis. Since September 2011, national accounts are calculated
with the NACE rev. 2 classifications, determined by the European Commission. However, there are
discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The
statistical discrepancy is included in changes in inventories on the expenditure side.
The underlying data for the production approach are obtained primarily through a survey of businesses and
individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and administrative sources. The CSB
believes that the basic data understate economic activity, particularly in the private sector, and there is an
ongoing effort to increase coverage. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are obtained from
household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and ministries.
Government finance statistics: Fund staff is provided quarterly with monthly information on revenues and
expenditures of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations, the available
information permits the compilation of consolidated accounts of the general government. The Government
Finance Statistics database in the IMF’s eLibrary website contains cash data in the GFSM 2001 format. Quarterly
general government data on an accrual basis are provided through Eurostat for the International Financial
Statistics on a timely basis.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics could provide more detail in the liabilities of depository corporations
by subsectors of the general government in line with international standards.
Balance of payments: The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics from
the CSB in early 2000. The data collection program is a mixed system, with surveys supplemented by monthly
information from the international transactions reporting system (ITRS), and administrative sources. Contrary
to international standards—but similar to a number of other EU countries—the BoL includes provisions for
expected losses of foreign-owned banks. Between Q4 2008–Q2 2010, this treatment led to the recording of
negative reinvested earnings (i.e., losses) of foreign-owned banks as negative outflows. These “inflows” in the
income account of the balance of payments thus gave a positive contribution to the current account.
Data Standards and Quality: Latvia is a participant in the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard since
November 1, 1996. A Data ROSC was published in June 2004.
Reporting to STA: The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics,
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Latvia
On May 2, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Latvia.
Latvia entered the euro area in January 2014 with the fastest rate of growth in Europe. A
slowdown in investment and exports was partly compensated by robust consumption demand,
supported by rising real wages, bringing GDP growth in 2013 to 4.1 percent.
Strong job creation reduced the unemployment rate to 11.3 percent by end-2013, close to its
structural level. Consumer price inflation fell to an average of about zero in 2013, mainly due to
weakening energy prices. A successful sovereign bond issue in January demonstrated that the
country retains market access at favorable rates.
The 2013 general government deficit outturn of 1.0 percent of GDP was below the target of
1.4 percent.2 Improved tax administration yielded substantial revenue gains which more than
compensated for a large unanticipated loan repayment on behalf of a bankrupt steel company,
and indexation of small pensions from September onwards. Separately, the passage of the Fiscal
Discipline Law ensures that future budgets will be grounded in a prudent medium-term
framework that seeks to avoid pro-cyclicality.
Bank balance sheets continued to strengthen. Profitability increased and the ratio of nonperforming loans declined for both the household and corporate sector. But credit continued to
contract, and parent funding of Nordic subsidiary banks declined further. Non-resident deposits
(NRDs) in the banking system—which now account for almost half of all deposits and are
subject to stricter prudential requirements—continued to grow but at a slower pace.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The 2013 general government deficit was revised from 1.3 percent of GDP to 1 percent of GDP after the issuance
of the staff report.

2
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors congratulated the Latvian authorities on fulfilling their goal of joining the
euro area. Directors observed that the economic recovery continues to be strong, unemployment
has declined rapidly, and the current account position is near balance. However, risks to the
broadly favorable medium-term outlook are tilted to the downside, given an uncertain external
environment. Directors emphasized the importance of continued fiscal prudence, accelerated
reforms to reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity, sustained resumption of bank
credit, and vigilant supervision of the financial sector.
Directors agreed with the broad contours of the 2014 budget, which allows fiscal consolidation
to continue at a measured pace while strengthening the social safety net. They welcomed the
passage of the Fiscal Discipline Law and the authorities’ commitment to the structural deficit
targets over the medium term. To this end, Directors encouraged the authorities to reconsider the
planned reductions in the personal income tax rate, improve revenue administration, and broaden
the tax base by increasing property taxes and reducing the grey economy. Addressing high levels
of income inequality and safeguarding investment expenditures in crucial areas remain important
objectives.
Directors underscored that progress on a broad range of structural reforms will be needed to
maintain competitiveness within the euro area and to reduce structural unemployment. Key
priorities include upgrading infrastructure, particularly in the area of ports, liberalizing the
electricity sector, and centralizing the management of state-owned enterprises while divesting
non-core activities. Directors also recommended aligning higher education and vocational
training with market demand to reduce skills mismatches. Broader labor market reforms are also
needed to improve work incentives. In this regard, they saw merit in a more gradual phasing-out
of the guaranteed minimum income (GMI) benefit to reduce the tax wedge for GMI recipients
entering employment.
Directors highlighted the urgency of reviving bank credit to support investment and growth.
They welcomed the planned reforms to expedite the resolution of insolvency cases, and urged
further efforts to reduce the private sector’s debt overhang and develop non-bank sources of
financing, including through further integration with regional markets. Directors noted that the
large size of non-resident deposits (NRD) and associated risks warrant continued vigilant
supervision. They supported the stricter prudential requirements for NRD-specialized banks,
close consultation with home and European supervisors and regulators, and ongoing initiatives to
strengthen the framework for anti-money laundering.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director for the Republic of Latvia
and by Mr. Uldis Rutkaste, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 2, 2014

On behalf of our Latvian authorities, we thank staff for the analysis provided in the staff
report for the 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Latvia, the first since the
euro adoption. The report properly reflects the fruitful discussions with the authorities on
different policy options in the context of both the Article IV and Baltic Cluster Report
missions, and the challenges that the Latvian economy is facing. The Latvian authorities have
always given careful consideration to policy recommendations coming from the Fund. In our
recent experience, policy discussions and Fund advice have provided meaningful input to
shaping the authorities’ strategy for a prudent fiscal policy and ambitious structural reforms,
which implemented in a frontloaded fashion, routed the economy out of the recession and on
a sustainable growth path.
After the years of the crisis, the report describes a largely calm period of an economy in
equilibrium. While GDP growth remains among the fastest in Europe, the output gap is
largely closed, the current account stays close to balance, and the fiscal position is credibly
anchored within the recently enacted medium-term fiscal framework. The real exchange rate
is broadly in line with fundamentals and the inflation rate, that had been temporarily pushed
into a very low territory by easing commodity and energy prices, is gradually picking up to
more normal levels.
In this overall heartening outlook characterized by harmony between staff and the authorities
on most issues, our authorities would like to provide more detailed remarks on the following
subjects: first, on the outlook for 2014 and 2015 in light of the events in Ukraine; second, on
fiscal and tax policies, in particular, with regards to addressing the high level of inequality;
and third, on the risks associated with non-resident deposits (NRDs).
Outlook for 2014 and 2015
The recent events in Ukraine and Russia have obviously introduced new downward risks and
increased the uncertainty surrounding the projections. For the time being, the effect is difficult
to gauge, but the authorities’ calculations suggest that no severe downturn could be expected
even in case of material disruptions of economic ties. Both the Ukrainian hryvnia and the
Russian ruble have depreciated significantly, but monthly exports data do not show any effect
yet; February figures still post robust annual and monthly growth.
However, a growth slowdown may not be ruled out against weaker external demand and if a
further escalation leads to trade restrictions and heightened uncertainty. Anecdotal evidence
points to a profound impact on businesses working in Ukraine (in particular, fish processing
seems to have been harmed the most). A more diverse, but equally uncertain picture is
observable in the case of exports to Russia with some enterprises even planning expansion,
but most worried about the possible effect of a future escalation of tensions. Significant
effects on business confidence and businesses postponing investment or expansion decisions

in Latvia cannot be excluded, though very little of this is currently evident. On the upside,
should the situation in Ukraine remain contained, a stronger-than-expected euro area recovery
may very well provide an additional impetus to the Latvian economy.
Fiscal policy and measures addressing high level of inequality
Despite the unanticipated loan repayment on behalf of Liepajas Metalurgs1, the 2013 fiscal
deficit outturn was better than expected, at 1.0 percent of GDP. Staff rightly points to the
challenges related to the planned cut in PIT in the coming years. The authorities are fully
aware that, if implemented without compensatory measures, it may excessively constrain
much-needed public expenditure in priority areas. While it is obvious that an adequate
response to this prospect will be necessary, most likely along the lines suggested by staff, it is
doubtful that details of possible measures averting the revenue squeeze will be clearer before
the October elections. Building on the past success, the authorities are also fully committed to
continued efforts to reduce the grey economy that would further increase revenue envelope.
In line with the authorities' priorities, the 2014 budget included several measures addressing
the high level of inequality, such as indexation of small pensions and an increase in the
minimum income tax threshold. After a careful analysis of the potential impact on
employment, a decision was taken to increase the minimum wage. Job search requirements
for unemployed have already been strengthened in 2013. An increase in the minimum income
levels used to calculate last resort benefits (GMI), the introduction of gradual phasing out of
this benefit with an aim to encourage return to the labor market, as well as a possible return to
co-financing and a review of eligibility criteria, are being considered and discussed with
municipalities and other stakeholders.
Mitigating the risks pertaining to NRDs
While recognizing the risks related to the NRDs, the authorities do not agree that “the level of
non-resident deposits in Latvia’s banking system represents a key vulnerability to the
economy”. The authorities closely monitor banks focused on NRDs. Those banks are subject
to additional, much stricter, prudential capital and liquidity requirements (within Pillar II)––
based on pre-defined quantitative criteria, taking into account both the share of non-resident
deposits and loans to non-residents in bank's balance sheet, as well as their growth rate.
Currently, NRD banks' capital adequacy ratio exceeds the minimum regulatory requirement
on average about two times (reaching 17.7 percent at the end of 2013), whereas their average
liquidity ratio was 78.3 percent in February 2014 (minimum regulatory requirement is
30percent). Liquidity stress test results show that each Latvian bank would be able to
withstand an outflow of up to 60 percent of its non-resident deposits without recourse to other
sources of financing to replenish the outflows.

Since the issue of the guarantee on Liepajas Metalurgs an array of enhancements to the sovereign guarantee
system of Latvia has been introduced, the most intrinsic of them being improvement of guarantee planning
procedure, strengthening involvement of line ministries into the planning and monitoring process and straitening
the target applicant scope. These reforms render relevant grounds to avoid similar cases and fiscal impact in the
future.

The financial regulator (FCMC) will continue to enhance the risk-oriented approach to
supervision and maintain Pillar II tools to adequately capture the risks inherent in banking
activities, especially those of the NRD-specialized banks. Capital add-on and individual
liquidity ratios for NRD-specialized banks are re-assessed annually or can be re-set more
frequently, in case of material changes in banks’ strategy or risk profile. The supervisory
toolkit is supplemented by macroprudential instruments that can be activated to address
system-wide risks and increase resilience of banks, if mandated by external or internal
developments. The new Law on Resolution and Recovery (tentatively by end 2014 or
Q1 2015) will, inter alia, introduce a bail-in provision for banks’ creditors, thus effectively
alleviating the potential burden of resolution costs on tax-payers.
Latvia continues to strengthen the AML framework. Significant progress has been made in
the implementation of the Moneyval recommended action plan. Supervision of AML risks
and bank compliance practices remains intense, recently broadening the focus, so as to also
encompass non-bank payment services providers given the notable development of this
segment.
On a different but related issue, the report leaves the impression that external debt, at
130.6 percent of GDP, is a significant source of concern. This concern is a long-lasting
feature of Latvia’s Article IV reports. Nonetheless, it should be noted that this high level of
external debt is linked to high level of NRDs, 82 percent of which, as noted in the report, are
invested abroad in liquid assets, mitigating the risks of an outflow. Therefore, gross external
debt is expected to remain high so long as there is a well-supervised non-resident element in
the banking system. In our authorities’ view, the net debt, firmly on a declining trend
(expected at 33.1 percent in 2014), would probably be more informative when it comes to the
associated risks to the domestic economy.
