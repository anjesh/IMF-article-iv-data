IRAQ
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and Request for
Stand-By Arrangement
Prepared by Middle East and Central Asia Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Juan Carlos Di Tata and David Marston
February 16, 2010


This report is based on discussions held during July 13–16 in Beirut, September 28–October 2
in Amman, October 5–7 in Istanbul, and October 20–21 in Washington, D.C. Staff met with
Minister of Finance Al-Zubaydi, Minister of Oil Al-Shahristani, Governor of the Central Bank
of Iraq Al-Shabibi, other senior officials, and parliamentarians. The staff team comprised
Mr. van Rooden (head), Ms. George, Ms. Oliva (all MCD), and Mr. Bakhache (SPR).
Mr. Ibrahim, the Fund’s Resident Representative for Iraq, assisted the mission. Mr. Di Tata
(MCD) participated in the policy discussions, and Mr. Said and Ms. Sahnoun (World Bank)
joined the technical discussions.



Context: Iraq’s external and fiscal outlook has worsened significantly owing mainly to the large
drop in oil prices from mid-2008 levels. The current account and the government budget have
shifted into large deficits in 2009, and, based on conservative oil price assumptions are expected
to remain in deficit in 2010–11.



Request for a Stand-By Arrangement: The authorities have requested a two-year SBA in the
amount of SDR 2,376.8 million ($3.7 billion), equivalent to 200 percent of Iraq’s quota, to
cover the country’s balance of payments needs. Board approval of the proposed arrangement
would unlocked a disbursement of SDR 297.1 million (about $460 million), or 25 percent of
quota.



The main objectives of the program are to maintain macroeconomic stability during a period
of high economic and political uncertainties (parliamentary elections are scheduled for March 7,
2010), and to provide a framework for deepening structural reforms.



Iraq’s exchange rate regime is classified as stabilized against the U.S. dollar. Iraq continues
to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV.



Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, but there are
some weaknesses that hamper economic analysis.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following a strong economic performance, the Iraqi economy has been seriously
affected by the drop in oil prices from their peak levels in mid-2008. As a result, Iraq’s
external position deteriorated substantially in 2009, with both the external current account
and the overall balance of payments shifting into large deficits of about 20 percent and
10 percent of GDP, respectively. With oil export receipts accounting for about 85 percent
of government revenues, the lower oil prices had a similar impact on the government’s
budget. Even though the execution of the budget was seriously hampered in the second half
of the year by two bomb attacks on the Ministry of Finance, the budget is estimated to have
recorded a deficit of over 20 percent of GDP in 2009.1
While Iraq’s medium-term economic outlook remains favorable because oil prices and
production are projected to increase in the coming years, based on conservative oil
price assumptions the current account and overall balance of payments are expected to
remain in deficit in 2010 and 2011. Similarly, Iraq’s fiscal position is projected to record
large, albeit declining deficits in both years, before returning to a surplus position in 2012.
Against this background, the authorities have designed an economic program for the
period through end-2011 and have requested the Fund to support it with a new twoyear Stand-By Arrangement. The authorities view the new program primarily as a way to
provide a sound macroeconomic framework during a period of high economic and political
uncertainties. The authorities’ fiscal program seeks to contain current government spending
while catching up on much-needed investment spending. The budget deficit is targeted to
decline to 19 percent of GDP in 2010 and further to 6 percent in 2011, before shifting back
into surplus in 2012. Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at keeping
inflation low.
The new program will also help the authorities move forward with their structural
reform agenda. In particular, the program aims to advance key reforms in the areas of public
financial management, including the management of the country’s oil resources, and
financial sector development, in close coordination with a Development Policy Loan
provided by the World Bank.
The program will provide access to Fund resources, if needed. Based on conservative oil
price assumptions and full execution of the government’s capital budget, Iraq would have a
temporary financing need of almost $5 billion through end-2011. However, oil prices may
turn out higher than envisaged and capacity constraints may result in under-execution of the
capital budget. If either of these developments were to imply that there is no longer a
financing need, the authorities have indicated that they would treat the SBA as precautionary.
If drawing on Fund resources becomes necessary, the authorities intend to use the domestic
counterpart to finance the budget deficit. This would avoid central bank financing of the
government and help preserve the independence of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI).

Oil price movements have a large impact on nominal GDP and hence also on the GDP ratios. Largely
reflecting the decline in oil prices, nominal GDP is estimated to have fallen by almost 25 percent in 2009.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Fund has been closely engaged with Iraq since 2003. Initial work focused on
providing policy advice, mainly on monetary and fiscal policies, and technical assistance to
rebuild essential economic institutions. In September 2004, the Fund approved Emergency
Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA) for Iraq, which—in combination with a debt sustainability
analysis—paved the way for an agreement with Paris Club creditors. Since then, Iraq
successfully completed two (precautionary) Stand-By Arrangements (SBA) whose main
objectives were to achieve macroeconomic stability, promote growth, and continue with the
process of structural and institutional reforms.
2.
The Fund has also been a partner in the International Compact with Iraq, an
initiative of the Iraqi government for a new partnership with the international
community. The Compact was launched in May 2007 and entails a medium-term framework
for comprehensive political, security, and economic reforms, aimed at facilitating Iraq's
integration with the regional and global economy. The Fund contributed to the preparation
of the medium-term macroeconomic framework that underpinned the Compact.
3.
Iraq has made substantial progress since 2003. Despite a difficult security
situation, the authorities have demonstrated their commitment and ability to implement
sound macroeconomic policies and advance structural reforms. Inflation has been reduced to
single digits and the international reserves position has improved markedly. At the same
time, domestic fuel prices were raised to eliminate direct fuel subsidies and the pension
system was put on a sustainable footing, which created room for priority spending on
investment and the social sectors. Several steps have also been taken to strengthen public
financial management, improve transparency in the oil sector—including with the help of the
International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB)—and rebuild capacity at the central
bank, and the authorities have initiated the restructuring of the two largest state-owned
banks.
4.
Important advances have also been made in attaining long-term debt
sustainability. In 2004, the Paris Club agreed to reduce Iraq’s external debt by 80 percent in
net present value terms. The third and final tranche of this debt relief was granted following
the completion of the last review under the second SBA in December 2008. Out of a total of
$37.2 billion due to Paris Club creditors, $29.7 billion was cancelled, and the remaining
$7.4 billion has been rescheduled. Bilateral debt agreements with several non-Paris Club
creditors have already been concluded, but this process is yet to be completed.
5.
Looking forward, serious challenges remain. First and foremost is the continuing
need to improve security. It is also important to maintain a stable macroeconomic
environment and improve the business climate to create a viable private sector in order to
sustain economic growth and provide much-needed jobs for Iraq’s labor force. In addition,
many structural reforms have yet to be finished, including in the areas of public financial
management and bank restructuring.

6
6.
Therefore, in the attached letter to the Managing Director, the Iraqi authorities
request a new 2-year SBA to support their stabilization and rehabilitation efforts, and
help advance their structural reform agenda. Their request for a new Fund-supported
program responds to the recent deterioration of Iraq’s economic outlook associated with a
sharp decline in oil export revenues, owing mainly to the fall in oil prices from their highs
of 2008. Based on conservative projections for oil prices, this has created significant balance
of payments and fiscal needs. The authorities have outlined their program in the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for 2010-11 (Attachment II).
7.
This staff report also covers the third Article IV consultation discussions with
Iraq since 2003. At the time of the 2007 Article IV discussions, Directors commended the
Iraqi authorities for strengthening economic policies and making progress in structural
reforms, despite an unsettled political situation and a very difficult security environment.
They noted, however, that the expansion of oil production was lagging, and that inflation,
while on a downward path, remained high. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions
took place in a still fragile but more stable environment.
II. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Political and Security Situation
8.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for early March 2010. These follow the
first parliamentary and provincial elections successfully held in January 2006 and January
2009, respectively. While the elections could result in a change of government, the main
orientation of economic policies is not expected to change.
9.
Security has improved significantly over the past year, but the recent resurgence
of violence shows that the situation remains fragile. The authorities are strengthening
security arrangements after

B. Recent Economic Developments
10.
Iraq’s economic performance was strong in 2008 aided by record oil prices and
improved security. Oil production rose to 2.3 million barrels per day (mbpd), the highest
level since 2003, compared to 2.0 mbpd in 2007. Crude exports reached 1.8 mbpd, compared
to 1.6 mbpd in 2007. As a result, real GDP is estimated to have grown by almost 10 percent
in 2008, up from 1½ percent in 2007. With the increase in oil export volumes and recordhigh oil prices, crude oil export receipts reached $61 billion in 2008—65 percent higher than
in 2007—and the current account recorded a surplus of 15 percent of GDP.
11.
The government budget registered a lower-than-expected surplus of 1¾ percent
of GDP in 2008. This reflected a significant increase in government spending that more than
absorbed the higher-than-budgeted revenues. In particular, a large wage increase was granted
to compensate for the erosion of real wages that had occurred during previous years. Current
spending rose by 40 percent, with the civil service wage bill and transfers (including those to
safety net programs and state-owned enterprises) expanding by about 70 percent. Capital
spending rose by 140 percent due to the adoption of a supplementary mid-year budget and
a marked improvement in the rate of execution, which increased to over 90 percent of the
budgeted amounts.
12.
Performance in 2009 was seriously affected by the drop in oil prices from their
peak levels in 2008. The Iraqi export price fell from a high of $124 per barrel in mid-2008
to a low of $35 per barrel in early 2009, before picking up to around $68 per barrel in the
second half of 2009. The average export price in 2009 was $57 per barrel, well below the
2008 average of $92 per barrel. In addition, the volume of oil exports fell below 2008 levels
in the first half of the year due to insufficient investment in the sector. With oil exports
averaging 1.88 mbpd (compared to an original target of 2 mbpd), oil export receipts
amounted to only $39 billion in 2009.
13.
Against this background, economic growth slowed and Iraq’s external position
deteriorated. Growth is estimated to have more than halved, to 4 percent in 2009, even
though oil production improved towards the end of the year owing to efforts to address
bottlenecks. As crude oil exports account for more than 95 percent of Iraq’s total exports,
the external current account and the overall balance of payments shifted into large deficits
in 2009, estimated at about 20 percent and 10 percent of GDP, respectively. The CBI’s
international reserves declined by $6 billion, to about $44 billion at end-December 2009, a
drop of 12 percent. Nominal GDP is estimated to have declined by almost 25 percent in
2009, a much more pronounced drop than originally expected.

14.
The decline in oil export revenues also put substantial pressure on the
government finances in 2009. Receipts from crude oil exports account for the bulk of total
government revenues (almost 90 percent in 2008). Although in 2009 the government tried to
contain current spending, these efforts were complicated by the large carry-over effect of the
2008 wage increase and by the need to cover additional security outlays, as the role of Iraqi
forces in providing security has been steadily expanding. As a result, and aggravated by the
bombings of the Ministry of Finance in August and December that temporarily reduced
administrative capacity, investment appears to have borne the brunt of these exogenous
shocks. Preliminary data suggest that capital spending was reduced by almost one-third in
2009 relative to 2008, despite the urgent need to improve the delivery of basic public
services (including the supply of electricity and water) and address oil infrastructure
bottlenecks. Even with the compression of capital spending, however, the budget is estimated
to have shifted into a very large deficit of almost 23 percent of GDP in 2009.
15.
Financial savings accumulated in previous years, together with substantial
domestic financing, enabled the government to finance the large 2009 budget deficit. By
the end of 2008, the government had built up financial buffers in the DFI and its accounts
with the CBI, totaling $21 billion (about one quarter of 2008 GDP).2 These buffers were run
down to just over $10 billion by the end of 2009, despite the mobilization of $3.4 billion in
Treasury bills.
16.
Inflationary pressures have eased significantly. Twelve-month headline inflation
declined to 6.8 percent at end-2008 despite that year’s fiscal stimulus and prices fell by
4½ percent during 2009, mainly reflecting the drop in fuel prices. Core inflation (excluding
energy and transportation) slowed to 6 percent at end-2009, from 12 percent at end-2008.
17.
With the easing of inflationary pressures, monetary and exchange rate policies
have been relaxed. The CBI gradually reduced the policy interest rate to 7 percent in May
2009. The CBI also moved from a policy of allowing the Iraqi dinar to gradually
appreciate—the dinar strengthened by 20 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from end 2006 to
end 2008—to one aimed at keeping a stable exchange rate. Since January 2009, the value
of the dinar has remained stable at ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar.
18.
The overall performance under the previous SBA that ended in March 18, 2009
was generally good, but two quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2008
were not observed. Specifically, the performance criterion on the central government fiscal
balance was missed (a surplus of ID 1.8 trillion compared to the programmed surplus of
ID 3.2 trillion), reflecting mainly a much higher-than-projected execution of the capital
2

This excludes the amounts in the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) sub-account of the DFI, which are encumbered
for settlement of purchases of military equipment upon delivery.

10
budget in 2008. The performance criterion on the wages and pensions paid to civil servants
was also missed by ID 0.001 trillion. All structural performance criteria were observed, but
several structural benchmarks were met with delays, and four have yet to be completed.3
Box 1 provides a summary of Iraq’s key structural reform achievements since 2003.
Box 1. Key Structural Reform Achievements since 2003

III. THE AUTHORITIES’ PROGRAM FOR 2010–11
A. Overall Outlook and Program Objectives
19.
Iraq’s economic outlook is strongly influenced by oil price movements and
changes in oil production. Oil prices have been very volatile by historical standards over
the last two years and projections are subject to a large degree of uncertainty. International
oil prices are expected to
increase in the coming years as
the global economy recovers,
although they are unlikely to
return to the record levels of
mid-2008. At the same time,
oil production is projected to
steadily increase over the
medium term as domestic and
foreign investment in the
sector starts to bear fruit. As a
result, Iraq’s longer-term
economic outlook remains
strong, provided that security
continues to improve.
Box 2. Oil Sector Outlook
Iraq is estimated to have at least 115 billion barrels of proven petroleum reserves, the third
largest in the world. Over the last 30 years, Iraq’s oil production and exports have been badly
affected by the war with Iran (1980-88), the first Gulf war (1990–91), subsequent sanctions,
and the 2003 conflict. Oil production was 3.5 mbpd before the first Gulf war, but fell to below
1.5 mbpd in 2003, before recovering to 2.4 mbpd in 2009.
The medium term outlook for the oil sector is promising, with ten new contracts recently
signed with international oil companies following bid rounds in mid and late 2009. The
contracts aim to increase the output of existing fields and develop new fields. Based on these
contracts, Iraqi oil production could gradually increase to as much as 7 mbpd by 2016–17 and
to over 10 mbpd in later years. Some very large fields were awarded, including Rumaila with
an estimated 17 billion barrels in reserves and to be developed by a consortium including
British Petroleum and China National Petroleum Corporation; Majnoon, with 12½ billion
barrels and to be developed by Shell and Petronas; West Qurna-1, with 8¾ billion barrels and
to be developed by Exxon Mobil and Shell; and West Qurna-2, with almost 13 billion barrels
and to be developed by Lukoil and Statoil.

12
20.
The external current account and the overall balance of payments, however, are
expected to remain in deficit in 2010 and 2011. As in previous programs, projections for
2010 and beyond are based on a conservative price assumption for Iraqi oil—$62.5 per barrel
in 2010 and $67.5 per barrel in 2011—based on WEO prices discounted by an uncertainty
margin of 10 percent and by the quality
differential between Iraqi oil and the
WEO basket. Iraq’s oil exports are
projected to increase to 2.1 mbpd in
2010 and to 2.25 mbpd in 2011,
although technical and security
problems pose significant downside
risks. Based on these assumptions, Iraq
is expected to have a financing gap of
about $5 billion through end-2011.
Similarly, Iraq’s fiscal position is
projected to record large, albeit
declining deficits in both years.
Financing these deficits, even after mobilizing substantial domestic financing, could exhaust
the government’s remaining financial balances and result in the accumulation of arrears.
21.
To address this situation, the authorities have designed an economic program
for the period through end-2011. The authorities view the new program primarily as a way
to provide a sound macroeconomic framework during the upcoming period of political
transition, while supporting the government’s efforts to address the country’s large
rehabilitation needs and improve public service delivery—a prerequisite to consolidating
political stability and security improvements. The authorities consider macroeconomic
stability—together with security—as critical factors to foster private sector development and
generate sustainable employment opportunities.
22.
In addition to preserving macroeconomic stability, the new program will also
help the authorities move forward with their structural reform agenda. With many of
the structural reforms still unfinished, the program aims to advance key reforms in the areas
of public financial management (PFM) and financial sector development, in close
coordination with a Development Policy Loan (DPL) provided by the World Bank. Both
operations focus on advancing PFM and bank restructuring action plans prepared by the
authorities during 2008 and 2009 with the assistance of Fund and World Bank staff.
23.
The program will provide the authorities with access to Fund financing, if
needed. As noted, oil prices are expected to increase in the coming years, and with the
projected increase in oil production, Iraq’s financing needs are expected to be temporary in

13
nature. In fact, oil prices have already been increasing in recent months and may turn out to
be higher than projected during the program period. In this regard, the authorities have
indicated that they intend to treat the SBA as precautionary if at the time of each program
review it becomes evident that oil revenues would increase to levels implying that that there
is no longer a financing need. Specifically, provided that Iraq is able to sustain an export
level of 2.1 mbpd in 2010, the authorities have indicated their intention to treat the program
as precautionary if at the time of the program reviews futures prices for Iraqi oil average $73
per barrel or higher. In the same vein, the authorities would also treat the SBA as
precautionary if investment remains significantly below budgeted amounts. While the
authorities are working to restore and expand administrative capacity in the wake of the two
bombings, including with the assistance of the World Bank, to ensure that the disruptions do
not lead to poor quality implementation, investment could again fall short of budgeted
amounts if capacity issues cannot be fully addressed. Therefore, the authorities would treat
the SBA as precautionary if at the time of the second review the rate of execution of the
capital budget for the year as a whole is expected to remain below 93 percent (with the
difference between 93 and 100 percent equal to the third disbursement).

Box 3. Poverty and Social Development
Poverty is relatively high in Iraq, and while poverty is relatively shallow, many Iraqis are
vulnerable to falling below the poverty line. According to Iraq’s National Strategy for Poverty
Reduction and the World Bank, Iraq has an estimated poverty headcount of almost 23 percent
(based on the 2006/07 Household Socio-Economic Survey), but the poverty gap—measured as the
gap between the poor’s average incomes and the poverty line—is only 4½ percent. Thus, a
relatively small increase in people’s incomes could lift most of the poor above the poverty line. At
the same time, however, a large proportion of the non-poor hovers just above the poverty line,
implying that a relatively minor deterioration of economic conditions would substantially increase
poverty rates. Meanwhile, the delivery of basic public services, including water and electricity,
remains unreliable, while access to medical services and education is limited, especially for the
poor.
Almost half of total household income is provided in one way or another by the government.
According to the 2006/07 Household Socio-Economic Survey, about 30 percent of all household
income comes from public sector employment. An additional 15 percent comes from government
transfers including pensions, in-kind transfers through the Public Distribution System, and cash
transfers.
Iraq has the lowest employment to population ratio in the region. Out of every 100 Iraqi adults,
slightly over one-third (38 percent) is employed, while 5 percent is officially unemployed
(available and seeking work). The majority (57 percent) is not in the labor force. The labor force
participation of women is especially low, at just over 10 percent.
Refugees have slowly started returning home as security improves, but displacement remains
a concern. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that more than
4.7 million Iraqis have left their homes as a result of the recent conflicts. Of these, 2.7 million
Iraqis are displaced internally, while about 2 million have sought refuge in countries such as Syria
and Jordan.

14
24.
The program will safeguard central bank independence. The central bank law
prohibits the CBI from financing the budget, and changing the law at this juncture would
undermine the hard-won gains made in achieving low inflation and a strong currency.
Consequently, the authorities strongly believe in the importance of safeguarding central bank
independence and, if the need materializes, intend to use the domestic counterpart of the
Fund’s support to finance the budget deficit. This would allow for a larger budget deficit than
could otherwise be financed from domestic and external resources, avoiding having to
compress government spending at a time when the country’s rehabilitation needs are high,
poverty and unemployment are widespread, and the security situation remains very fragile. It
would also allow the government to maintain financial buffers (equivalent to two months of
its wage bill) to absorb further shocks.
B. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
25.
With oil production and prices expected to increase over the medium term,
economic indicators would improve steadily:


Economic growth is projected to accelerate to 7–8 percent a year in the coming years
as oil production increases gradually from 2.4 mbpd in 2009 to 2.6 mbpd in 2010, and
to 3.1 mbpd in 2012.



Combined with higher oil prices, this will result in a steady narrowing of the current
account deficit. Oil exports are projected to rise from 1.88 mbpd in 2009 to 2.1 mbpd
in 2010 and further to 2.5 mbpd in 2012, with the current account deficit declining to
5½ percent of GDP in 2011, and moving back into surplus in 2014.



While Iraq’s overall international reserves (including balances in the DFI) would still
fall in 2010, they are projected to stabilize in the following years at a level equivalent
to about 7 months of imports, before starting to improve in 2014.



Following the containment of government current spending and a pick-up in capital
spending in 2010–11, the budget would move back into surplus in 2012, and would
remain in a sustainable position over the medium-term.



With appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies, headline inflation is projected
to remain low at around 5–6 percent a year in the coming years.



Iraq’s external debt position would also reach a sustainable position provided that
further progress is made in concluding agreements with non-Paris Club creditors
(see the attached debt sustainability analysis).

15
C. Fiscal Policy
26.
As noted above, a key element of the authorities’ policies is to contain current
government spending over the coming period in order to gradually reduce the deficit
and make room for investment. Current spending is set to increase slightly in 2010 and
would be kept broadly unchanged in nominal terms thereafter (a performance criterion under
the program). This will require

broadly constant in 2011, current
spending will fall from 78 percent of GDP in 2009 to 67 percent in 2010 and 57 percent in
2011. Specifically, the authorities will:


Contain the wage bill by refraining from raising wages and limiting hiring—besides
the tribal militias that are being put on the payroll as part of the security agreement—
to new teachers and doctors (MEFP ¶12).



Complete the census of government civil servants (MEFP ¶15). To overcome delays
related to problems in accessing information from the security sector, the scope of the
census has been narrowed. Completion of the census for civil servants will allow for
the elimination of ghost workers from the payroll and pave the way for an automated
human resource database and payroll system.



Improve the targeting of social spending. While the in-kind Public Distribution
System (PDS) reaches nearly all poor Iraqis, in its current form it is an inefficient
generalized benefit that distorts private sector activity. As a first step, high-income
earners will be excluded from the PDS, and the number and volume of goods
distributed through this system will be reduced (MEFP ¶12). The authorities are
working with the World Bank and the World Food Program on further developing
a well-targeted cash-based safety net that would replace the PDS over time.



Reduce transfers to state-owned enterprises, which should either gradually become
financially viable or be closed (MEFP ¶12).

16


Avoid the reemergence of direct fuel subsidies. Fuel prices in Iraq compare favorably
relative to those in the region. The authorities are determined not to reverse the gains
made in market pricing of fuel
products under the previous
SBAs (MEFP ¶17). They are
also planning to gradually
reduce indirect subsidies
(estimated at now about
1½ percent of GDP). In this
regard, the authorities will
continue to work on developing
an automatic adjustment
mechanism for domestic fuel
prices.

27.
A substantial recovery in capital spending is envisaged for 2010. Following the
early approval of the 2010 budget by parliament and based on the efforts underway to rebuild
and strengthen administrative capacity in the Ministry of Finance, the authorities aim to fully
execute this year’s capital budget. Investment will focus on improving the delivery of key
public services, including electricity, water, health, and education, and on further
rehabilitating and expanding the oil sector infrastructure. The latter is urgently needed to
ensure an increase in production and export volumes, and is therefore critical to Iraq’s
medium-term fiscal sustainability. The level of investment in 2010, however, would still
remain below the high level recorded in 2008.
28.
With these policies, the budget deficit would decline moderately to 19 percent
of GDP in 2010, before falling markedly to 6 percent in 2011, and moving back into
surplus in 2012 as oil revenues increase. In the event that oil revenues are higher than
budgeted, half of the additional revenues (up to a specified limit) could be used for further
investment. The remaining half would be used to build up buffers in the DFI. If oil revenues
are less than budgeted, the authorities will reduce spending and aim to mobilize additional
(external) financing. The 2010 deficit will be financed by a further drawing down of
government balances in the DFI and the CBI, a significant amount of domestic financing,
and external support, including from the Fund. The authorities also intend to use the SDR
allocation, equivalent to $1.7 billion, to finance the budget deficit. With regard to domestic
financing, the authorities plan to further develop the Treasury bill market by improving the
auction process with the assistance of the US Treasury and the Fund. This would enable the
government to attract deposits currently held by commercial banks with the CBI and would
contribute to the development of a secondary market. The authorities will also start
preparations for the introduction of a sales tax with the purpose of broadening the revenue
base over the medium-term.

D. Fiscal Structural Policies
29.
Improving public financial management is another key objective of the
authorities’ program (MEFP ¶14). In October 2008, a three-year action plan was adopted
under the World Bank PFM project that identified priority measures in the areas of budget
preparation, reporting and cash management, public procurement, internal audit and control
systems, and the accounting framework. Specifically:


To improve budget preparation, the authorities are moving towards introducing a
medium-term budget framework. As part of this, clear priorities and ceilings in line
with a sustainable medium-term budget strategy will be included in the budget
circular for the preparation of the 2011 budget;



In the area of reporting and cash management, spending units will be required to
submit comprehensive spending reports to enable the Ministry of Finance to better

18
track implementation and strengthen cash management. In addition, the functionality
of Iraq’s Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which was developed
with assistance from USAID, will be reviewed to ensure that it is consistent with the
original objective of establishing an internal commitment control mechanism and a
system that can automatically produce regular comprehensive reports;


To ensure transparency, the authorities will continue to submit in a timely manner the
final fiscal accounts for each year to the Supreme Board of Audit and the Council of
Representatives;



The accounting systems and practices will be reviewed to strengthen the internal
audit and control systems. Specifically, performance audits examining the process of
selection, procurement, and management of the largest capital projects will be
undertaken to evaluate the quality of investment spending. In addition, a review of
the outstanding stock of advances will be carried out to strengthen discipline in this
area. Also, a new procurement framework will be put in place with the assistance of
the World Bank.

30.
The authorities also remain committed to continuing the process of creating a
transparent and accountable oil sector in Iraq. In this regard, they will:


Maintain a single account for all oil export proceeds (MEFP ¶18). In December 2009,
the UN Security Council extended the DFI for another year, but requested the
authorities to prepare for transitioning to another mechanism. The authorities will
maintain a single oil export revenue account, which will continue to be subject to the
same principles that currently apply to the DFI, including audits by a reputable
external auditor and oversight by the independent Iraqi Committee of Financial
Experts (COFE), which would take over the role currently performed by the IAMB;



Complete the process of becoming a candidate country for membership in the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) (MEFP ¶19). The authorities
already publish full information with regard to all crude oil export receipts;



Complete the installation of domestic metering systems to allow accurate
measurement of all domestic fuel flows (MEFP ¶20). The metering of export
terminals and pipelines has been almost completed. Completion of the domestic
metering system will enable the full reconciliation of domestic flows of oil and oil
products with the financial flows between the state-owned oil companies and the
budget. In this regard, the World Bank plans to conduct a streamlined public
expenditure review in Iraq covering key ministries, including the ministry of oil.

19
E. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
31.
The CBI intends to maintain its present monetary and exchange rate policies,
which are aimed at keeping inflation in the single digits and further reducing
dollarization. In the absence of an effective monetary transmission mechanism, the
exchange rate remains the CBI’s main policy instrument. Up until late 2008, the CBI had
allowed the dinar to appreciate gradually to bring down core inflation to near single digit
levels. Once inflation was brought under control, the CBI returned to its earlier policy of
maintaining a stable dinar, as it had been specified in the last SBA. The CBI also intends to
keep the policy interest rate positive in real terms (as measured by core inflation).
32.
The lack of data and large structural changes in the Iraqi economy preclude any
meaningful estimation of the equilibrium real exchange rate. A very crude assessment
suggests that the dinar is broadly in line with fundamentals.4 With the drop in oil prices, it
appears that a possible prior undervaluation has disappeared, and that the dinar could even be
somewhat overvalued. The relative low levels of headline and core inflation, however, do not
suggest any significant deviation from the equilibrium real effective exchange rate.
Moreover, as oil revenues are expected to rise substantially over the medium- to longer term,
the equilibrium real exchange rate is likely to rise as well. More importantly, a nominal
depreciation could undermine confidence in the dinar, destabilize expectations, lead to
increased dollarization, and reignite inflation, reversing the hard-won gains made in recent
years. The CBI therefore intends to continue to keep the exchange rate stable, but will
consult with staff if its reserves were to fall significantly below the program targets.

4

Rough estimates based on the external sustainability approach aimed at determining the current account
balance that would stabilize the country’s net foreign asset position relative to GDP suggest that the real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with the equilibrium real exchange rate. The current account norm for
2014 was estimated at a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP. Under current projections, the current account surplus is
expected to be only marginally lower than the norm in 2014.

20
33.
The authorities are committed to a liberal exchange regime and to removing all
restrictions under Fund jurisdiction. Iraq has a generally unrestricted current account
regime and a significantly liberalized capital account. However, four measures have been
identified to give rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval. Three relate to a
requirement to pay all obligations and debts to the government before relevant payments are
transferred abroad, and one to an inoperative bilateral payments agreement with Jordan. The
authorities are considering measures to remove the identified restrictions, with a view to
accepting Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, but it may take time to resolve
the last restriction because of the pending resolution of Iraq’s debts to Jordan.
F. Financial Sector Reforms
34.
Financial sector development will be important for facilitating private sector
activities. The level of financial intermediation in Iraq remains very low because the banking
system is still weak. Broad money was equivalent to 35 percent of GDP at end-2008, while
credit to the economy was only 4 percent of GDP. The banking system is dominated by two
state-owned banks, Rafidain and Rasheed, which account for 90 percent of total assets.
Besides four other small state-owned banks, there are 23 small private banks that service
only a small number of trusted clients. Capital markets, besides government securities, are
almost nonexistent.
35.
The authorities adopted a banking sector reform program in early 2009. This
program was developed with the support of the World Bank, in coordination with other
providers of technical assistance, including the Fund. A key element of the reform program is
the operational and financial restructuring of the two largest banks, Rafidain and Rasheed
(MEFP ¶22). Operational and financial audits of these two banks were completed by an
independent auditor in 2008. Their operational restructuring envisages a new organizational
structure, including the establishment of business units (retail, corporate and investment
banking); risk management units; and governance, control and support units. The financial
restructuring will first involve cleaning up the banks’ balance sheets and removing the legacy
of bad debts and suspense accounts and working out the fiscal implications. During a second
phase, the banks’ capital will be brought up to the required levels.
36.
The CBI is further developing its institutional capacity. The CBI’s reserve
management practices are being brought in line with the reserve management guidelines
adopted in mid-2008, but further training and better reporting are still required (MEFP ¶25).
The CBI also completed the set of prudential regulations for commercial banks, and work on
the relevant reporting tables for banks is expected to be finalized soon. A full assessment of
the banking supervision department at the CBI that is currently underway with foreign
assistance should provide a roadmap for further improvement (MEFP ¶23). The accounting

21
and reporting framework, and the internal audit function of the CBI, will also be
strengthened as a control committee appointed by the CBI is developing control procedures
and manuals with the assistance of external advisors (MEFP ¶24). To make sure that these
reforms move forward at the same time, the CBI is seeking resident advisors with
international experience in a broad range of areas such as IT, banking supervision, and
reserve management. Finally, commercial banks have been instructed to conform their
accounting norms to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and to prepare a set
of financial soundness indicators that could be used by the CBI to monitor sectoral
developments (MEFP ¶23).
G. Statistics
37.
The authorities have continued to improve Iraq’s statistical database, but
further efforts are needed. Monetary and balance of payments data are now being
published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics regularly, annual national accounts
data have been compiled up to 2007, and the quality of the national accounts has improved in
the last year. In addition, a new CPI using the latest household expenditure survey is being
rolled out. The authorities have begun participating in the GDDS as of December 15, 2009, a
major step forward in the development of Iraq’s statistical system. Comprehensive
information on Iraq’s statistical production and dissemination practices now appears on the
IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. While the coverage of fiscal statistics has
improved, the information is still subject to considerable delays.
IV. PROGRAM MODALITIES
A. Program Access, Duration, Phasing, and Monitoring
38.
Proposed access under the new SBA is 200 percent of quota (SDR 2,376.8 million
or $3.7 billion). As noted above, this would cover part of the financing gap estimated at
about $5 billion in 2010–11. The World Bank is expected to provide a total of $0.5 billion in
two tranches in 2010, while bilateral donors are expected to provide some small amounts in
2011. The new program’s proposed duration of two years would cover the period for which
financing gaps are projected. The program would also allow the authorities to make
significant headway in implementing the structural reform agenda, given capacity and
security constraints.
39.
The bulk of the financing needs, if they materialize, would arise in 2010. While
the first disbursement upon Board approval would be equal to 25 percent of quota, larger
disbursements would follow the completion of the first and second program reviews
(40 percent and 90 percent of quota, respectively) if there is a financing need. With this, and
the Bank’s disbursement of $0.5 billion, the first year of the program would be fully
financed. The remaining amount equivalent to 45 percent of quota would be disbursed in
2011.

22
40.
The program will be subject to two reviews each year, with end-March 2010
being the first test-date. Performance criteria have been set for: (i) the central government
budget balance; (ii) central government current spending; (iii) the DFI balance (floor);
(iv) direct fuel subsidies (a zero ceiling); (v) new nonconcessional external debt; (vi) external
arrears (a zero ceiling on new and rescheduled debt); (vii) the CBI’s net international
reserves; and (viii) the CBI’s net domestic assets.
41.
The structural conditionality reflects the program’s strong emphasis on
improving the management of public resources, bank restructuring, and program
safeguards. The rationale behind the benchmarks in the areas of public financial
management and oil sector transparency stems from the need to improve the allocation,
execution, transparency, and accountability in the mobilization and use of public resources,
including Iraq’s natural resources. The financial restructuring of the two state-owned banks
is crucial to allow these banks to become viable institutions. Benchmarks related to the CBI
and its relationship with the Ministry of Finance are essential to strengthen safeguards over
Fund resources (see below).
B. Risks, Safeguards, and Capacity to Repay the Fund
42.
The provision of Fund resources directly to the Iraqi budget involves
considerable risks. A first risk relates to the capacity to repay the Fund. The security
situation could deteriorate, in which case oil production could be adversely affected. Also,
the proposed partnerships with foreign companies could hit obstacles before implementation
and oil production may not increase as projected. A second risk is posed by fiscal
governance, given the many weaknesses still present in Iraq’s public financial management
system. A third risk is the possibility of policy slippages, particularly with regard to
containing current government spending.
43.
Iraq’s capacity to repay the Fund looks adequate. Foreign exchange earnings from
oil exports are expected to increase substantially over the medium and long term as existing
fields are rehabilitated and new fields come into production, provided that security improves.
Even taking into account possible delays, this is expected to put the government finances on
a sustainable footing. Moreover, the CBI’s reserve position is expected to remain relatively
strong over the medium term, and the program includes a floor under the government’s
balance in the DFI. At the same time, Iraq’s external debt outlook has improved substantially
with the final round of debt relief granted by Paris Club creditors last year, and the
authorities are seeking to reach agreements with remaining non-Paris Club creditors. Several
key creditors (China, United Arab Emirates) have already indicated their willingness to

23
reschedule on comparable (or better) terms, but the agreements have yet to be finalized. Once
agreements with non-Paris Club creditors are secured, Iraq’s external debt would reach a
sustainable level.
44.
In addition to the heavy emphasis on strengthening public financial
management, which would help mitigate fiduciary risks, the program includes a
number of measures to strengthen safeguards over Fund resources. While the obligation
to repay the Fund is with the member, the Ministry of Finance and the CBI have agreed on a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) clarifying responsibilities (a prior action under the
program). Specifically, under the MOU Fund resources for budget support will be disbursed
into a treasury account with the CBI. Further, the Ministry of Finance would assume
responsibility for servicing the debt to the Fund and ensuring that sufficient funds are
available in its accounts with the CBI to meet these obligations.
45.
An update safeguards assessment of the CBI is underway. The assessment will
also focus on the procedures governing the government’s treasury accounts with the CBI. An
internationally reputable external auditor has already completed a special audit of the CBI’s
international reserves as of June 30, 2009 (a prior action under the program). The external
auditor is expected to complete the full audit of the 2008 CBI accounts in the coming weeks,
which will be a key input for the update safeguards assessment. An external auditor will also
be appointed shortly to conduct the audit of the 2009 CBI accounts (another prior action). To
better safeguard the Fund going forward, the scope of the special audits will be expanded to
cover, for all program test dates, CBI data reported to the Fund and the procedures in place
over the government accounts at the CBI.
46.
The risk of policy slippages is mitigated by the authorities’ commitment to the
program. As noted, the authorities view the program as providing an essential framework
to help maintain discipline during a period of large uncertainties. In addition, the recent
approval by parliament of a 2010 government budget consistent with the program’s
objectives provides further assurances that macroeconomic policies will be kept on track.
47.
Another risk relates to the limited administrative capacity of the government
and the central bank. While the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the
CBI has been strengthened in recent years, further improvements are needed. Companion
technical assistance projects to help build capacity will continue over the coming years, with
support from several organizations. In this context, given that the resources remaining in the
Fund’s technical assistance subaccount for Iraq are nearly depleted, staff will prepare a
request for additional resources to ensure that Iraq’s large technical assistance needs continue
to be met.

24
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Iraq has continued to make progress in rebuilding its economy and achieving
macroeconomic stability under very difficult security and political circumstances.
During the last Fund-supported program, inflation was successfully brought down into single
digits, the international reserves position was further strengthened, and the CBI’s
institutional capacity was strengthened. Moreover, with the reduction in violence, the
prospects for an increase in oil production and non-oil activity have improved.
49.
Nevertheless, Iraq still faces major challenges, which were exacerbated by the
fall in oil prices in 2009. With both the balance of payments and the government budget
heavily dependent on oil revenues, the lower oil receipts have created balance of payments
and fiscal gaps, which so far the authorities have been able to cover through the financial
buffers built up in previous years. As oil prices and production are projected to increase,
these financing gaps are expected to be temporary.
50.
The authorities’ economic program for 2010–11 is well focused on maintaining
macroeconomic stability and advancing the unfinished reform agenda. The program will
provide an anchor for economic policy during a period of economic and political
uncertainties. Also, it will ensure that no time will be lost during the period of political
transition after the elections in improving infrastructure and public service delivery and
implementing critical reforms to strengthen fiscal governance, enhance oil sector
transparency, and develop a financial sector capable of providing essential services.
51.
The program is based on conservative oil price assumptions, which have been
incorporated in the budget. This is appropriate taking into account that over the last two
years oil prices have been very volatile and that projections are subject to a high degree of
uncertainty. Oil export volumes, however, may be affected by technical or security problems.
52.
At the same time, staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to treat the new SBA
as precautionary if oil prices continue to rise or the investment budget is significantly
underexecuted. Oil prices have been increasing in recent months and may turn out to be
higher than projected during the program period, which may eventually eliminate Iraq’s
balance of payments need. Similarly, capacity constraints may continue to limit investment
spending. In the same vein, staff supports the authorities’ commitment to adjust spending and
seek additional financing should oil prices turn out lower than envisaged.
53.
The authorities will need to firmly contain current spending, in particular the
government wage bill, and streamline transfers. This would enable the government to
increase investment and improve public service delivery, which are critical to ensure social
and economic stability. As oil revenues increase, however, the authorities should also seek to
rebuild their financial buffers. In addition, they should continue to base their medium-term
budget framework on conservative oil revenue assumptions and press forward with reforms

25
to broaden the revenue base by introducing a general sales tax, which would make the budget
less dependent on oil revenues.
54.
The use of Fund resources to finance the budget deficit (if necessary) would be
warranted in light of Iraq’s particular circumstances. Given the fiscal dominance and the
very close linkages between the balance of payments and the government budget, using Fund
resources to finance the deficit would directly address the country’s balance of payments
needs. At the same time, given the constraints on other sources of external and domestic
financing, the additional fiscal space offered by the use of Fund resources would allow the
government to avoid a contraction at a time when rehabilitation needs are still large and
unemployment is high. It would also allow the authorities to preserve CBI independence and
avoid central bank financing of the government.
55.
Staff supports the CBI’s intention to continue to manage the exchange rate with
a view to keeping inflation under control. Although difficult to assess, the exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, taking into account the expected increase in
oil production. Moreover, a strong and stable currency provides a solid anchor for the
public’s expectations. The CBI should continue to keep a close watch on inflation and be
ready to raise the policy interest rate if core inflation were to pick up again.
56.
The authorities should continue with their efforts to conclude debt agreements
with the remaining official and private creditors. Several non-Paris Club creditors have
already indicated their willingness to provide relief on terms comparable to (or better than)
those provided by the Paris Club, and the authorities should seek similar treatment from the
remaining non-Paris Club creditors. In this regard, staff believes that Iraq is making best
efforts to reach bilateral agreements on its arrears to official non-Paris Club creditors, and
that the authorities have been negotiating in good faith to resolve the remaining arrears to
private creditors, consistent with the Fund’s policy of lending into arrears.
57.
Staff also urges the authorities to move forward with their plans to liberalize the
exchange regime by removing the exchange restrictions that fall under Fund
jurisdiction. Specifically, the authorities are encouraged to establish a timetable to remove
these restrictions promptly, and to subsequently accept the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4.
58.
There is a need to further improve the accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of
macroeconomic statistics. Efforts are needed in all areas, and coverage, in particular, should
be extended to the Kurdish region.

26
59.
Despite the large risks and uncertainties, staff supports the authorities’ request
for a two-year SBA in the amount of SDR 2,376.8 million. Risks and uncertainties cover
a broad range, from an increase in violence that would hamper Iraq’s development to
constraints in administrative capacity and volatility in oil prices. The new Fund-supported
program would provide a sound macroeconomic framework during the political transition
and, together with a parallel operation of the World Bank, would advance the authorities’
agenda to rebuild and improve economic institutions, thus helping to mitigate some of these
risks. Moreover, the authorities have demonstrated their commitment to implement sound
macroeconomic policies and difficult structural reforms, and Iraq’s capacity to repay the
Fund looks adequate.
60.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held according to the provisions
applying to countries with Fund arrangements.

1/ 2008 includes expenditures of 11.4 percent of GDP (ID 12.4 trillion) that are outstanding as advances and letters of credit and
that have been reclassified mostly as investment spending.
2/ Assumes a debt reduction in 2010 by non-Paris Club official creditors, comparable to the Paris Club agreement.
3/ Reserve money growth in 2007 reflects the impact of an increase in the required reserves ratio on government deposits
from 25 percent to 75 percent in September 2007.
4/ 2009 as of December 31.
5/ For comparability, the overall balance in the EBS/08/140 column reflects the new presentation in which the DFI flows have
been reclassified as a financing item below the line.

4/ Includes security spending associated with the implementation of reconstruction projects.
5/ 2008 data excludes an amount of ID636 billion included in the Supplementary Budget to settle arrears of the electricity sector to the
state-owned oil companies; this cross-settlement is expected to have no net impact on the budget.
6/ 2009 data includes expenditures made in 2009 but allocated in the 2010 budget.
It also includes ID287 bn on transfers to the Kurdish area linked to increase of the unified general budget.
7/ Calculated as 5 percent of oil exports as per U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 to finance war reparations to Kuwait.
8/ LCs in the Trade Bank of Iraq, full down-payment is customarily required. 2008 LCs and advances to suppliers were re-classified.
9/ Includes the $1.7bn under the new IMF SDR allocation and $1.2tr in soft loans from oil companies obtaining licenses for 2010.

ATTACHMENT I. IRAQ: LETTER OF INTENT
February 8, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
In the past few years, despite a very difficult security situation, Iraq’s economic performance
strengthened considerably owing to improved macroeconomic management and a favorable
external environment that lasted until mid-2008. These improvements also reflected the
assistance we received from the international community, including from external creditors
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Growth accelerated, inflation was reduced to
single digits, and fiscal and external sustainability improved substantially. Since 2004, we
have successfully completed three economic programs supported by the IMF, with our last
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) ending in March 2009.
Already at the time of the last SBA review it became evident that the external environment
was deteriorating rapidly due to the sharp drop in international oil prices and the onset of a
slowdown in the global economy. As the proceeds from oil exports account for the bulk of
Iraq’s export receipts and government revenue, the decline in oil prices has posed
considerable challenges to our internal and external stability. During 2009, we have been
able to absorb much of the adverse impact of these external shocks by using the financial
buffers we built up in recent years. However, unless oil prices increase markedly, we would
be forced to constrain government spending in 2010 and 2011, at a time when our
developmental and security-related needs remain high. A fiscal contraction would hurt the
economy and undermine our hard-won macroeconomic stability, and could also contribute to
a deterioration of the security situation.
To address these challenges, we have developed the attached economic program for 2010–
2011. Our program aims to manage the effects on the Iraqi economy of the lower oil prices
and the slowdown in global economic activity. The program focuses on keeping inflation
low, increasing growth by boosting oil production, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. While
our main focus is on macroeconomic policies, we are also accelerating the pace of structural
reforms, especially to improve public financial management and develop the financial sector.
To support our efforts, and based on the economic program and the specific targets set out in
Tables 1 and 2 attached to this letter, we request a 2-year Stand-By Arrangement from the

37
IMF in the amount of SDR 2,376.8 million (approximately $3.8 billion), equivalent to
200 percent of Iraq’s quota, to help cover our balance of payments needs.
Given the large uncertainties and the high volatility of international oil prices, our
projections and the government’s budget for 2010 are conservatively based on an average
price of $62.5 per barrel for Iraqi oil. In the event that our oil export revenues turn out to be
higher than projected, we plan to save half of the additional revenues to rebuild our financial
buffers, while using the other half to finance additional investment to improve the delivery of
basic public services. Moreover, if by the time of the first or second program review futures
markets indicate that we will be able to obtain, on average, an oil price equal to or higher
than $73 per barrel for our exports in 2010, we intend to treat the SBA as precautionary,
given that we would no longer expect to have a financing need, provided that our oil export
volume (projected at 2.1 million barrels per day) is sustained (this issue will be examined in
detail at the time of each program review discussion). Vice versa, should oil export receipts
fall below our assumptions, we will reduce spending by half of the revenue shortfall and
cover the remaining gap by further using our financial buffers and seeking additional
external support, including from the IMF. If the revenue shortfall turns out to be sizable, or if
the reserve position of the CBI weakens below program targets in between test dates, we will
consult on the policy response with IMF staff.
In the same vein, we intend to treat the SBA as precautionary if it is expected that the 2010
investment budget will not be fully executed. Disbursements of capital spending in 2009 fell
short of budgeted amounts, due in part to severe disruptions of administrative capacity as a
result of the bombings of the Ministry of Finance in August and December. Investment
remains a key priority, however, as underscored also by the Council of Representatives’
provision of additional investment spending at the time of approval of the 2010 budget. The
2010 capital budget would imply a large increase over last year’s estimated investment
outturn. In order to ensure that the disruptions of administrative capacity do not lead to poor
quality implementation, we are working hard to rebuild and expand capacity, including by
restoring information systems and strengthening project approval processes. With these
efforts, we will aim to execute the full envelope for the year. If capacity issues cannot be
fully addressed, however, investment could again fall short of budgeted amounts. Therefore,
at the time of the second review we will reach understandings with IMF staff on the expected
rate of execution of the 2010 investment budget. If the rate of execution is expected to be less
than 93 percent, we intend to treat the SBA also as precautionary.
We understand that the requested SBA will be subject to semi-annual reviews, semi-annual
performance criteria, and structural benchmarks, as set out in the attached Tables 1 and 2,
and described in more detail in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(TMU). In this regard, we understand that the completion of the first review under the
SBA—expected to take place on or after May 31, 2010—will require observance of the
quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2010 specified in Table 1, and that

38
completion of the second review—expected to take place on or after August 31, 2010—will
require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2010.
We believe that the policies set forth in our economic program are adequate to achieve our
objectives but are prepared to take additional measures if necessary. We will consult with the
IMF on the adoption of these measures and in advance of any revision to the policies
contained in our economic program, in accordance with IMF policies on such consultation.
The Iraqi government and the Central Bank of Iraq will continue to provide the IMF with the
necessary information for assessing progress in implementing our program, as specified in
the attached TMU, and will maintain a close policy dialogue with IMF staff. We authorize
the IMF to publish the Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the related staff report,
on the IMF’s website following consideration of our request by the IMF’s Executive Board.
Sincerely yours,

//s//
Mr. Baqir S. Jabr Al-Zubaydi
Minister of Finance of Iraq

ATTACHMENT II. IRAQ: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
FOR 2010–11
February 8, 2010
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since 2004, Iraq has successfully completed three economic reform programs
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF): one under the Emergency Post Conflict
Assistance (EPCA) facility and two (precautionary) Stand-By Arrangements (SBA). During
this period, we have made considerable progress under very difficult circumstances,
including a very challenging security situation. We have successfully reduced inflation,
showed fiscal discipline, and started rebuilding our economic institutions. These
achievements have helped us to obtain generous debt relief from Paris Club and other
creditors that has substantially improved our external position.
2.
These hard-won gains of recent years could be undermined, however, by the large
drop in oil prices from their peak levels of mid-2008. After reaching a high in July 2008,
when Iraqi crude oil sold for $124 per barrel, prices fell to a low of $35 per barrel in January
2009, before slowly recovering to a level of around $68 per barrel in the second half of 2009.
The average export price in 2009 was $57 per barrel, well below the average export price of
$92 per barrel in 2008. In addition, due to dire infrastructural problems, the volume of oil
exports in the early months of the year fell below 2008 levels (to 1.75 million barrels per day
(mbpd) in the first five months). We have been working to address these problems and oil
exports reached 2 mbpd towards the end of 2009, bringing the average for the year to
1.88 mbpd.
3.
As the proceeds from oil exports account for the bulk of our total export receipts,
and for the majority of government revenues, the lower oil prices are posing considerable
challenges to our internal and external economic stability. To maintain macroeconomic
stability, and foster growth and employment, we have adopted an economic adjustment
program for 2010–11 for which we seek support from the IMF under a new 2-year SBA,
as well as financial assistance from other international institutions and countries. This
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes our economic
objectives and policies, including the structural reforms, for this period.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Due to the temporary drop in oil production, real GDP growth is estimated to have
slowed to 4 percent in 2009, from almost 10 percent in 2008. There are indications, however,
that the improved security situation has supported economic activity in the non-oil sector.
The Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT) estimates that

40
real non-oil GDP grew by about 5½ percent in 2008 and that the pace of non-oil growth
remained broadly unchanged in 2009.
5.
The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has been successful in keeping inflation under
control, by managing the exchange rate and by keeping the policy interest rate positive in
real terms. When inflationary pressures emerged in 2008, the CBI stepped up the rate of
appreciation of the dinar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (to about ½ percent per month until late
2008), which also helped counter dollarization. As a result, headline inflation fell to
6.8 percent by end-2008. Inflation remained well below the target of 6 percent in 2009, with
prices falling by 4½ percent, mainly because of a further decline in fuel prices. Food price
inflation has picked up more recently, however, and core inflation (excluding fuel and
transportation) ended 2009 a 6 percent, down from 12 percent at end-2008.
6.
With headline and core inflation low, the exchange rate has been stable since the
beginning of 2009. The policy interest rate has been reduced gradually to 7 percent. Net
international reserves increased to $50.2 billion at end-2008, but have fallen to $44 billion
at end-2009, reflecting the drawdown of the government’s deposits with the CBI.
7.
The government budget recorded a modest surplus in 2008 (almost 2 percent of
GDP). Higher-than-expected oil revenues enabled us to increase spending. Particularly, and
due also to our efforts to improve the execution of the investment budget, we were able to
substantially increase capital expenditures in 2008, compared to the previous year.
8.
With the drop in oil prices, the external current account is estimated to have moved
into a large deficit in 2009, of over 20 percent of GDP. And as oil revenues account for the
bulk of government revenues, the government budget is also estimated to have shifted into a
large deficit, of over 20 percent of GDP in 2009. The 2009 budget, which was adopted at a
time when sharply lower oil revenues were expected, was designed to support as much as
possible our investment program and the required security outlays, while containing current
spending. The bombings of the Ministry of Finance in August and December of 2009,
however, affected our capacity to fully execute our investment plans. Despite this, the 2009
budget deficit, based on preliminary financing data, is estimated to have recorded a deficit of
over ID 17 trillion. This deficit was covered mainly by drawing down the balances the
government had built up in the CBI and by mobilizing domestic resources through the
issuance of Treasury bills.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES IN 2010-11
9.
The global financial and economic crisis has worsened Iraq’s external outlook
significantly. The drop in oil export revenues, in particular, presents a major challenge in
view of the country’s vast reconstruction and rehabilitation spending needs. Under these
circumstances, we are determined to strengthen fiscal discipline to better ensure that the
reduced public resources are used more efficiently and that fiscal sustainability is preserved.

41
We have adopted a budget for 2010 that aims to further reduce non-priority current outlays
and align the investment budget with our national priorities and implementation capacity. We
seek to reduce the government’s budget deficits during 2010 and 2011, with a view to
returning to a budget surplus in 2012. In addition, we aim to maintain a financial buffer in
our accounts equivalent to three months of government wages. Appropriate management of
the exchange rate and an interest rate policy aimed at keeping the policy interest rate positive
in real terms will continue to be the main instruments to keeping inflation under control. We
will also continue to advance our structural reform agenda, with a particular emphasis on
public financial management and financial sector reforms.
10.
By continuing to pursue sound economic policies and intensifying our efforts to boost
oil production, we aim to accelerate the pace of economic growth. We seek to increase
average crude oil production and exports to 3.1 mbpd and 2.5 mbpd, respectively, by 2012.
As a result, we expect real GDP growth to increase to almost 7 percent in 2010 and to 7½8 percent in 2011 and 2012. We will also strive to keep inflation at around 5–6 percent in the
coming years.
11.
As oil prices and production are expected to rise in the medium term, the current
account deficit would narrow markedly in the coming years. Since the decline in oil revenues
is expected to be temporary until oil production reaches higher levels, we intend to secure
adequate financing to avoid a major economic contraction. The international reserves held in
the CBI and the DFI (excluding the FMS subaccount) are expected to fall from $55 billion at
end-2009 to $46 billion by end-2010 and to broadly remain at that level in 2011 and 2012,
before increasing in the following years.
A. Fiscal Policy and Reform
The 2010 Budget
12.
The 2010 budget aims to contain current spending to limit the deficit and create room
for higher investment outlays. In this regard, we will contain the government’s wage bill by
refraining from granting new wage increases following the large catch-up in salaries in 2008,
which carried over into 2009. In addition, net hiring of non-security personnel in 2010 will
be limited to new teachers and doctors, until the civil service census is completed. To limit
spending related to the in-kind Public Distribution System (PDS), we have initiated reforms
that seek to target the benefits of the program to the poorest Iraqis. In addition, we have
decided to reduce the number and volume of goods distributed under the PDS system. At the
same time, we plan to expand the new targeted cash transfer system. Generalized transfers, in
particular to state-owned enterprises, will be sharply reduced, reflecting the improved
financial position of many of these enterprises. As a result of these measures, current
spending will be curtailed at ID 62.9 trillion (in the IMF’s presentation). By doing so, we
have been able to increase the capital budget to ID 25.8 trillion, with an increased focus on

42
electricity, water and sanitation, health, and agriculture. The overall deficit will be limited to
ID 17.9 trillion (19 percent of GDP) in 2010 (in the IMF’s presentation).
13.
As our financing needs in 2010 will still be substantial, we will step up our efforts to
mobilize domestic financing through the Treasury bill market. To that end, we will conduct
regular auctions, and refrain from cancellations, while allowing interest rates to be
determined by the market. This will have additional benefits by determining a benchmark
interest rate, while the development of a secondary market for treasury bills will allow banks
to improve their liquidity management. Also, to ensure integrity in our payment and budget
systems, we will refrain from accumulating domestic expenditure arrears.
Public Financial Management Reforms
14.
Over the next two years, we intend to transform and modernize our public financial
management (PFM) system. Late last year, in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank,
we adopted a three-year action plan that identified priority measures in the areas of budget
preparation, execution and reporting; cash management; public procurement; and the
accounting framework. Specifically:


To improve budget preparation, we will clearly define priorities, set ceilings in the
budget circular for current and investment spending in line with a sustainable
medium-term budget strategy, and develop overall sector strategies;



To strengthen reporting and cash management, we will require spending units to
submit reports on all spending including investment, advances, and letters of credit no
later than two months after the end of each month, and to reconcile these amounts
with the cash balances at the beginning and end of the reporting period. Cash releases
will be approved only after the Ministry of Finance has reviewed the report from
three months before. This will reduce the idle balances in spending units’ accounts to
the minimum required to ensure the continuity of government operations. Moreover,
by end-March 2010 we will review all accounts in the banking system that are
classified as central government accounts and reconcile them with Treasury records,
and will return any idle balances received from the budget to the central Treasury.



With regard to advances, we will review the outstanding stock of advances to identify
those that are recoverable and set a time schedule for their recovery and for writing
off irrecoverable advances based on appropriate authorization at a high level. We will
prepare a detailed report to document the results of the review. The basis on which
debts have been classified as recoverable or irrecoverable, and actions taken to
recover doubtful amounts before recommending that they be written-off will be
clearly specified.

43


To strengthen internal audit and control systems, we will reexamine our internal
policies and procedures at the Ministry of Finance, as well as the accounting systems,
processes and internal controls used by the accounting department; and review the
internal controls of the largest spending units' operating systems. To strengthen the
quality of our investment agenda and accelerate the reconstruction of Iraq’s
infrastructure, we will ask the Board Supreme Audit (BSA) to review the largest
investment projects financed with 2008 budget allocations. This audit report will
evaluate (i) the criteria for approving capital investment projects: whether a costbenefit analysis was carried out; (ii) the procurement process: whether it conformed
to international standards of transparency and competitiveness; and (iii) the project
management process: whether the projects were delivered on time and within budget.
The report will provide recommendations that could be used in the following
budgeting process to enhance the agenda on public investment.



We will also undertake an assessment of the functionality of the Iraq Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) developed with the assistance of USAID,
and make the changes required to ensure that this system is fully operational (with the
inclusion of a commitment control system and the ability to produce regular
comprehensive reports in line with best practices) in 2011.



We will continue to submit to the BSA and to the Council of Representatives the final
accounts for each fiscal year no later than September 30 of the following year. The
BSA has already completed the audit of the final accounts of the federal budget for
2005-06, and it is reviewing the 2007 and 2008 accounts.

15.
To avoid the obstacles we encountered last year in data collection for the census of
public service employees, we have narrowed the coverage to include all central government
employees that work outside of security related areas. We will make all efforts to have the
census completed by September 30, 2010. After completion of the census, we will move
swiftly to eliminate ghost workers and adopt an action plan aimed at developing a
computerized human resource database and a computerized payroll system, as a first step
toward comprehensive civil service reform. In parallel, the BSA has begun a project to verify
the personnel records in the line ministries in order to clean up the existing payroll.
Tax Reforms
16.
We have made some progress in developing a medium-term tax reform strategy
with the objective of streamlining the tax system, broadening and diversifying the tax base,
and increasing revenue collection. As a first step, in 2008 we introduced a mobile phone tax.
Looking ahead, we plan to introduce a sales tax in the coming years as a precursor for a
value-added tax, and are also considering to reduce the number of income tax brackets. We
will seek technical assistance from the IMF and other international partners to support our

44
tax reform efforts. We will urge the Council of Representatives to adopt the new customs law
that will establish a transparent and efficient tariff system with fewer exemptions.
Oil Sector Reforms
17.
We will ensure that no direct subsidy is placed on any fuel products in Iraq.
Moreover, to continue reducing the size of indirect subsidies to fuel products and counter
smuggling, we intend to increase official fuel prices as needed especially if the world prices
of fuel products continue to rise. To eliminate hidden subsidies, we will ensure that all
ministries, governmental agencies, and public enterprises will pay domestic market prices for
fuel purchases starting in 2011. We will also work on developing a periodic adjustment
mechanism for fuel prices, with technical assistance from the IMF.
18.
We want to ensure that the oil sector is fully transparent, to strengthen accountability
of how this important natural resource is used. To that end, we intend to maintain a single
account for oil export proceeds and will continue to adhere to the strict transparency and
accountability rules that currently govern the DFI. The accounts will continue to be subject
to an independent external audit, and to the oversight of the Committee of Financial Experts
(COFE). If it were no longer possible to maintain the DFI, we will establish another single
account for oil export proceeds governed by similar principles.
19.
We will complete the process of becoming a candidate for membership in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by March 31, 2010. In addition to
regular publication of our production, refining, and export data, we have appointed a senior
government official, the Inspector General of the Ministry of Oil, to take the lead on EITI
implementation. The next steps will be to convene a stakeholders’ meeting (government,
private sector and civil society) and put together a fully costed plan including measurable
targets, a timetable for implementation, and an assessment of capacity constraints.
20.
To promote transparency and good governance in the oil sector, we plan to complete
the metering project in the next years. The metering system for the Al-Basra oil export
terminal has already been installed. Moreover, the second phase of the installation of
metering systems for the northern pipeline and the Khor Al-Amyah export terminal has
started, and will be completed by early 2010. Also, in addition to a computerized tracking
system for oil transports by road and rail that is already up and running, a comprehensive
domestic custody-transfer metering system is being installed and will be completed by
December 31, 2010. These mechanisms would enable a full review of the domestic oil sector
allowing the flows of oil and oil products to be fully reconciled with the financial flows
between the state-owned oil companies and the budget by mid-2011. In this connection, we
also plan to conduct a streamlined Public Expenditure Review of the oil ministry, together
with the ministries of health, education, and public works, with the assistance of the World
Bank.

45
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies and Financial Sector Reform
21.
The CBI will continue to be independent in the pursuit of its policy objectives. The
CBI’s monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to be aimed at keeping inflation
under control and safeguarding international reserves. The subdued inflationary pressures
thus far in 2009 have helped to maintain the nominal exchange rate stable since the
beginning of the year and to reduce the policy interest rate to 7 percent. The policy interest
rate will be kept positive in real terms (measured against core inflation) to signal the CBI’s
firm commitment to maintain a low rate of inflation. We are accelerating plans to roll out a
new CPI based on more recent household expenditure data, which will help us better monitor
underlying inflationary dynamics.
22.
The banking sector is in urgent need of reform to foster financial intermediation and
enable banks to contribute to the development of a strong private sector. With the help of the
World Bank and other international agencies, we have developed a banking sector reform
strategy. The first important step will be to finalize the restructuring of Rafidain and Rasheed
banks, based on their completed financial and operational audits. In this regard, the foreign
liabilities incurred by Rafidain and Rasheed on behalf of the previous regime and the large
suspense accounts will need be removed from these banks’ balance sheets. We aim to
complete the restructuring of the balance sheets of Rafidain and Rasheed by June 30, 2010.
Once their balance sheets are cleaned up and restructured, based on the decision already
made by the Economic Committee, the capital of Rafidain and Rasheed will be raised to
ID500 billion and ID400 billion, respectively. We are also strengthening their internal audit
capacity, developing legal arrangements within the banks, and working towards providing
missing data identified in the audit reports. The BSA has also completed the financial and
operational audits for the three specialized state-owned banks and has proposed an individual
strategy for each bank that was discussed by the Restructuring Oversight Committee (ROC).
The three banks have set up a restructuring committee which includes BSA members to
implement the recommendations from the proposed strategy.
23.
We have already completed the set of prudential regulations for commercial banks,
including those related to minimum capital requirements, liquidity risk, and anti-money
laundering, and will begin the implementation phase. Work on the relevant reporting tables
for the banks will be completed soon in consultation with the IMF and other technical
assistance providers. At the same time, we are stepping up our efforts to further
develop banking supervision practices in line with best international practices. In addition,
we have asked the commercial banks to conform their accounting norms to the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as per end-2009, and to prepare a set of financial
soundness indicators that could be used to monitor sectoral developments. Finally, to assess
the progress made so far, we are in the process of conducting a full assessment of the
banking supervision department.

46
24.
We have continued to strengthen the accounting and reporting framework of the CBI.
The CBI has appointed a control committee, which is responsible for developing control
procedures and manuals, and for establishing a modern internal audit function with the
assistance of external consultants. An internal audit committee including two external experts
has also been set up to make recommendations regarding external and internal audit
oversight, financial reporting, and controls. We have also reconciled almost all the
outstanding suspense accounts and CBI intra-branch accounts, and established a register of
outstanding off-balance sheet commitments (letters of credit and guarantees). As of July, the
CBI has completed the process of becoming IFRS compliant.
25.
We are committed to strengthening the management of international reserves by
moving ahead with the implementation of new reserves management guidelines that were
adopted in early August 2008. We will follow the guidelines to diversify currency
composition and establish appropriate duration and credit risk, build capacity for risk
analysis, and work towards establishing a dealing room. We will also provide by end-March
2010 more frequent reports to the CBI board based on the investment criteria established in
the guidelines.
26.
To improve the functioning of foreign exchange auctions, we plan to develop
organized exchange markets outside the central bank, including an interbank foreign
exchange market. Our aim is to establish a forward market in Iraqi dinars in the near future.
IV. PROGRAM SAFEGUARDS AND MONITORING, DEBT AND DATA ISSUES
27.
As we intend to use the domestic counterpart of IMF resources for budget support,
the CBI—which is the fiscal agent—will request the IMF to disburse the resources directly
into a government account at the CBI. To provide adequate safeguards to the Fund, the
following steps have been taken or will be implemented in the near future:


A Memorandum of Understanding has been agreed between the CBI and the



An external auditor has been appointed to undertake the audit of the CBI 2008
financial statements in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, and the
audit is expected to be completed by March 31, 2010. The external auditor has
already completed a verification of the CBI’s international reserves as of June 30,
2009. The completion of the external audit will allow the IMF to prepare a safeguards
assessment update by the time of the first review of the program. In the future, the
CBI will work with the Ministry of Finance to adopt a timely selection and rotation
policy for future audits; an auditor for the 2009 CBI financial statements will be
appointed before end-February 2010.

47


The external auditor will also undertake special audits of (i) CBI Net International
Reserves, and a full count of gold and foreign reserves held at the Central Bank, as
of June 30, 2009, (ii) CBI data reported to the Fund, including, but not limited to, Net
International Reserves, Net Domestic Assets, credit to government and a full count
of gold and foreign reserves held at the Central Bank, as of December 31, 2009,
December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and the other test dates during the SBA, and
(iii) procedures surrounding government accounts at the CBI.

28.
Progress has been made in moving toward accepting the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. We have worked with IMF staff
to complete the review of exchange laws and regulations and are considering measures to
remove the identified exchange restrictions on current international transactions. We remain
committed to avoid imposing any restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions or introducing any multiple currency practices.
29.
We will continue our efforts to resolve outstanding external claims under terms that
are consistent with the 2004 Paris Club agreement. Bilateral agreements with twelve nonParis Club official creditors have already been signed and are being implemented. We will
continue our best efforts to reach bilateral debt agreements with the remaining non-Paris
Club creditors. The United Arab Emirates has announced the full cancellation of Iraq’s debt,
and implementation of a bilateral agreement with Greece is awaiting the Greek parliament’s
approval. Debt reconciliation was completed with Morocco, Egypt, and China, and we hope
to sign the relevant debt agreements, particularly with China with which an agreement has
been initialed recently, in the near future. Regarding private creditors, most of the
commercial debt has been restructured, and is serviced as agreed. We also expect that the
proceeds of the liquidation of the London branch of Rafidain Bank will be distributed to
private claim holders by the end of the year.
30.
Efforts will continue to improve Iraq’s statistical database. Monetary and balance
of payments data are now being published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics
regularly, and annual national accounts data have been compiled up to 2007. We will focus
on improving the quality of these annual data developing quarterly national accounts data.
While the Socio-Economic Household Survey has been completed, the updating of the CPI
weights has been delayed for a number of reasons. A new national coordinator for the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) has been appointed. As of December 15, we
are participating in the GDDS and comprehensive information on Iraq’s statistical production
and dissemination practices now appears on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board.

31.
Performance under the program will be monitored through twice-yearly reviews, with
macroeconomic policy performance monitored through semi-annual quantitative
performance criteria (Table 1). Progress in structural reforms will be monitored through
benchmarks (Table 2).

ATTACHMENT III. IRAQ: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
February 8, 2010
1.
This memorandum describes the quantitative and structural performance criteria,
benchmarks, and indicators for the third Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). It also specifies the periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data
to the staff of the IMF for program monitoring purposes.
I.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATORS

2.

The quantitative performance criteria are the following:

(i)

a floor on net international reserves of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI);

(ii)

a ceiling on net domestic assets of the CBI;

(iii)

a ceiling on the central government fiscal deficit;

(iv)

a ceiling on the central government current spending bill;

(v)

a floor under the balance in the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI);

(vi)

a ceiling on direct government subsidies to the fuel sector;

(vii) a ceiling on contracting and guaranteeing of new medium- and long-term nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government and/or the
CBI; and
(viii) a ceiling on external payments arrears on any rescheduled and new debt of the central
government and/or the CBI.
II.

DEFINITIONS

3.
For purposes of monitoring under the program, a program exchange rate will be
used. This program exchange rate will be set at ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar. The program
exchange rate will be used to convert into Iraqi dinars the U.S. dollar value of all CBI foreign
assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars, as required. For CBI assets and liabilities
denominated in SDRs and in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar, they will be
converted in U.S. dollars at their respective SDR-exchange rates prevailing as of
December 31, 2009, as published on the IMF’s website.
4.
For the purpose of this program, the international or world oil price is understood
to be the Average Petroleum Sport Price (APSP) used in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook
(WEO), which is the simple average of UK Brent, Dubai Fateh, and West Texas Intermediate

53
spot prices reflecting world exports of light, medium, and heavy crude oil. The projected
international or world price for a particular year is the latest WEO price projection for that
year as released by the IMF’s Research Department to IMF staff. IMF staff will provide
these oil price projections to the Iraqi authorities. For purposes of assessing whether the SBA
will be treated as precautionary, the relevant projected international or world price will
be the average of APSP futures prices for the current year during the 30-day period prior to
the circulation to the IMF’s Executive Board of the documents for the respective review. In
turn, the projected Iraqi oil price for purposes of assessing whether the SBA will be treated
as precautionary will be calculated as the difference between the relevant projected
international or world price (as defined above) and the average differential between the
international price and the actual price at which Iraqi crude has been sold in the preceding
18-month period. IMF staff will make the APSP futures prices available to the Iraqi
authorities on a regular basis.
5.
For program purposes, central government is defined to include the central
administration, the Kurdish government, as well as agencies included under Section 6 (the
local boards, Iraqi media network, Iraqi national Olympic committee, Bait-Al-Hikma,
Ammant Baghdad, Municipality institutions, as well as the General directorates of sewerage
and water).
6.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as gross usable reserves minus
reserve-related liabilities of the CBI. Gross usable reserves of the CBI are claims of the CBI
on nonresidents that are controlled by the CBI, denominated in foreign convertible
currencies, and are immediately and unconditionally available to the CBI for meeting
balance of payments needs or for intervention in foreign exchange markets, and are not
earmarked by the CBI for meeting specific payments. They include CBI holdings of
monetary gold, SDRs, Iraq’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency cash, and deposits
abroad, except for the resources of the DFI but including the CBI DFI sub-account. Excluded
from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered;
claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in nonconvertible
currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign
currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options).
Reserve-related liabilities shall be defined as foreign currency denominated liabilities of the
CBI to residents and nonresidents with original maturity of one year or less, and all liabilities
to the Fund. They include: foreign currency reserves of commercial banks held at the CBI;
commitments to sell foreign currency arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to commercial banks,
suppliers, or official export credit agencies. Excluded from reserve liabilities are the
government's foreign currency deposits at the CBI. As of December 31, 2009, (net)
international reserves amounted to US$44.34 billion, all comprising of in reserve assets. The
program floors on the net international reserves of the CBI are reported in Table 1.

54
7.
Net domestic assets of the CBI include (i) net claims on the general government,
comprising of gross claims on the general government minus general government domestic
and foreign currency deposits at the CBI; (ii) gross claims on commercial banks;
(iii) monetary policy instruments, including dinar and foreign currency denominated term
deposits and CBI bills; and (iv) gross claims on non-bank, non-government entities. For the
purpose of this arrangement, net domestic assets of the CBI excludes other items net,
comprising of net fixed and other assets, minus revaluation accounts and capital and reserve
accounts. As of end-December 2009, net claims on the general government amounted to
ID 2,740 billion; gross claims on commercial banks stood at ID 4 billion; monetary policy
instruments amounted to ID -3,988 billion; and gross claims on non-bank, non-government
entities were nil, resulting in a stock of the CBI’s net domestic assets of ID -1,243 billion. As
of end-December 2009, OIN amounted to ID -1,040 billion. The program ceilings of the net
domestic assets of the CBI are reported in Table 1.
8.
The central government fiscal deficit will be calculated as the sum of domestic and
external financing of the central government balance, adjusted for any deviations in the
amounts of (i) donor financing for projects and (ii) “other financing” in excess of program
projections. Domestic financing includes any form of resident financing of the consolidated
budget from (i) the central bank; (ii) commercial banks; (iii) non-bank financial institutions;
(iv) nonfinancial enterprises; (v) privatization proceeds; (vi) changes in arrears;
(vii) households; and (viii) all other domestic financing not elsewhere classified. External
financing includes financing from (i) the Development Fund for Iraq, (ii) donor financing for
projects, (iii) other financing not elsewhere classified, net of (iv) the amortization of external
debt. The ceilings for end-March 2010, end-June 2010, and end-December 2010 will be
measured on a cumulative basis from January 1, 2010. The program ceilings of the central
government fiscal deficit are reported in Table 1.
9.
The central government current spending bill includes the wage and pension bill,
the in-kind transfers under the Public Distribution System (PDS), and transfers to stateowned enterprises (SOEs). The wage and pension bill includes all wage and pension
payments made by the central government, excluding wage payments made by the ministries
of defense and interior. Specifically, with reference to the 2009 budget classification, it
includes expenditures under Section 1 (except those for the ministries of defense and
interior) and Section 6, sub-section 1, items 2(1), 3(1, 3, 5, and 7), 4(1), 5(1), 7(1), 8(1), 9(1),
10(1), 11(1), 12(1), and 13(1). The Public Distribution System bill includes the spending
reported under Section 7, sub-section 2, item 1(1). The transfers to the SOEs bill covers
expenditures covered in Section 5, net items covered under subsection 2, items 1(1 to 6). The
ceilings on the government current spending bill for end-March 2010, end-June 2010, and
end-December 2010 will be measured on a cumulative basis from January 1, 2010. The
program ceilings of the central government current spending bill are reported in Table 1.

55
10.
The balance in the DFI consists of: (i) the main account held at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that consolidates all receipts from export sales of petroleum and
petroleum products; proceeds from frozen assets in foreign countries; balances related to
the United Nations Oil for Food Program; interest or other revenue accrued from income
investments (i.e., overnight deposits and repos, interests derived from the PCO, FMS and
TBI balances) and T-bills; returned Letters of Credit; and other deposits and revenue covered
under the UNCR 1483 (2003) resolution; and (ii) the balance in the PCO account. For
program purposes, the balance in the FMS account is excluded from the balance in the DFI.
The program floors on the balance in the DFI are reported in Table 1.
11.
Direct government subsidies to the fuel sector shall comprise of any financial
assistance rendered by the Ministry of Finance to fuel-related enterprises. The ceilings for
end-March 2010, end-June 2010, and end-December 2010 will be measured on a cumulative
basis from January 1, 2010. The program ceilings of the direct government subsidies to the
fuel sector are reported in Table 1.
12.
A continuous ceiling applies to the non-accumulation of external payments arrears
on rescheduled debt and new external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central
government and/or the CBI. External payment arrears consist of external debt service
obligations (principal and interest) falling due after December 31, 2009 and that have not
been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements. The program
ceilings of the external payments arrears are reported in Table 1.
13.
As set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000), the term “debt” will be
understood to mean a current liability (i.e., not contingent), created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by
the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits), and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which
the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are
provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception

56
of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement,
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will
not give rise to debt.
14.
For purposes of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the government or CBI or any other agency acting on behalf of the government
to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment by the recipient (involving payments in
cash or in kind), or indirectly through any other obligation of the government or CBI to cover
a shortfall incurred by the loan recipient.
15.
The limits on medium- and long-term external debt apply to the contracting or
guaranteeing by the government and/or the CBI of new, nonconcessional external debt with
an original maturity of more than one year. This limit applies not only to debt as defined in
point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt in Fund
Arrangements (Decision No. 6230-(79/140), August 3, 1979, as amended by Decision Nos.
11096-(95/100), October 25, 1995, and 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000), but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. External debt
will be considered to have been contracted at the point the loan agreement or guarantee is
ratified by the Iraqi parliament. Excluded from this limit are leases of real property by Iraqi
embassies or other foreign representations. External debts will be expressed in U.S. dollar
terms, with debts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar converted into U.S. dollars at the
market rates of the respective currencies prevailing on December 31, 2009, as published on
the IMF’s website. The program ceilings of the contracting or guaranteeing of medium- and
long-term external debt are reported in Table 1. These limits are applied on a continuous
basis to the contracting and guaranteeing of external debt on or after January 1, 2010 and the
limit during the period preceding each test date will be the ceiling set for that particular test
date.
16.
Concessionality will be based on currency-specific discount rates based on the
Organization for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs). For loans of an original maturity of at least 15 years, the average
of CIRRs over the last 10 years will be used as the discount rate for assessing the
concessionality of these loans, while the average of CIRRs of the preceding six-month period
will be used to assess the concessionality of loans with original maturities of less than
15 years. To the ten-year and six-month averages of CIRRs, the following margins will be
added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years;
1.15 percent for 20–30 years; and 1.25 percent for over 29 years. Under this definition of
concessionality, only loans with grant element equivalent to 35 percent or more will be
excluded from the debt limits. The debt limits also will not apply to loans contracted for debt

57
rescheduling or refinancing (including the deferral of interest in commercial debt), and
credits extended by the IMF and the World Bank.
V. PROGRAM ADJUSTORS
17.
If oil revenues exceed/fall short of the amounts projected under the program
($22.6 billion in the first half of 2010 (of which $11.8 billion in the first quarter); and
$48 billion for the entire year 2010), the ceilings on the central government fiscal deficit
for end-March 2010, end-June 2010, and end-December 2010 will be adjusted
downwards/upwards by half of the excess/shortfall as compared to the respective projected
amounts, multiplied by the program exchange rate. In case oil revenues exceed the amounts
projected under the program, half of the additional revenues can be used only to finance
capital spending. In 2010, this additional capital spending will be limited to the equivalent of
$4 billion ($2 billion in the first half of 2010), subject to a reassessment in the context of the
first and second reviews under the program.
18.
The ceilings on the central government fiscal deficit will be adjusted (i) upwards/
downwards by the cumulative amount (prorated for the relevant period) of any
excess/shortfall in external project loans, and/or external debt interest payments, relative to
the program amounts (included in the table below); and (ii) downwards by the cumulative
amount (prorated for the relevant period) of any excess in external budget support grants
relative to the program amounts (included in the table below).

APPENDIX I. IRAQ: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Iraq’s debt sustainability analysis underlines the progress the country has made in
recent years in resolving the country’s external debt burden (Tables 1 and 2). With the
conclusion of the third and last phase of the Paris Club debt reduction agreement, as well as
the settlement of almost all private sector debt, Iraq’s external debt sustainability has
improved significantly. Assuming that debt reduction on terms comparable to the Paris Club
agreement is applied to all non-Paris Club creditors’ claims, Iraq's external debt is projected
to fall to about 47.5 percent of GDP at end-2010 and to decline over the medium term. Under
the baseline scenario, the medium term projections assume that the new external debt is
mostly to multilateral creditors (particularly the IMF and World Bank) and a few bilateral
creditors. Under this scenario, gross public sector debt is projected to decline from
137 percent of GDP in 2009 to 28 percent in 2014.
The authorities intend to broaden the debt instruments available to them to absorb
shocks and cover their financing needs by deepening the Treasury bill market. This will
allow the government to tap private domestic financial resources and help develop an active
and liquid domestic capital market. In line with budget projections, the analysis assumes the
issuance of $3 billion of Treasury-bills annually until 2011 to help finance the projected
fiscal gap. These Treasury-bills would be partially redeemed by 2013-14 as the budget
moves back into surplus. By end-2014 the stock of outstanding Treasury-bills is projected at
$3 billion.
While the debt ratios show a healthy decline under the baseline scenario, stress tests
indicate that:




Iraq's external debt is significantly vulnerable to oil price and production shocks.
With a permanent oil production shock (production remaining at a level 5 percent
below the baseline 2010 level), the debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-export ratios
would rise rapidly over the medium term; (ii) a price shock of 10 percent (relative to
the baseline) would also present difficulties albeit of a lesser importance than the
volume shock; and (iii) a combined oil price and production shock would present
significantly more severe problems as unsustainable market borrowing would become
necessary.
Iraq’s public debt remains somewhat vulnerable to negative shocks, especially to a
depreciation of the exchange rate and oil shocks (through external debt liabilities). A
30 percent depreciation of the dinar would triple the stock of debt relative to the
baseline scenario, exceeding 85 percent of GDP by 2014. An increase of interest rates
and a decline of growth rates would also have a negative impact the stock of debt,
which would almost double by 2014 relative to the baseline ratios.
Major vulnerabilities could also arise if the authorities deviate from the adoption and
implementation of sustainable fiscal policies.

VIII. Safeguards assessments:
The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) is subject to an update safeguards assessment in respect
of the proposed SBA. The earlier safeguards assessment, in conjunction with the SBA
approved on December 19, 2007, was finalized on March 7, 2008. It concluded that
accounting and control governance at the CBI needs to be strengthened. Steps are being
taken to address the issues that continue to give rise to heavily qualified external audit
opinions, but accounting and internal control procedures are not yet fully effective.
Measures to mitigate the safeguards risks, notably through continued external audits
and adoption of foreign reserves management guidelines were recommended.
IX. Exchange rate arrangement:
The Central Bank of Iraq has been conducting foreign exchange auction on a daily basis
since October 4, 2003. The central bank followed a policy of exchange rate stability
which has translated in a de facto peg of the exchange rate since early 2004. However,
from November 2006 until end 2008, the CBI allowed the exchange rate to gradually
appreciate. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement of Iraq was reclassified to the
category of crawling peg effective November 1, 2006. Since the start of 2009, the CBI
returned to its earlier policy of maintaining a stable dinar. Consequently, the exchange
rate arrangement of Iraq was reclassified effective January 1 2009 as a stabilized
arrangement.
Iraq continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. Iraq has
a generally unrestricted current account regime and a significantly liberalized capital
account. However, four measures (plus one exchange restriction maintained for national
or international security) have been identified to give rise to exchange restrictions
subject to IMF approval, namely, (i) the requirement to pay all obligations and debts to
the government before proceeds of investments of investors, and salaries and other
compensation of non-Iraqi employees may be transferred out of Iraq, (ii) the
requirement to submit a tax certificate and a letter of non-objection stating that the
companies do not owe any taxes to the government before non-Iraqi companies may
transfer proceeds of current international transactions out of the country, (iii) the
requirement that before non-Iraqis may transfer proceeds in excess of ID 15 million out
of Iraq, the banks are required to give due consideration of legal obligations of these
persons with respect to official entities, which must be settled before allowing any
transfer, and (iv) an Iraqi balance owed to Jordan under an inoperative bilateral
payments agreement. In addition, one exchange restriction maintained for security
reasons should be notified to the IMF under the framework of Decision 144-(52/51).

Article IV consultations:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 1, 2007. The staff report

ANNEX II. IRAQ: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
As of November 23, 2009
1.
Iraq, a founding member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), received six loans from the IBRD between 1950 and 1973 for
agriculture, education, flood control, telecommunications, and transport. The last loan closed
in 1979. Iraq was in non-accrual status from 1990 to December 2004, when it paid its arrears
to the IBRD (about US$108 million).
2.
The Bank began reengaging with Iraq in 2003, with the preparation of Watching
Briefs followed by a Joint Needs Assessment together with the United Nations. A first
Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Iraq, discussed by the Bank’s Executive Directors in January
2004, relied on grants from the multi-donor World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) to finance
projects.
A. The Bank Group Strategy and Operations
3.
The World Bank’s Group’s third ISN for Iraq for the period 2009-2011 was discussed
by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on March 19, 2009. The central guiding
principle of the ISN is that the main role for the World Bank is to help Iraq use its resources
more effectively and transparently and to lay the ground for private sector development. The
ISN includes three thematic areas of engagement: (i) continuing to support ongoing
reconstruction and socio-economic recovery; (ii) improving governance and the management
of public resources, including human, natural and financial; and (iii) supporting policies and
institutions that promote broad-based, private-sector-led growth, with the goal of revitalizing
the private sector and facilitating job creation. The ISN includes a $500m envelope for
financial support to Iraq in IBRD terms.
4.
Analytical and Advisory Activities. In addition to financial support, the Bank places
special emphasis on its analytical and advisory activities (AAA), including capacity building,
policy advice, and economic and sector work, as key vehicles of Bank assistance to Iraq.
Examples of recent key analytical work include a Report on the Management of the Public
Distribution System (2005), a Public Expenditure Institutional Assessment (2008); and a
Poverty Assessment (2009). An Investment Climate Assessment is underway and a Public
Expenditure Review is planned.
5.
Public finance management reform continues to be a key component of the Bank’s
engagement with Iraq. The PEIA, issued to the Government in June 2008, outlined steps for
strengthening the accountability and transparency of public finance institutions and policies
and help Iraq meet the goals set in the Iraq Compact. The PEIA underpins an Iraqi-owned
public finance management reform program. A Public Financial Management project,
financed through the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) was approved in June 2009 to
provide technical assistance (TA) to help the GOI's develop a more effective, accountable
and transparent public financial management system. The Bank has also provided related
support to modernize the public procurement system, including the drafting of a new public
procurement law.

7
6.
While focusing on public resource management, the Bank is supporting other key
issues: strengthening social safety nets and modernizing the pension system; improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of the Public (food) Distribution System; assessing poverty and
vulnerability; improving management of oil revenues; and restructuring the state-owned
banking system, for which an ITF-financed Banking Sector Reform project was approved in
April 2009. The Bank has also provided policy support in a wide range of sectors including
education, electricity, health, transport, water supply and sanitation, and water resource
management.
7.
World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF). Seventeen donors have deposited US$494
million in the ITF. It has financed 21 grants valued at US$507 million, exceeding donor
contributions by US$13 million and committing 103 percent of donor deposits to projects.
ITF projects focus on helping the GOI strengthen its institutional capacity to deliver services,
utilize its resources in an efficient and transparent manner, and implement key reforms. ITF
grants finance textbooks, schools, pharmaceuticals and health clinics, improved social safety
nets, water supply and sanitation, irrigation and drainage, electricity, environmental
management, private sector development, and banking and public finance management
reform efforts. The ITF also finances technical assistance to help strengthen Iraqi institutions
develop baseline poverty data, and improve social safety net targeting mechanisms.
8.
Of the 21 grants, 18 are active projects valued at US$447 million, and 3 projects,
valued at US$60 million, are completed. The vast majority of ITF projects are implemented
by Iraqi agencies (15 out of the 18 active projects, amounting to US$434 million) to help the
GOI develop effective institutions to ensure country ownership. Three projects, totaling
US$12 million, finance technical assistance/capacity building activities that are implemented
by the Bank at the request of the GOI. Commitments and disbursements continue to increase.
Overall, as of November 20, 2009, commitments total about US$390 million (about
79 percent of the grant amounts), and disbursements for project expenditures total US$279
million (about 57 percent of the grant amounts).
9.
Three technical assistance projects to be financed by the ITF are scheduled to be
approved before the end of the year: (i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building
for the Education Sector Project (US$3 million) aims to help four education ministries
develop a coherent, Iraqi-owned, national education sector strategy; (ii) Pension Reform
Implementation Technical Assistance Project (US$6 million) aims to help the Ministry of
Finance develop a long-term pension strategy that will expand social insurance coverage, and
unify the policies and administrative bodies of private and public sector pension schemes;
and (iii) Integrated National Energy Strategy Technical Assistance Project (US$5 million)
finances technical assistance to help GOI formulate an Integrated National Energy Strategy
that will include on all branches of the energy sector (oil, gas and power), with particular
emphasis on their coordination and on setting the stage for effective medium- and long-term
development.
10.
IDA. In late 2004, Iraq became eligible for exceptional Bank lending under IDA (the
Bank’s concessional assistance window). Since then, the Bank has approved 5 IDA projects

8
amounting to US$509 million, to finance projects in education, roads, electricity and water.1
Following a lengthy delay in identifying the required steps to make the credits effective,
Iraq’s parliament ratified the four loans on July 2007, and the water project in September
2009. As of November 20, 2009, commitments total US$279 million (about 55 percent of the
credit amounts), and disbursements total US$44 million (about 9 percent of the credit
amounts).
11.
The Bank engages a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to help supervise ITF and
IDA project implementation. The FMA employs about 24 Iraqi professionals to monitor the
physical implementation of projects and compliance with procurement and financial
management requirements. The FMA visits projects sites and meets with ministry staff on a
daily basis and provides monthly progress reports to the Bank.
12.
International Finance Corporation (IFC). IFC’s current portfolio consists of a
10 percent equity stake (US$6.2 million) in Credit Bank of Iraq (CBI) in partnership with the
National Bank of Kuwait (NBK)—this has had a strong demonstration effect. IFC has also
partnered with the National Bank of Iraq (NIB), and committed US$98 million to support
Iraq’s first private cement company in Kurdistan—these two projects were cancelled due to
sponsor/project issues and security circumstances.
13.
IFC is keen to continue investing and supporting the private sector in Iraq. On the
investment side, IFC is exploring opportunities in the following areas: (a) establishing trade
finance lines with 2 Iraqi banks (Bank of Bagdad and Credit Bank of Iraq); (b) investments
in microfinance, in collaboration with US Treasury and OPIC; (c) supporting a Greenfield
business hotel in Erbil-recently submitted to the Board; (d) supporting SOE reforms; (e)
exploring opportunities for power sector Independent Power Plants (IPP); and (f)
investments in the telecom sector.
14.
On the advisory side, IFC will try to (a) develop the capacity of IFC’s current Iraqi
client banks (CBI, National Bank of Iraq); (b) build on the successes of SME management
training provided under the first phase of our Business Edge program. Phase II will target up
to 6,000 participants in 2 years (20 percent women); (c) develop the capacity of IFC’s current
Iraqi client banks (CBI, National Bank of Iraq); and (d) explore opportunities in Public
Private Partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure (see below). IFC’s advisory services have
already trained around 200 Iraqi bankers, completed SME advisory to NBI in collaboration
with Rabo Bank of Holland, supported the housing construction study together with World
Bank

1

The Third Emergency Education Project (US$100 million) was approved by the Board in November 2005;
the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project (US$135 million) was approved in June 2006; the Dokan and
Derbandikan Emergency Hydropower Project (US$40 million) was approved in December 2006; the Emergency
Electricity Reconstruction Project (US$124 million) was approved in March 2007; and the Emergency Water
Supply Project (US$109.5 million) was approved in June 2008.

9
and UN-Habitat, and implemented its SME management training program, Business Edge,
especially targeting women (3,000 women have already been trained).
15.
Collaboration with the World Bank in potential PPP activities. IFC and World Bank
are discussing with Iraq's National Investment Commission potential support to the
implementation of PPP strategy. This could include capacity building to a PPP unit,
identification of PPP projects, and support in implementing one pilot project, preferably an
IPP given the need for power generation in Iraq. A detailed action plan is currently being
prepared.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
16.
The Bank is working closely with the Fund on the reform program in Iraq. The two
institutions have conducted a number of joint missions and organized policy workshops and
training courses for Iraqi civil servants and academics, covering public financial
management, oil revenue management, intergovernmental finance, investment climate,
payment system, banking supervision, social safety nets, and the like. There are no major
differences of views between the two institutions on policy issues. The staffs are in broad
agreement on the core reform program in Iraq, namely: (i) reinforcing public governance and
institutions, including management of oil revenues; (ii) ensuring coherent and wellsequenced market-focused reforms; (iii) strengthening social safety nets; and (iv) improving
delivery of essential services, including education and health.
C. Areas in Which the World Bank Leads and There is No Direct IMF Involvement
17.
Through ITF- and IDA-funded projects the Bank is providing emergency support to
rehabilitate vital public services—education, health, water supply and sanitation, urban
infrastructure, power, and telecommunications. The Bank anchors its project work in focused
analysis of sector issues, and supports Iraqi capacity-building via policy workshops and
training courses. The Bank leads work on gender issues; and has successfully facilitated the
GOI’s efforts to undertake an Iraqi Household Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES) as well as a
Poverty Reduction Strategy which was completed in June 2009 and included feedback from
more than 100 donors and Iraqi stakeholders.
D. Areas in Which the World Bank Leads and Its Analysis Serves as Input into the
IMF-Supported Program
18.
The Bank has provided policy advice and inputs to the Prime Minister’s Supreme
Economic Committee and to key ministries. Bank inputs are provided in the form of policy
papers on key reform areas, such as subsidy reform, pension system and social protection, oil
revenue governance, public finance management, civil service and payroll reform,
restructuring of SOEs and public banks, investment climate, and trade policy and facilitation.
19.
The IMF has a strong interest in the areas listed above from the macroeconomic
perspective (economic growth and fiscal sustainability, including the phasing out of
nontransparent quasi-fiscal operations). The IMF has also a strong interest in governance
issues, in particular with regards to oil revenue management.

10
E. Areas of Shared Responsibility
20.
The IMF and the World Bank are working together on macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability, revenue management, the reform of domestic subsidies, financial sector
reform (comprising state bank restructuring, strengthening payment system and banking
supervision and regulation), public debt management, and statistical capacity building. The
Bank and the Fund closely coordinate their capacity building activities in macroeconomic
management, public sector governance, private sector development, and social safety nets.
The Bank’s design of the IHSES benefited from comments provided by the Fund.
F. Areas in Which the Fund Leads and its Analysis Serves as Input into the World
Bank–Supported Programs
21.
The IMF leads the dialogue on core macroeconomic policies and has taken the lead
on debt sustainability analysis, monetary policy, and the management of aggregate
expenditures. The Bank is working with the IMF to ensure consistency of the overall
macroeconomic and fiscal framework. With the support of the IMF and the World Bank,
progress in strengthening budget management and banking sector reform is underway. With
support from the IMF, the Government also executed a debt restructuring program with all
Paris Club creditors.
G. Areas in Which the IMF Leads and There is No Direct World Bank Involvement
22.
The IMF leads the dialogue on monetary and credit policies, exchange rate
management, tax policy and administration, and balance of payments issues.

ANNEX III. IRAQ: STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Background
1.
Data provided to the Fund, while broadly adequate for program monitoring, have
serious shortcomings that significantly hamper economic analysis. Macroeconomic statistics
have suffered from years of neglect and recent turmoil has added to the difficulties. While
the Central Organization for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT) remained in
place, its technical expertise has become outdated. At the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI),
statistical capacity is slightly better, although the staff need training.
2.
Since 2003, the Statistics Department (STA) has provided considerable technical
assistance (TA) in all major datasets, including on dissemination standards. The authorities
have indicated their intention to participate in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and draft metadata for most data categories have been prepared. The ongoing TA
program takes into account the absorptive capacity of the statistical agencies involved, and
the contributions of other donors.
B. Shortcomings of Statistical Framework
National accounts
3.
COSIT compiles annual and quarterly national accounts at currant and constant
(1988) prices. Annual data of GDP by activity are available on the website of COSIT for
2001-07, and quarterly GDP data for 2007 and the first three quarters of 2008.
4.
The national accounts follow the 1968 SNA, however, with technical assistance from
STA, COSIT is moving towards implementing the concepts of the 1993 SNA. The quality of
the national accounts compiled is poor, due to the lack of source data. There are no
comprehensive source data available for estimating the value added by activity and for GDP
expenditure categories. A Household Budget Survey (HBS), restaurants and hotel survey,
and money exchange survey have been conducted during 2007 but, the results have not been
processed yet. Public sector hotels are not covered in the survey because they are occupied
by the coalition forces and their staff. An establishment survey was supposed to be
conducted in 2007, but due to the security situation, COSIT was not able to conduct the
scheduled survey. The data on the oil sector is generally adequate and timely, but there is
little information on non-oil economic activity. COSIT still includes the Kurdistan
Territory’s contribution to GDP by economic activities as percentages for each activity based
on results obtained from previous estimates dating back to 1990. Other activities that started
in the Kurdistan Territory after 1990 are not included. There are limited price and volume
indicators which could be used for deriving volume measures of GDP. The base year (1988)
is outdated and needs to be updated. Work is underway to move the base year to 2004.
5.
Data collection is reasonably comprehensive for current price data in the formal
sector. Under current procedures, businesses employing more than 10 people must report
calendar year data by the following October, and small businesses need to report by the
following June. Because there are sizable penalties for noncompliance, respondents usually

13
meet these deadlines. However, with recent changes in the country, there is a risk that the
timeliness of data reporting will deteriorate.
6.
There is a shortage of quarterly and monthly indicators of economic activity and a
lack of timely data for services. Quarterly GDP estimates are based on a limited number of
indicators - crude oil output, electricity, rent of dwellings, and government expenditure.
Nevertheless, for several industries, extrapolating from out-of-date benchmarks adversely
affects data reliability. The results of the 2007 HSES should provide better indicators.
Consumer price index
7.
Consumer price data are available with relatively short lags but do not cover the
Kurdish region. Staffing is inadequate in number and training has been received only during
STA technical assistance missions. There is not enough computer hardware and software to
process the CPI efficiently. Recent technical assistance missions have focused on providing
hands-on training on methodologies for compiling the CPI and on methods for making
adjustments in the CPI for seasonality and changes in the quality of goods. Improvements in
the CPI have been limited by outdated weights, which date back to 1993. Currently, COSIT
is in the process of rebasing the CPI based on the 2007 HSES. Limited training has also been
provided on methods for constructing the producer price index (PPI) and the wholesale price
index (WPI) and on documenting the procedures and methods used to compile the CPI
(metadata); work in this area is continuing.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Notable progress has been made in developing the components and structure for
compiling a depository corporations survey, but the quality of the data continues to be
hampered by several factors: (i) the lack of sufficiently trained staff and adequate internal
cooperation within the CBI; (ii) difficulty in collecting information on banking transactions
in the northern region (Kurdistan); (iii) a chart of accounts (COA) that is not fully compliant
with current monetary and financial data requirements—the CBI approved in April 2007 a
resolution for drafting a new COA by end-2008; (iv) the use of pre-conflict forms for
reporting monetary statistics; and (v) the balance sheet presentations for the commercial
banks that do not conform with the sectorization and instrument classification of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
9.
The recent mission (January 28–February 8, 2008) found that the authorities have
made progress in implementing the recommendations from previous missions. More
specifically, the mission found that (1) further progress was made in harmonizing the data
transmitted to STA and MCD; (2) several balance sheet entries were resolved for proper
economic sectorization and classification of financial instruments; and (3) progress was
made towards developing data reporting instructions for Other Financial Corporations. The
mission helped the authorities to address compilation problems to facilitate the publication in
March 2008 of a new country page in the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial
Statistics and an expanded country page in International Financial Statistics.

14
Balance of payments statistics
10.
Balance of payments statistics are available to the Fund for 2005 and 2006 in the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) format. The quality of the
information for recent years has improved; however, the presentation is still limited due to
coverage problems and some deviations from the internationally acceptable methodologies.
Issues regarding the recording of external debt data seem largely resolved, and balance of
payments data might be soon published in the IFS. International reserves are compiled
consistent with international methodologies and published in the IFS since end-2006.
11.
A recent TA mission (January 19-February 1, 2008) found that consistent with the
previous recommendations the CBI staff has been provided with sufficient technological
resources, although limited work space continued to make working conditions very difficult.
Furthermore, the quality of the information remains hampered by the lack of data submission
to the CBI from other government institutions and the private sector. The lack of data has
meant inaccuracies or absence of BOP data particularly in the area of external trade, foreign
direct investment and external debt statistics.
12.
To help address these and other issues, the mission proposed several short-term
recommendations, including : (1) reporting to the IMF updated BOP data for the 2005, 2006,
and 2007 in BPM5 format as well as updated methodological notes when additional data
sources are being used; (2) conducting high-level inter-agency discussions to ensure
consistency of external trade data and cooperation in conducting CBI’s surveys; (3) liaising
with the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation in order to discuss the exchange
of information on foreign direct investment; (4) using data from other depository
corporations (ODCs) to compile direct investment data; (5) disseminating comprehensive
BOP statistics in the CBI’s publications and on its website; and (6) engaging the Ministry of
Finance to obtain external debt data.
External trade statistics
13.
External trade data have serious problems of timeliness and are of poor quality. A
new customs form for imports is available but it is not being used at the customs border due
to the security situation and the lack of Customs Department resources at the border outlets.
14.
Imports are calculated based on the reconstruction fee form, but are considered to be
undervalued and unreliable. Therefore, data for private sector imports were excluded and
derived from a survey. Wholesale traders were surveyed at five border outlets to elicit
information on imports by economic activity. The coverage of the external trade statistics
excludes the northern region of the country (Kurdistan), and no estimates for smuggling are
made.
15.
Export data from the oil sector are received from the BOPSD at the CBI. The non-oil
export data, which amounts to the equivalent of 3–5 percent of total exports, are compiled
based on information from the customs export form. Non-oil export data are provided to the
CBI on a monthly basis for crosschecking purposes.
Government finance

15
16.
Despite the difficult security situation, which has a direct impact on data compilation
and analysis, the provision of fiscal data for program monitoring purposes has been
satisfactory. Infrequent submission delays occur, and coverage of the Kurdish region remains
sketchy. However, the authorities are taking measures to address these shortcomings.
17.
In February 2005, an STA mission—held jointly with a parallel FAD and World
Bank mission—discussed a work plan aimed at building up reporting as an integral part of
a major rehabilitation of the budgetary, accounting, and fiscal management information
system. The mission identified institutional, technical, resource, and coordination issues that
would need to be addressed prior to developing the government finance statistics (GFS).
These include establishing a macro-fiscal directorate-general in charge of developing and
disseminating fiscal statistical data, implementing the classification for mapping the chart
of accounts and budget classification onto the format of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM 2001) (an area where significant progress has been made), and preparing
preliminary estimates of GFS-compliant data for general government on a best effort basis.
The Ministry of Finance has also set up a debt unit with the support of external consultants.
Iraq does not report government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or IFS. Currently there are no fiscal statistics published by the
government beyond the summary of central government budgetary estimates and outturn.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Iraq
On February 24, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Iraq.6
Background
The Fund has been closely engaged with Iraq since 2003. Initial work focused on
providing policy advice, mainly on monetary and fiscal policies, and technical assistance
to rebuild essential economic institutions. In September 2004, the Fund approved
Emergency Post Conflict Assistance for Iraq, which—in combination with a debt
sustainability analysis—paved the way for an agreement with Paris Club creditors. Since
then, Iraq successfully completed two (precautionary) Stand-By Arrangements whose
main objectives were to achieve macroeconomic stability; promote growth; and continue
the process of structural reforms.
Substantial progress has been made since 2003, despite the difficult security situation.
Inflation has been reduced to single digits, the international reserves position has
improved markedly, and direct fuel subsidies were eliminated, while the pension system
was put on a sustainable footing, which created room for priority spending on investment
and the social sectors. Several steps have also been taken to strengthen public financial
6

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
management, improve transparency in the oil sector, and rebuild capacity at the central
bank, and the authorities have initiated the restructuring of the two largest state-owned
banks. In addition, important advances have been made in attaining long-term debt
sustainability. In 2004, Paris Club creditors agreed to reduce Iraq’s external debt by
80 percent in net present value terms. Also, bilateral debt agreements with several nonParis Club creditors have been concluded, although this process is yet to be completed.
Iraq’s economic performance was strong in 2008, aided by record oil prices and
improved security. Oil production rose to 2.3 million barrels per day (mbpd), the highest
level since 2003. As a result, real GDP is estimated to have grown by 9½ percent in
2008, up from 1½ percent in 2007. Crude oil export receipts reached $61 billion in
2008—65 percent higher than in 2007—and the current account recorded a large
surplus. The government budget registered a lower-than-expected surplus of 1½ percent
of GDP in 2008. This reflected a significant increase in government spending that more
than offset the higher-than-budgeted revenues. This increase in government spending
reflected in part a large wage adjustment to compensate for the erosion in real wages
that had taken place in previous years.
Following the strong economic performance in 2008, more recently the Iraqi economy
has been seriously affected by the drop in oil prices from their peak levels in mid-2008.
Also, oil production and export volumes have not risen as much as planned due to
insufficient investment; production reached 2.4 mbpd. As a result, Iraq’s external position
weakened in 2009, with oil export proceeds falling to $39 billion and both the external
current account and the overall balance of payments shifting into large deficits. With oil
export receipts accounting for about 85 percent of government revenues, the lower oil
prices had a similar impact on the government’s budget, which is estimated to have
recorded a deficit of over 20 percent of GDP in 2009. The CBI’s international reserves
fell by almost $7 billion in 2009, to about $44 billion by year’s end, reflecting the use of
government deposits at the CBI to finance the budget deficit. Growth is estimated to
have slowed to 4 percent in 2009, even though oil production improved towards the end
of the year owing to efforts to address infrastructure bottlenecks.
Iraq’s longer-term economic outlook is strong as oil prices and production are projected
to increase markedly in the coming years. However, based on conservative oil price
assumptions, the external current account and the overall balance of payments are
expected to remain in deficit in 2010 and 2011. Similarly, Iraq’s fiscal position is
projected to record significant, albeit declining deficits in both years, before returning to a
surplus position in 2012. Financing the budget deficits in 2010–2011, would require
additional financial support to fill a financing gap projected at almost $5 billion, even after
mobilizing substantial amounts of domestic financing and utilizing the recent SDR
allocation of $1.7 billion.
Against this background, the authorities have designed an economic program for 2010–
11 that aims to maintain macroeconomic stability during the period of political transition
(parliamentary elections are scheduled for early March 2010) and deepen structural

3
reforms, particularly in the areas of public financial management, the financial system,
and oil sector transparency. In support of this program, the authorities have requested
a new Stand-By Arrangement from the IMF in the amount of SDR 2,376.8 million
($3.6 billion). This amount, together with disbursements from the World Bank under
a Development Policy Loan and support from some donors, is expected to cover the
financing gap for 2010–11. An important objective of the authorities’ fiscal program is to
contain current spending in order to gradually reduce the budget deficit and make room
for additional investment. Specifically, current spending in both 2010 and 2011 will be
kept broadly unchanged in nominal terms at 2009 levels. At the same time, given the
urgent need to improve infrastructure and basic public service delivery, a significant
increase in capital spending is planned for 2010, following an underexecution of the
2009 capital budget due to administrative capacity constraints associated with security
incidents that affected the Ministry of Finance towards the end of the year. Monetary and
exchange rate policies will continue to aim at keeping inflation low in 2010 and 2011.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Iraqi authorities for the progress in rebuilding its economy
under extremely difficult security and political conditions. While the medium-term
economic outlook remains favorable as oil prices and production are expected to
increase in the coming years, major challenges lie ahead. Large fiscal and balance of
payment gaps are projected for 2010 and 2011, caused by the lower oil receipts and
infrastructure bottlenecks. Directors also noted considerable risks associated with
security problems, oil price volatility, and capacity constraints. They welcomed the
authorities’ strong commitment to consolidate macroeconomic stability and advance the
structural reform agenda, particularly in the areas of public financial management and
the banking sector. Directors underscored the importance of steadfast implementation
of the economic program, which would help unlock much needed resources from other
donors and multilateral development banks.
Directors considered that the 2010 budget, based on conservative oil price assumptions,
is consistent with the program’s objectives. They highlighted the need to contain current
spending, in particular through rationalizing the government wage bill and streamlining
the in-kind Public Distribution System and transfers to state-owned enterprises. This
would create room for targeted social safety nets and for essential investment and
reconstruction projects, including improving public service delivery and infrastructure in
the oil sector. Directors encouraged further reform efforts aimed at improving budget
preparation and execution through developing a medium-term budget framework, and
broadening the revenue base by introducing a general sales tax.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to strengthen governance
and improve transparency in the hydrocarbon sector. Completion of the oil metering
system would help facilitate the full reconciliation of oil flows with financial flows between
the state-owned oil companies and the budget. Directors congratulated Iraq on
becoming a candidate for membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency

4
Initiative. They encouraged the authorities to establish a successor arrangement for the
Development Fund for Iraq with the similar standards of transparency and accountability.
Directors supported the central bank’s objective of aiming monetary and exchange rate
policies at keeping core inflation in single digits. They called on the authorities to remove
the remaining exchange restrictions under Fund jurisdiction. Directors also encouraged
the central bank to fully implement the recommendations of the previous safeguards
assessment and looked forward to its update. The need to preserve central bank
independence was particularly emphasized. Further steps are necessary to strengthen
reserve management, banking supervision and prudential regulations, and the AML/CFT
framework.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ good-faith efforts to conclude debt agreements with
the remaining official and private creditors. They encouraged the authorities to continue
to work with non-Paris Club creditors, with a view to securing debt relief on terms
comparable to those of the 2004 Paris Club Agreement.
While welcoming Iraq’s participation in the General Data Dissemination System,
Directors called for continued efforts to improve the quality, coverage, and timeliness
of macroeconomic statistics.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$3.6 Billion Stand-By Arrangement for Iraq
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a two-year
Stand-By Arrangement for Iraq for an amount equivalent to SDR 2.38 billion (about
US$3.64 billion) to cover the country’s balance of payments needs. The Board’s approval
makes an amount equivalent to SDR 297.1 million (about US$455 million) immediately
available to the Iraqi authorities.
The new arrangement follows a 15-month program supported by a Stand-By Arrangement,
which was approved by the executive Board on December 20, 2007 and expired on March
18, 2009 (Press Release No 07/301). The successor arrangement is designed to support Iraq's
economic program over the next 24 months through February 23, 2012.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Iraq, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Iraq has made substantial progress in rebuilding its economy and consolidating
macroeconomic stability under difficult security and political conditions. The economy was
severely affected in 2009 by the drop in international oil prices. The current account and the
overall balance of payments are expected to remain in deficit in 2010 and 2011. Similarly,
the fiscal position is projected to record large, albeit declining, deficits in both years, before
returning to a surplus position in 2012.
“Against this background, the economic program for 2010 and 2011 aims at providing a
sound macroeconomic framework during a period of economic and political uncertainties.
Consistent with this program, the 2010 budget adopted by parliament seeks to contain current
spending while increasing investment to address Iraq’s large rehabilitation needs and
improve public service delivery. Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at
keeping inflation low.
“The economic program will also help the authorities move forward with their structural
reform agenda. Strengthening the public financial management system is critical to

2
improving the allocation and execution of public resources, as well as enhancing
transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s natural resources. The
program also incorporates banking sector reforms, including a restructuring of state-owned
banks, with a view to improving the financial services required by a growing economy.
“The authorities intend to treat the new Stand-by Arrangement as precautionary should oil
prices turn out to be significantly higher than envisaged, or investment execution be lower
than budgeted.
“The authorities have made significant progress in their external debt negotiations with
official and private creditors. They remain committed to completing the restructuring of
remaining non-Paris Club claims,” Mr. Kato stated.
ANNEX
Program Summary
The main objectives of the program are to maintain macroeconomic stability during a period
of high economic and political uncertainties (parliamentary elections are scheduled for
March 7, 2010), and to provide a framework for deepening structural reforms.
While Iraq’s medium-term economic outlook remains favorable because oil prices and
production are projected to increase in the coming years, based on conservative oil price
assumptions the current account and overall balance of payments are expected to remain in
deficit in 2010 and 2011. Similarly, Iraq’s fiscal position is projected to record large, albeit
declining deficits in both years, before returning to a surplus position in 2012.
Against this background, the authorities have designed an economic program for the period
through end-2011 and have requested the Fund to support it with a new two-year Stand-By
Arrangement. The authorities view the new program primarily as a way to provide a sound
macroeconomic framework during a period of high economic and political uncertainties. The
authorities’ fiscal program seeks to contain current government spending while catching up
on much-needed investment spending. The budget deficit is targeted to decline to 19 percent
of GDP in 2010 and further to 6 percent in 2011, before shifting back into surplus in 2012.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to aim at keeping inflation low.
The new program will also aim to advance key reforms in the areas of public financial
management (PFM) and financial sector development, in close coordination with a
Development Policy Loan (DPL) provided by the World Bank. Both operations focus on
advancing PFM and bank restructuring action plans prepared by the authorities during 2008
and 2009 with the assistance of Fund and World Bank staff.

Statement by Shakour A. Shaalan, Executive Director for Iraq
February 24, 2010
Background
Notwithstanding extremely difficult security and political conditions, Iraq has continued to
make progress in rebuilding its economy and achieving macroeconomic stability over the
past few years. Under three successfully completed Fund-supported programs, the authorities
reduced inflation to single digits from 65 percent in 2006, while significantly adjusting
domestic fuel prices. In addition, they strengthened the international reserves position and
implemented significant structural reforms—including to the pension system, and the audit
and capitalization of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). These accomplishments were made
possible by timely adjustments in monetary and exchange rate policies, as well as continued
fiscal discipline.
Notwithstanding these developments, the Iraqi economy continues to face daunting
challenges, which were exacerbated by the large drop in oil prices in 2009. With both the
balance of payments and the government budget largely reliant on oil revenues, the lower oil
receipts have given rise to sizeable, although temporary, balance of payments and fiscal
deficits. In 2009, the authorities were able to absorb much of the adverse impact of the
external shocks by using the financial buffers built up in recent years.
The balance of payments is likely to remain under pressure in 2010 and 2011 and a
substantial fiscal deficit will be recorded in 2010 before receding sharply in 2011. Financing
these deficits, even after mobilizing substantial domestic financing, could exhaust the
government’s remaining financial balances. It could also severely constrain government
spending at a time when Iraq’s developmental and security-related needs remain high,
poverty and unemployment are widespread, and the security situation remains fragile. The
authorities are also concerned that a drastic fiscal contraction at this juncture would
undermine hard-won macroeconomic stability, and could contribute to a deterioration of the
security situation.
In view of these developments, the authorities have adopted an economic adjustment
program for 2010–11 for which they are seeking support from the Fund under a new twoyear Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), as well as financial assistance from other international
institutions and countries. The main objective of the program is to maintain macroeconomic
stability during a period of high economic and political uncertainties. The program also aims
at advancing the authorities’ structural reform agenda, notably in the areas of public financial
management and financial sector development, in close coordination with a prospective
Development Policy Loan provided by the World Bank. The Bank Board is scheduled to
consider this loan on February 25, 2010.

2
The program will provide the authorities with access to Fund financing, if needed. With
international oil prices and domestic oil production forecast to increase in the coming years,
Iraq’s financing needs are expected to be temporary. In this connection, the authorities intend
to treat the SBA as precautionary if, at the time of the first and second program review,
futures prices for Iraqi oil average US$73 per barrel or higher. With these prices, Iraq would
no longer expect to have a financing need, provided that it is able to sustain an oil export
volume of 2.1 million barrels per day in 2010.
Similarly, the authorities would also treat the SBA as precautionary if investment remains
significantly below budgeted amounts—specifically, if at the time of the second review, the
rate of execution of the capital budget for the year as a whole were expected to remain below
93 percent. Disbursements of capital spending in 2009 indeed fell short of budgeted amounts,
due in part to severe disruptions of administrative capacity as a result of the bombings of the
Ministry of Finance in August and December. Investment remains a key priority, and the
authorities are striving to restore and expand administrative capacity, including with the
assistance of the World Bank, to ensure that implementation quality is not compromised.
The authorities would use Fund resources to finance the budget deficit, which would directly
address the country’s balance of payments needs given the very close linkages between the
balance of payments and the government budget. At the same time, given the constraints on
other sources of external and domestic financing, the additional fiscal space offered by the
use of Fund resources would allow the government to avoid an economic contraction. It
would also allow the authorities to preserve CBI independence and avoid central bank
financing of the government.
Economic and Financial Policies and Reforms in 2010–11
The fiscal strategy aims primarily at containing current spending in order to gradually reduce
the deficit and create room for higher investment outlays. A moderate decline in the budget
deficit to 19 percent of GDP in 2010 is projected, followed by a marked decline to 6 percent
of GDP in 2011, and a return to a surplus in 2012 as oil revenues increase.
To this end, current spending will be kept broadly unchanged in nominal terms beyond 2010.
This would ensure a decline in current spending by about 30 percentage points of GDP by
2012. To obtain this target, it is intended to reduce non-priority expenditures immediately.
To this end, the authorities will: (i) contain the wage bill by refraining from raising wages
and limiting hiring; (ii) complete the census of government civil servants; (iii) improve the
targeting of social spending by enhancing the in-kind Public Distribution System initially,
and replacing it over time with a well-targeted cash-based safety net; (iv) reduce transfers to
state-owned enterprises; and (v) avoid the reemergence of direct fuel subsidies while
gradually reducing indirect subsidies.
Considerable effort is being devoted to advancing fiscal reforms. In addition to the reform
commitments indicated above, the authorities intend to modernize their public financial

3
management system over the next two years. In this regard, they adopted in October 2008, in
consultation with the IMF and the World Bank, a three-year action plan identifying priority
measures in the areas of budget preparation, execution and reporting; cash management;
public procurement; and the accounting framework, as detailed in the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies. They have also made progress in developing a mediumterm tax reform strategy with the objective of streamlining the tax system, broadening and
diversifying the tax base, and increasing revenue collection. They plan to introduce a sales
tax in the coming years as a precursor for a value-added tax, and are also considering
reducing the number of income tax brackets. They intend to seek technical assistance from
the Fund and other international partners to support their tax reform effort.
Investment remains a key priority, as evidenced in the increase in investment spending in the
budget for 2010. Investment will focus on improving the delivery of key public services,
including electricity, water, health, and education. It will also aim at further rehabilitating
and expanding the oil sector infrastructure given its critical role in maintaining fiscal and
external sustainability.
The CBI intends to maintain its present monetary and exchange rate policies, which are
aimed at keeping inflation in the single digits and further reducing dollarization in order to
enhance the CBI’s control over monetary conditions. Up until late 2008, the CBI had allowed
the dinar to appreciate gradually to bring down core inflation to near single digit levels. Once
the inflation target was achieved, the CBI returned to its earlier policy of maintaining a stable
exchange rate as the nominal anchor ―as specified in the last SBA. The CBI also intends to
keep the policy interest rate positive in real terms.
The structural agenda in the monetary area includes further enhancement of the CBI’s
reserve management practices. The authorities have prepared prudential regulations for
commercial banks, including those related to minimum capital requirements, liquidity risk,
and anti-money laundering, and will begin the implementation phase shortly. Further
improvements in banking supervision will be sought following the assessment that is
currently underway with foreign assistance. Moreover, control procedures and manuals are
being developed to help strengthen the accounting and reporting framework, as well as the
internal audit function of the CBI.
The Iraqi authorities are committed to strengthening the stability of the financial system.
They developed, in coordination with the World Bank and other international agencies
including the Fund, a banking sector reform strategy aimed primarily at undertaking the
operational and financial restructuring of the two largest state banks. The operational
restructuring entails introducing a new organizational structure, including the establishment
of business units, risk management units, as well as governance, control and support units.
The financial restructuring will consist of cleaning-up the banks’ balance sheets from the
legacy of bad debts and recapitalizing them.

4
Increasing transparency and good governance in the oil sector continues to rank high on the
authorities’ agenda. In this connection, they will maintain a single account for all oil export
proceeds and will continue to adhere to the strict transparency and accountability rules that
currently govern the Development Fund for Iraq. This account will continue to be audited by
a reputable external auditor and overseen by the independent Iraqi Committee of Financial
Experts, which would take over the audit oversight role currently performed by the
International Advisory and Monitoring Board. In an effort to enhance transparency and fight
corruption in the oil sector, the authorities will complete the process of becoming a candidate
for membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative by March 2010.
The authorities are committed to further improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of
macroeconomic statistics, despite serious capacity constraints. This will take time. Monetary
and balance of payments data are now being published in the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics regularly, annual national accounts data have been compiled up to 2007, and the
quality of the national accounts has improved in the last year. A new CPI using the latest
Socio-Economic Household Survey is being developed. Iraq began participating in the
General Data Dissemination System in December 2009, and comprehensive information on
Iraq’s statistical production and dissemination practices now appears on the IMF’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
The Iraqi authorities will continue their good faith efforts to resolve outstanding external
claims under terms that are consistent with the 2004 Paris Club agreement. With twelve nonParis Club official creditor claims already signed and currently being implemented, they will
focus their efforts on resolving the still outstanding non-Paris Club claims. Regarding private
creditors, most of the commercial debt has been restructured, and is being serviced as agreed.
Conclusion
The Iraqi authorities have demonstrated their commitment to undertaking strong
macroeconomic policies and implementing economic reforms under three successive Fundsupported programs, including two SBAs. These arrangements have served Iraq well,
providing cohesion to the policy framework while anchoring and furthering progress towards
macroeconomic stability and economic reforms. The road ahead is still very challenging. The
Iraqi authorities are fully committed to the implementation of the new arrangement, although
stable security conditions remain a prerequisite for the success of their policies. They would
like to express their deep appreciation for the Fund’s Executive Board, Management, and
