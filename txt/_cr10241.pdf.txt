EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


The financial crisis exposed underlying vulnerabilities in the banking sector and impaired
GDP growth. Aided by ample resources, the authorities responded with a large-scale policy
package that helped stabilize banks and limited the impact on growth and employment.



External liabilities of two large banks were successfully restructured, but the banking
system continues to be burdened by a large and increasing stock of nonperforming loans.
A transparent and comprehensive strategy to resolve bad debts is crucial for restoring financial
sector health. This should be accompanied by an independent assessment of systemic banks to
evaluate recapitalization needs, and by improvements in the legal, regulatory and supervisory
frameworks.



The fiscal stimulus should be withdrawn gradually, as public support is still needed for
bank liquidity and non-oil economic activity. The stimulus can be sustained as the public
sector’s net foreign asset position remains strong, but expenditures need to be better prioritized.
In the medium term, the fiscal deficit should be placed on a downward path to limit inflationary
pressures and real exchange rate appreciation. This will be consistent with an accumulation of
oil revenues over time.



The economy would benefit from greater exchange rate flexibility, once the problems in
the banking system have been resolved. The exchange rate regime is currently classified as
pegged to the U.S. dollar with horizontal bands. Greater exchange rate flexibility would
facilitate monetary management, help the economy adjust to external shocks, and promote localcurrency financial market development.



In the longer term, Kazakhstan is set to benefit from its mineral resource wealth and plans
to diversify the economy and improve the business environment. The authorities’ mediumterm strategy provides the framework for increasing the share of manufacturing in GDP,
improving productivity in agriculture, and reforming the health and education systems.



Policy actions have been generally consistent with the recommendations of the 2009
Article IV consultation. The authorities have maintained the fiscal stimulus, improved FSA
regulations, and kept the exchange rate peg to support the recovery of the financial sector.
Further efforts to strengthen bank soundness are needed.

I. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS—IMPACT AND RESPONSE
The global financial crisis led to an abrupt halt in credit growth and a bursting of the
property bubble in Kazakhstan. As a result, underlying vulnerabilities in the banking sector
were exposed and GDP growth declined sharply. Benefitting from ample resources and low
public debt, the authorities responded with substantial support to the banking sector and the
real economy. The stimulus measures have helped lessen the impact of the crisis on incomes
and employment. Nevertheless, structural weaknesses in banks persist, the sector remains
under stress, and the ongoing deleveraging process makes the economic recovery uncertain.
A. Deteriorating Bank Soundness and Slower Economic Growth
1.
The sudden stop in capital inflows in the early stages of the global financial crisis
exposed the underlying vulnerabilities in the banking system. Kazakhstani banks
borrowed heavily from abroad in the years preceding the crisis—amassing external debt of
$46 billion by 2007 (44 percent of GDP)—to fund a rapid expansion of credit, largely
concentrated in the nontradables sector. The tightening of external funding precipitated
marked declines in credit growth and property prices, and the early 2009 devaluation of the
tenge exacerbated risks in the highly dollarized economy. Notwithstanding the provision of
liquidity and capital support, the combination of weak economic growth, currency induced
credit exposure, and increased uncertainty led to a sharp worsening of banks’ balance sheets.
2.
Four financial institutions stopped making principal repayments and were
forced to restructure their external liabilities. Following extensive and difficult processes,
foreign creditors agreed to restructure external obligations in two large banks (BTA and
Alliance Bank), while significant progress has been made at two smaller institutions (Temir
Bank and Astana Finance). The banks are now developing new business models, but public
sector support will need to continue.
3.
The banking system faces significant difficulties. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) on
a 90-day overdue basis have risen sharply to 26 percent of total loans (from 3½ percent in
mid–2008), increasingly driven by non-restructuring banks, including some systemic ones.

Aggregate provisioning levels are high by international standards, covering more than total
NPLs, but the coverage has declined over the last year. Banks have been reluctant to write off
bad debts, allegedly for tax reasons. At 18½ percent, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio
excluding restructuring banks, remains above the minimum requirements. However, the
capital base has been under pressure as profitability has been hit by the need for higher
provisions and the negative carry resulting from the placement of excess liquidity at the
National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) or in correspondent accounts (Box 1).
4.
The steady decline in deposit dollarization quickly reversed with the onset of the
crisis. Foreign currency deposits peaked at around 45 percent of total deposits by September
2009, compared to just 24 percent in mid–2007. High inflation, economic uncertainty, and a
loss of confidence in the tenge during the early stages of the crisis precipitated a rise in
dollarization after more than two years of steady decline. However, the recent strength of the
tenge and lower rates of inflation have prompted some shift back into local currency deposits.
5.
Although banks’ aggregate liquidity is comfortable, credit dynamics remain
weak. Annual credit growth has plummeted into negative territory from its pre-crisis peak of
over 110 percent. This reflects a drastic decline in external funding (banks’ external debt
falling to $30 billion or 30 percent of GDP at end–2009), heightened risk aversion by banks,
ongoing private sector deleveraging, insufficient demand in the nontradables sector, and the
onset of tighter prudential regulations. Overall external debt remains manageable (see
Appendix 1 and Debt Sustainability Tables).
6.
The debt restructuring undermined confidence of external creditors, limiting
access of all institutions to international markets. Kazakhstan’s credit default swaps and
bond spreads have benefited from an improvement in global risk appetite and higher
commodity prices, but remain highly sensitive to shifts in market sentiment. Importantly,
external funding from traditional sources remains prohibitive, and is likely to be only partly
replaced by new sources of official financing—notably from the Gulf, Russia, and China, as
well as from the rise of Islamic banking in Kazakhstan.
7.
Given the clear linkages between the financial and real sectors, most
macroeconomic indicators worsened in 2009. Real GDP growth slowed sharply from the
10 percent rates recorded during 2000–07, becoming negative by mid–2009, but a sharp

rebound in the last quarter of the year (driven by the strong performance of industry and
agriculture, according to official statistics) helped it reach 1¼ percent for the year as a whole.
Exports fell significantly, reflecting lower oil prices and a decline in non-oil sales abroad.
Notwithstanding the fall in imports from weaker demand, the current account shifted into a
deficit of about 3 percent of GDP in 2009, reinforcing pressures on the balance of payments
from ongoing capital outflows and declining foreign exchange reserves. Average annual
inflation slowed in 2009 and has remained relatively contained at around 7½ percent.
B. A Strong Policy Response Supported by Ample Resources and Fiscal Space
8.
Drawing upon savings in the National Oil Fund (NFRK), the authorities
responded with a large scale policy package that helped stabilize banks. The response
included measures amounting to 8½ percent of GDP, and was focused on stabilizing banks.
Samruk-Kazyna (SK), the national development agency, took equity stakes in four large
banks (including two majority positions); public entities placed deposits in the troubled banks
by repatriating funds from abroad and reallocating from perceived stronger banks; and key
sectors of the economy where NPLs are concentrated—real estate, construction and other
nontradables—are currently receiving preferential funding. This support, alongside enhanced
deposit insurance and the external nature of the debt restructuring, largely shielded domestic
agents, mitigating widespread withdrawals of deposits. A Distressed Asset Fund (DAF) was
capitalized through the budget in late 2008 to remove overdue obligations from banks’
balance sheets, but has not been involved in bad debt resolution, and its role has evolved to
the provision of support to specific sectors and banks.
9.
Countercyclical fiscal policy helped limit the economic slowdown. The authorities
allowed automatic stabilizers to operate even as revenues fell sharply. In addition, tax cuts in
the non-extractive sector were introduced, although some of the initially announced cuts were
delayed to help preserve the fiscal position. Additional expenditures to mitigate the impact of
the crisis were mostly directed through SK, but some budgetary outlays—for pensions, public
sector wages and social benefits—increased significantly. This resulted in an expansion of
the deficit, financed through oil savings, domestic debt, and a loan from the Asian
Development Bank.

Monetary policy was accommodative in 2009 as the economy remained weak and
inflation pressures declined. The central bank lowered reserve requirements on domestic
and foreign currency obligations to 1½ and 2½ percent, respectively, and the main policy rate
was reduced to 7 percent, reflecting a series of cuts totaling 350 basis points since the start of
the year. Easier monetary conditions and enhanced liquidity facilities contributed to an
improvement in bank liquidity. Despite these measures, broad money expansion slowed
sharply, and the banking sector’s net foreign assets improved with continued balance sheet
deleveraging and the prohibitive cost of international borrowing.
11.
The devaluation of the tenge in February 2009 helped stabilize market pressures,
and was followed a year later by a widening of the trading band. The combination of
declining oil prices, a depreciating ruble, and significant capital outflows prompted the
20 percent devaluation. As a result, domestic deposits stabilized and international reserves
recovered. In February 2010, the central bank introduced a wider, asymmetric trading
corridor (+10/-15 percent around the central parity of T/$150) to accommodate favorable
market sentiment resulting from the stabilization of the ruble and the ongoing rebound in
global commodity prices. Since then, the tenge has gained only about two percent as the
central bank, focused on managing the effective exchange rate, has accumulated reserves and
limited the bilateral appreciation of the tenge against the U.S. dollar.
12.
Kazakhstan and Russia have begun implementing a customs union agreement as
a first step to creating a single economic space by 2012. Belarus was also part of the
agreement but has temporarily withdrawn. In line with the agreement, the countries have
eliminated most duties on mutual trade, moved to harmonize customs rules, and are set to
adopt a common external tariff. While Kazakhstan is expected to benefit from larger trade
volume, free movement of labor, capital, and goods, and better access to outside markets, it
will have to raise its currently low customs duties, increasing the prices of goods coming
from outside of the union. The modalities for WTO accession remain unresolved, but
Kazakhstan has committed to continue to pursue accession independent of the customs union.

Box 1. Kazakhstan: The Ongoing Balance Sheet Restructuring of Banks
The restructuring process has been largely completed. Against market expectations of unlimited
government support, the authorities’ decision to stop payments and propose restructuring resulted in a
reduction of external liabilities of the banking system by about one-third, while domestic confidence was
effectively maintained.



At end-May 2010, external creditors voted in favor of restructuring $12¼ billion of BTA’s debt.
This will result in a debt reduction of $6¾ billion once the legal and operational procedures are
completed. BTA’s capital will revert to a positive position of $1¼ billion as SK will also increase
its equity stake to 81½ percent.



Alliance Bank restructured $4½ billion of external debt in early 2010, lowering its liabilities by
about $3½ billion and improving its capital from negative $3.0 billion to $0.2 billion, of which SK
now owns 67 percent.



Restructuring is also underway at smaller institutions, including Temir Bank, which will become
80 percent owned by SK, and Astana Finance.
As a result of debt restructuring and restricted access to foreign borrowing, the aggregate banking
sector balance sheet shows the following main changes:
Assets. The net loan-to-GDP ratio has fallen from 63 percent in 2007 to around 34 percent currently.
Other assets have been significantly written down, largely as a result of write offs of BTA’s external
portfolio, and also as bank holdings of property and securities have declined in value. Outstanding credit
related to mortgages, construction, and non-productive sectors accounts for nearly three-quarters of
system loans. House prices have fallen by 27 percent since their peak in 2007—with prices in Almaty
declining by 54 percent. Assets that are 100 percent provisioned account for over 20 percent of all assets.
Liabilities. Banks’ external debt has declined to around 20 percent of GDP from over 44 percent in
2007. Deposits of companies linked to SK reportedly account for around 25 percent of the deposit base.
The loan-to-deposit base continues to fall although it is above the new prudential norm of 150 percent
for many banks.
Provisions. Reflecting the rise in NPLs, provisions have been raised from 6 percent of total loans at end–
2007 to 37 percent in April 2010, and the coverage is high by international standards. However, the
coverage of NPLs has been falling and may be overstated as provisions include amounts allocated for
restructured loans that have been removed from the NPL classification.
Capital. The aggregate capital base has declined from the equivalent of 11 percent of GDP in 2007 to
negative 3 percent in April 2010, reflecting current bank restructuring and the massive rise in
provisioning. Capital is expected to turn positive by mid-2010 after accounting for BTA's restructuring.

II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND AUTHORITIES’ ANNOUNCED POLICIES
Higher commodity prices, stronger trade, and improved expectations will support the
authorities’ plans to continue to back bank liquidity and stimulate key economic sectors in
the near term. This would sustain a recovery of economic growth driven by tradable sectors,
but broader activity will remain contained by weak credit growth and banking difficulties. In
the longer term, the authorities plan to reduce their dependency on oil by improving
competitiveness and productivity in the nontradables sector.
13.
Staff projects real GDP growth of around 4 percent in 2010 and a recovery of
the external outlook. Growth will be driven mainly by the oil, gas, and mining sectors, as
well as by some recovery in trade, transport, and communications. The current account is
expected to show a surplus in 2010, driven by a strong rebound in exports (in particular oil)
combined with a relatively slow recovery in import growth. This outlook would allow for a
continued build-up of gross international reserves in 2010. Staff projects inflation to remain
around 7½ percent under the current monetary policy stance. A possible deterioration of
external conditions would pose risks to this outlook (Box 2).
14.
Continued public sector support, albeit at a lower level than in 2008 and 2009,
will sustain the expected recovery. Additional direct capital injections to banks are not
expected, but liquidity provision through public sector deposits will continue. With long-term
bilateral credit facilities from China totaling over $13 billion that are ready to be drawn once
projects are identified, public sector enterprises will finance investments in the mining sector
and infrastructure development, a key priority within the authorities’ industrialization policy.
15.
The government is coordinating additional efforts to address banking sector
vulnerabilities. A Council for Financial Stability—comprising the NBK, FSA, and
government ministries—is to be established to strengthen coordination across the public
sector. This policy forum plans to enact tighter macroprudential policies to limit credit boombust cycles, including prudential measures to manage unhedged credit risk, and
countercyclical bank regulations on capital and provisioning.

Budgetary and monetary policies will remain accommodative. The revised 2010
budget projects a general government deficit of about 3¼ percent of GDP, higher than the
2009 deficit of 1½ percent, mainly on account of higher current spending, including another
significant increase in the public sector wage bill.1 However, if nonbudgetary items are
included, the fiscal stance would tighten in 2010, consistent with the expected recovery in
economic activity.2 Apart from the annual transfer from the NFRK to the budget—now
limited to $8 billion per year—the authorities intend to exclude the use of oil savings to
finance the 2010 deficit, preferring instead to borrow both domestically and externally,
including $1 billion directly from the World Bank, and through possible Eurobond and
Sukuk issuances. With continued favorable external conditions, the authorities expect to
allow a greater role for market forces in the determination of the exchange rate.
17.
Over the medium term, the government plans to improve productivity and
advance economic diversification through structural reforms. Efforts will be directed to
improving the business environment, modernizing enterprises, creating new high value added
export-oriented sectors, and providing selective support to key industries, including
telecommunications and transport. The Development Plan to 2020 envisages an increased
share of manufacturing and SMEs in GDP, improved productivity in agriculture, and health
and education reforms. This would allow real GDP growth to increase gradually toward its
estimated potential of about 6 percent over the next five years (Box 3).

On the authorities’ definition, the deficit is expected to increase from 3 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4½ percent
in 2010. Staff treats all taxes from the oil sector as revenues, while the authorities only include the funds
transferred from the NFRK to the budget.

In particular, the support to the financial sector in 2009 amounted to about 4 percent of GDP. This expense
will not be repeated in 2010, resulting in an improvement in the augmented fiscal stance.

Box 2. Possible Spillovers to Kazakhstan of Renewed Global Market Turbulence
Kazakhstan is well positioned to cope with global economic uncertainties. The economy is supported
by a strong foreign asset position ($54 billion or 42 percent of GDP), a healthy outlook for FDI, and the
prospect of large official bilateral financing deals. Moreover, government debt remains low at less than
20 percent of GDP—with external debt amounting to only 3 percent of GDP—and is underpinned by a
strong track record of fiscal management.
Nonetheless, the economy is vulnerable to renewed turbulence in global markets:
Risk perception. Notwithstanding limited direct financial linkages with euro area countries, the recent
deterioration in global risk appetite resulted in volatile movements in CDS, quasi-sovereign and
corporate bond spreads, and marked declines in the stock market. This reflects the impact of current
financial fragilities on confidence.

pricing and rollover rates of private sector
debt would be affected. A negative impact
on corporate share prices could potentially complicate planned divestment of public sector equity stakes
in the banking system.
Trade and growth. Kazakhstan remains vulnerable to possible negative commodity price effects from
weaker European or global growth. Euro area countries account for around 25 percent of Kazakhstan’s
exports ($11½ billion in 2009), of which nearly 85 percent is oil related. Spillovers felt by Russia—also
a large commodity exporter—would reinforce the negative impact on Kazakhstan through the strong
trade and financial linkages.
Bank soundness. Weaker economic growth would further undermine asset quality, placing additional
pressures on financial sector balance sheets and posing significant contingent fiscal risks for the
government.
Policy constraints. While there is space for fiscal policy to continue to support the recovery, shallow
domestic markets and high financial dollarization restrict the traction of monetary policy in the face of
renewed pressures.

Box 3. Oil and the Kazakhstani Economy
Kazakhstan is the site of the most significant new oil discovery in recent years. At current production levels
(1½ million barrels per day in 2009), Kazakhstan is the 18th largest oil producer in the world and the largest in
the region after Russia. Proven reserves are now estimated at 30 billion barrels (similar to Nigeria and
exceeding Algeria, Mexico and the United States) due to the discovery of oil in the Kashagan field in the
Caspian Sea.
The oil sector dominates the economy. Oil accounts for almost one fourth of GDP, 60 percent of total exports,
and 40 percent of total budget revenues. In 2009, about three fourths of FDI inflows were directed into oil and
gas-related activities. These ratios are expected to rise significantly when production in Kashagan begins in
2015. Once Kashagan achieves peak production towards 2020, domestic oil production is expected to double
from current levels.
To ensure macroeconomic stability and save income for future generations, a large share of oil revenue is
transferred to the NFRK. The fund is managed by the NBK on behalf of the government, and its assets,
mainly from direct oil taxes (corporate income tax, royalties, the state’s share under production-sharing
agreements, and rent tax on exports), are invested abroad.
Oil revenues benefit the economy mainly through budget spending, but also through spillovers to oilrelated services. The primary channels of transmission to the domestic economy are the fiscal accounts, in the
form of yearly transfers from the oil fund, and through state and local taxes in oil producing regions.
Prospecting, exploration and maintenance services are additional channels of transmission, and oil-related
earnings of local firms, especially the state-owned oil firm, are a significant source of liquidity in the banking
system.
Growth is closely correlated to oil production, while
the sector accounts for more than 25 percent of GDP

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Public sector support, external debt restructuring, and improvements in supervision have
been appropriate to tackle the immediate difficulties. The key policy priorities now are to
effectively resolve bank weaknesses and gradually unwind emergency assistance. Given the
large expansion of commodity exports expected over the medium term, the appropriate policy
mix to prevent overheating entails a fiscal strategy balancing the needs for infrastructure
spending and saving of oil revenues; a monetary policy centered on controlling inflation;
and structural reforms to make the non-oil sector more competitive.
A. Financial Sector—Restoring Balance Sheets While Addressing Vulnerabilities
18.
Debt restructuring and stabilization have been vital in reducing banks’ external
liabilities, but there is a clear need to address the deterioration in the quality of assets.
The evolving nature of the crisis and concerns over undermining confidence limited the
authorities’ appetite for a wider and more forceful recapitalization strategy. In this context,
discussions focused on the need to take action to swiftly design and implement a
comprehensive and transparent resolution strategy for NPLs (Chapter I of the Selected Issues
Paper). Discussions also centered on the need to address the vulnerabilities that led to the
deterioration of the quality of bank capital by implementing pending FSAP
recommendations.
19.
Resolution of problematic loans is a precondition to rehabilitate the financial
system and resume an appropriate level of credit growth. Staff stressed that a resumption
of economic growth by itself is unlikely to adequately address the NPL problem, since
nontradables sector are expected to lag the recovery in commodity-driven sectors. Thus, the
current fragmented policy approach for the provision of subsidies and guarantees is
insufficient to effectively tackle the asset quality problems of individual banks. Moreover, if
sustained at high levels over a long period, NPLs could significantly weigh on growth
prospects and deter the creation of employment. The authorities considered that the current
ample level of provisioning provides an adequate buffer to the capital base, and explained
that valuation, legal and budgetary factors are likely to act as constraints, but saw merits in
being prepared for a more comprehensive resolution of bad debts. For this purpose they
requested technical assistance from the Fund.
20.
A strategy to reduce NPLs is urgent and should be accompanied by a full
diagnostic assessment of systemically important banks to assess recapitalization needs.
Staff stressed the need to adopt decisive policies to resolve the mounting problem loans, and
encouraged the authorities to assess the scope for remedial measures at the bank level (for
example, by a market-based restructuring of existing loans), or the need for a more
centralized approach to deal with bad assets via a reinvigorated DAF. In any case, continued
public support could be made conditional on a comprehensive and time-bound resolution
mechanism. A forward-looking evaluation of asset quality and capitalization, conducted by
independent auditors under the control of the Financial Supervision Agency (FSA), will be

13
crucial to assess additional recapitalization needs. The authorities agreed that any needed
recapitalization should ideally come from the private sector, but noted that raising new
capital from existing shareholders was challenging even in the case of banks with foreign
parents. Staff highlighted the need for contingency planning in case there is a need for
additional public sector resources.
21.
In parallel, improvements in the legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks
are needed to deal with underlying vulnerabilities. The government should continue to
strengthen the FSA with the due independence, authority, legal protection and resources to
credibly conduct its mandate and refrain from regulatory forbearance. Legal frameworks—
including collateral, foreclosure, and bankruptcy laws—should be improved, and appropriate
asset valuation methods, governance, transparency, and accountability should be established
and maintained. The FSA confirmed progress in some of these areas, including by raising
capital requirements, limiting overseas borrowing by banks, and increasing provisioning
requirements on foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers. Staff advised avoiding
market distortions created by directed lending at negative real interest rates and funding of
long term projects with public sector deposits. The authorities agreed to consider an FSAP
Stability Module, possibly in early 2011.
B. Fiscal Policy—Unwinding the Stimulus While Ensuring Sustainability
22.
The fiscal stimulus needs to be gradually withdrawn while ensuring efficiency of
spending. With the current low level of public debt, the authorities are well positioned to
continue sustaining the economic recovery. However, staff stressed the importance of
avoiding further increases in hard-to-reverse outlays and ensuring that the quality of public
spending is consistent with growth objectives. The authorities explained that the sharp
increase in pensions and wages was needed to reduce the still existing large gap with private
sector salaries, preserve social stability, and support incomes. Staff also recommended
eliminating remaining tax exemptions and strengthening tax administration, to ensure that
revenue collection from the non-oil sector is maximized, without affecting its
competitiveness.
23.
On the adequacy of financing, there is a trade-off between paying the costs of
borrowing and building reserves. Discussions focused on the economic and financial
rationale for external borrowing to finance the 2010 deficit vis-à-vis making further use of
accumulated oil savings. The authorities emphasized that higher but reasonable financial
costs were justified by the benefits of reinstating fiscal discipline and avoiding private sector
pressure on the use of oil savings. Staff advised against an undue increase in external
borrowing, and the authorities confirmed that there will be no additional financing needs
beyond the World Bank loan, and that the planned sovereign issuances are primarily aimed at
establishing interest rate benchmarks for Kazakhstani corporations.
24.
Medium-term institutional arrangements should support the fiscal framework.
The authorities support gradual fiscal consolidation starting in 2011 and phasing out of
contingent liabilities. Staff recommended the use of an aggregate approach (also comprising

14
off-budget fiscal transactions) to assess sustainability within a medium-term framework.3
Medium-term planning is also instrumental in defining the optimal combination of savings
and use of oil and commodity revenues. In this regard, the new concept for the management
of the NFRK explicitly increases the proportion of oil revenue to be saved over the next
decade by setting a ceiling on the annual transfers to the budget, eliminating the possibility of
off-budget use of NFRK, and establishing a target of 3 percent of GDP for the non-oil deficit
by 2020 (11 percent in 2009). Staff supported a steady accumulation of oil revenue and a
reduction of the non-oil deficit to promote macroeconomic stability. However, staff regarded
the authorities’ target as too ambitious, and suggested supplementing the concept with a
fiscal rule framework that would allow for countercyclical fiscal policy.4
C. Monetary Policy—Remaining Supportive While Developing Domestic Markets
25.
Monetary policy will need to keep inflation under control, while supporting the
financial sector and the real economy. With higher growth and excessive bank liquidity,
the NBK is aware of the need to continuously monitor pressures to maintain inflation within
the projected 6-8 percent range. The NBK should continue to manage domestic liquidity
through short-term notes in coordination with the domestic borrowing plans of the
government. Staff noted that real interest rates should be kept positive to support depositor
confidence and should be market determined to avoid distortions created by government
intervention in the credit market.
26.
The economy will benefit from greater exchange rate flexibility. In the short term,
the projected increase in foreign exchange inflows and confidence recovery are expected to
mitigate risks to banks’ balance sheets from adverse exchange rate fluctuations, while
supporting dedollarization. In the medium term, staff’s exchange rate assessment shows no

evidence of systematic deviations from equilibrium (Appendix I). Staff advised the
authorities to allow greater exchange rate flexibility once financial sector’s problems are
appropriately addressed, to enhance the economy’s ability to absorb external shocks and
provide additional monetary policy leverage. The NBK agreed with staff, but added that the
timing of any change would also be influenced by policies of major trading partners. Staff
stressed that the accumulation of oil savings in the NFRK should continue to be used to limit
oil-driven real appreciation, while planned structural reforms should enhance productivity
and competitiveness in the non-oil sectors.
27.
Against an improved macroeconomic and financial sector backdrop, the
authorities are interested in promoting efforts to spur dedollarization. Staff stressed that
the demand for holding and transacting in tenge will resume once confidence in
macroeconomic policies is rebuilt, and economic agents perceive that an adequately
capitalized and well regulated financial system is in place. Staff supported the authorities’
plans to deepen domestic financial markets in tenge to reduce the reliance on bank lending,
as well as the development of liquid futures and forward markets in foreign exchange to
promote risk diversification (Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper).
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
In the context of a slow global rebound and uncertain international financial
conditions, Kazakhstan’s economy is expected to recover at a gradual pace. Growth is
projected to pick up in 2010, mainly driven by higher exports, increasing commodity prices,
and the associated foreign direct investment. The strong and timely public sector support
provided to the economy will also result in some rebound in domestic demand, and the
restructuring of external liabilities is expected to support banking sector confidence.
However, stagnant credit growth and ongoing private sector deleveraging is likely to weigh
on the pace of recovery.
29.
In these circumstances, Kazakhstan has an urgent need to resolve bank
weaknesses. This will require a proactive, comprehensive and transparent strategy to reduce
the stock of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets. In parallel, the macroprudential framework
should continue to be strengthened to address the key vulnerabilities that led to the
deterioration of bank credit portfolios, including excessive reliance on foreign funding and
risky lending practices. Importantly, on the difficult trade-off between imposing enhanced
regulations to strengthen banks’ balance sheets and promoting credit growth through directed
lending policies, the restoration of banking system health should take precedence.
30.
The removal of public entity deposits, divestment of government equity stakes in
banks, and withdrawal of the stimulus-oriented budget spending should be gradual.
Official support is still critical in the near term, mainly through the maintenance of public
entity deposits in key banks and the continuation of programs to sustain the recovery in
sectors most affected by the crisis. Public sector support could be conditioned on an
improvement in the quality of banks’ credit portfolios. Against this, the divestment of bank
equity stakes should be timed carefully to maximize the value of banks. The need for

16
continued public sector support should be couched within a medium-term plan for fiscal
consolidation, centered on maintaining the quality of public spending and increasing savings
of oil revenues to ensure macroeconomic stability and save income for future generations.
31.
Close policy coordination between the government, FSA and NBK is central to
ensuring the appropriate management of post-crisis risks and incentives. Government
support to the economy should be transparent and avoid price and interest rate subsidies that
could create market distortions or exacerbate governance problems. Given the challenges
ahead, the government should continue to strengthen the FSA’s independence, authority and
resources. The FSA should focus on strengthening banks’ finances through enforcement of
regulations and refrain from regulatory forbearance. The NBK should continue to closely
monitor inflationary pressures taking into account expected capital inflows, current excessive
bank liquidity and the domestic borrowing plans of the government. In parallel, greater
exchange rate flexibility should support monetary management and the economy’s response
to external shocks.
32.
Plans to develop domestic capital markets should complement other efforts to
encourage a reduction in the level of dollarization. With lower external funding and
increased savings of oil resources, there is a clear need to mobilize domestic deposits over
the medium term to finance productive activities. This should be supported by efforts to
deepen domestic money markets, promote tenge long-term liquidity, and facilitate
appropriate risk management and hedging practices. The establishment of a well-functioning
government benchmark yield curve, with full market determination of prices and yields, is
crucial to these efforts and should be linked with the overall debt management strategy.
33.
In the longer term, Kazakhstan is set to benefit from its mineral resource wealth
and foreign asset holdings. Success in promoting sustainable development will entail
reduced dependence on commodities, increased productivity in the non-oil economy and
higher reliance on private consumption and investment as the primary sources of growth. The
government’s medium term strategy provides a strong basis for the gradual diversification of
the economy, but this requires the support of a well-capitalized and regulated financial
system.
34.
The board of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) granted
Kazakhstan an extension to September 2010 to complete validation procedures. The
government’s intention to raise participation of Kazakhstan’s oil companies in line with EITI
over the coming years is welcome.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Figure 4. Kazakhstan: External and Fiscal Sector Developments and Outlook
The external position is expected to improve in 2010, driven by a strong rebound in exports (in particular oil). The
budget deficit will increase in 2010, but the overall fiscal stance (including off-budget items) will improve. Apart from
the $8 billion transfer to the budget, the NFRK will not be used to finance the deficit.
The current account slipped into deficit in 2009, but a
rebound in exports and a slow recovery in imports will
see this reverse from 2010 onwards..

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain

Appendix I. Kazakhstan: External Stability and Exchange Rate Assessment
External stability
Kazakhstan’s current account is projected to return to surplus in 2010, which will be sustained
over the medium term. The surpluses reflect both higher prices and production of commodities,
primarily oil, as well as a gradual recovery in domestic demand after the economic crisis.
External debt is more manageable than headline numbers suggest. While debt (mostly private)
amounts to nearly 100 percent of GDP, a large proportion is intra-company debt, mainly in the oil,
gas and mining sectors. Excluding this, debt is expected to fall to 47 percent of GDP in 2010, and will
be on a downward trajectory thereafter. Staff projects external debt (excluding inter-company debt) to
stabilize at 40 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.
Exchange rate
There is no evidence that the tenge deviates systematically from its long-run equilibrium. The
three CGER approaches yield deviations that range from -3.5 to +3.1 percent.

2/ Based on current (2010) fundamentals. Medium term fundamentals are 2015 projections.
3/ The underlying current account and the norm exclude income; estimates based on NFA and NPV of oil wealth.

International reserve adequacy
How do Kazakhstan’s reserves compare to other emerging markets? Like many emerging
markets, Kazakhstan has experienced a strong increase in international reserves in recent years
despite the significant capital outflow in 2008. With better growth prospects, reserves are projected to
rise further over the medium term to about $73 billion by 2015 (9 months of imports). A variety of
common prudential measures suggest that the current level of reserves is not significantly out of line
compared with other oil exporters. Even a number of oil-importing emerging markets have
comparable reserve levels. This same pattern is expected to continue over the projection period.

ANNEX I. KAZAKHSTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE FUND
(As of June 1, 2010)


Mission: Article IV consultation discussions were held on May 26–June 8, 2010 in Astana
and Almaty. The concluding statement of the mission is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/060810.htm



Staff Team: A. L. Coronel (head), A. Al-Eyd, and D. Rozhkov (all MCD),
N. Raman (SPR), and N. Saker (MCM). D. Owen (MCD Reviewer) participated in key
meetings. D. Orynbaev (OED) joined some discussions.



Country Interlocutors: Prime Minister Massimov, parliamentarians, economic authorities,
and members of the banking, business, and international communities.



Fund Relations: Kazakhstan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
in 1996 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate regime has been
classified as a pegged exchange rate with horizontal bands (previously a managed float).



Statistical Issues: The authorities subscribe to the SDDS and the provision of data is
adequate for surveillance purposes.



Outreach: The mission met with the local press and made a presentation on the regional
economic outlook at the Kazakhstan National University.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The
official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held
daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are
quoted for over 30 other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. From late 1999 to October
2007, the exchange rate regime was a managed float with no preannounced path. Since
October 2007 the tenge has effectively been pegged to the U.S. dollar. In February 2010, the
trading band was widened and set at an asymmetric T150/US$ +10/-15% and an appreciation
of 2 percent has occurred since. The exchange rates at numerous exchange bureaus are very
close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and selling rates is very small. The
exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was
concluded on July 8, 2009 (see IMF Country Report No. 09/300).

FSAP Participation and ROSCS

Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000 (FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC
modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on Transparency in
Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities
Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP Update mission took place in
February 2004 and a second FSAP Update mission took place in March 2008. The fiscal
transparency module was completed in October 2002 and the final report published in
April 2003. A data module mission took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was
published in March 2003. An update of the data ROSC was undertaken in 2006 and the
report was published in February 2008 (see Annex V).

ANNEX II. KAZAKHSTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 1, 2010)
1.
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992
and of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. The Bank’s
lending program was curtailed earlier in this decade as a result of the country’s reduced
borrowing needs, but in FY09 it was revived and four new projects were launched. In
addition to lending activities, the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP) allows the Bank
to transfer knowledge in support of the government’s critical development needs. In FY10
the total financing of JERP amounts to just over $2.7 million, of which about 69 percent is
financed by the Government. JERP is built around four pillars aligned with the
government’s strategic priorities: (i) reform of public administration and public finance; (ii)
macroeconomic management and crisis mitigation; (iii) improvement in human development
outcomes; and (iv) private sector development and improvement to business climate.
2.
At present, the Bank’s program comprises thirteen projects (IBRD loans) with a
total commitment of $2.7 billion, of which $315 million is disbursed and outstanding.
Nine loans with total commitment amount of $2.6 billion are disbursing (Syr Darya Control
and Northern Aral Sea - Phase I, Nura River Clean-Up, Agricultural Post-Privatization
Assistance - Phase II, Agricultural Competitiveness, North–South Electricity Transmission,
Forest Protection and Reforestation, Customs Development Project, Health Sector
Technology Transfer, and South West Roads). Remaining four projects with total
commitment amount of $107 million were either launched recently (Moinak Electricity
Transmission), or pending effectiveness (on Tax Administration Reform six projects are
under preparation: Irrigation and Drainage Improvement - Phase II, Vocational Education
and Training, Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea - Phase II, Statistical Capacity
Improvement, Development Policy Operation, and South Kazakhstan Electricity
Transmission (the latter under Sovereign Guarantee) with an expected financing envelope of
about $1.4 billion.
3.
Kazakhstan is the IFC's largest client in Central Asia. As of the end of
March 2010, IFC’s total committed portfolio in Kazakhstan amounted to $602 million
of which $458 million were disbursed. IFC’s efforts in Kazakhstan are directed to foster
private sector led growth, particularly in the non-extractive sectors and frontier regions. This
includes ongoing support to the financial sector; and when possible, investments to promote
SME development, manufacturing, infrastructure, and the service sector. In the financial
sector, IFC is focusing on: (a) further stabilization, diversification and extension of the
maturity of the funding base in the banking sector; and (b) establishment of the best
international banking and corporate governance and regulatory environment. As the global
financial crisis has deepened, IFC aimed to identify partner financial institutions to contribute
to the stabilization of the financial sector and to effectively increase access to finance in the
priority sectors in the economy. IFC’s investment portfolio is mostly in the financial sector

7
and general manufacturing. In the past year, IFC has increased its investment program in
Kazakhstan to help alleviate problems with access to finance. IFC grew its investments
tenfold between FY05 and FY08 (from $11 to $110 million) and more than doubled
commitments again in FY09, committing $243 million in 7 projects despite the financial
crisis. In FY10 to date, IFC has already surpassed its FY09 commitment volumes with about
$330 million committed in four financial sector projects, including equity, quasi-equity, and
trade finance. IFC is also providing advisory services on corporate governance and
infrastructure; and is currently in discussions to help the government to structure PPP
projects and attract private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.
4.
On May 25, 2010, a US$ 1 billion Development Policy Loan (DPL) to
Kazakhstan was approved. The loan will provide budgetary support to the country to help
it implement its current economic program and sustain living standards of the population in
the aftermath of the economic crisis. The new loan supports the government's economic
program for ensuring financial stability and sustainable growth, with a particular focus on
fiscal policy, budgetary management, and banking regulation.

8
ANNEX III. KAZAKHSTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of June 1, 2010)
1.
The EBRD is the largest investor outside the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan. As
of May 31, 2010 the EBRD’s total business volume in Kazakhstan, including co-financing,
stood at €9.4 billion, with investments totaling €2.9 billion. The EBRD’s portfolio reached
€1.7 million. During 2009, the bank signed 16 projects, including regional ones, for a total
amount of EBRD finance of €436 million.
2.
During the first five months of 2010 the EBRD signed 10 operations with total
business volume of €273 million. The bank made a significant progress dealing with the
investments in Industry, Commerce & Agribusiness (ABV 42 %) and Power and Energy
(ABV 30%) and Infrastructure (ABV 18%). The bank’s business is promoting diversification
of the economy, which is in line with the new country strategy approved in January 2010.
The EBRD’s main operational objectives for 2010
3.
The EBRD’s strategic directions reflect the immediate need to help Kazakhstan
weather the crisis and get on the path of economic recovery, as well as to assist the country in
confronting its fundamental transition challenges.
Enterprise sector
4.
Support for the corporate sector, including through addressing the immediate
financing needs as part of crisis response, while promoting economic diversification and
innovation, including utilization of best available technology, integration into the global
economy (including through supporting inbound and outbound direct investment), best
business and environmental practices, and energy efficiency. The bank’s engagement with
Kazakhstani corporate clients will be underpinned by the principles of integrity, transparency
and good corporate governance. The EBRD will seek to engender these principles further
through greater use of equity instruments. Additional opportunities in the enterprise sector
are likely to be offered by energy-efficiency projects as well as by participation in existing
and new investment funds.
5.
The Kazakhstan state’s involvement in the country’s economy is not likely to abate in
the current post-crisis conditions. With that in mind, it will be strategically vital to develop
an appropriate level of co-operation with the National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna (SK).
The Bank will selectively pursue opportunities to co-operate with SK at the project level,
including in the corporate sector, in situations where the projects are based on sound market
principles, and subject to the usual integrity considerations. The EBRD will also selectively
consider possibilities to co-finance with such SK-owned institutions as the Development
Bank of Kazakhstan, as well as through co-investing with SK in investment funds.

9
Financial sector
6.
The EBRD will closely cooperate with the authorities and other IFIs to help formulate
a vision for the financial sector with the aim of achieving a sustainable financial model,
including through the scaling back over time of the government’s involvement in the banking
system. Through targeted investment, policy dialogue and technical assistance, the EBRD
will structure its work around that vision to help redress over-reliance on foreign wholesale
funding and a still limited deposit base, FX lending to unhedged borrowers, excessive
sectoral concentration of loan portfolios– in particular in construction and real estate– and
shortcomings in risk management, corporate governance and transparency.
7.
The banking sector will remain the primary conduit for channeling the bank’s funds
to SME’s and into energy efficiency and climate change projects. To allow the Kazakhstan’s
banking system to fulfill this role in a sustainable way, the EBRD will also seek to promote
and support the development of local currency and capital markets through engagement with
pension funds, increased involvement with non-bank financial intermediaries, and
development of institutional capacity through both macro and micro (project-related)
technical assistance. In particular, it will continue to support the emerging private equity
sector in order to ensure a sufficient supply of risk capital in addition to debt funding.
8.
The EBRD will seek to engage with non-bank financial institutions, including leasing
and insurance companies, and non-bank micro-lenders, and will consider the possibility of
launching a micro-finance bank.
Infrastructure and energy sectors
9.
Support the development and transformation of infrastructure sectors, which is
pivotal to further economic diversification and longer-term sustainable growth, while
fostering commercial viability, competition, and private sector participation.
Transport
10.
The EBRD will pursue rehabilitation of key international road corridors, for which
sovereign support may be required, provided the financing package is accompanied by sector
reform. To that end, the EBRD will seek to co-finance with other IFIs and to coordinate
police advice and technical assistance.
11.
In the rail segment, the EBRD will seek to replicate its existing successful transaction
with Transtelecom, pursuing similar deals with other subsidiaries of Kazakhstan Temir Zholi
(KTZ). In connection with the financing, the bank will provide technical assistance to
support KTZ’s restructuring efforts based on the draft Rail Reform Strategy 2009–2014.

10
Municipal and Environmental Infrastructure (MEI)
12.
The EBRD will continue to pursue development of creative mechanisms for financing
municipal projects, replicating the successfully closed transactions in water/ waste water and
municipal transport segments. In addition to urban transport and water/waste water projects,
the bank will consider projects in the district heating segment, where historical
underinvestment has created significant rehabilitation needs.
Power and Energy
13.
The EBRD aims to advance the transformation of the energy sector through
implementation of the “Sustainable Energy Action Plan” (“SEAP”) milestones. It will remain
committed to financing bankable power and energy projects that have a positive systemic
effect in the power sector—including use of best available technology, promotion of
renewable sources, energy efficiency and environmental standards—for both state and
private operators. The EBRD will also through technical assistance support the development
of a legal framework that supports their market penetration, and strengthen regulatory
agencies and tariff environment.
14.
In keeping with its transition mandate, the EBRD will concentrate its operations and
policy dialogue on promotion of the private sector and seek to further the diversification of
ownership in the economy. To that end, it will selectively work with creditworthy stateowned companies if deemed consistent with the bank’s transition objectives, i.e., by
requiring commercial viability, good corporate governance, and best business practices, in
particular when privatization prospects are realistic, but also when, in the absence of an
imminent privatization plan, there are opportunities to promote reform . In doing so, the bank
will carefully balance its work with national companies to contribute to separation between
ownership and regulation.
15.
The EBRD will continue to ensure that all of its operations in Kazakhstan are subject
to the bank’s 2008 Environmental and Social Policy and incorporate, where appropriate,
Environmental and Social Action Plans.
Main trends in Kazakhstan portfolio over 2009–2010
Notable progress was made in the infrastructure sector
16.
South-West Corridor Road Project. In March 2009, the EBRD signed a
$180 million sovereign loan for the rehabilitation of West China - West Europe International
Road Transit Corridor, a key international transport link connecting Europe with China. The
EBRD financing will upgrade a 102 km section between the border with Russia and the city
of Aktobe. Other sections of the corridor will be rehabilitated with loans provided by the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank, as well as
with budget financing from the Government.

11
17.
Kaztemirtrans project. In March 2010, the Bank signed a $50 million senior loan to
support this important subsidiary of Kazakhstan Temir Zholi in its rolling stock renewal
program.
The EBRD continues to focus on power and energy sector
18.
At present the power sector is suffering from significant inefficiency and capacity
underinvestment. As a response, the EBRD initiated and implemented Kazakhstan
Sustainable Energy Finance Facility program (KAZSEFF). Under this program the EBRD
via bank-partners will support private sector investments in energy efficiency and renewables
with a $75 million framework. Kazakhstan bank-partners will provide loans to local
companies to promote energy efficiency investments. Bank Center Credit with $10 million
and ATF Bank with a $30.5 million loan are the first recipients under this facility.
19.
In March 2009, the EBRD approved its first equity investment in the power sector of
Kazakhstan, and is investing up to KZT 9.2 billion (€46 million equivalent) to acquire a stake
in the private power company Central-Asian Electric Power Corporation (CAEPCO). The
capital injection will be used for the company’s investment program up to 2013, including
the upgrade and rehabilitation of CAEPCO’s generation and distribution assets to improve
efficiency, reliability and performance. Also, in February 2010, the bank signed a
$51.5 million financing for CHP Aktobe rehabilitation.
The EBRD continues its support and cooperation with Kazakhstan’s partners
20.
In May 2009, the EBRD has approved two loans worth a total $100 million to ATF
Bank to support lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and to promote energy
efficiency of industrial companies.
21.
As of May 2009 the total bank’s investments in the Kazakhstan’s banking system
reached €1.5 billion including: bank equity €192 million; bank lending €674 million; nonbank financial institutions €47 million; SME finance €319 million. In 2008, the EBRD
committed loans and guarantees under the Regional Trade facilitation program was about
€50 million.

12
The EBRD made good progress in financing corporate sectors, especially agribusiness and
oil services sectors
22.
During 2009 the EBRD signed 4 projects in the agribusiness sector for the total
EBRD finance $63 million. In 2009 and 2010 the bank supported KazExportAstyk, leading
grain producing and trading company with two $15 million loans.
23.
In March 2010, the EBRD signed a $50 million senior loan for Petrolinvest,
supporting the exploration and oil production operations of the company, demonstrating its
support to FDI and mid-sized operators committed to transparency and high operational
standards.
Priorities for the coming year
24.
In industry, commerce and agribusiness, the bank will support the industrial
diversification strategy of the country while financing commercially viable, transparent
projects across key industries.
25.
In the financial sector, the bank will continue to provide long-term debt, to support
the equity of banks and reduce the reliance of the sector on the state, with the long term aim
of facilitating the introduction of strategic international investors and to reconnect banks to
the international financial markets. In addition, EBRD will have an important role to play in
working with private equity funds and non-bank financial institutions to promote the
development of the local capital market as a complement to bank lending. Transparency of
shareholding structures and the willingness to improve corporate governance will be a
precondition to any future EBRD financing in Kazakhstan.
26.
Power shortages are an important constraint on private sector development,
especially in Southern Kazakhstan. To support the government with regulatory
improvements and tariff reform will be key for EBRD’s operations in this area. The EBRD
will focus on implementation of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan, financing priority
investments in power generation and supporting energy efficiency and the use of renewable
energy. Continued technical assistance will be given to improve sector regulation.
27.
The transport and communication infrastructure will be key to the country’s longterm competitiveness and regional cooperation and integration. In addition to road
infrastructure development, the EBRD will support the ongoing reform of the railway sector
and financing improvements of railway infrastructure and rolling stock. Development of
municipal and environmental infrastructure will be a priority.

ANNEX IV. KAZAKHSTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 13, 2010)
1.
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994.
As of May 2010, total public sector loan commitments amounted to $1.5 billion, covering
17 loans in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, and water supply, sanitation, and irrigation. Kazakhstan is no longer
eligible for concessional resources from the Asian Development Fund. As of March 2010,
total loan disbursements amounted to $989 million. In recent years, ADB activities for
Kazakhstan have focused on road transportation, SME development, water distribution, and
private sector. Regional cooperation is a key theme.
2.
ADB's public sector operations in Kazakhstan picked up in 2008. A $700 million
Multi-tranche Financing Facility (MFF) was approved by ADB in November 2008 for the
CAREC Transport Corridor project. In 2009, ADB signed two loan agreements for the total
amount of $527 million to reconstruct Zhambyl Oblast sections of the International Transit
Corridor "Western Europe-Western PRC". The Corridor project will improve a major
transport corridor across the country, linking eastern and western neighbors, as well as
opening up north-south routes. This is to be complemented by a proposed loan in 2010 for
reconstruction of Aktau–Beineu Road section located in Mangistau oblast (western part of
the country), which will connect Kazakhstan to its neighboring countries through the Caspian
Sea.
3.
ADB provided Kazakhstan assistance to help mitigate negative impacts of the
global economic crisis. In September 2009, ADB provided a $500 million loan to
Kazakhstan to support a government-run crisis-mitigation action plan and the employmentgeneration program. The loan was provided under ADB's $3 billion Countercyclical Support
Facility (CSF), which was established to support ADB's developing member countries to
increase fiscal spending to counter global turmoil. The Kazakhstan CSF loan helped the
government shoulder anti-crisis expenditure requirements and thereby financed a part of the
budget deficit. As part of the loan program activities, ADB will closely monitor the fiscal
stimulus package to ensure its effective use, as well as assess microeconomic and financial
sector performances.
4.
As requested by the government, ADB is to provide support for Kazakhstan's
SME development, under a $500 million MFF in 2010. This intervention will address the
government's important funding need and support the development of more competitive
SMEs and a more efficient financial sector. This will result in greater employment and
decreased poverty and lead to more sustainable economic growth through diversification.
5.
To assist the government in implementing the State Drinking Water Sector
Program for 2002–2010, ADB provided a loan of $34.6 million in 2004 for basic water
supply services and a capacity-building program designed to improve the living and health

15
conditions of selected rural communities. It covered three oblasts of Kazakhstan: Akmola
and North and South Kazakhstan. Given the State Drinking Water Sector Program extension
up to 2015 and its focus on both rural and urban areas, ADB may continue its assistance to
the water supply and sanitation sector of Kazakhstan with a new loan proposed for small and
secondary towns.
6.
ADB’s private sector operations in Kazakhstan began in 2006, and has historically
focused on the banking sector, with five private sector financings in the amount of
$375 million. ADB's previous interventions with the banking sector through its private sector
operation arm raised many issues and lessons, which will need to be addressed and reflected
in the future proposed projects. Near-term ADB private sector financing prospects are in
private infrastructure.

16
ANNEX V. KAZAKHSTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas
are monetary and balance of payments statistics, with remaining deficiencies in national accounts.
National Accounts: The quality of GDP statistics is affected by the limited coverage of small businesses in
selected activities such as retail and construction. While some progress has been made in compiling and
reporting GDP by final expenditure consistent with output-based measures, dissemination of quarterly GDP
series data is conducted on a discrete basis only.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts consistent
with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However, as a result of the
reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units, difficulties have arisen with
regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) complied by the
central bank have a few inconsistencies, and a technical assistance mission in January 2009 provided several
recommendations.
Balance of payments: In general, the balance of payments is compiled in concordance with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). However, foreign direct investment statistics are not fully
in line with the standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch offices of foreign companies operating in the
construction sector are considered nonresident entities. This leads to discrepancies with national accounts
statistics where this activity is treated as domestic production. In addition, the errors and omissions have been
large and increasing.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Kazakhstan
On July 12, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan.1
Background
The sudden stop in capital inflows in the early stages of the global financial crisis
exposed the underlying vulnerabilities in the banking system. The combination of weak
economic growth, currency induced credit exposure, and increased uncertainty led to a
sharp worsening of banks’ balance sheets. Four financial institutions were forced to
restructure their external liabilities.
Drawing upon savings in the National Oil Fund, the authorities responded with a large
scale and timely policy package that helped stabilize banks. This support, alongside
enhanced deposit insurance and the external nature of the debt restructuring, mitigated
deposit withdrawals. Nevertheless, the banking system continues to face significant
difficulties. Nonperforming loans have risen sharply, increasingly driven by nonrestructuring banks. Capital adequacy excluding restructuring banks remains above the
minimum requirement, but the capital base has declined, and bank profitability is under
pressure. Although banks’ aggregate liquidity position is comfortable, credit dynamics
remain weak, with annual credit growth plummeting into negative territory.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Most macroeconomic indicators worsened in 2009. Real GDP growth slowed sharply,
although a strong rebound in the last quarter helped it reach 1¼ percent for the year as
a whole. Exports fell significantly, reflecting lower oil prices and a decline in non-oil sales
abroad. Notwithstanding the fall in imports from weaker demand, the current account
shifted into a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP. Average annual inflation slowed in 2009
and has remained relatively contained at around 7½ percent (the end-of-period inflation
was 6 ¼ percent).
Countercyclical fiscal policy helped limit the economic slowdown, but resulted in an
expansion of the deficit and public debt. Monetary policy was accommodative as the
economy remained weak and inflation pressures declined. The devaluation of the tenge
in February 2009 helped stabilize market pressures, and was followed a year later by a
widening of the trading band. Since then, the tenge has gained about two percent and
the central bank has accumulated international reserves.
Staff projects real GDP growth of around 4 percent in 2010, driven mainly by the oil,
gas, and mining sectors. The external outlook is expected to recover, with an
improvement in the current account position, led by a strong rebound in exports (in
particular oil) combined with a relatively slow recovery in import growth. Average
inflation is projected to remain around the current level of 7½ percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for their prudent macroeconomic policies and swift response to the financial
crisis. Large-scale, coordinated public support—backed by ample resources
accumulated in good times—had helped stabilize the banking system and stimulated the
economy. The near-term growth outlook has improved, driven by tradable sectors, and
inflation is expected to remain under control. Directors observed, however, that broader
economic activity remains constrained by stagnant credit growth and banking sector
difficulties. The key policy priorities are to restore financial sector health and to gradually
unwind support to both banks and economic sectors, while ensuring sufficient liquidity
and promoting more balanced growth.
Directors stressed the urgency of implementing a comprehensive and transparent bank
resolution strategy, aimed at reducing nonperforming loans. This should be
accompanied by a full assessment of recapitalization needs, and by improvements in
the regulatory and supervisory frameworks to address key underlying vulnerabilities,
notably excessive reliance on foreign funding, weak governance, and risky lending
practices. Directors encouraged the authorities to formulate contingency plans should a
need for additional public support arise. They also stressed that actions to restore bank
soundness should take precedence over specific measures to promote credit growth in
the short term.
Directors supported the plans to withdraw the fiscal stimulus gradually, while prioritizing
expenditures and strengthening tax administration. They recommended that the
authorities weigh carefully the costs and benefits of borrowing vis-à-vis using oil savings
to finance the deficit. Directors encouraged the development of a well-defined mediumterm plan for fiscal consolidation, allowing for increased savings of oil revenues and
steadily reducing the non-oil deficit.

3
Directors noted the staff assessment that the exchange rate is broadly aligned with longrun equilibrium. However, they considered that greater exchange rate flexibility, once
conditions in the banking system have stabilized, would enhance the economy’s ability
to absorb external shocks and provide additional monetary policy leverage. They agreed
that real interest rates should be kept positive to maintain depositor confidence, and
cautioned against the use of subsidized interest rates. The plans to develop domestic
capital markets are a welcome step to complement de-dollarization efforts.
Directors noted that Kazakhstan is set to benefit from its mineral resource wealth over
the long term. The government’s medium-term development strategy appropriately
focuses on reducing dependence on commodities and increasing productivity and
competitiveness in the non-oil economy. Directors highlighted the important role of a
well-capitalized and well-regulated financial system in facilitating economic
diversification, and urged sustained efforts to improve governance, transparency, and
the business environment. They also encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue
WTO accession.

Statement by Mr. Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Republic of Kazakhstan and
Mr. Daulet Orynbayev, Advisor to Executive Director
July 12, 2010
The Kazakhstani authorities thank the staff for a productive dialogue and helpful policy
recommendations. The Article IV consultation with the Fund and the provided technical
assistance are fully appreciated.
The Outlook for Growth
The Kazakhstani economy started to recover in the second part of 2009, thanks to stronger
trade and activity in the oil, mining and manufacturing sectors. Fiscal and monetary policies
were supportive of economic activity last year. Policy stimulus will be continued this year.
Thanks to skillful macro-economic management, real output growth in 2009 remained
positive at 1.2 percent. During the first quarter of 2010, GDP growth was slightly above 7
percent. For the entire year 2010, growth is projected to exceed 4 percent for the economy as
a whole, and to exceed 8 percent in the oil sector. The non-oil sector growth is rebounding
strongly from last year’s low to 3.6 percent. In the medium term, growth is expected to
further recover to its potential, estimated to be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 percent. This would
be lower than the average 10 percent annual growth registered in the period 2000–2007,
when activity in the construction and real estate sectors was particularly buoyant.
The Financial Sector
The banking sector proved to be overextended in real estate financing, domestically and
abroad, and relied to a significant extent on foreign funding.
When the subprime crisis emerged in 2007 in the United States, the real estate sector in
Kazakhstan was soon hit by a severe correction, triggering significant loan portfolio losses
for banks. Rolling over of foreign funding became increasingly expensive, if at all possible.
As was documented in last year’s Article IV consultation, large scale public capital and
liquidity support was critical in supporting the banking sector. Earlier this year, the external
debts of Alliance Bank and BTA, two major Kazakhstani banks, were successfully
restructured without hurting the confidence of the domestic depositor base of the Kazakhstani
banks.
Although the Kazakhstani banking sector has been stabilized, and has now adequate liquidity
and capital, the amount of non-performing loans remains high. The staff has formulated
valuable advice on the needed broad actions that could help reduce NPLs and effectively
rehabilitate the financial system, so as to avoid that a high stock of NPLs could act as a
significant drag on growth.

2
The Financial Supervision Agency will continue to closely monitor and credibly address
weaknesses and risks in the banking sector. The authorities will determine any need for
additional capital and assess banks’ contingency plans for raising capital when needed. Their
attention will also focus on reducing foreign borrowing by banks, especially short term, and
to improve banks’ governance. Unwinding of public support for banks will be done gradually
to minimize market disorders, while continued support for lending to SMEs will be done
with the needed vigilance to avoid future bad debts.
With an adequately capitalized and well-regulated financial system in place, the process of
de-dollarization should accelerate and implementing plans to deepen domestic financial
markets should further progress.
The Council on Financial Stability and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic
of Kazakhstan was established with special Presidential Decree as a consultative body under
the President for interaction between state bodies on the matters of preserving financial
stability and effective development of the financial sector. The Council comprises high-level
officials from NBK, FSA, Ministry of Finance, Antimonopoly Agency and Presidential
Administration. The main tasks of the Council are assistance and making proposals on
implementation of macro-prudential regulation aimed at financial system stability and
minimization of systemic risks. This policy forum is to enact tighter macroprudential policies
to limit credit boombust cycles, including prudential measures to manage unhedged credit
risk, and countercyclical bank regulations on capital and provisioning.
Samruk-Kazyna, a public company, has been successfully managed through the crisis
resolving complicated financial issues. In 2010, the company’s assets totaled over USD 70
billion. The financial situation with the restructured banks has improved. In the medium
term, the shares in the banking sector will be sold.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
In line with recommendations by the staff, since the start of the crisis, the central bank has
pegged the exchange rate in order to contain the risks related to significant amount of
liabilities in foreign currency. This policy has worked well and provided relative stability,
even in the wake of the 20 percent devaluation which was implemented successfully in
February 2009, thanks to a skillful handling of the delicate operation by the National Bank of
Kazakhstan. The staff advises to allow more exchange rate flexibility when the situation
becomes more stable. The authorities agree with the wisdom and common sense in
recommending a managed floating, the success of which depends much on good judgment
used for such management. It will inspire confidence for markets when gradual exchange rate
evolutions take place that are beneficial for the diversified development of the economy. The
timing of changes in exchange rate management will also depend on exchange rate policies
of major trading partners.

3
The authorities take note that staff’s “exchange rate assessment shows no evidence of
systematic deviation from equilibrium”. Monetary policy will remain focused on maintaining
inflation within the projected 6 - 8 percent range. The monetary authorities are well aware of
the need to protect the depositor base in tenge by positive real interest rates and to properly
manage domestic liquidity.
Fiscal Policy
Kazakhstan’s fiscal policy has been constantly prudent, even during the past crisis years. The
authorities’ decision to avoid to bail out two private banks at what could have been an
excessive fiscal cost, is fully in line with their traditional prudent fiscal stance. Prior to the
crisis in 2007, Kazakhstan registered an annual fiscal surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP, a gross
public debt of 5.9 percent and a net positive public asset position of almost 15 percent of
GDP thanks to a sizable National Fund equivalent to 21 percent of GDP.
With fiscal space available to support economic activity and to assist the financial sector in
an orderly manner, the fiscal balance was allowed last year, to swing into a moderate deficit
of 1.5 percent. This year, the deficit will reach 3.2 percent of GDP. In addition, the total offbudget anti-crisis spending is estimated at about 5 percent of GDP. From next year onwards,
the fiscal stimulus will be gradually withdrawn with the fiscal balance expected to become
positive by 2013. Consequently, gross public debt is projected to rise moderately in the
coming years. At the same time, with oil production scheduled to come fully on stream, the
endowment of the National Fund is projected to grow at a brisk pace to reach US$ 50 billion
by 2014 and approach US$ 60 billion by 2015 (depending on world oil prices).
Structural Policies and Strategies to Diversify the Economy
In 1997, the authorities introduced the strategy “Kazakhstan – 2030”. So far, its
implementation is on track.
The authorities agree with staff that a decline in world commodities’ market prices poses
risks for the country’s economic growth. Following earlier staff recommendations, they
advance with the diversification of the economy. The authorities aim to double the average
labor productivity with a targeted unemployment rate below 5 percent.
The 2010-2014 accelerated industrialization program sets out future work. The authorities
intend to introduce more than 200 innovative industrial projects worth investments totaling
USD 50 billion. In June 2010, 72 projects for an initial USD 2.5 billion have been initiated.
Another 72 projects are planned to start during the second half of the year. The projects
target developing infrastructure, processing of natural recourses, industrial production, and
the development of a chemical industry. Hundred thousand new jobs should be created by the
end of this year.

4
The country’s mining and oil sectors are highly advanced and developed. The mining
sectors’ output is projected to double and oil production could increase up to 2.7 million
barrels a day by 2020, up from 400,000 barrels in 1994, and 1.5 million barrels a day in
2009. By 2020, the mining sector is expected to produce more than 70 tons of refined gold
annually and metal processing facilities cover most of the domestic demand for steel and
other metal products.
The authorities project that agricultural output could significantly increase thanks to
investment in new transportation infrastructure. By 2014, the sector should supply more than
80 percent of the domestic food demand. Grain production will grow further and the country
will remain an important exporter.
The downturn of the construction sector has demonstrated a high dependency on imported
materials. Domestic production of construction materials will grow, and within a few years,
will cover most of the domestic demand.
