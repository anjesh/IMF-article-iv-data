Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation, Fifth Review Under the ThreeYear Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Request
for Waiver of Nonobservance of Performance Criterion
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Mark Plant and Anthony Boote
December 19, 2008
Main topics
Article IV consultation. The key issue is how to sustain Rwanda’s recent economic
performance, encourage broad-based growth, and reduce poverty. This would require
developing the country’s production base, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and
accelerating structural reforms.
Program review. The program is broadly on track. Economic growth and the external position
are in line with program objectives, but inflation stemming from world commodity prices and
domestic demand is higher than expected. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June
2008 were met and structural policies are generally proceeding as envisaged. Staff supports the
authorities’ request for waiver of nonobservance of a structural performance criterion for endJune 2008 and recommends the completion of the fifth review of the PRGF, based on remedial
measures taken and policy commitments for the remainder of the program.
The exchange rate system is classified as a conventional peg. Rwanda has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, and maintains a system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Mission
Discussions were held in Rwanda during October 22–November 4, 2008. The staff team
comprised Ms. Murgasova (head), Messrs. Mitchell, Sobolev and Gorbanyov (all AFR),
assisted by Mr. Engström, the resident representative. The mission met with Mr. Musoni, the
Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mr. Kanimba, the Governor of the National Bank of
Rwanda, other senior government and central bank officials, and representatives of the donor
and business communities.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Rwanda has sustained strong economic growth over the last decade, but the country is
still very poor. Sound macroeconomic and structural policies backed by substantial donor
assistance have led to macroeconomic stability, robust growth and low inflation, a
comfortable level of international reserves, and significantly reduced external debt. Yet
poverty is prevalent.
The main challenge for the medium term is to address Rwanda’s development needs
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Stimulating higher growth requires addressing
Rwanda’s severe infrastructure gap and low agricultural yields, developing the financial and
private sectors, and promoting savings. Yet the required scaling up of public investment must
be pursued in a manner consistent with preserving macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability. Structural reforms must be accelerated to improve public sector efficiency and
effectiveness.
Policy implementation under the PRGF program has been satisfactory. Growth in 2008
is expected to reach 8.5 percent primarily because of buoyant private sector activity.
However, 12-month inflation gradually increased to over 20 percent in the third quarter as a
result of the international commodity price pass-through and domestic demand pressures. All
quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2008 were met. Because of administrative
delays, the end-September indicative target for the net accumulation of domestic arrears was
missed, but the authorities expect to eliminate the arrears by end-2008. Although structural
policies are generally on track, the completion and publication of the Public Financial
Management reform action plan for 2008-10, a structural PC for end-June, was not achieved
until September. Staff recommends a waiver because the deviation was temporary.
Program risks have increased. Short-term risks to economic growth and the balance of
payments have emerged because of the global financial crisis and economic slowdown. The
Rwandan franc has also appreciated in real terms in 2008. The authorities have committed to
monitoring developments closely and to increase the flexibility of the exchange rate as
appropriate. Further, they have agreed to contain fiscal spending and tighten monetary policy
to rein in inflation and maintain an adequate level of reserves.
Nevertheless, the medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth is
projected at 6 percent and with supportive macroeconomic policies inflation could decline to
5 percent over the medium term. Continued progress in structural reforms would make the
public sector more efficient and effective in tax policy and administration, public financial
management, and capacity building, and create an enabling environment for private sector
development. Progress in these areas would also help garner donor support. Rising
government revenues and substantial donor assistance would allow for more government
spending on priorities and infrastructure projects with limited domestic financing.
The staff recommends the completion of the fifth review of the PRGF.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Rwanda has made great strides in economic performance in recent years, but
poverty has not been significantly alleviated.
•

Growth has been strong (Figure 1). Real GDP growth was broadly in line with that
in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the last decade.1 The main sectors
driving economic activity—services and manufacturing—have been assisted by
favorable terms of trade, and inflows of aid and foreign direct investment (FDI).
However, agriculture, which supports 80 percent of the population, is highly
susceptible to shocks, particularly weather-related, and has expanded slowly because
of low productivity and poor land use practices.

Prudent macroeconomic policies have helped stabilize the economy
(Figures 2–4). Following the policy advice of the last Article IV consultation and
subsequent PRGF reviews, sound fiscal spending and limited recourse to domestic
financing facilitated a monetary policy stance that contained inflation on average to
single digits but allowed moderate growth in credit to the private sector.2 Rising
revenues and assistance from international donors created fiscal space to scale up
public spending, especially on pro-poor initiatives. The external position has
strengthened as donor flows and FDI offset the trade deficit, allowing an adequate
reserve cover. External debt was significantly reduced with the help of the HIPC
Initiative and MDRI debt relief.

On the recommendation of AFRITAC East, staff adopted the National Institute of Statistics’ (NIS) revision to
the national accounts for 2004 to 2007.

In the second half of 2008 inflation rose to double digits as a result of rising world fuel and food prices and
domestic demand pressures. See paragraph 17.

Structural reforms have been far-reaching, but capacity constraints have
slowed implementation. The structural reform agenda—economic liberalization,
public expenditure management, and financial sector development—supported by
the PRGF arrangement is on track, and good progress was made in responding to
Fund advice (Box 1).
Box 1. Progress in Main Structural Reforms since 2006

Advice from the past Article IV consultation and
previous PRGF reviews

Status

Strengthen public financial management.

Financial procedures manuals to accompany the Organic Law
on State Finances and Property were issued in May 2007. The
first consolidated government financial statement (covering
2006) was presented to the Office of the Auditor General in
June 2007 and the statement for 2007 in March 2008. The
new Law on Public Procurement, signed in December 2007,
strengthened regulation, decentralized public procurement to
government institutions, and established the Rwanda Public
Procurement Authority. A revised medium-term PFM strategy
and action plan was finalized.

Reform the civil service.

A comprehensive review of the wage structure of the public
sector, including fringe benefits and wages, and transfers to
local governments was completed in October 2007.

Deepen the financial sector and strengthen
financial intermediation and bank soundness.

An over-the-counter debt market was established in February
2008 after passage of accounting legislation consistent with
international standards. Capital requirements for banks and
microfinancial institutions were increased in January 2008
further strengthening and consolidating the financial system.
An insurance bill and a microfinance bill providing the legal
and regulatory framework for insurance companies and
microfinance institutions was submitted to Parliament in July
2008. The Union des Banques Populaires du Rwanda
(UBPR), a large microfinance network, was restructured and
reorganized into a commercial bank thus improving access to
banking facilities.

Lower cost of doing business.

A commercial justice, business and land registration program
was implemented in July 2007 and has been instrumental in
eliminating company registration fees and reducing the
number of procedures for land application, allocation and
registration, building permits, and international trade.

Privatize public commercial enterprises.

Coffee and tea factories (among others) were privatized.

Poverty is still pervasive. Despite the strong economic growth over the period, the
incidence of poverty only declined by 3.5 percentage points in 2006 from
60.4 percent in 2000. The rate of poverty reduction will be insufficient to meet some
of the MDGs, though Rwanda has made significant progress in achieving universal
primary education, gender equality and empowering of women, and reducing child
mortality (Table 5).
II. KEY ECONOMIC CHALLENGES

2.
The main challenge now for Rwanda is to address its development needs while
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Doing so will require:
•

Increasing productive capacity, through investment in physical and human capital,
and job-creating growth to reduce poverty.

•

Following prudent macroeconomic policies. The required scaling up of public
investment must be pursued in a manner consistent with preserving macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability, which are prerequisites to growth and poverty
reduction.

•

Accelerating structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and
effectiveness.
A. Increasing Productive Capacity

3.
To reach the medium-term objectives, Rwanda needs to address the most
important obstacles to economic growth: reduce its severe infrastructure gap and skilledlabor shortage, further develop the financial sector, and improve the business environment.
Reducing the infrastructure gap
Increase agricultural
productivity. Given little
scope to increase arable land,
vulnerability to shocks, and a
high rate of population
growth, Rwanda is planning
investments to ease pressures
on land, reduce soil erosion,
and increase irrigation
systems. The intent is to
improve food production,
create employment, and
increase rural incomes.

Improve transportation links. Because Rwanda is landlocked, transportation costs
are high and routes are slow. This severely limits the country’s access to global
markets. The domestic road network is being improved and Rwanda is expected
to benefit from regional efforts to rehabilitate key corridors, such as the World
Bank’s East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation project. Rwanda is also
giving priority to developing information and communications technology and the
services sectors to circumvent transportation constraints.

•

Developing the financial sector and promoting savings. The banking system has
been significantly restructured in recent years. Banking soundness indicators have
improved and the legal and supervisory framework has strengthened, but weaknesses
remain (Box 2). The level of financial intermediation is relatively low and credit is
concentrated in a few sectors. Reforms outlined in the Financial Sector Development
Plan should promote domestic savings and improve access to credit, particularly for
the agricultural sector.

•

Improving the quality of labor. Public spending needs to focus on primary and
secondary education, vocational training and incentives for on-the-job training to
reduce the shortage of skilled blue-collar workers; regional labor migration should
help increase the supply of white-collar workers over the short and medium term.

13
Box 2. Banking Soundness and Financial Sector Development
(a) Banking Soundness
The soundness and performance of the banking system have strengthened significantly since 2005 (Table 6).
Capital adequacy has improved because the capital requirement was raised in early 2008. Improvements in
the quality of bank asset portfolios and the reduction in nonperforming loans (NPLs) mainly reflect the
National Bank of Rwanda’s (NBR) enforcement of the write-off regulation implemented in October 2007
requiring banks to clean up their loan portfolios; as well as banks’ stronger loan recovery and collection
efforts. The increase in bank profitability over the period is attributable to the increase in loans by
59.4 percent in the first quarter of 2008, improved efficiency in banks’ operations, high net interest margins
due to the low cost of funds, and declining NPLs. The efficiency ratio for banks improved from 79.9 percent
at end-December 2005 to 38.6 percent at end-June 2008.
Nevertheless, credit and operational risks could jeopardize the banking system. The credit culture is weak
and in most banks loan-underwriting standards, collection efforts, loan monitoring, and credit policies are
weak. Operational risk is high as all banks suffer from cases of fraud. Inadequate internal controls and
audits, and the lack of risk management systems all contribute to this situation. In general, inadequate staff
capacity is a major problem.
The NBR has urged banks to establish risk management systems and train staff. The NBR plans to improve
its supervisory tools through the establishment of (i) an early warning system to detect anomalies and
financial difficulties to complement its risk-based supervision and continuous off-site monitoring and (ii) a
prompt corrective action (PCA) program to address deteriorating financial conditions.
(b) Financial Sector Development Plan
The 2005 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) characterized Rwanda’s financial sector as shallow,
undiversified, and incapable of adequately supporting its developmental objectives. The assessment
recognized that the financial sector was dominated by an oligopolistic banking sector with relatively high
lending rates, extremely low insurance penetration, and undiversified financial products. The FSAP
recommended that the Government establish an action plan and identify the need for policy changes,
capacity building and technical assistance to implement these changes.
In response, the Government drafted a comprehensive Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) with
support from the IMF, the World Bank, and other donors. The FSDP, finalized in May, 2007—following
discussions with key stakeholders and approval by the Cabinet—is a comprehensive policy framework and
a detailed action program to achieve the following objectives:
(a) Enhance access to and the affordability of banking and other financial services. This included the
support for the development and outreach of a healthy and properly regulated and managed microfinance
sector in order to extend financial services to the unbanked and help reduce poverty.
(b) Enhance savings mobilization by creating the appropriate environment, building institutions and
fostering market incentives for the development of long-term financial instruments and an efficient capital
market.
(c) Develop an appropriate legal, regulatory and policy framework for non-bank financial institutions
(pension funds, insurance companies, etc.) involved in contractual savings regulation; and
(d) Reorganize and modernize the national payments system.
Many donors are providing support in accordance with the action matrices that identified activities and
priority actions, responsibilities, technical assistance needs, sequencing and schedules.

Supervision”, November 2008; and First Initiative “Rwanda Financial Sector Development Program Report”, May

Reducing the cost of doing business. Rwanda scores high on ease of starting a
business, dealing with construction permits, and enforcing contracts, but much lower
in almost all other categories of the World Bank’s Doing Business Report.3 To reduce
the costs of tax compliance for private sector companies, additional measures should
be taken to improve efficiency of tax collection procedures and streamline the process
of tax appeals. Further legal, institutional, and governance reforms are required to
improve trade and property registration, commercial justice, and establish principles
of modern corporate governance.

4.
The authorities have articulated a medium-term strategy in their PRSP that
addresses these obstacles, in consultation with development partners, through a Public
Investment Program (PIP), a Financial Sector Development Plan, and a Rural Development
Program to promote private-sector led growth and create employment over the medium term.
They also recently consolidated and realigned the activities of eight government agencies
into the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to eliminate inefficiencies in operations and
streamline the bureaucracy in order to advance private sector development initiatives
(MEFP ¶8).
B. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability and Debt Sustainability
5.
While scaling up public investment is a critical requirement, it must be done in a
manner that is consistent with macroeconomic stability. Rwanda will require substantial
resources to achieve its development aspirations and the MDGs.4 Because the availability of
grant financing for some infrastructure projects is uncertain, the authorities are considering
external debt financing and public private partnerships (PPPs). Managing the impact of fiscal
policies on domestic demand will be critical in containing inflation and preventing an undue
crowding out of the private sector. The medium-term fiscal strategy should therefore:
•

3
4

Use growing external aid for financing public investment to help achieve a supply
response and manage the macroeconomic implications of increased aid. Scaling up
of import-intensive public investment will mitigate the impact of aid flows on the real
exchange rate in the short run and address Rwanda’s infrastructure gap. Over the
medium term, capital spending would be gradually reduced to allow for higher
recurrent social spending, which would correspondingly increase the domestic
demand impact of fiscal policies. To implement the spending shift, fiscal and
monetary policies must be closely coordinated.
Rwanda ranked 139 (of 181 countries) in the 2008 World Bank Doing Business report.

The government’s analysis suggests that a substantial scaling up of aid would be required to achieve all
MDGs. The Fund analyzed the macroeconomic impact of scaling up aid to US$85 per capita, consistent with
the G8 Gleneagles declaration. For Rwanda that would mean an increase in aid of about 1 percent of GDP,
which would be insufficient to reach all MDGs.

15
•

Improve the prioritization and efficiency of expenditures. The authorities indicated
that they are strengthening the institutional framework for the PIP and are developing
guidelines for identifying investment selection criteria and project prioritization that
maximizes the return on investments and safeguards public debt sustainability. They
agreed that the formulation of the PIP and better medium-term expenditure
frameworks together with improvements in project monitoring and execution could
encourage international donors to provide more grants or concessional financing.

•

Properly assess and limit fiscal risks, which are not anticipated in budget estimates.
The assessment of fiscal risk should extend to contingent liabilities, particularly those
associated with government guarantees of public enterprises or with PPPs. Fiscal
institutions and legal and accounting structures will require reinforcement to
effectively limit such risks. Staff emphasized that transparency or disclosure will be
enhanced by annexing a risk statement to the budget document. The authorities
agreed with the proposals and indicated that they would include the assessment of
contingent liabilities in the guidelines being developed for the PIP and the Debt
Management Strategy.

6.
Monetary policy must be more proactive in managing liquidity and moderating
inflation. In the short term, the NBR must take steps to reduce inflation (which has risen in
the third quarter of 2008 to over 20 percent as a result of increasing world commodity prices
and domestic demand pressures) back to single digits. To do this the NBR must be vigilant in
monitoring inflationary developments and liquidity forecasts and use suitable monetary
policy tools to reduce the inflationary pressures. Concerned about undue exchange rate
appreciation, the NBR relied through 2007 primarily on open market operations to sterilize
excess liquidity, and the exchange rate remained stable.5 This approach, however, is not
consistent with reserve money targeting, which requires subordinating foreign currency sales
to monetary policy objectives. Since mid-2008 the NBR has allowed more exchange rate
flexibility.
7.
Increasing NBR policy interest rates to positive levels in real terms would help
reduce inflationary pressures and mobilize domestic savings for investment. In 2007 the
NBR reduced its nominal rates and maturities on policy instruments in an attempt to lower
the costs of sterilization. Consequently, commercial banks deposit rates, which typically
follow the rates on policy instruments, also declined and in the high inflationary environment
have become increasingly negative in real terms. Reversing this trend would also

US dollar.

16
complement the NBR’s recent efforts to encourage savings mobilization by boosting
confidence in the banking system and making it more competitive (MEFP ¶24).6
8.
Reaccumulation of unsustainable levels of debt must be prevented. The DSA
indicates that all external debt indicators are below the sustainability thresholds and
consequently Rwanda’s debt distress classification has been revised from high to moderate
(Figure 7). This improvement over the previous DSA (Country Report No. 08/89) mainly
reflects stronger export earnings in 2007 and 2008 and a lower external borrowing over the
medium-term because of higher committed grants and lower primary deficits. While the debt
indicators in the baseline scenarios are benign, shocks to the small export base or a reduction
in the concessionality of financing would cause a protracted breach of the threshold on the
present value of debt-to-export ratio. The authorities have stated that future borrowing will be
guided by the principles established in their comprehensive debt management strategy. The
main objective of the strategy is to ensure that the financing requirements and repayments are
met at least cost with prudent risk considerations while keeping debt sustainable.7

Staff advice is consistent with the recommendations of the MCM TA mission to Rwanda (September 22–
October 7, 2008) for (i) improving the efficiency of monetary policy operations and managing bank liquidity;
(ii) developing interbank markets in local currency and foreign exchange, and (iii) improving the financial
health of banks and their compliance with prudential norms and regulations.

In the MEFP (¶18) the authorities foreshadow their intention to seek financing from the Eximbank of China
for rehabilitating roads, with concessionality below 50 percent. An evaluation of this borrowing will likely be
made at the sixth PRGF review.

17
9.
Rwanda will need to enhance trade not only to increase growth and reduce
poverty, but also to maintain external debt sustainability. Despite a recent pick up in
export receipts, Rwanda’s export base (goods and services) is still small at less than
10 percent of GDP, which limits its capacity to carry external debt. The World Bank suggests
that encouraging subsistence farmers to increase production for trade could significantly
reduce poverty, diversify exports, and reduce Rwanda’s vulnerability to shocks.8 The
authorities’ export promotion measures are summarized in the MEFP (¶30).
10.
The authorities noted that trade integration was likely to advance under the
Customs Union of the East African Community (EAC).9 They (i) indicated that lowering
the common external tariff and eliminating non-tariff barriers in the EAC common market
agreement was planned from July 200910, and (ii) emphasized the membership offers scope
for leveraging improvements in regional infrastructure, labor migration, and the business
climate.11 Staff assessed the potential revenue impact of Rwanda joining the EAC to be
marginal, less than 0.4 percent of GDP. Discussions on a full Economic Partnership
Agreement with the EU are expected to be finalized by mid-2009.
11.
The authorities agreed with staff that the real effective exchange rate (REER)
was broadly consistent with economic fundamentals (Box 3). Its appreciation since 2004
reflects the scaling-up of aid and the associated increase in fiscal spending (Figures 3 and 4).
However, the acceleration of inflation to double-digits in 2008, the appreciation of the
U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and other major reserve currencies, and the relative stability
of the exchange rate of the Rwandan franc to the US dollar have added to the real
appreciation pressures on the local currency. The authorities agreed that increasing flexibility
of the nominal exchange rate would help the economy adjust to external shocks and keep the
current account at a sustainable levels. Additionally, they emphasized that flexibility in the
exchange rate must be supported by structural reforms and the removal of infrastructural
impediments to safeguard external competitiveness and enhance trade.

Measures, October 12, 2007.

Consistent with the EAC protocols, to protect local industries the authorities are drawing up a list of sensitive
products on which higher tariffs than the maximum allowable rate will be applied.

10

The trade regime under the EAC will be more liberal as it lowers the average tariff for third countries by
about 5 percentage points upon implementation of the common external tariff.
11

Besides liberalizing intraregional trade and giving its members access to a market of about 90 million people,
the EAC promotes regional cooperation through: (1) addressing the region’s infrastructure gaps; (2) setting
phytosanitary and technical standards; (3) sharing and coordinating use of mineral, water, and energy resources;
and (4) drafting investment, anticorruption and good governance codes and coordinating tax incentives.

18
Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
The exchange rate system was liberalized in 1998 and an auction system was introduced in 2001 to ensure the
market determination of the exchange rate and the adoption of a policy to allocate foreign exchange guided by
the NBR’s net foreign asset target. Between 1998 and 2004, Rwanda’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
depreciated by some 45 percent. (This period also coincided with a marked deterioration in Rwanda’s terms of
trade). Subsequently, the REER has appreciated by about 20 percent as the authorities have increased the
spending and absorption of scaled-up aid.
Equilibrium REER analysis using panel data estimates with model specifications relating the REER to a set of
fundamentals (following Mongardini and Rayner (forthcoming)) yields a small overvaluation of about 2 percent
as of 2007. The estimated equilibrium REER over the period has mainly been driven by Rwanda’s GDP growth
relative to its trading partners.
Rwanda: Estimated Equilibrium and Actual REER

Staff analysis using the external sustainability
approach–which estimates the level of the
exchange rate consistent with stabilizing net
foreign assets at the end-2007 level–suggests a
slight undervaluation of about 2 percent.

On balance, the REER in Rwanda was broadly in
line with its estimated equilibrium level in 2007.
Since then, the REER for the first 8 months of
2008 appreciated by less than ½ percent on
average compared to 2007.

Recent performance of the external sector also indicates that Rwanda’s exports are competitive. Measured in
dollar terms, Rwanda’s export of goods and nonfactor services (GNFS) has grown by an average of about 20
percent per year over the last five years. The high volatility of export growth reflects the concentration of
exports (coffee, tea, and tin comprise over 60 percent of goods exports) and large terms of trade swings.

The low level and high volatility of Rwanda’s exports in the context of a relatively favorable real exchange rate
trends in recent years suggest that over the medium term, export performance is likely to be constrained by
structural bottlenecks–such as poor infrastructure and access to bank credit–rather than by external price
competitiveness.

19
C. Accelerating Structural Reforms and Other Policies
12.
Sustaining high growth and reducing poverty requires that Rwanda accelerate
the breadth and pace of structural reforms and leverage synergies from coordinating
reforms across sectors. Development, prioritization, sequencing, and implementation of
reforms still remain a critical challenge. Closer alignment of development partners’ activities
and financial support with Rwanda’s priorities established under the national development
agenda would facilitate the implementation of reforms. The focus of public sector reforms
should be on strengthening capacity building, increasing efficiency in resource allocation and
improving fast feedback through better monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. In particular:
•

Improving public service delivery. Addressing capacity constraints and reforming the
civil service, especially considering the recent decentralization initiative, will be
essential for enhancing policy implementation as well as monitoring and performance
management systems.12 Further public service reforms may be necessary to attract
and retain high quality staff.

•

Strengthening public financial management (PFM). Substantial improvements in
budget preparation, execution and monitoring are critical to ensure that public
resources are allocated efficiently. Moreover, achieving greater budget flexibility in
the form of budget-support aid should be directly related to the quality of the PFM.
The government has finalized a medium-term PFM reform strategy that give priority
to improving (i) accounting, recording, and reporting; (ii) external scrutiny and audit;
and (iii) comprehensiveness and transparency. The prioritization and sequencing of
reforms is being guided by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) Assessment made in 2007.

•

Formulating an exit strategy from aid dependence over the long term. The
authorities plan to continue to strengthen tax and customs administration to increase
the revenue-to-GDP ratio and reduce Rwanda’s reliance on donor support. On
domestic taxation, their efforts will focus on enhancing auditing and enforcement
capacity, particularly for medium-sized tax payers, and widening the tax base to
include the informal sector while improving collections of non-tax revenue. Reforms
in customs administration should facilitate trade and strengthen compliance.

20
D. Macroframework and Risks
13.
Staff projects average growth for 2009–11 of about 6 percent. This growth rate,
which is 1¾ percentage points lower than the historical average over the past 4 years, reflects
the dampening effects of the decline in world growth mainly through slowdown in the
construction and service sectors. At the same time, the Rwandan economy is not strongly
integrated into the world economy and subsistence agriculture has a large share. In the
medium-term, agriculture production is likely to recover following the ongoing enhancement
of the crop intensification program, while expansion of the public sector infrastructure
program will mitigate the slowdown in construction activity. Staff’s outlook for growth,
which is lower than the 8 percent forecasted in the authorities’ PRSP, is based on a more
conservative projection that takes into account world economic growth and the pace of
structural reform implementation. This also suggests that a significant reduction in poverty is
likely to take considerable time.
14.
Inflation is projected to return to 5 percent over the medium term, after the
impact of international fuel and food prices has passed through. Achieving this objective
also hinges on continued prudence in macroeconomic policies and the success of measures to
boost agricultural output and reduce the price volatility of fresh food products.
15.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain at around
8-10 percent of GDP over the medium term. It will be largely financed by international
donor flows and FDI, which will keep reserves at an adequate level. Staff projections suggest
an initial slowdown of export growth, reflecting a reduction in commodity prices and
tourism, followed by an acceleration due to the implementation of growth and export
enhancing structural reforms and the resumption of global economic growth. The growth of
import volumes is expected to remain fairly high, reflecting capital imports related to
infrastructure projects, and will be partly offset by the lower import prices. These projects
will contribute to the expected rise in Rwanda’s investment rate.
16.
The medium-term outlook is subject to a number of downside risks. The global
financial crisis and economic slowdown pose near-term risks for Rwanda’s economic growth
and balance of payments. Demand for Rwanda’s exports, export prices and remittances may
further decrease, which would reduce the foreign currency receipts. A more pronounced
deterioration in the terms of trade would add to balance of payments pressures. Foreign direct
investment could fall and trade credits could become more difficult to obtain. All these
factors could bring economic growth in 2009 below the current projection of 6 percent and
reduce government revenues, straining fiscal policy. Slower growth could result in rising
credit risks and make Rwanda’s banking sector more vulnerable.

III. PROGRAM ISSUES
A. Macroeconomic Developments and Program Performance in 2008
17.

Macroeconomic developments in 2008 have been mixed:

•

Growth in 2008 is expected to remain resilient to the global slowdown. The
projection of 8.5 percent is supported by a substantial increase in agricultural
production, expanding production of manufactured goods for the domestic market,
construction of private and commercial property, growing demand for transport, and
a revived financial sector now that Rwanda’s banks have been recapitalized.

•

Inflation has accelerated as a result of international commodity prices passthrough and domestic demand pressures. The 12-month CPI inflation reached
21.9 percent in October, up from single digits in March, mainly because of rising
transport charges, utility fees and food prices, and administered price increases in
education and health services. Staff estimates suggest that rising international

22
commodity prices explain about 1/3 of the overall inflation in recent months.13 An
accommodative monetary policy stance during the rapid fiscal expansion in the
second half of 2007 is also a contributing factor, as evidenced by sharply rising
nonfood and nonfuel factors of inflation. Average inflation is projected at around
15 percent in 2008, which underscores the need for macroeconomic policy actions to
limit the possible second-round effects of the food and fuel price shock.

Program performance was satisfactory through September. All quantitative endJune performance criteria (PCs) for the fifth review were met (MEFP, Table 1).
19.
Fiscal policy in the first half of 2008 was tighter than envisaged and the end-year
fiscal targets appear within reach because the government is committed to saving part
of the additional revenues (Table 2).
•

Revenues overperformed throughout the year due to higher inflation and taxation
of growing imports as well as faster-than-anticipated economic growth. This kept
the domestic fiscal balance within program targets.

•

Spending was broadly in line with the program during January-June, but
accelerated thereafter. In August, Parliament approved a supplementary budget for
additional priority spending, largely financed by new IDA and AfDB grants, on
imports of fertilizer, seeds and food storage (0.6 percent of GDP) to increase food

These estimates are based on the findings of the accompanying Selected Issues Paper (SIP) studying the passthrough effects of global food and oil prices on inflation in EAC countries (Country Report No. 09/36).

23
production and create a food buffer.14 Some of the contingency spending envisaged
in the program and emergency spending on road maintenance will be financed by
higher-than-expected tax collections.
•

A substantial part of the additional revenues will be saved. This will improve the
projected domestic fiscal balance for 2008 by 1.4 percent of GDP compared with the
program target. Staff and the authorities concurred that restraining fiscal spending
will alleviate domestic demand pressures and help return inflation to single digits.

•

Because of administrative delays, the budget accumulated arrears of about
1 percent of GDP and the end-September indicative target on the net
accumulation of domestic arrears was missed. The authorities have taken measures
to eliminate these arrears before year-end (MEFP ¶3).

20.
The monetary program remained broadly on track through end-September
although inflation has accelerated (Figure 9).
•

The end-June and end-September targets on reserve money were observed. The
NBR mainly relied on foreign exchange sales for sterilization and limited the use of
domestic debt instruments. Money market interest rates increased by up to 250 basis
points since end-2007 following the introduction of the key policy rate and repo
market in July (MEFP ¶4).

•

The pass-through from world food and fuel prices boosted inflation and thus
reduced the liquidity overhang. Rising prices increased the nominal demand for
money and currency in circulation, leading to tighter monetary conditions. In turn,
banks’ excess reserves decreased. Broad money declined to levels consistent with
program projections, indicating that the monetary overhang that persisted through
early 2008 has diminished.

14

The supplementary budget also institutionalized changes to the fiscal program that were built into the
program during the fourth review (see MEFP Text Table 1 in Country Report No. 08/222).

Monetary policy should aim at preventing second round inflationary effects
from the world commodity price increase earlier in the year and bring back inflation to
single-digit levels, including through exchange rate flexibility and close coordination of
monetary and fiscal policy.
•

The NBR committed to further tightening the monetary stance by raising the key
repo rate (MEFP ¶24). This would lead to the restoration of positive real interest
rates once inflation has declined to a moderate level and would encourage savings.
These changes should be implemented gradually and prudently so that the impact on
the private sector credit is spread overtime. Simultaneously, the NBR should
monitor credit expansion and the exposure of the banking sector to developments in
the domestic economy particularly the sectors that may have benefited from rapid
asset price increases in recent years.

•

Greater flexibility of the nominal exchange rate will be essential to ensure
adherence to quantitative monetary targets under the program and preclude
excessive real appreciation of the local currency. The NBR modified the
mechanism for determining the weekly average reference rate at which it sells
foreign exchange to commercial banks in July (MEFP ¶5) and moved to setting the
exchange rate on a daily basis from mid-November. This introduced more flexibility
in the exchange rate and led to a moderate depreciation of the Rwandan franc
relative to the US dollar (Figure 10). While these developments are welcome, staff
urged the authorities to move swiftly toward an interbank foreign exchange market
in coordination with banks and further increase exchange rate flexibility.

All but one structural reform measure through end-June 2008 were met. The
completion and the publication of the PFM reform action plan for 2008-10, a PC for endJune (MEFP, Table 3), was delayed until September, allowing the Ministry of Finance
sufficient time to solicit and incorporate input from development partners. The National
Payments Strategy designed to improve the payments infrastructure and address the
development of basic payment services in Rwanda (end-September benchmark) was prepared
on time but was posted on the website of the NBR only in October. The debt management
strategy (end-November benchmark) was published on the MINECOFIN website on
November 28 after incorporating comments provide by Bank and Fund staff following
reviews of earlier drafts.
B. Macroeconomic Policies for 2009
23.
Macroeconomic policies in the short term need to ensure a smooth adjustment to
volatility in commodity prices and changes in the uncertain global economic
environment, while advancing the medium-term agenda. In light of the risks, careful
monitoring of domestic developments and policy coordination between the Ministry of
Finance and the NBR will be necessary to safeguard macroeconomic stability.
24.
Fiscal policy in the first half of 2009 will be geared towards limiting the potential
risks to the economic outlook (MEFP ¶¶15-17). The minibudget for January-June 200915
allows for the full use of aid inflows to scale up spending (by 0.6 percent of GDP) on priority
sectors, including infrastructure, agriculture, education, health, and information and
communications technology, but precludes recourse to domestic financing. 16 If necessary, the
government is prepared to reduce spending during the course of 2009 to ensure
macroeconomic stability. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase in line with the
long-term objective of gradually widening the tax base. In the event of an unanticipated
revenue shortfall, the authorities have committed to implement offsetting measures.
Considering current uncertainties, additional revenues beyond those projected through mid2009 will be saved for future use.
25.
Monetary policy will aim at mitigating the impact of fluctuations in world
commodity prices and reducing inflation to single digits in the second half of 2009.
Reserve money will continue to anchor monetary policy, and broad money is projected to
grow in line with nominal GDP. The NBR will increase nominal exchange rate flexibility to
meet its monetary targets and ensure that foreign exchange reserves remain adequate (MEFP
15

The authorities are switching from the calendar fiscal year to the EAC budget cycle which covers July to
June. A mini-budget covering January to June 2009, which allows the transition to the fiscal budget cycle, was
submitted to parliament in October. The annual budget for July 2009 to June 2010 will be submitted for
parliamentary consideration in April 2009; it will be discussed in detail during the sixth PRGF review.
16

Spending measured as total expenditure and net lending excluding privatization proceeds.

27
¶¶21-24). Policy interest rates will be gradually increased to mitigate inflationary pressures.
Monetary policy will accommodate private sector credit growth of about 23 percent.
C. Data Issues
26.
Although economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, weaknesses
hamper economic analysis. Weaknesses permeate all areas, but particular attention is
needed to improve statistics on national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of
payments.
D. Program Risks and Monitoring
27.
Program risks have increased. The main risk is that macroeconomic stability could
be derailed if the authorities do not appropriately adjust fiscal and monetary policies to
shocks from the current global economic crises. Weak administrative capacity could delay
structural reforms.
28.
Program monitoring for 2009 is described in the MEFP (¶¶33 and 34) and the
technical memorandum of understanding. The PRGF arrangement expires in June 2009
but an annual macroeconomic program with quarterly targets has been established to guide
macroeconomic policies. Quantitative indicative targets reflecting the mini-budget period
have been established for end-March and end-June 2009 (MEFP, Table 2).
29.
Staff discussed with the authorities Rwanda’s relations with the Fund after the
PRGF arrangement ends in June 2009. The authorities are interested in a follow-up
arrangement as a macroeconomic anchor, especially given the world economic crisis. They
believe it would boost domestically owned structural reforms and help catalyze external
financial support for meeting the MDGs. They are reviewing the relative merits of PRGF and
PSI arrangements.
30.
An update safeguards assessment in 2007 proposed recommendations to address
continuing vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The
implementation of these measures is broadly on track and is being monitored by staff.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Rwanda remains committed to sound economic policies that delivered strong
economic performance and macroeconomic stability over the last decade. Economic
growth has been high relative to other members of the EAC, inflation was mostly moderate
and debt relief improved the external position. This performance was underpinned by prudent
macroeconomic policies and the implementation of structural reforms. When faced with
inflation pressures or challenges to growth, the authorities promptly modified the policy
stance so as to safeguard macroeconomic stability.

28
32.
Nevertheless, Rwanda remains a poor country with pressing social needs and
significant capacity constraints. It is continuing with social rehabilitation and is making
progress toward the MDGs. The challenge now is to maintain sound policies and structural
reforms that will mobilize and efficiently use resources, including scaled-up aid, to boost
long-term growth and significantly reduce poverty.
33.
While Rwanda’s development needs are vast, spending in support of growth and
poverty reduction should not jeopardize macroeconomic stability. The 2009 mini-budget
gives priority to spending on infrastructure and social objectives while limiting the domestic
demand impact on inflation and undue crowding out of the private sector. Given current
uncertainties the government should carefully monitor domestic developments and the
volatile external environment and be prepared to promptly adjust the fiscal policy as needed.
Looking forward, staff urges the authorities to embed their policies in a medium-term
expenditure framework and a supporting PIP.
34.
To safeguard debt sustainability, recourse to external financing should be
generally limited to grants or concessional borrowing. Given Rwanda’s susceptibility to
external shocks, staff supports the authorities’ cautious stance toward nonconcessional
borrowing and commends them on the development of a debt management strategy. To
reinforce the analytical framework for assessing the risks of debt distress and evaluating
projects, staff recommends that the debt management strategy and the PIP policy guidelines
incorporate the fiscal risks associated with contingent liabilities, particularly those associated
with planned PPPs.
35.
The REER is broadly in line with fundamentals. However the current high
inflation environment and the recent real appreciation of the Rwanda franc will require more
flexibility in the exchange rate, particularly if the current account should widen more than is
projected. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to limit foreign exchange interventions to
smoothing excessive short-term volatility and meeting the foreign exchange reserves target.
36.
The NBR needs to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back to single
digits. While the recent decline in world commodity prices is conducive to disinflation,
prudent fiscal and monetary policies will be essential if inflation is to fall to single digits by
end-2009. Staff commends the introduction of the repo market in July 2008 but a better mix
of available instruments will be required to limit monetary growth and offset the inflationary
impact if the franc were to depreciate. Such actions would also raise the cost of private sector
credit and must be implemented gradually.
37.
The authorities must be vigilant in the uncertain and changing global economic
environment. The NBR must continue to scrutinize the credit exposure of banks and be
prepared to implement appropriate measures to minimize the possible adverse effect of the
slowing global economy and the financial crisis on banks and the wider financial sector.

29
38.
Structural reforms that make the public sector more effective and efficient will
be critical to Rwanda’s success. The authorities need to prioritize policies and structural
reforms to address the major obstacles to growth. Staff welcomes the development of the
public financial management reform strategy and the implementation of the financial sector
development plan and encourages the authorities to accelerate efforts to improve public
service delivery. While tax administration has improved substantially, further increases in the
revenue ratio should come from strengthening audit and enforcement capacity and widening
the tax net to the informal sector.
39.
The efforts to improve the investment climate are commendable. The recent
establishment of the Rwanda Development Board to promote private sector development,
projects to augment Rwanda’s electricity supply, actions to develop the capital market and
improve the soundness of commercial bank, and the overhaul of business-related laws are all
commendable. Moreover, EAC membership should leverage regional improvements in
infrastructure, provide better access to skilled labor, and improve the business climate; and
sectoral export promotion strategies should enhance Rwanda’s competitiveness.
40.
Staff recommends that the requested waiver be granted—its nonobservance was
temporary—and that the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement be completed.
41.
Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation with Rwanda take place
within 24 months, subject to the provision of the Decision on Consultation Cycles in
program countries.

Reflects the operations of the Union Banques Populaires du Rwanda (UBPR)—a large microfinance network— which was transformed into a commercial bank in Frebuary 2008.
The IMF's MDRI reduced foreign liabilities at the NBR by RF 42.4 million with a counter entry in government deposits (in January 2006).

The definition of reserve money as performance criterion or structural benchmark differs from the definition in the monetary program in that it excludes the deposits of a defunct savings bank, import deposits, and dormant accounts. It
includes old notes demonetized at the end of 2004 but in circulation until the end of 2005.
4

The reserve money target for 2007 is derived by applying the programmed growth rate of 13 percent to the rebased 2006 outcome. The rebased 2006 outcome was calculated by allowing banks to meet the legal reserve requirement on
deposits (banks' reserves at the end of December 2006 fell short of the requirement by RF 7.5 billion, they met the requirement because it is based on an average over two weeks; plus (2) a liquidity reserve of RF 3 billion to ensure
sufficient financing in banks' branches.
5
From December 2005 on, includes Caisse Hypothecaire du Rwanda (BHR) deposits (RF 1 billion at end-2005).
6

End-2006 broad money includes RF5 billion temporary build up of local government deposits, which were unwound by February 2007.

7

Broad money plus deposits in the Union de Banques Populaires de Rwanda (UBPR) through December 2008 and Rwanda Development Bank (BRD).

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
Kigali, December 18, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:

1.
The fourth review of our financial and economic program supported by the Fund’s
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was completed on June 16, 2008. In the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), we review recent
economic developments and progress in the implementation of our program through the third
quarter of 2008; and set out policies the Government intends to pursue in 2009.
2.
Program implementation under the PRGF arrangement has been broadly on track. All
quantitative and structural performance criteria for the completion of the fifth review were
met except for the performance criterion (PC) on publication of the PFM reform action plan
for 2008-10. However, it is to be mentioned that the first1 draft PFM action plan was
published on the website of Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning in June 2008. As the
nonobservance was temporary, we are requesting a waiver for the nonobservance of the
structural PC on the publication of the PFM reform action plan.
3.
In support of our policies as described in the MEFP, the Government of Rwanda
requests the completion of the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement and the disbursement of
the sixth loan of SDR 1.14 million.
4.
The Government of Rwanda believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP
are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program but will take any further measures that
may become appropriate for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on
adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
5.
The Government of Rwanda authorizes publication and distribution of this letter, the
MEFP and the TMU together with the related staff report and debt sustainability analysis and
the selected issues paper.
1

The first draft was not discussed with the development partners. A final version was published in September
2008 after thorough consultations with them.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES (MEFP) OF THE GOVERNMENT
OF RWANDA
December 18, 2008
1.
Rwanda’s medium-term economic program is supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility arrangement for 2006–09. We are committed to reducing poverty
through preserving macroeconomic stability, boosting economic growth, and implementing
policies targeted at improving the livelihood of the poor. This memorandum is consistent
with the goals established in the new Economic Development and Poverty Reduction
Strategy (EDPRS), which was launched in November 2007. The memorandum reviews
recent performance under the program through the third quarter of 2008 and describes
policies for 2009.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Growth remains strong, but inflation has accelerated. GDP growth is expected to
reach about 8½ percent in 2008, owing to buoyant activity in agriculture, construction, and
services. Inflation, led by rising prices of food, transport, and housing and utilities, has
accelerated from 6.6 percent at end-2007 to 21.9 percent in October. These developments
partly reflect the pass-through from elevated international food and fuel prices amid higher
local and regional demand for food products, which, despite the favorable harvest, led to
rapid price increases for locally produced food. Domestic demand pressures also played a
role. Average inflation in 2008 is expected to be about 15 percent.
3.

The fiscal program has remained broadly on track through September 2008.

•

Fiscal policy in the first half of 2008 was tighter than programmed because of higher
revenues and lower spending. The larger revenues reflected an increase in collections
from income and consumption taxes, as well as higher inflation and GDP growth.
Given the build up of inflationary pressures, we made an effort to restrain spending
across the board. Nevertheless, the target on priority spending was achieved. The
tighter fiscal stance led to a larger than programmed reduction of credit to
government and also made it possible to keep domestic debt below targeted levels.

•

Spending accelerated in the third quarter of the year and the strong revenue
performance continued. Spending through September was higher than programmed
because of the purchase of seed and fertilizer and spending on food storage (largely
financed by grants from IDA and AfDB) and maintenance of the road network. As a
result, the target on priority spending was met by a wide margin. The end-September
indicative targets on domestic fiscal balance and net credit to the government were
met. Because of administrative delays associated with the general elections, the
budget accumulated domestic arrears totaling about 1 percent of GDP in July–August.
Even though about a third of this amount was already cleared in September, the endSeptember indicative target for arrears repayment was missed. The Government

44
continued to repay domestic arrears in the fourth quarter and is confident that the
program target for arrears repayment for end-2008 will be reached.
•

Domestic petroleum prices have been adjusted periodically in response to world oil
market developments. From end-2007 through September 2008, the cumulative
increase in retail petroleum prices amounted to 35 percent. However, the recent fall in
world oil prices prompted us to reduce retail petroleum prices by 15 percent between
September and November. Despite these price changes, we remain committed to
generating stable revenues from petroleum taxes.

4.
The reserve money targets for end-June and end-September 2008 were met. The
National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) overhauled monetary operations in July when it introduced
the key policy rate, which was set at 8 percent, and a new corridor structure for the interbank
rate based on daily repo operations of 1–14 days maturity. This replaced weekly liquidity
auctions (7-day deposits) and overnight deposits. The NBR has increased sales of foreign
exchange relative to projections and is relying less on issuance of domestic instruments to
meet the reserve money target. Broad money was consistent with program targets for endJune and marginally higher for end-September.
5.
The Rwandan franc depreciated somewhat against the U.S. dollar. In July the
NBR modified the mechanism for determining the weekly average reference rate at which it
sells foreign exchange to commercial banks. The new mechanism sets the reference rate as
the weighted average of the rate applied by the NBR and commercial banks in their foreign
exchange transactions with clients during the week, but it excludes all transactions between
banks. As a result, the exchange rate has become more flexible.
6.
The external current account has deteriorated somewhat relative to 2007. During
the first half of the year, exports and imports of goods grew faster than anticipated in the
program due to significant increases in the prices of main commodities. Despite the strong
increase in export receipts from coffee, tea, minerals and tourism, the widening of the trade
deficit was caused by the surge in food and fuel prices, and is expected to persist for the rest
of the year, causing an overall deterioration of the current account.
7.

Progress was made on the structural agenda:

•

Our efforts in public financial management (PFM) reforms are beginning to show
results, and we will be accelerating the pace of reforms as we address capacity
constraints. The operational manual for the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
was produced and published on the MINECOFIN website in June (June 30
performance criterion). After consultations with development partners, the PFM
reform strategy and action plan for 2008–12 (June 30 performance criterion) was
published in September, and we initiated work to establish a new framework for
strategic guidance, implementation, monitoring, and financing of the PFM reform
strategy. This should guarantee more coherent implementation and reduce the risk of
bottlenecks delaying progress in some areas. In line with identified needs, capacity
building and training in PFM continued throughout the year.

45
•

On tax administration, two structural benchmarks for end-June were completed on
time: (i) a comprehensive compliance program--that identifies the main compliance
risks associated with the large, medium, and small taxpayer segments, and describes
planned Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) initiatives to address those risks based on
risk analysis--was developed and published on the RRA website, and (ii) an expedited
clearance scheme (super green/gold card) for compliant importers contributing a
cumulative 40 percent of import value was implemented.

•

Further progress was made in reforms to develop and strengthen the financial sector:
o

Payment systems. The Cabinet adopted a National Payments Strategy to
improve the payments infrastructure and develop basic payment services in
Rwanda before end-September 2008, although publication of the strategy on
the NBR website (end-September benchmark) was delayed until October. A
payment system bill that would establish a clear oversight framework for the
NBR over key components of the Rwandan payment system and ensure
settlement finality was submitted to Parliament in September 2008. The
company operating the switch to national card-based payment changed
management in August and 70 percent of the shares are now owned by a
German-based company. The new management, fully supported by the NBR,
should be able to develop a modern system for electronic payments.

o

Legal reforms. Parliament passed laws governing organization and
supervision of the insurance industry in July and the Anti-Money Laundering
and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Legislation in June 2008.

o

The NBR continued its work to prepare the implementation of consolidated
banking and insurance supervision in conformity with international standards,
and developed a comprehensive internal audit manual.

o

A private credit bureau that also operates in Tanzania and Uganda was granted
a license in October.

8.
Rwanda is determined to build a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, in
which an expanded private sector can create jobs and increase opportunities for all
Rwandans. The Rwanda Development Board (RDB) was created to advance these goals by
making Rwanda a compelling global hub for business and investment. The RDB is a new
institution that is charged with leading the Government’s efforts to accelerate Rwanda’s
strategic growth and development. The RDB will work to create a world-class business
climate that will build on the country’s assets, expand the private sector, create jobs, and
increase opportunities for all Rwandans. The RDB incorporates elements of eight
government agencies: Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA); Rwanda
Office of Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN); Privatization Secretariat; Rwanda
Commercial Registration Services Agency; Rwanda Information and Technology Authority
(RITA); Center for Support to Small and Medium Enterprises (CAPMER); Human Resource
and Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA); and the Environmental Impact
Assessment Division of the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA).
Realignment of these agencies will allow the Government of Rwanda to gain greater

46
efficiency and productivity. RDB will drive legal and regulatory reforms to eliminate
inefficiencies and streamline bureaucracy that might hinder private sector development.
RDB will also work to expand the infrastructure needed for economic growth, including
transportation, information communications technology (ICT), conservation, and human and
institutional capacity.
9.
In order to achieve effective and sustainable social protection for the poor and
vulnerable, Rwanda began implementation of the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program
(VUP program). This is an integrated rural development program designed to eradicate
extreme poverty in Rwanda by 2020. It is being piloted in 30 of the poorest sectors
(imirenge) of the country (about 600,000 people). The program is organized around three
components: (i) The first component (50 percent revives planned public works using
community-based participatory approaches (e.g., Ubudehe) to build community assets and
create off-farm employment infrastructure. (ii) The second (30 percent) innovates with credit
packages to tackle extreme poverty and foster entrepreneurship and off-farm employment
opportunities. (iii) The third component (20 percent) includes direct supports to improve
access to social services or to provide for landless households in which no members qualify
for public works or credit packages; such unconditional support seeks to expand health and
education coverage and encourage the development of skills, handicrafts, or social services
activities. A number of donors (WorldBank, DFID, European Union, and Sweden) are
supporting this program.
II. MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY
10.
Our medium-term policy agenda will focus on reducing poverty by improving
food security and creating social protection schemes, removing impediments to growth,
and preserving macroeconomic stability. The policies, which are based on the Vision 2020
development plan, are elaborated in the new EDPRS. The main elements seek to:
•

Address severe infrastructure bottlenecks, including the insufficient and expensive
energy supply, poor road network, shallow financial system, and the high costs of
doing business.

•

Enhance agricultural development and trade as vehicles to empower the poor by
having them participate in economic activity.

•

Improve the delivery of public services through better expenditure management and
better analyses and monitoring of the links between policies, growth and poverty
reduction. Through better monitoring we will identify worthy programs and projects
that can be scaled up.

•

Remove obstacles to private sector development to make it the engine of growth. To
this end, we will continue building human capital through better health and education
and address skill shortages.

•

Rely on sustainable financing sources with an emphasis on grant financing and
raising the revenue ratio in the long run.

47
11.
While our medium-term macroeconomic framework is based on prudent
projections for growth and external assistance, we believe that steadfast
implementation of our reform agenda is likely to lead to growth that is substantially
higher than projected, and we hope it could facilitate higher levels of external
assistance. Moreover, to further improve the policy dialogue with stakeholders and
development partners, we will maintain a rolling medium-term expenditure and
macroeconomic framework.
III. POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2008
12.
We expect to meet all end-2008 fiscal targets. Revenue overperformance and higher
budget support grants are expected to cover unanticipated spending for fertilizer, seeds,
storage facilities, road maintenance, and water supply (Text Table 1). To limit the fiscal
stimulus on domestic demand, the remaining revenue will be saved.
13.
The NBR will maintain a tight monetary policy. It will continue to monitor
inflation and private sector credit and be prepared to tighten the policy stance. The exchange
rate will be sufficiently flexible to meet the reserve money target and ensure that foreign
exchange reserves remain at or above their target. Furthermore, a committee comprising
representatives of the various financial institutions has been established to monitor and assess
financial sector trends and advise on measures to limit the impact of the global financial
crises on Rwanda.

IV. THE PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2009
14.
Our policies from January to June 2009 will continue to safeguard
macroeconomic stability while laying the basis for stronger medium-term growth and
poverty reduction. We expect real economic growth of 5.5–6.5 percent.2 We will focus our
efforts on reducing inflation to single digits in the second half of 2009, which should be
aided by the likely decline in world food and fuel prices. Nevertheless, average inflation is
expected to remain at about 12 percent in 2009. As a precaution against possible balance of
payments pressures arising from the global economic crises, we will target a level of
international reserves of about 4½ months of imports. Structural policies will focus on
improving public financial management, developing the financial sector, and making growthenhancing investments and reforms.
A. Macroeconomic Program for January-June 2009
15.
Managing the domestic demand impact of fiscal policies will be at the heart of
our macroeconomic policies.3 While the domestic deficit (excluding spending on
demobilization and peacekeeping) is projected to expand to 2.6 percent of GDP, the net
liquidity impact will be reduced to 0.8 percent of GDP, compared with 1.2 percent of GDP in
the first half of 2008. This will result from increasing allocation of budget resources to
investment projects with high import component. The budget envisages an accumulation of
government deposits in the NBR of nearly 0.9 percent of GDP in the first half of 2009, which
should reduce inflationary pressures and contribute to the maintenance of adequate reserve
levels. If grants or revenues in the first half of 2009 exceed program projections, they will be
saved and allocated toward the 2009/10 budget for expenditures if a careful assessment of
macroeconomic conditions suggests that such expenditures are prudent.
Fiscal policy for January–June 2009
16.
On the revenue front, we will increase the revenue-to-GDP ratio by
0.2 percentage points to 7.1 percent of GDP in the first half of 2009. We will monitor
government cash flow on monthly basis. Should unanticipated revenue losses arise, we will
implement offsetting measures, such as increasing fees and charges and taxes on petroleum
products, so that the revenue target can be attained. Furthermore, we will safeguard the
agreed targets for domestic fiscal balance by cutting or postponing non-priority expenditure
and adopting a more gradual approach to releasing the domestic component of the budget.
Our measures to further widen the tax base are described in paragraph 19.

2

The macroeconomic program is rebased using revisions to the national accounts data prepared by the National
Institute of Statistics (NIS). The national accounts have been revised from 2006 to reflect omissions in the
compilations of imports and corrections to VAT data.

3

To harmonize its budget cycle with that of other EAC countries, Rwanda is switching from a calendar to a
fiscal year budget. Budget operations in January-June 2009 will be guided by minibudget for these six months
only; and subsequently Rwanda will approve annual budgets covering periods from July to June.

50
17.
The focus of expenditure lies in increasing public investments. The mini-budget
allows for an increase in investment spending by 1 percent of GDP compared with the first
half of 2008, largely financed by foreign grants and concessional loans. To mitigate the
impact on domestic demand, we will cooperate with donors to postpone some spending from
off-budget project accounts. In case of an unexpected build-up of pressures on the exchange
rate or persistently high inflation, we will reduce government spending.
18.
The increase in investments will go alongside with maintaining priority spending
and improving the quality of public services. To strengthen private-sector-led growth,
especially in rural areas, we will dedicate more resources to public infrastructure as well as to
agriculture, education, health, electricity, and water supply. If expenditure cuts become
necessary, we will safeguard priority spending while cutting or postponing outlays on nonpriority items. The fiscal program will be reviewed at the time of the sixth review under the
PRGF arrangement in light of developments in key macroeconomic indicators in late 2008
and early 2009. Should additional grants or regular revenues materialize, we will save them
for future use and not do any additional spending in the first half of 2009. The main factors
related to key spending areas are these:
•

Priority spending will remain at about 6 percent of GDP in the first half of 2009
(Text Table 2). It will focus on agriculture, infrastructure, health, education, and
energy.
o

Agriculture. We are currently in discussions with donors to initiate pilot
projects for enhancing land husbandry, water harvesting, hillside irrigation
and seeds improvement. We expect that these pilot projects will confirm the
viability of the large three-year investment project in agriculture that is being
prepared. The preliminary overall cost estimate is US$200 million. We will
proceed with the project only if the World Bank provides a favorable
assessment of its economic and financial feasibility. We are exploring all
possible sources of financing, including grants and concessional borrowing
from our development partners.

o

Information and communication technologies (ICT). We will invest a portion
of the proceeds from privatization of RwandaTel in the ICT sector. The
objective of the project is to provide a robust nationwide broadband backbone
using fiber optics. Over time it is expected that the availability of this ICT
backbone will also provide a platform to induce new economic activity,
especially in rural areas with little current service.

o

To address the issue of limited and insufficient energy, we have begun the
construction of the Nyabarongo hydro dam and will support other microdam
projects. We project that implementation of these projects will make it
possible to reduce the electricity tariff by half after 2010 as well as cut the
subsidy to Electrogaz by 0.5 percent of GDP in 2010–12.

o

We are planning a project on upgrading and rehabilitating key road networks
in Kigali and the surroundings. To finance this project, the Government is
considering contracting a government interest-subsidized concessional loan

51
from China Exim Bank of approximately US$32.5 million. Negotiations on
the terms of the loan are currently ongoing. At present it is estimated that the
grant element may reach 40.7 percent. The World Bank will conduct an
assessment of the financial viability of the project. If we decide to proceed
with it, we intend to request a modification of the PRGF program to
accommodate this borrowing at the time of the sixth review.

Other Spending
•

AU peace keeping in Darfur. We will continue to monitor the costs associated with
our peacekeeping activities. The Auditor General will publish by end-July 2009 an
audit of spending in 2008.

Fiscal structural reforms for 2009
19.
We plan to continue improving the efficiency of tax administration to widen the
tax base and further raise the tax-to-GDP ratio. Our goal is to increase revenue to GDP
ratio by at least 0.2 percent per year over the medium term. To achieve this, we focus our
efforts on three broad areas:
•

Enhancing taxpayer compliance. We will vigorously implement the measures
envisaged in the Comprehensive Tax Payers Compliance Strategy adopted in mid2008. To improve monitoring, we will refine taxpayer segmentation by allocating
more companies to the groups of large and medium-sized companies subject to
enhanced surveillance. From January 2009, we shall adopt a block management
system to bring more businesses into the tax net and extend services closer to the
businesses.

•

Increasing efficiency of operations and minimizing transaction costs. To reduce
congestion in the offices of the RRA, we plan to open two additional offices in Kigali
in 2009. We will also expand the network of payment points located in banks, so that

52
taxpayers can make a payment directly from their bank without visiting the RRA
office.
•

Facilitating trade. In 2009 we will further refine the operations and eligibility criteria
for using the expedited clearance scheme (blue channel) for compliant exporters,
which accounted for about two-thirds of imports in September 2008. We have already
extended the working hours of the customs offices and plan to switch to a 24 hour
operating schedule in 2009, which would minimize cargo dwelling time.

20.
The government will begin implementing its new medium-term strategy for
public financial management (PFM) reform. An institutional framework for strategic
guidance, implementation, monitoring, and financing of the PFM reform strategy will be
finalized during the course of 2009. As part of our broader strategy, the PFM action plan for
2009 includes measures in the following areas:
•

Economic management and budgeting. Build capacity for research and macroeconomic
modeling and establish a macro database; align the budget calendar to practices within
the East African Community (EAC); clarify reporting relationships and reporting formats
for sub-national government units; and increase the efficiency of the tax appeal
mechanism.

•

Financial management and reporting. Reorganize and strengthen the Office of the
Accountant General and the Office of the Director of Administration and Finance in
ministries, departments, and agencies; develop a policy and strategy for government
portfolio management and clear guidelines on borrowing; start introducing SmartGov
(the new integrated financial management information system); and approve the software
for the new integrated personnel and payroll information system.

•

Public procurement. Adopt the new organizational structure for the Rwanda Public
Procurement Authority, and conduct a capacity needs assessment in central government
ministries and agencies and sub-national government units to ensure sufficient staffing.

•

Budget execution oversight. Conduct an organizational review of the Office of the
Government Chief Internal Auditor and internal audit units in ministries, departments,
and agencies and sub-national government units; and prepare external audit regulations.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
21.
The NBR will maintain a tight monetary policy in 2009. It will continue to monitor
inflation, government spending and private sector credit and will stand ready to tighten the
monetary stance by raising the key repo rate, if needed. With the current global financial
crises and the onset of global recession, we will be more vigilant in monitoring credit
expansion and the exposure of the banking sector to domestic sectors that may have benefited
from rapid asset price increases in recent years (property market) or to the retail sector.
22.
The NBR will continue to use reserve money as the operational target to control
inflation. To reduce inflation to about 14 percent by mid-2009 and to single digits in the
second half of 2009, it will limit reserve money growth (12-month) to 15 percent at end-June

53
and 18 percent at end-2009. This should help create sufficient room for an expansion of
credit to the private sector. The NBR will continue to follow inflationary developments
closely and mop up excess liquidity, in particular through sales of foreign exchange.
23.
We will allow more flexibility in the exchange rate and increase the frequency of
adjustments. Exchange rate movements will be guided by developments in the retail market
and will ensure that the targets on foreign currency reserves of the NBR are met. This will be
necessary to reduce any pressures for appreciation of the franc and to ensure that Rwanda’s
exports remain competitive. We will be guided by the recommendations of the technical
assistance mission from the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department in our efforts
to revitalize the foreign exchange market. Our interventions in the market will be orderly and
focused on smoothing short-term market fluctuations.
24.
The NBR will improve liquidity management. We are committed to gradually
increasing the policy interest rates, with the intention of restoring real interest rates to
positive levels once inflation has come down to a moderate level. Higher interest rates will
also counteract the inflationary impact that higher import prices would have on the economy
and sustain the reduction in inflation arising from declining world commodity prices. These
changes will be done gradually and prudently so that private sector credit is not adversely
affected. Additionally, we will communicate our intentions to the financial sector in a timely
manner so as to avoid disruptions in the financial markets arising from asymmetric
information.
25.
We will strengthen the Treasury Management Committee (TMC). The TMC has
been holding meetings with the MoF and NBR to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy
weekly at the technical level and monthly between the Minister and the Governor.
External sector
26.
We expect the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) to
remain at about 18 percent of GDP in 2009. Reflecting the reduction in international
prices, receipts from export of goods and services are projected to grow by 11 percent in U.S.
dollars, driven mainly by increased volumes of traditional exports and the strong
performance of the tourism industry. However, there are considerable downside risks as a
consequence of the projected slowdown in world economic growth. Given the reduction in
the prices of oil, food, and other commodities imported by Rwanda, we project the value of
imports of goods to increase by some 6 percent. At the same time, import volumes will
increase by some 15 percent, buoyed by the robust economic growth and growing public
investment. Despite the efforts of NBR to lower inflation, which would help reverse the
current trend of real appreciation, real appreciation will continue until inflation in Rwanda is
significantly reduced to a level close to that of inflation in trading partner countries. This
appreciation will boost import volumes in 2009.
27.
Rwanda has received debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and
benefited from MDRI. In addition to IMF, IDA and AfDB, completion point and toppingup assistance have been provided by BADEA and the OPEC Fund. IFAD, the Kuwait Fund,
the Saudi Fund and the EU have already provided completion point assistance. Bilateral
agreements have been signed with all Paris Club creditors except France. China cancelled all

54
outstanding loans, totaling about US$32 million, in 2007. Debts owed to the Abu Dhabi
Fund, France, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are under negotiation.
28.
Preparations for joining the EAC Customs Union have intensified. Rwanda
became a member of the EAC on July 1, 2007. The necessary provisions for entrance into the
Customs Union will be completed by June 2009. The list of sensitive products and raw
materials exempted from the common external tariff has been compiled. Preliminary
estimates suggest that the annual revenue loss from reduced external tariffs could amount to
some 0.4 percent of GDP. Rwanda has signed an interim agreement with the European Union
to continue negotiations on an Economic Partnership Agreement in line with the EAC
common position.
B. Structural Policies
29.
The focus on the structural side will remain on enhancing the productivity of the
agricultural and export sectors and improving conditions for the private sector.
Export promotion
30.
Our export promotion strategy will continue to focus on enhancing the
productivity in traditional sectors and diversifying our export base.
•

Coffee. To improve yields, use will be made of industrial fertilizers and pesticides,
for which training will be provided to farmers. To increase value added, the number
of washing stations will be further increased. Existing stations are being made more
efficient through more training, an improved water supply, and an upgrade of feeder
roads. A Coffee Marketing Alliance will be established to improve marketing.

•

Tea. To increase export volume and quality, efforts aimed at improving harvesting
methods and expanding nursery beds and tea plantations will be intensified. To
increase value added, a blending industry will be established. Efforts at direct
marketing will be intensified to improve market prices.

•

Tourism. A tourism master plan is being developed with the assistance of the World
Tourism organization.

55
Financial sector
31.
The agenda for medium-term financial sector reform is based on our Financial
Sector Development Plan. Our plans for 2009 include the following:
•

Modernizing the national payments system. We anticipate that the Rwanda
Integrated Payments System Processing System (RIPPS), which will integrate the
Automated Clearing House, Real Time Gross Settlements and the Central Securities
Depository, will become operational in 2009.

•

Developing long-term finance and capital markets. We hope to enact legislation
for securities exchange and regulator. Once that is passed we will transform the
Capital Market Advisory Council (CMAC), which was established earlier in 2008,
into the regulator of the securities industry and spin off its market operations into a
privately owned securities exchange. We also anticipate that we can begin to integrate
the trading platform and settlement systems with those in other EAC member
countries.

•

Contractual savings and investments.
o

By mid-2009, we plan to submit to Parliament legislation for private pension
funds and collective investment schemes (mutual funds, unit trusts, and
investment companies) to further strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework to support development of a market for (a) the contractual savings
industry and (b) long-term saving and investment instruments.

o

We also plan to enact an insurance contract law for consumer protection and a
mandatory insurance law to protect the public.

•

Secondary mortgage facility. We plan to transform the Rwanda Housing Bank
(BHR) into a secondary mortgage facility by end-2009 to further develop the
mortgage industry and providing liquidity to commercial banks. To this end we
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Finance Corporation
in July 2008 and began receiving support to develop the market.

•

Financial stability. To assist in the promotion of financial stability we plan to
implement deposit insurance in 2010 to protect less financially sophisticated
depositors of commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions.

Cost of doing business
32.
We will make further efforts to improve the business climate and remove
obstacles to business development. The Rwanda Commercial and Registry Services will be
made operational. The agency will provide a comprehensive registration system aimed at
improving business registration, securitization of assets, and registration of intellectual
property rights. The office of the Registrar of Land Titles has been operational since the
beginning of 2008, simplifying the land registration process.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
RWANDA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
December 18, 2008
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) supplements the TMU of
June 16, 2008. It (a) sets the quantitative program targets for end-March 2009 and end-June
2009 (Table 2 of the MEFP) and (b) updates the definitions and adjusters of these targets.
Unless an update is provided in this TMU, the definitions, adjusters and reporting
requirements outlined in the TMU of June16, 2008 apply to the program targets set for 2009.
A. Quantitative Program Targets
2.
Indicative targets for March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009 are proposed to be
established with respect to:
•

floors on the domestic fiscal balance of the central government (DFB)

•

ceilings on the net credit to the central government (NCG)

•

floors on priority spending

•

ceilings on the net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government

•

floors on the net foreign assets (NFA) of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR)

•

ceilings on reserve money

•

ceilings on the outstanding stock of external debt with original maturities of one year
or less owed or guaranteed by the public sector

•

ceilings on broad money

•

ceilings on the consolidated domestic debt of the public sector.

3.
Indicative target for end-June 2009 is proposed to be established with respect to the
ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of concessional external debt.
4.
Indicative targets that apply on a continuous basis are proposed to be established with
respect to the ceilings on new external payment arrears of the public sector and new
nonconcessional debt of the public sector.

61
B. Targets Related to Execution of the Fiscal Program
Domestic fiscal balance of the central government (DFB)
5.
A floor applies to the DFB, which is measured cumulatively from December 31, 2008
for the end-March 2009 and end-June 2009 targets.
Net credit to the central government (NCG)
6.
A ceiling applies to the NCG, which is measured cumulatively from December 31,
2008 for the end-March 2009 and end-June 2009 targets.
7.
Definition. For program monitoring purposes, the NCG will be calculated as the
change from end-December 2008 of net credit from the banking system and the change of
holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the nonbank sector.
Priority expenditure
8.
A floor applies to priority spending of the central government, which is measured
cumulatively from December 31, 2008 for the end-March 2009 and end-June 2009 targets.
9.
Definition. Central government priority spending is defined as the sum of those
recurrent expenditures, domestically financed capital expenditures, and net lending that the
government has identified as priority in line with the PRSP process. The definition of priority
expenditures is based on the program classification of the annual budget. Table 1 provides a
summary of the SIBET output4 and a list of the main programs.
Net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government
10.
A ceiling applies to the net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central
government, which is measured cumulatively from December 31, 2008 for the end-March
2009 and end-June 2009 targets.5
11.
Definition. The net accumulation of arrears is defined as the difference between the
gross accumulation of new domestic arrears (measured as the difference between payment
orders and actual payments related to payment orders issued) and gross repayment of any
arrears outstanding on December 31, 2008 (including repayment of float in 2008 and the
repayment of older arrears).
Domestic debt of the central government and the National Bank of Rwanda (DD)
12.

A ceiling applies to the DD for the end-March 2009 and the end-June 2009 targets.

4

The computerized SIBET expenditure management system tracks priority spending at the program level.

5

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

62
C. Targets for Monetary Aggregates
Net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (NFA)
13.
A floor applies to the NFA of the NBR for the end-March 2009 and end-June 2009
targets.
14.
Definition. NFA of the NBR in Rwanda francs are defined, consistent with the
definition of the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) template, as external assets
readily available to or controlled by the NBR net of its external liabilities. Pledged or
otherwise encumbered reserve assets are to be excluded; such assets include, but are not
limited to, reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for third party external liabilities.
Foreign assets and foreign liabilities in U.S. dollars are converted to Rwanda francs by using
the U.S. dollar/Rwanda franc program exchange rate.6 Foreign assets and liabilities in other
currencies are converted to U.S. dollars by using the actual end-of-period
U.S. dollar/currency exchange rate. Foreign liabilities include, inter alia, use of IMF
resources (CCFF and post-conflict emergency assistance purchases and SAF/ESAF/PRGF
disbursements).
Reserve money
15.
A ceiling applies to the stock of reserve money for the end-March 2009 and end-June
2009 targets.
16.

Adjuster:

•

The ceiling on the stock of reserve money will be adjusted symmetrically for a
change in the required reserve ratio of commercial banks by the amount of (new
reserve ratio - program baseline reserve ratio) multiplied by reservable deposit
liabilities in commercial banks.

Broad money
17.
A ceiling applies to the stock of broad money for the end-March 2009 and end-June
2009 targets.
18.
Definition. Broad money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, deposits in
commercial banks, and nonbank deposits in the NBR.

6

The program exchange rate for January – June 2009 is projected at RF555 = US$1.

63
D. Limits on External Debt
Limit on short-term external debt of the public sector
19.
A zero ceiling applies to the outstanding stock of external debt with original
maturities of one year or less owned or guaranteed by the public sector or other agencies on
behalf of the central government. The ceiling is measured cumulatively from December 31,
2008 for the end-March 2009 and end-June 2009 targets.
Contracting or guaranteeing of concessional external debt
20.
A ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of concessional external debt of
the public sector or other agencies on behalf of the central government for the end-June 2009
target. The ceiling on contracted debt becomes binding through a disbursement profile over
2007-09.

Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.

23

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.
24

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.
25

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 3 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) was
subject to a safeguards assessment with respect of the PRGF arrangement approved on
June 12, 2006. The update assessment proposed recommendations to address continuing
vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The implementation of these
measures is being monitored by IMF staff.
X.

Exchange System:

The Rwandan franc was pegged to the SDR until March 6, 1995, when Rwanda adopted
a market-determined exchange rate system. In 2006, the exchange rate regime was
reclassified to a conventional fixed peg in the IMF’s Quarterly Report on Exchange
Arrangements. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF and maintains a system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Since 2001, the NBR has been
operating a weekly auction to sell foreign exchange to commercial banks and published a
reference exchange rate based on its results. From June 2007, the auction was abolished and
replaced by a new arrangement whereby the NBR stood ready to trade with commercial banks
in foreign exchange in unlimited amounts at the price quoted by the NBR. The exchange rate
was set daily as a combination of the previous day’s reference rate, the interbank rate on the
previous day and the five-day moving average of the commercial banks’ exchange rates with
their clients. From February 2008, the exchange rate of the NBR was adjusted weekly
according to the difference between the targeted foreign exchange sales and the actual
amounts sold. From July, the reference rate has been determined by the weighted average of
the rate applied by the NBR and commercial banks in their foreign exchange transactions with
clients during the week, but excluding all transactions between banks. From mid-November
2008, the NBR moved to setting the exchange rate on a daily basis.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Rwanda is on the revised 24-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed the
staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 07/80) on January 29,
2007.

XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:

A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal Transparency (ROSC) was issued
in July 2003. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) took place in February 2005.
Rwanda has not had an Offshore Financial Center (OFC) assessment.

APPENDIX III. RWANDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. National
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments statistics have various
weaknesses which hamper economic analysis. Monetary statistics and data relevant for
banking supervision are adequate for program monitoring, but there is some scope for
improvements in quality and timeliness. The country has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System since October 2003. In August 2005, the National Institute of
Statistics (NIS) was established following the passage of the new Statistics Law.
National Accounts and Price Statistics
Annual GDP estimates in current and constant prices are compiled and disseminated by the
NIS, based on the 1968 System of National Accounts methodology. Work is primarily
carried out by a United Nations Development Programme advisor as NIS staff have little
training in national accounts compilation. Data quality is weak, reflecting inadequate human
and material resources. While considerable effort has been made to improve the reliability of
GDP estimates using the production approach, significant weaknesses in data collection on
expenditures and income hinder the assessment of savings and investment. The reliability of
national accounts estimates is also reduced by weak external sector statistics.
Since 2003, the East AFRITAC has advised the authorities on real sector statistical issues.
This assistance is focused on capacity building to enable the construction of short-term
indicators such as a monthly PPI for the manufacturing sector, which is a joint project with
the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR). The results have not yet been integrated in the national
accounts. A UK Department For International Development project is also supporting the
NIS with a component on national accounts, aiming to establish a program of economic
surveys and the development of leading indicators that can serve as source data for national
accounts. Work is currently underway to rebase the national accounts to base year 2006.
Work on the development of supply and use tables is due to begin in early 2009.
The consumer price index (CPI, 2003=100) utilizes expenditure weights derived from a
2000-01 survey of 6,450 households. Work is under way to rebase the CPI using data from
the 2005/06 Household Living Conditions Survey which the NIS plans to publish in mid
2009. A quarterly PPI (base Q4 2003 = 100) is produced for manufacturing activities.
Real sector data are reported regularly for publication in International Finance Statistics
(IFS), although with some lag, particularly for GDP estimates. Data on employment and
wages are not collected, except for the central government.

12

Government Finance Statistics
Detailed monthly revenues and expenditures are reported to AFR with a lag of three to four
weeks. These data are compiled by the flash-reporting unit of The Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning (MINECOFIN). A functional classification of government expenditure
has been available since the 2003 budget. Within the economic classification, expenditures
on PRSP-designated “priority areas” are clearly identifiable. The fiscal data do not capture
capital expenditure consistently because capital projects (almost entirely externally financed)
are mainly carried out by line ministries outside the regular budget process. Compilation of
data on external budgetary assistance as well as on external debt would benefit from
strengthened coordination between the finance ministry and the central bank. Efforts are
underway to integrate the development budget into the normal budgetary procedures. Fiscal
data often exhibit discrepancies between deficit and financing estimates. To address these
issues, the authorities have made adjustments for changes in the balance of non-core
government accounts, changes in cash in vault at the revenue authority, accounting errors,
and other factors.
No sub-annual data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS, and annual government
finance statistics have not been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook since 1993.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The balance sheet of the NBR and detailed data on money market transactions are
transmitted to AFR on a weekly basis with a lag of one week, while the monetary survey and
the consolidated balance sheet of commercial banks are transmitted on a monthly basis with a
lag of about five weeks. Detailed data on interbank money market transactions are also
provided upon request. Monetary data used to be reported separately to STA and published in
the IFS. The reporting of monetary statistics to STA has been delayed during the migration to
the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) undertaken by the NBR. The interruption in reporting
has been longer than initially planned as the progress of the SRF migration has been
hampered by the scarcity of skilled staff.
An August 2007 STA mission found that (i) a new chart of accounts for commercial banks
was enacted in 2005 and the call report forms sent to the NBR were improved, better
reflecting the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual; (ii) the data on
the Union des banques populaires du Rwanda—a countrywide mutual bank network—were
included in the broad money survey beginning January 2004; (iii) the data on credit and
savings cooperatives and other microfinance institutions are still not included in monetary
statistics.

13
External Sector Statistics
Balance of payments statistics are affected by weaknesses in the collection of source data
(treatment of customs data and bank settlement reports, questionnaires) and insufficient
staffing. The June 2003 multisector statistics mission recommended: (1) reorganizing data
entry and production of external trade statistics, using ASYCUDA and Eurotrace software;
(2) adapting survey forms sent to companies to the BPM5 methodology; and (3)
collaborating with Central Public Investments and External Finance Bureau (CEPEX) to
obtain data on international and bilateral aid. Subsequently, STA balance of payments
statistics missions followed up in January 2004 and June 2005, as did AFRITAC missions in
October 2006 and June 2007.
Technical assistance resulted in significant improvements. In particular, the collection of data
through direct surveys now seems to be well established, and the rate of response is
satisfactory (except for embassies). The NBR has started compiling BOP/IIP statistics in
conformity with the BMP5 methodology. Annual balance of payments and IIP data through
2007 have been reported to STA for publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook.
Nevertheless, some weaknesses remain, particularly in the compilation of trade data. Data
compilation was the main focus of the June 2006 AFRITAC mission, and many adjustments
to customs data were introduced to improve coverage and valuation. The treatment of bank
settlement reports is not effective, because of incomplete automation of the collection of
declarations.
The coverage of external aid remains a cause of concern. Data produced by the CEPEX do
not include aid from important UN agencies and from certain countries. Only the external aid
registered in the Government budget is fully covered. Concerning the NGO sector, the data
should result from the survey of NGOs, but its coverage is insufficient.
Databases on external public debt are maintained by both MINECOFIN and the NBR.
A committee, composed of staffs from the ministries of finance and economic planning,
foreign affairs, and the NBR, is responsible for collecting, harmonizing, and monitoring
information on external public debt.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
RWANDA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Mark Plant and Anthony Boote (IMF) and
Carlos Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
December 19, 2008
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses the sustainability of Rwanda’s external and
domestic public debt. It was conducted jointly by the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank
using the Bank-Fund framework for debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries.
The analysis concludes that Rwanda is at a moderate risk of debt distress.
VI. BACKGROUND
21.
Rwanda’s debt distress classification has been revised from high to moderate.
The last joint DSA, undertaken in February 2008, concluded that Rwanda was at high risk of
debt distress, as the PV of debt to exports ratio breached its policy dependent threshold under
the baseline scenario. Given Rwanda’s small export base and vulnerability to shocks, the last
DSA concluded that continued high level of grants was needed to maintain the PV of
external debt-to-exports ratio at sustainable levels. In the current update of the DSA,
Rwanda’s PV of debt to GDP ratio in 2007 is higher than that projected in the previous
DSA.1 At the same time, the long-term outlook has somewhat improved: (i) grants committed
for 2009-11 are now higher, taking into account the new multiyear commitments by donor
countries, (ii) exports are higher mainly due to a better outturn in 2007 and higher projections
for 2008, and (iii) the projected fiscal financing gap is lower, due to higher budget revenues
(reflecting better-than expected collection in 2008 and the authorities’ efforts to widen the
revenue base) and lower current expenditure path (due to the government’s plans to reduce
exceptional expenditures related to the demobilization and reintegration of former rebels).
Consequently, the current DSA projects the PV of debt to exports ratio and other external

debt indicators to stay below the relevant policy-based indicative thresholds throughout the
entire projection period.
22.
Rwanda reached the HIPC completion point in April 2005 and qualified for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in January 2006, which substantially
improved its debt indicators.2 By end-2006, Rwanda's public debt had declined to
29 percent of GDP from 84 percent in the previous year. In 2007, the pace of debt
accumulation slightly exceeded the nominal GDP growth, and the ratio of public sector debt
to GDP marginally increased. External debt outstanding amounted to nearly 17 percent of
GDP at end-2007, broadly unchanged from end-2006.
23.
At end-2007, Rwanda’s liabilities to international multilateral institutions
comprised the largest share of its debt. In terms of the creditor composition, about
72 percent of the public debt at end-2007 was owed to multilaterals, while 12 percent was
owed to official bilateral creditors. Domestic debt comprised the remaining 16 percent of the
public debt (Figure 1).

The implementation of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative is at an advanced stage. In addition to
the IMF, IDA, and AfDB, completion point and topping up assistance have been provided by BADEA and the
OPEC Fund. IFAD, the Kuwait Fund, the Saudi Fund and the EU have already provided completion point
assistance. Bilateral agreements have been signed with all Paris Club creditors, except France. China has
canceled all outstanding loans, while debts owed to the Abu Dhabi Fund, France, Libya, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait are under negotiation.

3
VII. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
24.
The macroeconomic framework is more favorable over the long term than the
one presented in the last DSA (Box 1). The new baseline reflects:
a.

Higher level of nominal and real GDP due to an upward revision in the real GDP
growth for 2006-07 and projections for 2008 (from 6.0 to 8.5 percent). The projected
growth rate over the medium term takes into account the likely impact of the global
crisis (Box 1). Inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 are also higher than envisaged
in the previous DSA, but from 2010 inflation reverts to the long-term trend after the
impact of international fuel and food prices has passed through and corrective
domestic policies are implemented. The exchange rate is projected to depreciate
somewhat faster in 2008-09 during the period of high inflation and remain unchanged
in real terms from 2010 onward.

b.

Higher export receipts, reflecting the actual outturn for 2007 and the higher projection
for 2008 due to higher commodity prices and export volumes of coffee, tea, and
minerals as well as an increase in tourism arrivals. Consequently, projections of
export receipts over the medium to long term are somewhat higher. Nevertheless,
these results take into account the likely impact of the global slowdown (Box 1).

c.

Lower borrowing requirements because

3

i.

revenue collections are higher than projected for 2008, and the authorities
have stepped up efforts to widen the revenue base and boost efficiency of
tax collection over the medium-term. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is
projected to average 16.7 percent over the long term (Table 3a), as
compared with 15.7 percent in the last DSA;

ii.

total expenditures are projected to be lower than in the last DSA, largely
reflecting the expected cuts in non-priority and exceptional expenditures
projected from 2009 (Text Table 1). The total public expenditure is
projected to average 25.5 percent of GDP, as compared with 26.1 percent
of GDP in the last DSA;

iii.

a new and higher multi-year commitment of grants from major donors
satisfies most of Rwanda’s financing needs in the short-term (Text
Table 1).3 Reflecting available information, the proportion of loans in
external financing gradually increases from about 12 percent and 9 percent

As agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding Governing the Provision of Direct Budget Support in the
Implementation of Rwanda’s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy signed by the
government and major donors in September 2008.

4
in 2008 and 2009 respectively, to an average of about 26 percent in 201011 and annual average of about 33 percent from 2012 onward. In 2008 and
2009 the budget support from IDA is in the form of grants and is assumed
as loans from 2010 onward.4 Financing for the Nyabarongo project, which
is on non-concessional terms, is considered as part of the baseline rather
than as an alternative scenario. All other government borrowing is
assumed to be financed with loans at an average concessionality of
61 percent reflecting the government’s plans to largely rely on borrowing
from IDA and AfDB, in line with recent trends.

This assumption for IDA financing avoids the endogeneity problem in IDA’s decision to allocate grants.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions

Rwanda’s real GDP growth is projected to stabilize at about 6 percent for the
projection period. This growth rate is 1¾ percentage points lower than the historical
trend over the past 4 years (Text Table 1) and assumes that the global slowdown
results in lower remittances and slower growth in the construction and tourism
sectors and other services. At the same time, subsistence agriculture comprises a
large share of the Rwandan economy, which is not strongly integrated into the
world economy. In light of the Government’s plans to adopt measures to improve
agriculture productivity (through improving water management, controlling soil
erosion, intensifying the use of fertilizer and seed inputs, integrating livestock
development into crop farming, and enhancing extension services), growth in the
agriculture sector is projected to be strong over the medium term and is expected to
be the driving force of the overall economic growth. Over the long term, measures
to facilitate trade and reduce transaction costs as well as investments in
infrastructure and human capital are expected to sustain growth in the services and
manufacturing sectors. Rwanda is also consulting with donors on an energy sector
strategy to systematically address its energy constraints in a sustainable manner. In
addition, government is elaborating a strategy to develop vocational education and
training, and ensure that the education system is producing the types of graduates
that are most needed for employment and growth.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow at an average rate of about
10 percent in U.S. dollar terms—less than half of the average annual export growth
over the past 5 years (23 percent). While the export prices are projected to decline
from the high levels of 2008, the growth of export volumes is expected to remain
robust, as the government’s export promotion strategy takes effect. Export growth
in the future is expected to be affected by interventions aimed at increasing yield
and value added in the coffee and tea industry through increased utilization of
fertilizers, improved harvesting methods and better seed quality. With support
from both the EU and the World Bank, investments in road construction should
help reduce the costs of transport, as should regional projects through the Nile
Basin Initiative and a regional Bank project on transport. Services exports are
likely to remain buoyant on account of improved marketing efforts and increased
hotel room capacity.
Imports of goods and services are projected to grow by 9 percent on average over
the period 2008-28, mostly due to growing demand for capital good imports in the
medium term from the private sector, which is partly offset by substantially lower
transportation costs because of better infrastructure links both internally and with
neighboring countries.

VIII. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
25.
The external DSA indicates that all Rwanda’s debt indicators are below the
policy-dependent indicative thresholds. 5 Rwanda’s PV of debt-to-exports ratio is
projected to peak at 138 percent in 2021 and decline thereafter (Figure 2). This improvement
over the previous DSA results (where the ratio breached the policy dependent threshold in
2018) mainly reflects the improved long-term macroeconomic framework. At the same time,
the PV of external debt-to-GDP and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios remain well below their
thresholds throughout the forecast period, while debt service payments continue to be
manageable at below 10 percent of exports.
B. Stress Tests
26.
Rwanda’s debt dynamics would deteriorate sharply if external financing were
delivered on less favorable terms. A 2 percentage point increase in interest rates on all new
borrowing (reflecting borrowing at less concessional terms) starting in 2008 would
substantially increase Rwanda’s PV of debt-to-exports ratio, which would breach the
threshold by 2018 and remain above the threshold until 2025 (Table 3b).6 This indicates that
Rwanda should rely to a large extent on grants to finance its development efforts.
27.
Shocks to the small export base would substantially worsen Rwanda’s PV of
debt-to-exports ratio. If exports were to grow at the historical average less one standard
deviation in 2009 and 2010 (equivalent to a 20 percent reduction in exports in 2009 relative
to the baseline), Rwanda’s PV of debt-to-exports ratio would exceed 150 percent from 2010
onward, peaking at over 230 percent in 2019 (Figure 2). This scenario highlights the
importance of effective export promotion to set Rwanda on a sustainable debt path.
28.
In the historical scenario, the indicators of debt sustainability remain below the
policy-based thresholds. The improvement in the historical scenario as compared to the last
DSA largely resulted from changing projections for the private capital flows. The better than
expected outcome of 2007 and improved projections for 2008 led to a shift of the path for
foreign direct investment and private debt-creating flows over the long term.

The World Bank’s three-year average CPIA classifies Rwanda as a medium policy performer.

The 2 percent increase in interest rates would be equivalent to lowering the grant element to fewer than
35 percent from 2009 onward (which is below the grant element of 50 percent required under the Rwanda’s
PRGF).

IX. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
29.
Rwanda’s public debt burden (including domestic debt) is expected to stabilize
over the projection period.7 With moderate domestic financing over the long term, the PV
of domestic debt is expected to stabilize at about 5 percent of GDP from 2018 onward. This
trend is partly offsetting the increase in external debt, so that the PV of total public debt-toGDP ratio would increase from 15 percent in 2008 and stabilize at about 20 percent in the
long term. The debt service-to-revenue ratio would remain below 4 percent (Figure 3).
B. Stress Tests
30.
Lower GDP growth would result in much less favorable debt dynamics. Both
growth-related stress tests (assuming growth at the historical average less one standard
deviation in 2009-10 and permanently lower growth during 2009-28) imply a substantial
worsening in all debt indicators (though all indicators stay below debt burden thresholds).
This underscores the importance of selecting and investing only in infrastructure projects
with a high rate of return and undertaking structural reforms to set the stage for robust private
sector growth.
31.
Debt indicators would worsen under the bounds test, where there is a 10 percent
of GDP increase in debt-creating flows in 2009. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would climb
to 38 percent by 2028. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio and debt service-to-revenue ratio
would accelerate reaching 104 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in 2011. This scenario
demonstrates the impact of contingent liabilities, such as the recapitalization of banks or
systematically important private or public sector entities, and highlights the need for
appropriately accounting for fiscal risks and maintaining contingency reserve funds for
addressing the shocks.
32.
However, the scenario with fixed primary deficit suggests that reining in
government spending can significantly improve the debt dynamics. In this scenario, the
primary balance for 2009-28 is assumed to be in a small surplus as projected for 2008 (while
the baseline scenario projects a modest primary deficit). This together with the high level of
grants received by Rwanda in the baseline scenario implies that the financing need in the
scenario is exclusively covered by grants. Over time, this would cause the public debt to
decrease.

7

The DSA excludes contingent liabilities of the pension fund and possible government guarantees for the public
power utility Electrogaz, which are not yet quantifiable because projects in the sector are still at an early stage.

X. CONCLUSION
33.
The baseline, alternative scenarios and stress tests confirm that Rwanda faces a
moderate risk of debt distress. Despite reduced risk of debt distress, owing to recent debt
relief and favorable debt developments in the last year, exogenous shocks to exports or
imprudent borrowing on nonconcessional terms could cause a rapid deterioration in the
medium-term outlook. The alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that debt indicators
are highly sensitive to less concessional financing and lower growth, particularly in exports.
This indicates that Rwanda should rely on concessional borrowing and grants to finance its
development efforts.
34.
The DSA suggests that investment and structural reforms should focus on
enhancing private-sector led exports and growth and protecting Rwanda against
shocks. Reducing the cost of doing business, financial sector reform and infrastructure
investments will be critical. These efforts, together with measures to promote exports, should
not only raise overall growth, but also help improve the business and investment climate, and
facilitate a strengthening and diversification of the export base. At the same time, the
authorities are committed to reforms to improve expenditure and debt management and raise
the revenue-to-GDP ratio for an eventual exit from donor flows.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Rwanda
January 12, 2009
This statement summarizes developments in Rwanda since the issuance of the staff
report. The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Signs of economic slowdown have emerged. While export growth remained strong up to
October 2008, tourism bookings for 2009 have declined and some foreign investors reported
difficulties in securing financing for planned FDI projects, confirming the projected deceleration of
growth in 2009.
Rising food prices have kept headline inflation above 20 percent. Notwithstanding a
significant reduction in retail petrol prices, inflation reached 22.4 percent year-on-year in November.
Food prices increased despite a good local harvest, reflecting high demand for agricultural products
from the neighboring countries. At the same time, the seasonally adjusted monthly core inflation
declined sharply in November, a sign that the underlying inflationary pressures are subsiding.
A shortfall in budgetary grants has occurred, as several donors have recently put their
budget assistance on hold. The amount of budgetary support currently on hold is about 0.7 percent
of GDP for 2008, and about 0.3 percent of GDP for the first half of 2009. Staff’s preliminary
assessment suggests that this shortfall can be accommodated within the current program framework.
Elimination of domestic arrears appears to be on track. Preliminary information for midDecember suggests that the stock of domestic arrears accumulated in the third quarter has been
repaid, and the end-2008 program target for domestic arrears repayment appeared to be within reach.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008
IV Consultation with Rwanda

International Monetary Fund

Article Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

On January 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1
Background
Over the past decade, Rwanda’s economic performance has been strong, backed by
sound macroeconomic and structural policies and substantial donor assistance. During
this period, real GDP growth has been robust at 7 percent on average and inflation has
been generally low. Rising revenues and assistance from international donors created
fiscal space to scale up public spending, including on pro-poor initiatives. Rwanda
qualified for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative in 2005 and benefited from MDRI in
2006, which significantly reduced its external debt. External position has strengthened
with the aid flows, allowing an adequate reserve coverage of imports.
Rwanda is advancing toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has made
significant progress in achieving the objectives on universal primary education, gender
equality and empowering of women, and reducing child mortality. Nonetheless, poverty
remains pervasive.
The Rwanda’s macroeconomic policies have been supported by a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which was approved in June 2006.
The program is designed to maintain macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for
stronger growth and poverty reduction.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Policy implementation under the PRGF-supported program in 2008 has been
satisfactory. Growth is expected to reach 8.5 percent, reflecting buoyant activity in the
agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services sectors. Nevertheless, inflation
accelerated to double digits in the second half of the year, reflecting the impact of
international commodity prices and expansion of domestic demand. The fiscal stance
was tighter than envisaged in the first half of the year, largely reflecting strong revenue
performance. The monetary program also remained broadly in line with the program.
The authorities made good progress in implementing the structural reforms agenda. In
particular, in the second half of 2008 the authorities finalized a medium-term action plan
for the public financial management reform, the national payments strategy, designed to
improve the payments infrastructure and address the development of basic payment
services in Rwanda, and the debt management strategy, which sets the limits for
external debt accumulation consistent with the medium-term fiscal policy objectives.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Rwandan authorities for implementing sound macroeconomic
policies and important structural reforms over the past years. These policies and reforms
helped achieve high economic growth, keep inflation relatively stable, and improve debt
sustainability.
Downside risks to the near-term economic outlook have increased because of the global
financial crisis and economic slowdown. Also, poverty remains widespread, and social
indicators lag behind those of many other African countries, despite high economic
growth rates. Over the medium term, Directors emphasized that the main challenge will
be to maintain high and broad-based economic growth and reduce persistent poverty,
while pursuing macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.
Directors considered the authorities’ macroeconomic policy framework and structural
reform agenda to be appropriate for tackling these challenges. They encouraged the
authorities to implement cautious fiscal and monetary policies that would ease inflation
and possible balance of payments pressures without stifling economic growth.
Continued determined implementation of structural reforms will be important to raise
investment rates, expand the private sector, deepen the financial sector, and diversify
the production and export base.
Directors commended the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance, which focuses on priority
spending while containing inflationary pressures and keeping debt at a sustainable level.
They observed that while Rwanda’s revenue collection has improved, it is still relatively
low. They encouraged the authorities to monitor revenue developments carefully, and to
further enlarge the tax base and strengthen tax administration in order to reduce over
time Rwanda’s substantial aid dependence. Directors underscored the importance of
improving public financial management and, in this regard, welcomed the efforts to
improve the institutional framework for formulating and executing the public investment
program.
Directors supported a scaling up of public investment in view of Rwanda’s substantial
development needs. They encouraged the authorities to rely on grants and

3
highly-concessional loans for its financing in order to safeguard debt sustainability gains.
In this respect, Directors welcomed the authorities’ development of a comprehensive
debt management strategy, which sets limits for loans and loan guarantees. They
recommended that the debt strategy incorporate the fiscal risks associated with
contingent liabilities, particularly those relating to planned public-private partnerships.
Directors stressed that the financing of infrastructure projects should be consistent with
a well-prioritized medium-term expenditure framework.
Directors noted that domestic demand pressures and higher world food and fuel prices
led to an acceleration of inflation in the second half of 2008. Although recent signs of
easing core inflation are encouraging, Directors supported the authorities’ tight monetary
stance to contain the second-round effects of the commodity price shocks. They
recommended that steps be taken to raise interest rates to positive levels in real terms.
They encouraged efforts to improve liquidity forecasting and management, particularly
through better coordination of monetary and fiscal policies.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the real exchange rate of the Rwandan franc
is broadly in line with economic fundamentals, although rising inflation led to real
appreciation pressures toward the end of 2008. In this context, they welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to increase nominal exchange rate flexibility and subordinate
the foreign currency sales to monetary policy objectives. Directors underscored the
importance of structural reforms and of the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks to
safeguard Rwanda’s external competitiveness.
Directors commended the measures taken in recent years to strengthen the banking
sector, including the passage of legislation in October 2008 to counter money
laundering and terrorism financing. Noting that credit and operational risks remain high,
Directors welcomed the central bank’s intention to improve banking regulation and
supervision. They looked forward to the timely implementation of the financial sector
development plan.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to promote private sector-led diversified
growth and employment generation. They supported the reforms to improve the
investment climate, and attached high priority to measures aimed at addressing land
use and other structural problems that hinder agricultural development. They
encouraged further trade integration with the East African Community. Given Rwanda’s
financing and capacity constraints, Directors underlined the importance of properly
calibrating the scope, timing, and pace of reforms.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the
IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV
consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of
post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term
program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy
matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 12, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review under PRGF with Rwanda and Approves
US$1.7 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth review of
Rwanda’s economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. The completion of the review enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent
to SDR 1.14 million (about US$1.7 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR
6.84 million (about US$10.4 million).
The Executive Board also granted a waiver for the nonobservance of a structural performance criterion
for end-June 2008 related to publication of the Public Financial Management reform action plan for
2008-10. The action plan was published with a delay in September 2008.
The Executive Board also concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation with Rwanda. Details of the
findings will be published in a Public Information Notice.
The three-year PRGF arrangement for Rwanda was approved by the Executive Board in June 2006 (see
Press Release No. 06/121) in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.01 million (about US$12.2 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, said:
“The Rwandan authorities have continued to implement strongly their economic program in 2008.
Economic growth accelerated and external public debt sustainability improved. While inflation increased
in the second half of the year due to increases in world food and fuel prices and domestic demand
pressures, preliminary signs of easing core inflation are encouraging. The medium-term outlook remains
favorable, even though risks of contagion from the deteriorating external environment have increased.
“In 2009, the main challenges will be to mitigate the impact of the world economic crisis on the local
economy, reduce inflation further and cope with possible balance of payments pressures without
jeopardizing economic growth. To this effect, the authorities aim to continue to implement cautious and
coordinated fiscal and monetary policies, as well as structural reforms that will help raise investment
rates, expand the private sector, deepen the financial sector, and diversify the production and export base.
These measures should make it possible for Rwanda to take full advantage of the recent steep decline in
world commodity prices to lower inflation.
“The authorities intend to continue to rely mostly on grants and highly concessional borrowing in order
to safeguard debt sustainability. Borrowing decisions will be guided by the new debt management
strategy and a medium-term public expenditure management framework. Infrastructure projects that are

2
needed to alleviate bottlenecks to private sector growth should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case
basis in terms of their cost effectiveness and impact on the public debt.
“Sustaining high growth and reducing poverty requires that Rwanda accelerate the breadth and pace of
structural reforms, while maintaining the focus on improving public service delivery and creating a
vibrant private sector. The ongoing and planned reforms in public financial management are
encouraging, and will be essential to ensure that public resources are allocated efficiently. Enlarging the
local tax base and improving tax administration will be key to increasing revenue collection and reducing
aid dependence over time,” Mr. Portugal said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that PRGFsupported programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce
poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a
5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for Rwanda
January 12, 2009
My Rwandan authorities would like to thank staff for the constructive discussions held in Kigali relating
to the fifth review of the PRGF arrangement and the 2008 Article IV consultation. They would also like
to thank the Executive Board and Management for the continued support to Rwanda in its endeavor to
pursue the agenda for development and poverty reduction. My authorities broadly share the thrust of the
staff report, which well documents the progress made so far in economic management as well as key
strategic areas that need further effort to sustain performance.
After more than two years of steady reforms under the current PRGF, Rwanda has consolidated a
decade-long performance of macroeconomic stability, and is laying firmer ground for robust growth and
debt sustainability. Cognizant of the potential impact of the current global economic slowdown,
especially on exports, my authorities have developed strategies to diversify partners and promote exports
especially by targeting niche markets. My authorities are also fully aware of the challenges ahead,
including promoting job-creating growth especially in agriculture, addressing the infrastructure gap and
skilled-labor shortage. The policies laid out in their MEFP for 2009 and for the medium term have been
set expressly to address these constraints.

I. Overview of Recent Economic Developments
Rwanda’s macroeconomic performance in 2008 has been satisfactory amid many domestic constraints
and a gloomy international environment. End-year growth is projected at 8.5 percent owing to buoyant
agricultural production, expanding production of manufactured goods, construction, transport, and a
more dynamic financial sector. Inflation recently accelerated, reaching 22.4 percent year-on-year in
November. In addition to measures implemented to cope with world oil and food price shocks, my
authorities are taking actions both on the fiscal and monetary fronts to bring inflation back to single
digits.
My authorities have also recorded appreciable performance in the implementation of the PRGF program.
All quantitative end-June performance criteria for the fifth review and all but one structural reform
measure through end-June 2008 were met. Revenues outperformed throughout the year, owing to
taxation of growing imports and faster-than-anticipated growth, but also as a consequence of higher
inflation. My authorities are committed to save part of this revenue with the view of making-up the effect
of higher spending stemming from financing emergency programs. In the monetary sector, the
authorities intend to further tighten policy to tackle inflation with a view to restoring positive real interest
rates. As regards structural reforms, my authorities have made important strides that will undoubtedly
improve business in many areas. The PFM reform action plan for 2008-10 prepared with development
partners is completed and published. In the financial sector, the National Payments Strategy designed to
improve the payments infrastructure and address the development of basic payment services in Rwanda
is also completed and posted on the website of the NBR. Many other reforms include a new legal
framework to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, a better organization and
supervision of the insurance industry, as well as the reinforcement of the oversight framework for the
NBR. With the assistance of the World Bank and the Fund, my authorities have also developed a debt
management strategy that was published on the MINECOFIN website.

2
II. Program 2009 and Medium Term Agenda
My Rwandan authorities’ medium-term policies are embedded in the new EDPRS (2008-2012), which,
in line with the Rwanda Vision 2020 development plan, focus on removing impediments to private
sector-led growth, reducing poverty by improving food security, raising income of the poor especially in
rural areas and creating social protection schemes, while preserving macroeconomic stability. The
EDPRS key elements are: (i) addressing severe infrastructure bottleneck; (ii) enhancing agricultural
productivity, linkages and trade; (iii) removing obstacles to the development of private businesses; (iv)
improving the delivery of public services; and (v) mobilizing sustainable financing.

Macroeconomic policies for 2009
The authorities projected real GDP growth at 5.5–6.5 percent for 2009 against 8.5 percent in 2008.
Recent developments showed an adverse impact of global slowdown on the tourism and FDI sectors in
Rwanda, confirming the projected deceleration of growth. Despite a good local harvest and a significant
reduction in retail petrol prices, a high food deficit in the surrounding region introduces some downward
rigidity to achieving dramatic price decline from a domestic point of view. Nevertheless, my authorities
intend to intensify their efforts in that regard. The international reserves target is set at about 4½ months
of imports. Structural policies will broadly focus on improving public financial management, developing
the financial sector, and making growth enhancing investments and reforms.
In the area of fiscal policy, my authorities’ actions for 2009 will be geared towards increasing the
revenue to GDP ratio by at least 0.2 percent to finance public investments. Actions will include a
monthly monitoring of government cash flow and a set of structural measures, namely: (i) enhancing
taxpayer compliance and refining taxpayer segmentation by allocating more companies to the groups of
large and medium-sized companies subject to enhanced surveillance; (ii) increasing efficiency of
operations and minimizing transaction costs; and (iii) facilitating trade by further refining the operations
and eligibility criteria for using the expedited clearance scheme for compliant exporters, which
accounted for about two-thirds of imports in September 2008.
My authorities intend to begin implementing their new medium-term strategy for PFM reform. As part of
their broader strategy, the PFM action plan for 2009 includes measures in the areas of economic
management and budgeting, financial management and reporting, public procurement and budget
execution oversight. A broad range of activities will be carried out, such as building capacity for research
and macroeconomic modeling, aligning the budget calendar to practices within the East African
Community (EAC), clarifying reporting relationships and reporting formats for sub-national government
units, introducing the new integrated financial management information system, SmartGov, or adopting
the new organizational structure for the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority.
As regards monetary and exchange rate policies, my Rwandan authorities will maintain a tight
monetary policy in 2009. In that regard, the NBR will continue to monitor inflation, government
spending and private sector credit and will stand ready to raise the key repo rate, if needed. To reduce
inflation to about 14 percent by mid-2009 and to single digits in the second half of 2009, the NBR will
limit reserve money growth (12-month) to 15 percent at end-June and 18 percent at end-2009. It is also
the authorities’ intention to allow more flexibility in the exchange rate and increase the frequency of
adjustments so as to reduce any pressures for appreciation of the franc and to ensure that Rwanda’s
exports remain competitive.

3
Medium term policies
In the implementation of their broad development agenda, my authorities, in consultation with
development partners, have elaborated a Public Investment Program (PIP), a Financial Sector
Development Plan, and a Rural Development Program to promote private sector led growth and create
employment over the medium term. They also recently consolidated and realigned the activities of eight
government agencies into the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to eliminate inefficiencies in
operations and streamline the bureaucracy in order to advance private sector development initiatives.
The Public Investment Program aims at supporting the accelerated delivery of strategic national
infrastructure without jeopardizing debt sustainability. Its objectives evolve around aligning public
investment and private investment with the long-term development agenda, enhancing efficiency in
resources allocation, and the overall coordination of interventions. Particularly, the PIP framework
highlights the major public projects that are planned over the course of 2009-2011, their likely costs and
criteria for selection. The framework was discussed with development partners, some of whom
(particularly DFID and the World Bank) are already providing technical assistance. Regarding
infrastructure, the focus of the PIP in 2009 is to address the issue of limited and insufficient energy,
continue improving ICT infrastructure, design and execute projects to upgrade key road networks in
Kigali and the surroundings.
My authorities consider that public investment should be an engine for private investment, by helping to
reduce systematically the operational cost of business, and increasing the private sector’s capacity to
innovate. The EDPRS targets an average level of public investment of 10% of GDP over 2009-12, whilst
private investment will need to rise from 8.6% of GDP to 14.6% of GDP in 2012. The public spending is
expected to be financed by a combination of domestic tax and non-tax revenues, external budgetary
grants trough budgetary support, external project grants and loans trough project support, and external
net borrowing.
In the same vein, my authorities have updated their Strategic Plan for the Transformation of
Agriculture (PSTA-Phase II) for implementation over the 2009-2012 period. The government views the
agricultural sector and animal husbandry as the main springboard for poverty reduction, through its
capacity to improve food security, create employment and raise incomes especially for rural populations.
The main focuses of the plan are four fold: (i) agriculture intensification and development of sustainable
production systems; (ii) support to the professionalisation of producers; (iii) promotion of commodity
chains and development of agribusinesses; and (iv) improvement in the institutional capacity of the
supporting systems. Within the framework of this strategic plan, my authorities are planning investments
to ease pressure on land, especially through crop intensification, reduce soil erosion and increase
irrigation systems. Their approach is to implement over the short-term pilot projects in these areas, to
help assess viability, before launching larger investment projects that are under preparation for
implementation over a three-year period. As for export crops, the strategy is to promote value-added
products targeting niche markets for the traditional sectors of coffee, tea and pyrethrum as well as other
non-traditional export crops.
As for the development of the private sector, my Rwandan authorities are determined to advance their
goal of making Rwanda a compelling hub for business and investment. Efforts to build a culture of
innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as to improve the delivery of public services, will continue. It is
in this regard that eight former government agencies were consolidated into the new Rwanda
Development Board (RDB). RDB will drive legal and regulatory reforms to eliminate inefficiencies and

4
streamline the bureaucracy. Furthermore, along with the progress already made in building institutions
and process for land registration, steps are being taken to make the Rwanda Commercial and Registry
Services operational, with the view to improving business registration, securitization of assets, and
registration of property rights. Furthemore, the Rwanda Workforce Development Authority created in
January 2008 – will continue to build its capacity and systems to fully spearhead the development of
employable skills and entrepreneurship capacity, principally through vocational and on-the-job training,
skills regulation and accreditation, labor market information systems and business incubation.
My authorities have also stepped up efforts to implement reforms outlined in their Financial Sector
Development Plan, with the view to building a sound and dynamic financial sector capable of sustaining
private sector activities. Banks have been recapitalized and stability indicators have improved. Actions in
2009 will cover the modernization of the national payments system, the development of long-term
finance and capital markets, the development of contractual savings and investments, and the
transformation of the Rwanda Housing Bank into a secondary mortgage facility. The government will
also continue to work on the reform of the Rwandan Development Bank with a view to enhancing
medium term lending. A law on non-bank financial institutions (such as private pensions, mutual funds)
should come out in 2009, which will set the basis for the emergence of those institutions, twenty of
which already operate informally. As for microfinance, a law passed in April 2008 should be gazetted in
2009.
As regards debt management, my authorities are committed to maintain the current favorable situation
inherited from debt relief initiatives. Rwanda’s debt distress classification has improved from high to
moderate. My authorities intend to further improve this stance thanks to the guiding principles of their
debt management strategy whose main objective is to ensure that the financing requirements and
repayments are met at least cost with prudent risk considerations while keeping debt sustainable. In that
regard, authorities have committed themselves to request, whenever possible, the assessment of the
economic and financial viability of major agriculture and infrastructure projects from the World Bank
before proceeding. The Rwandan authorities also plan to formulate a strategy to exit from aid
dependence over the long term, of which increasing revenue-to-GDP ratio forms a key component.

Conclusion
With the continuous support of the donor community, my Rwandan authorities have made great strides
on the path of macroeconomic stability and sustained growth. Nevertheless, Rwanda is still facing many
impediments that preclude the country from significantly tackling pervasive poverty. My authorities are
committed to steadily pursue their effort that yielded appreciable results other the last decade. Their
comprehensive agenda going forward, encompassing all sectors is meant to sustain those efforts,
especially in the field of infrastructure, PFM, banking and finance and cost of doing business.
In light of their good track record of policy implementation and sound policy agenda for the period
ahead, my Rwandan authorities would like to request the support of the Board for the conclusion of the
2008 Article IV consultation, the completion of the fifth review under the PRGF arrangement and waiver
of nonobservance of a performance criterion. My authorities are convinced that the policies set forth for
the period ahead will help build a broad-based economy capable of bringing about substantial poverty
reduction and achieving the remaining MDGs.
