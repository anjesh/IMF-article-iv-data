EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Real GDP growth accelerated to an estimated 5.2 percent in 2005, driven by
strong exports and consumption, prudent policies, and improvement in the security situation.
Inflation is slightly higher than a year ago, but remains in check, while unemployment
continues to fall, albeit from a high level. The sheqel has remained broadly stable over the
past year. Financial system indicators have strengthened, but credit risks remain high, and the
rapid development of the capital markets has introduced new regulatory and supervisory
challenges.
Outlook: The macroeconomic outlook is broadly positive, but there is further scope to
enhance growth and reduce vulnerabilities. More can be done to improve the soundness of
fiscal and monetary policies, reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system, and increase the
economy’s flexibility. Poverty alleviation has become a top priority in the political agenda
and may require some reallocation of resources within the fiscal envelope.
Policy Discussions
Fiscal consolidation remains a priority. The ceilings on real expenditure growth and the
deficit, as a percent of GDP, have strengthened fiscal consolidation efforts. However there is
a strong case for more ambitious fiscal consolidation, particularly by targeting a deficit
below the 3 percent of GDP ceiling in order to achieve a meaningful reduction in the debt-toGDP ratio. The staff stressed that the authorities should resist taking additional measures,
such as the tax cuts introduced in 2005, that would impede lowering public debt relative to
GDP.
The stance of monetary policy is appropriate. However, the staff’s view is that the policy
rate is below the neutral rate and will, therefore, have to rise over time as excess capacity is
gradually eliminated, an assessment the authorities broadly agreed with. A proposed new
Bank of Israel Law will strengthen the independence of the central bank.
A rapidly changing financial system requires greater scrutiny. In view of the accelerated
developments in the capital markets, the staff encouraged the authorities to refine their
supervisory and regulatory activities to focus more on key risks associated with the
transformation of the financial system. The authorities shared this view. The staff cautioned
that the actual implementation of Basel II will require a significant resource commitment.
Poverty alleviation. Despite the strong economic recovery, the incidence of poverty and
income inequality have increased. The authorities are considering various remedial measures.
The staff noted that any such measures should be within the current fiscal framework, be
targeted, provide the right incentives to work, and be consistent with growth-promoting
policies.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
Following a strong performance in 2004, the economic expansion accelerated in
2005, supported by a relatively favorable global economic environment, an
improvement in the security situation, and prudent policies. The Article IV consultation
occurred against the backdrop of robust output growth, low inflation, falling
unemployment—albeit from a high level—and a steady improvement in the external
position. The current account is in a small surplus, the sheqel has remained broadly stable,
and foreign investment has reached record levels.
2.
The macroeconomic outlook is positive, but there is further scope to enhance
growth and reduce vulnerabilities. The macroeconomic policies and structural reforms of
recent years have opened up the economy, increased its competitiveness, and attracted
foreign investment. However, more can be done to improve the framework for fiscal and
monetary policies, reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system, and increase the economy’s
flexibility. A key challenge is to sustain the ongoing fiscal retrenchment and thereby reduce
the large stock of public debt relative to GDP. While banking system indicators have
strengthened recently, credit risks remain high and the development of capital markets has
created new regulatory and supervisory challenges. Poverty alleviation has become a top
priority in the political agenda and may require some reallocation of resources within the
fiscal envelope.
Box 1. Israel: Key Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal policy: The Fund has considered the fiscal stance over the past several years as appropriate and welcomed the
introduction of expenditure and deficit ceilings. At the same time, the public debt as a share of GDP remains very high
and the Fund has emphasized the importance of accelerating debt reduction by abstaining from further tax cuts. In this
regard, the passage of the 2005 legislation of multi-year tax cuts may risk slowing the path of debt reduction.
Structural Fiscal Reform: The Fund has urged the authorities to adopt a multi-year budget framework to help ensure
that future budgets are better insulated from political pressures and reflect long-term priorities. The authorities are
concerned about loss of budget flexibility, but have agreed in principle to explore this recommendation further.
Monetary policy: In line with the Fund’s recommendation, the authorities are working to enhance their policy tools
and procedures for implementing inflation targeting. The authorities have also continued to take steps to increase the
transparency of the Inflation Report, including by giving more attention to the dynamics of the inflation forecast. Key
parameters of the proposed new Bank of Israel Law are consistent with previous Fund recommendations.
Capital Market Reforms: During the 2004 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to strengthen competition in the financial sector and the steps being taken to remove obstacles to capital
market development. Banks’ divestiture of their mutual and provident funds has so far increased competition in these
instruments. Directors also noted, however, that the capital market reforms would require the supervisory and
regulatory functions to be enhanced to mitigate systemic risk that could arise from the transfer of mutual and
provident funds to the non-bank sector. The authorities have recognized the risks posed by these reforms and are
taking action to address them, in particular, by introducing new laws and regulations and developing new proactive
approaches to enforcement.

3.
The fallout from the Gaza disengagement, which included the resignation of the
finance minister and the creation of a new centrist party, has significantly altered the
political landscape. Prime Minister Sharon’s illness has added to the political turmoil.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Ehud Olmert has been serving as Acting
Prime Minister in the run-up to the March 28 elections. Because the Knesset was dissolved
prior to approving the 2006 budget, the government has been operating using the (relatively
tight) 2005 budget framework, which allows 1/12 of that budget to be spent each month until
a new 2006 budget is approved. The staff suggested a follow-up staff visit to assess the
proposed new budget following the elections. This suggestion was welcomed by the
authorities. The new political landscape is not expected to adversely affect economic policy
in the near term, but may well have implications over the longer term.

After three years of depressed
activity, real GDP growth recovered
strongly in 2004 and increased further in
2005. The strong and sustained growth
experienced since the mid-1980s came to a
halt in 2001−02 as a result of the high-tech
slump, the global slowdown, and the
deterioration in the Israeli security situation
(Figure 1). The economy has since recovered;
real GDP grew by 4.4 percent in 2004, and by
an estimated 5.2 percent in 2005. The
expansion is being driven by exports, which
rose by an average of 10 percent annually
over the past three years, and private
consumption (Table 1). Staff analysis
suggests that investment has lagged other
indicators in recent years partly because of
high corporate leverage.1 However, as the
financial health of the corporate sector
improved, investment began to rise in 2005.
Inflation is slightly higher than a year ago,
but remains contained, while unemployment
continues to fall, although from a high level
(Figure 2, Table 1).

5.
There is broad agreement that economic growth will remain strong in the short
term. In line with the authorities’ views, the staff projects output to expand by slightly more
than 4 percent in 2006−07, driven by private consumption, in turn supported by strong
employment and income growth, and a favorable external environment. The staff expects the
recovery of business investment to strengthen, reflecting increased profitability and liquidity
as well as lower debt ratios; while residential investment will likely still lag given the
continued high leverage in the real estate sector. Export growth is projected to remain strong,
while imports should rise in line with the recovery in investment. As the output gap closes,
inflation is expected to pick up, albeit moderately. The main risks to the outlook are related
to weakness abroad, especially in the United States and Europe, a sustained rise in oil prices,
political volatility, and a deterioration in the security situation.2

Improved confidence in the macroeconomic outlook has been helped by the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts, which are critical to putting the public debt to
GDP ratio on a firm downward path.

Given the renewed emphasis on fiscal consolidation, and inflation within the
Bank of Israel’s (BoI) target range of 1–3 percent, monetary policy has been
appropriately accommodative, notwithstanding recent increases in the policy rate
(Figure 5). Interest rates were lowered in 2004, as inflationary pressures eased amid sheqel
appreciation against the U.S. dollar.

changed in December but was
increased by 25 basis points in January as the Bank of Israel became concerned about the
closing of the output gap and the narrowing interest rate differential with the United States.
8.
The Israeli sheqel, a freely floating currency, has remained broadly stable over
the past year, balanced by strong economic activity on the one hand and relatively low
interest rates on the other. The improved economic outlook helped attract strong foreign
capital inflows in 2005 amounting to a record US$9.7 billion of direct and portfolio
investment, an increase of 66 percent over the 2004 level. The US$5.7 billion of foreign
direct investment, in particular, has helped mitigate downward pressure on the sheqel
stemming from the historically low interest rate differential with the U.S. Owing largely to
the continued low inflation, Israel’s competitive position has remained relatively strong, as
evidenced by the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) in recent years
(Figures 1, 4). The improved competitiveness can also be seen in the strength of private
sector productivity growth, which averaged 2 percent in the period 1993−2004, compared to
the growth in real wages, which averaged 1.3 percent over the same period. This is
confirmed by the depreciation in recent years in the unit labor cost (ULC) based REER.

The initially proposed 2006 budget projected a deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP.

Looking ahead, staff expects capital inflows to remain strong, although below the record
levels reached last year, provided the security situation remains relatively calm, productivity
continues to strengthen, and the economy expands further. In the event that these favorable
conditions fail to materialize, there is the risk that capital inflows would reverse, as happened
in 2001−02, and the sheqel could come under pressure.
9.
The current account continued to show a small surplus in 2005, further
enhancing confidence and mitigating external risks. After ten consecutive years of current
account deficits, Israel has run surpluses for the past three years, largely reflecting the strong
recovery in exports (Figure 4, Table 3). The staff expects the improvement in the current
account to continue over the medium term, reflecting past gains in productivity and
competitiveness. The improved balance of payments position is also reflected in the
country’s net external asset position (on debt instruments), which is close to US$23 billion as
of end-2005. Moreover, foreign reserves, totaling about US$27 billion (22 percent of GDP),
cover roughly 90 percent of total gross short-term external debt or about 5 months of
imports. Rollover risks of public-sector external debt—currently at about 25 percent of
GDP—are mitigated by two key factors; about 80 percent of this debt is held by the Jewish
Diaspora or backed by U.S. government guarantees,5 while short-term external public debt
remains low, at around 2 percent of GDP. Indeed, the relatively low level of sovereign risk is
reflected in the low risk premium of about 80 basis points over U.S. treasuries on 10-year
foreign-currency denominated sovereign bonds (Figure 5). This risk premium compression
and the sharp rise in the equity market over the past two years (Figure 5) were in part driven
by foreign investors’ appetite for emerging market assets generally and Israeli assets in
particular.
5

Under the 2003 U.S. government’s guarantees program, Israel is eligible to issue US$9 billion of
sovereign guaranteed debt spread between 2003 and 2007. As of end-October, 2005, the remaining
balance was US$4.6 billion, of which US$2.6 billion is available immediately.

-9-

10.
While the economic recovery has led to a strengthening of the financial system,
the banking system continues to hold a stubbornly high level of problem loans.6 Despite
the growing economy, problem loans as a percentage of total loans averages about 10 percent
for the banking system. The construction and real-estate sectors, which have been in a
persistent slump since the beginning of the 2001−02 recession, account for a significant share
of the banks’ problem loan exposure. Risk-based capital adequacy ratios for the five largest
banks range from 9.7 to 12.2 percent.
11.
Post recession bank earnings have improved, but remain low despite a strong
economy. Through end-September 2005, the banking system reported net income of
NIS5.3 billion or a 0.8 percent annualized return on assets compared to a 0.6 percent rate for
2004. The banks expect to realize one-time gains from the divestiture of their funds
management businesses, which temporarily will augment income. The banking system
enjoys ample liquidity provided primarily through deposit funding, including from the
foreign offices of Israeli banks. Foreign currency funding averaged 43 percent of liabilities
for the five largest banks.

The recent passage of new capital market reforms has led to rapid changes in
the structure of the capital market. The Knesset approved the capital market reforms in
mid-2005 with the objective of fostering a stable, competitive financial system with welldeveloped capital markets. The main reform measures included the requirement that banks
divest themselves of their mutual and provident fund business, regulations on banks’
securities-related activities to reduce potential conflicts of interest, and restrictions on the
maximum market share of individual firms. Contrary to expectations, the sale of the mutual
and provident funds proceeded rapidly, with banks selling most of the funds, primarily to
insurance companies, within three months of the passage of legislation. Separately, the
authorities have also taken actions that have led to an expansion in the corporate bond market

and in capital markets more generally. This has provided further opportunities for businesses
to obtain credit and more choice for investors.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on four main areas: fiscal policy, monetary policy, financial
stability, and poverty alleviation. There was broad agreement on the key issues,
particularly on the need to continue fiscal consolidation.
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The authorities instituted in 2004 a new budgetary framework intended to
ensure medium-term fiscal consolidation. This framework, which, provides a welcome
sign of increased commitment to fiscal consolidation, is based on two rules: a cap on the
growth rate of budgeted real expenditures of 1 percent a year and a ceiling on the deficit of
3 percent of GDP. When growth is weak, as was the case when the framework was adopted,
the framework is binding. However, when growth is strong, the deficit ceiling becomes nonbinding and scope emerges to use revenue over-performance to either reduce the stock of
public debt or cut taxes. This possibility arose early in 2005, and a 5-year tax reduction
package was enacted (Box 2). Staff had urged that the revenue over-performance be used to
reduce the deficit and debt. In the event, both happened because of unexpected favorable
one-off shocks to expenditure late in the year.
15.
Turning to prospects for 2006, the authorities reiterated their commitment to
fiscal consolidation.7 In particular, they noted that the budget adhered to the 1 percent
ceiling on the growth in real expenditure as well as the 3 percent of GDP ceiling on the
deficit. The staff noted that a 3 percent of GDP deficit outturn in 2006 would be
expansionary relative to the estimated 1.9 percent deficit in 2005. The authorities observed
that the 2005 fiscal over-performance reflected a number of one-off factors that amounted to
expenditure reduction estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP.8 More generally, they noted the
importance of keeping the framework during a political transition. The staff agreed and
welcomed the broad parameters of the proposed 2006 budget and shared the authorities’
view that, once a new government is formed, a budget which adheres to the expenditure and
deficit ceilings should be approved without delay.
16.
Maintaining a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in the years ahead, however, implies
only a modest decline in public debt as a share of GDP, and the staff recommended
more ambitious consolidation. The staff argued that the 1 percent real expenditure growth
ceiling ought to be the binding constraint, and the authorities should allow any unanticipated

The budget that had been proposed to the cabinet was fully in line with the framework (Table 2).

increase in revenues to bring the fiscal deficit below the ceiling of 3 percent of GDP. The
authorities reiterated that the expenditure and deficit targets should be seen as ceilings, and
thus lower-than-targeted deficits are indeed possible. The debt sustainability analysis
illustrated in Figure 6 shows that, under the baseline scenario of 3 percent of GDP deficit
and 4 percent real GDP growth, the public debt to GDP ratio would fall only slightly, from
about 101 percent today to about 95 percent by 2010.9 Furthermore, the debt ratio is

maintain fiscal balance over the medium
term—in order to achieve a meaningful
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
17.
The staff, therefore, stressed that the authorities should resist taking additional
measures, such as the tax cut measures introduced in the middle of last year, that
would impede lowering the public debt to GDP ratio. The authorities argued that these
multiyear tax rate reductions need not hinder the pace of debt reduction, since stronger
growth is expected to compensate for any revenue shortfall resulting from the tax cuts. The
staff was unconvinced and noted that possible offsetting measures should be identified. As
regards 2006, the authorities indicated that currently there are no plans for any additional
tax reductions. Turning to the expenditure side, while there is broad agreement among the
authorities on the need for sustained fiscal consolidation, there is less agreement about the
best rule for the medium term. Some officials have the view that the real expenditure growth

Selected Issues paper – “Fiscal Policy in Israel: Trends and Prospects.”
10

This would be a shock scenario, whereby real GDP is assumed to grow at the baseline level minus
one-half standard deviation.
11

In this analysis, we assume that the subnational governments run a collective annual budget deficit
of 0.5 percent of GDP, which is in line with the authorities’ projections. The DSA also reflects the tax
cuts approved in 2005 to cover the period 2006−10.

target should be closer to Israel’s population growth rate, currently at about 1.7 percent. The
staff acknowledged the potential difficulties in meeting the 1 percent expenditure rule, but
stressed the importance of adhering to the original ceiling over the medium term, so as to
further cement policy credibility.
Box 2. Israel: Multi-Year Tax Plan
On July 25, 2005, the Knesset approved a multi-year tax plan covering the next five years. The plan expands
some of the measures introduced in the 2003 tax reform,1 and its stated goal is to stimulate private sector
growth. The key measures are:
•
•
•
•
•

Lowering the top marginal income tax rate, from 49 percent to 44 percent by 2010.
Cutting the corporate tax rate, from 34 percent to 25 percent by 2010.
Reducing the VAT rate from 17 percent to 16.5 percent.
Establishing a uniform 20 percent capital gains tax rate.
Widening the tax base and strengthening enforcement through a proposal for taxation of trusts.

The fiscal cost of the tax plan is estimated at NIS 11.2 billion (or 0.4 percent of GDP annually over the five-year
period). The authorities are very confident that the plan will be financed through the increase in tax receipts
stemming from stronger economic growth and the progressiveness of the tax brackets.

The introduction of a medium-term budget framework, with a detailed
expenditure breakdown consistent with the overall expenditure ceiling, is unlikely to be
implemented in the near-term. The staff noted that international experience has shown that
multi-year budget plans reinforce fiscal consolidation, minimize expenditure growth, and
strengthen adjustment. The staff pointed out that the government already has a medium-term
tax plan as well as a plan for capital expenditures over several years and that broadening this
approach to current expenditures would provide additional benefits by raising the
government’s credibility and lessening political pressures to deviate from the expenditure
ceiling. The authorities agreed, in principle, with multi-year budgeting, but were concerned
that it would reduce budget flexibility. The staff also stressed the importance of presenting

- 13 -

mid-year reports covering the execution of the budget and progress in achieving the rest of
the economic agenda.
B. Monetary Policy
19.
The policy rate has risen, in line with higher inflation, but remains
accommodative. Over the past two years, both the headline and core CPIs have increased,
although at a gradual pace, while inflation expectations have remained within the target
range. The rise in oil prices has yet to result in appreciably higher consumer prices, but the
authorities agreed that it will be important to monitor closely the degree of pass-through
from oil prices to wages and core inflation. There was also broad agreement that, in light of
the historically strong pass-through from the sheqel/dollar exchange rate to inflation,
exchange rate developments and their impact on prices should also be closely monitored.
The staff noted that other factors, such as high unemployment and excess capacity in the
construction sector, argued against aggressive tightening.
20.
The policy rate was agreed to be broadly appropriate, but below the long-run
neutral rate, and would need to be raised as the employment and output gaps close
(Box 3). At present, the staff’s view is that the neutral policy rate is around 5.25 percent and
the policy rate will have to rise over time as the excess capacity, currently estimated at
around 1 percent of GDP, is gradually eliminated. The authorities broadly shared this
assessment, but there was no agreement about the estimated value of the output gap. Indeed,
experience has shown in many countries that there is considerable uncertainty in such
estimates so it will be important to monitor measures of core inflation and inflation
expectations as well as other indicators of slack so that these estimates are updated in a
timely manner.
21.
Israel has a well-established inflation-targeting framework—and the fully
floating exchange rate that it requires—but there is scope for improving the analytical
framework used to formulate policy and to communicate with the public. In the past,
the BoI largely relied on measures of market-based inflation expectations to adjust the
policy rate, rather than developing a forecast based on the BoI’s own views about the
fundamentals driving the inflation process. It is widely recognized that over-reliance on
market expectations can give rise to an indeterminacy problem as market participants look
to the central bank to provide an anchor for inflation and inflation expectations. For this
reason, increased emphasis has recently been given to communicating the BoI’s views about
future inflation developments and how the BoI will likely respond to new information. The
development of a model-based framework will greatly facilitate the process of developing
baseline forecasts and risk assessments as well as communicating the logic of current and
possible future policy actions to the public. The development of a model-based framework
has recently become an important priority at the BoI.

- 14 -

22.
As part of a more general effort to improve surveillance of inflation targeting
countries, the staff developed a small model of the Israeli economy and received
feedback on its structure and properties from the authorities.12 This model was used to
organize monetary policy discussions with the authorities and to construct a baseline
forecasts and undertake risk assessments. The authorities welcomed this initiative, as well as
the discussions that took place concerning state-of-the-art modeling techniques and how
they are being used in other central banks that face similar sorts of challenges with short
data samples.13
Box 3. Israel: Inflation Targeting, Modeling, and Risk Assessment
The mission developed a small simulation model to construct baseline forecasts of key macroeconomic variables and undertake risk
assessments. The model is based on a conventional view of the transmission of monetary policy which focuses on the output gap as the major driving
force of underlying inflation, but allows for exchange rate pass-through to play a significant role in the shorter term. The model enforces consistency on
the largely judgmental baseline forecast and allows for risk assessment under uncertainty.
The baseline is predicated on the assumption of an output gap of 0.7 percent of
GDP in the first quarter of 2006 that closes by 2007. Under these circumstances,
the current policy rate of 4.75 percent is below the neutral rate of 5.25 percent and
will thus have to rise as the output gap closes. This, in turn, implies that headline
inflation will gradually fall to the mid-point of the target range–2 percent–by the
end of the year and remain there in 2007. As in all inflation targeting countries, it
will be important to monitor economic and financial developments and update the
baseline in response to new information.

There are three major sources of uncertainty underlying the baseline: the size
of the risk premium and thus the level of the neutral rate; the size of the
output gap; and the future price of oil. The tables below show how the baseline
forecast would be altered if the risk premium and thus the neutral rate were 50 basis points higher (table 2a), if the output gap were 1 percent larger
(table 2b), and if the price of oil were to be permanently 50 percent higher than in the baseline.

A proposed new Bank of Israel Law should strengthen the independence of the
central bank. After years of futile attempts, a proposed new Bank of Israel Law was finally
approved by the government in 2005. However parliamentary approval is still required and
is not expected until after the March elections. Key principles of the proposed new law
include the creation of a monetary committee responsible for interest rate decisions;14 the
formation of a management board responsible for oversight of administrative matters; and
the establishment of price stability as a primary policy objective. The staff agreed that other
policy goals, for example growth, should be considered only in so far as they do not
undermine the primacy of price stability.
C. Financial Sector Stability
24.
Israel has a large and highly concentrated banking system, with the five largest
banking groups accounting for 95 percent of system assets. Banking assets were
NIS 875 billion at end-September 2005 (1.7 times 2004 GDP). Against the background of
the ongoing economic recovery, the banking system has shown some positive signs: capital
ratios have increased and system profitability has recovered to pre-recession levels, though
remaining weak. Problem loans have remained elevated, however, particularly in the
construction and real estate sectors, which have not yet fully felt the impact of the recovery.
The authorities have taken some steps, such as increased bank provisioning, but further
action is needed to encourage banks to be more proactive in lowering problem loan levels,
including through the greater use of charge-offs and loan sales.
25.
The staff encouraged the authorities to refine their supervisory and regulatory
activities focusing more on key risks in the changing financial system. Additionally, the
staff noted that undertaking self assessments against key internationally recognized
regulatory standards would help the authorities address the new challenges more effectively.
The staff agreed with the decision by the BoI to gradually move towards the more
sophisticated risk-based approach within the framework of Basel II. However, the staff
cautioned that implementation of Basel II will require a significant resource commitment of
staff over a number of years and more extensive dialogue with industry. There is also scope
for the BoI to enhance its oversight of group-wide activities of Israeli banks, particularly
following actions taken by foreign regulators that have identified deficiencies in the AML
programs in foreign offices of Israeli banks. The BoI agreed with the staff that given the
significance of foreign currency funding of Israeli banks, this is an area where weak controls
in banks’ overseas operations pose an AML/CFT vulnerability and that greater coordination
with host supervisors should take place.

14

According to the current draft of the law, the monetary committee will be made up of equal number
of BoI members and outside public representatives. In the event of a tied vote, the Chairman (the
governor) will have the casting vote. The minutes of the monetary committee’s meetings would be
expected to be published after two weeks.

- 16 -

26.
The ongoing reforms in the capital markets have gone well to date.15 In
particular, forcing banks to divest themselves of mutual and provident funds has contributed
to increased competition and market efficiency, as sought by the authorities. The relatively
rapid changes in the capital markets have resulted in new participants selling new products
to investors under new rules, with financial advisors operating under a new regime.16 The
faster-than-expected sale of mutual and provident funds was welcomed, and was seen, in
part, as a by-product of the buoyant financial market environment in Israel during the
second half of 2005. 17 There is a particular risk, however, that arises because of the
radically changed risk profile of provident funds, as a result of a shift in their asset portfolio
away from “risk-free” government bonds to newer capital market instruments. The staff
stressed that investors may not be fully aware of the changed risk profile and thus need to be
properly advised and protected.
27.
The authorities recognize that these capital market developments pose risks,
and agreed that there is a need to strengthen supervision, regulation, and
enforcement.. The introduction of new laws and regulations designed to increase
competition in the financial services market and the development of new, proactive
approaches to enforcement are welcome. But more remains to be done. In many cases, the
legislation proposed by the authorities has yet to be enacted. And new regulations for nonbank financial institutions—and the budgets of their regulators—require prior approval of
the Knesset Finance Committee. Most importantly, the regulatory infrastructure, although
strengthened by recent legislation, needs further attention, particularly in the form of greater
independence and additional resources. In particular, the supervisors of insurance
companies, provident funds, pension funds and mutual funds require additional resources to
undertake the necessary research into the effect of the new developments, collect and
analyze the information received from regulated institutions, and conduct on-site
inspections.
15

For more details on the development and reforms of the capital market, see the accompanying
Selected Issues paper – “The Reform of the Capital Markets in Israel.”
16

The reduced number of non-tradable, guaranteed government bonds in the portfolios of institutions
has encouraged the use of a wider range of financial instruments in order to secure yield and manage
risks. The equalization of the tax treatment of overseas investments to match that for domestic
investments has widened the investment opportunities. Barriers to the promotion of foreign mutual
funds in Israel are being removed and the registration and approval requirements for new issues are
being simplified. The corporate bond market is growing rapidly and activity on the stock exchange
has increased. The development by the BoI of a real time gross settlement system, which will reduce
banks’ settlement risks, has prompted an interbank market and proposals for repos.

17

Some of the regulators and banks believe that the price received by the banks was substantially
higher (perhaps up to 50 percent higher) than might have been expected on the basis of the current fee
income received by the banks.

- 17 -

D. Poverty and Social Issues
28.
Despite the strong economic recovery, the incidence of poverty increased in 2005
due, in part, to cuts in social spending. Notwithstanding improvements in employment and
income, the poverty rate among families increased to 20.5 percent in 2005, while child
poverty rose to 34.1 percent.18 Moreover, the poverty gap and income inequality have
increased over the past five years. The poverty rate in Israel is also high when compared to
OECD countries. The rise in the scope of poverty can be partly attributed to the erosion of
welfare benefits, particularly those paid to the working-age population (child allowances,
unemployment benefits and income support).19 Poverty alleviation has now become a top
priority in the Israeli policy agenda, and the authorities are working on developing new
initiatives.

29.
Against this background, an advisory group headed by Director General of the
Ministry of Finance is examining policy options to reduce the poverty rate. In midDecember, the Primer Minister, Minister of Finance, and the Central Bank Governor
approved a seven year initiative to combat poverty with a total budget of about
NIS 14 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) to be spread over the seven years. The authorities are
considering a broad range of measures, including the introduction of a negative income tax
(NIT).20 The exact timetable and budget allocation for each measure are still under
discussion. In general, it was recognized that a NIT can be a useful mechanism in promoting
employment and/or ensuring adequate income for low income earners. However, its
effectiveness depends on a variety of factors, and the authorities had some concerns about
implementation given its potential high cost and difficulties in its administration. The staff
concurred and stressed that any poverty alleviation measures should be within the current
fiscal envelope, be targeted, provide the right incentives to work, and be consistent with
growth-promoting policies. The staff also noted the importance of an appropriate safety net
to protect children, the elderly, and the disabled, particularly given the recent cuts in welfare
benefits.
E. Other Issues
30.
The economic reform agenda for 2006 reiterates the government’s continued
dedication to structural reforms. The authorities highlighted the privatization of the second
largest bank, Bank Leumi, in 2005 as a key accomplishment fundamental to enhancing
competition in the financial sector. Looking ahead, in addition to completing the ongoing
efforts to streamline the public sector and increase competition in the electricity and water
distribution networks, the authorities intend to implement restructuring measures with the
objective to privatize the oil refineries. The staff supported the authorities’ reform efforts and
commended the achievements to-date. Streamlining the public sector and strengthening its
efficiency are crucial to fostering growth. However, the staff noted that, given the natural
monopoly nature of many of these sectors, care must be taken to ensure that a proper,
independent regulatory mechanism is in place.
31.
A recent Data ROSC mission concluded that Israel has a well-developed
macroeconomic statistical system, but some shortcomings may impede the accurate and
timely analysis of macroeconomic and financial developments.21 Foremost among these
are deficiencies in the timeliness, methodology, and classification of monetary statistics.
There is also room to enhance source data for national accounts, producer prices, and
government finance statistics. In this regard, the staff noted the need, especially at the

timeliness of data compiled under its mandate.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The Israeli economy is strong and the outlook favorable, but challenges—
primarily reducing the public debt stock, strengthening financial supervision, and
alleviating poverty—lie ahead. Growth has largely been driven by high technology exports
and private consumption and has been supported by prudent policies, a favorable global
environment, and an improvement in the security situation. Inflation remains in check, while
unemployment continues to fall. The sheqel has been relatively stable over the past year,
and the level of the REER reflects underlying economic fundamentals. Development of the
capital market has accelerated bringing with it new challenges to the supervisory and
regulatory agencies. Banking system indicators have strengthened, but credit risks remain
high. While the macroeconomic outlook is positive, there is further scope to enhance growth
and reduce vulnerabilities, especially to external shocks.
33.
Fiscal consolidation and an appropriately accommodative monetary policy have
underpinned this strong performance. Limiting the growth of public expenditures to one
percent a year is a strategy that has served Israel well and should be continued. Fiscal
retrenchment is crucial in putting debt on a firm downward path and thereby reducing
vulnerabilities and allowing future spending to be directed at priority items. Given the
renewed emphasis on fiscal consolidation, and with inflation within the Bank of Israel’s
(BoI) target range, monetary policy has been appropriate. Developing a detailed mediumterm budget plan would also enhance credibility and ensure that future budgets are allocated
according to long-term priorities. The presentation of mid-year reports covering the
execution of the budget and progress in achieving it would strengthen transparency and
budget planning.
34.
The authorities should seize the opportunity provided by the strong fiscal
outturns in 2005 and strong growth to sustainably reduce the deficit to well below the
3 percent of GDP ceiling and thereby achieve a meaningful decline in the large stock of
outstanding public debt. It is important that, once a new government is formed, the 2006
budget should maintain the expenditure and deficit ceilings and additional tax cut be
avoided. Failure to do so would increase uncertainty in the market, lead to a loss of
confidence, and increase the country’s risk premium. The authorities have made important
progress in keeping expenditure under control and strict adherence to the current
expenditure ceiling in future budgets will cement the credibility of fiscal policy. As shown
in the debt sustainability exercise, this approach would lead to a reduction in the public
debt-to-income level of about 20 percent over the next 5 years when compared to a strategy
of holding the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP. More ambitious fiscal consolidation would
underpin lower interest rates, greater private investment, lower future taxes, and stronger
medium-term growth.

- 20 -

35.
Inflation targeting, and the associated floating exchange rate regime, have
served Israel well, but there is scope for enhancing the analytical framework used to
formulate policy and communicate it to the public. In particular, the increased emphasis
on the development of macroeconomic models at the BoI is welcome. Once this work is
completed, practices at the BoI will be among the best of inflation targeting countries. The
development of these models is central to implementing a forward-looking approach to
monetary policy and will serve to enhance policy deliberations and the communication of
policy actions in speeches, press releases, and the Inflation Report.
36.
The proposed new Bank of Israel law will strengthen the independence of the
central bank. Updating the current Bank of Israel Law to reflect international best practices
will help reinforce central bank independence, enhance transparency and accountability, and
aid in achieving price stability. The proposed creation of a Monetary Committee responsible
for interest rate decisions and the formation of a Management Board to oversee the
administration of the central bank should aid in meeting these objectives. Adoption of the
Law by the Knesset is overdue.
37.
The banking system has strengthened but the level of problem loans remains
high, notwithstanding the improving indicators, such as profitability and capital
adequacy. The measures taken by the supervisor to reduce the banks’ exposure to credit
risk, including by increasing required provisions, are thus welcome. Nevertheless, continued
supervisory vigilance of the systemically important financial institutions is essential to
maintain financial stability. In light of the recent developments in the capital market, the
authorities could benefit from undertaking self assessments against the key internationally
recognized regulatory standards. The staff cautioned that actual implementation of Basel II
will require a significant resource commitment. There is also scope for the BoI to enhance
its oversight by cooperating and coordinating with its foreign counterparts, especially in the
area of anti-money laundering. The authorities should undertake a self assessment against
the revised Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations using the assessment
methodology.
38.
Efforts to alleviate poverty are welcome. Notwithstanding improvements in
employment and income, the poverty rate among children and families increased last year,
and both poverty and income inequality have increased over the past five years. From this
perspective, the work of the advisory group headed by director general of the ministry of
finance on measures to reduce the poverty rate is welcome. In broad terms, any such
measures should be within the current fiscal envelope, be targeted, provide the right
incentives to work, and be consistent with growth-promoting policies. The cuts in some
welfare benefits have contributed to social hardship, and it is therefore important to ensure
that there is a safety net to protect children, the elderly, and the disabled.

- 21 -

39.
Israel has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards and its
macroeconomic statistical system is generally adequate for Fund surveillance.
Nonetheless, there are some shortcomings that may impede the accurate and timely analysis
of macroeconomic and financial developments, which need to be addressed.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

IX.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of June 9, 2005 Israel’s exchange rate regime is officially classified as floating.
This step by the Government of Israel was taken to remove the last vestige of a policy
in which the exchange rate of the NIS fluctuated within the limits of a crawling band.
In practice, however, the NIS has been floating since 1997, when the Bank of Israel
stopped intervening to protect the band.

X.

Article IV consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on April 18, 2005. Israel is on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

XI.

ROSCs:
o Financial System Stability Assessment was conducted in 2000, issued in August
2001.
o Fiscal Transparency ROSC was conducted in 2003, issued in March 2004.
o AML/CFT ROSC was conducted in 2003, issued in June 2005.
o Data Module ROSC conducted in 2005, expected issuance in March 2006.

XII.

Technical Assistance:
For purposes of Fund relations, the West Bank and Gaza are under Israeli authority
within the terms of Article XXXI, Section 2(g) of the Articles of Agreement.
The IMF has provided technical assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the
WBG, with a focus on assisting the PA in establishing economic and financial
institutions, and in monitoring and reporting on fiscal developments and institution
building. In particular, technical assistance has been provided in the areas of tax and
customs administration, and expenditure management (Fiscal Affairs Department); in
the areas of bank supervision and restructuring, payments systems, and central bank
organization (Monetary and Financial Systems Department (MFD)); financial sector
legislation (MFD together with Legal Department); and in the areas of national
accounts and monetary statistics (Statistics Department).

XIII.

Resident Representative:
A resident representative has been in the WBG since early 1996.

APPENDIX II

ISRAEL: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Israel is a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. The periodicity, timeliness,
and coverage of economic data are generally adequate for surveillance. The methodology
underlying the reported overall annual fiscal balance is not in conformity with internationally
accepted practice as interest costs exclude the inflation component of such payments. The
authorities are gradually moving toward the methodology that is standard in other countries.
Data submitted for the 2004 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook now present cash and
accrual data for revenue and expense, following the GFSM 2001 format. However, no data
on transactions and stocks of financial assets and liabilities were submitted. Within-year
monthly reports on central government operations cover only the main aggregates of
budgetary accounts, without a breakdown by composition.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 22, 2006
1.
This statement contains information on recent economic developments in Israel that
has become available since the circulation of the staff report for the Article IV consultation.
The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) released the 2005 national accounts on March
15th. Real GDP grew by 5.2 percent, the same as the estimate provided in the staff report.
However, the composition of growth changed somewhat, as seen in the table below:

3.
The Bank of Israel (BoI) kept its policy rate unchanged at 4.75 percent for the month
of March. The BoI in its press statement said that while “interest rates in both the United
States and Europe are likely to rise in March, the Bank of Israel does not believe that an
increase in the interest-rate gap with the United States is needed at the present juncture to
keep inflation within the target range.” The BoI views the interest rate gap as “an important
determinant of the likely behavior of the exchange rate and consequent inflationary
pressures, but does not believe that there is a unique level of the gap that is needed to
maintain inflation within the target range set by the government.” Nonetheless, the BoI noted
that expectations of increased interest rates around the world and the continued narrowing of
Israel’s output gap “increase the probability that interest rates in Israel will rise somewhat
during the remainder of the year.”
4.
The latest reading of the consumer price index (CPI) showed that inflationary
pressures are increasing somewhat, with the February CPI registering a monthly rise of
0.6 percent (3.1 percent yoy), with about half of the increase attributed to energy related
items. The February figure followed three consecutive monthly declines in the CPI of
0.3 percent, 0.2 percent, and 0.1 percent in November 2005−January 2006, respectively. The
staff’s view is that additional data points are needed in order to establish the extent to which
the latest reading reflects a sustained increase in inflationary pressures. Based on currently
available information, the staff’s baseline forecast points to a moderate overshooting of the
inflation target band—on a year-over-year basis—during the first half of 2006, before
inflation returns to within the band in the third quarter of this year.

-2-

5.
The unemployment rate fell 0.1 percent in the last quarter of 2005, reaching
8.8 percent. According to the CBS, and based on preliminary trend data, the unemployment
rate declined to 8.7 percent in the month of January. This is consistent with the staff’s
projection for the 2006 average unemployment rate of 8.5 percent.
6.
The CBS also released the 2005 balance of payments data, with the current account
registering a surplus of US$2.4 billion (1.9 percent of GDP), up from US$1.8 billion
(1.5 percent of GDP) in 2004.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On March 22, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Israel.1
Background
Following a strong performance in 2004, the economic expansion accelerated in 2005, supported
by a relatively favorable global economic environment, an improvement in the security situation,
and prudent policies. Real GDP grew at an estimated 5.2 percent in 2005. Inflation is slightly higher
than a year ago, but remains in check. The unemployment rate continues to fall, but remains high.
The exchange rate has been broadly stable over the past year, balanced by robust economic
activity on the one hand and relatively low interest rates on the other.
The macroeconomic policies and structural reforms of recent years have opened up the economy,
increased its competitiveness, and attracted foreign investment. Looking ahead, a key challenge is
to sustain the ongoing fiscal retrenchment and thereby reduce the large stock of public debt
relative to GDP.

Greater confidence in the macroeconomic outlook has been helped by the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation efforts, which are critical to putting public debt—about 100 percent of GDP—on a
firm downward path. The government is establishing a credible commitment to maintain future
deficits below 3 percent of GDP and to limit government expenditure growth, in real terms, to
no more than 1 percent a year.
Given the renewed emphasis on fiscal consolidation, and inflation within the Bank of Israel’s
target range of 1–3 percent, monetary policy has been appropriately accommodative,

The authorities have continued to implement structural reform policies aimed at boosting
competition and efficiency. These included privatization in key sectors and a major reform of
the capital market, which has gone well to date. A rapidly changing financial system, however,
requires greater scrutiny, and the authorities are committed to refining their supervisory and
regulatory activities accordingly.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued improvement in the Israeli economy: export
performance and economic growth are strong, the unemployment rate is falling, inflation
expectations remain in check, and the exchange rate is broadly stable. A favorable external
economic environment and an improved security situation have been important factors,
but sound policies have remained instrumental to this outcome. Notably, fiscal consolidation
and an appropriately accommodative monetary policy have underpinned the strong economic
performance. Directors noted that, while the macroeconomic outlook is positive, there is further
scope to enhance growth and reduce vulnerabilities, especially to external shocks.
They stressed the need for the policy agenda to remain focused on strengthening the fiscal
position, reducing the high level of public debt, and ensuring financial sector stability in a
context of relatively high credit risk and rapid capital market development.
Directors welcomed the improved fiscal performance, and noted that limiting the growth of real
public expenditures to one percent a year is a strategy that has served Israel well and should
be continued. Directors encouraged the authorities to seize the opportunity provided by strong
growth and a favorable fiscal outturn in 2005 to reduce the deficit to well below the 3 percent of
GDP ceiling and thereby achieve a meaningful decline in the large stock of outstanding public
debt. Such a fiscal consolidation would underpin lower real interest rates and lead to greater
private investment, lower future taxes, and stronger medium-term growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to make the implementation of the multi-year tax
reduction plan approved in 2005 conditional on a continuation of the downward-moving debtto-GDP ratio. Most Directors emphasized the importance of accelerating debt reduction by
abstaining from further unplanned tax cuts. Accordingly, automatic stabilizers ought to be
allowed to operate fully should revenues over-perform. To sustain the fiscal consolidation
efforts, Directors also urged the authorities to adopt a multi-year budgetary framework and a
detailed spending plan to enhance credibility and to help ensure that future budgets better
reflect long-term priorities. A few Directors also called for a review of the fiscal rules to ensure
that additional consolidation is achieved in good years.
Directors commended the Bank of Israel for its success in maintaining low inflation. With
inflation expected to revert by the end of the year to the middle of the Bank of Israel target
range, they felt the current policy rate is appropriate. Directors cautioned, nonetheless, that the
Bank of Israel needs to closely monitor the pass-through from oil prices and exchange rate
movements, and that rates may need to rise over time as the output gap closes and demand
pressures mount.

Directors observed that Israel’s strategy of inflation targeting—and the associated floating
exchange rate regime—have served the country well, but noted that there is scope for further
enhancing the analytical framework used to formulate policy and communicate it to the public.
In particular, Directors welcomed the increased emphasis on the development of new
macroeconomic models at the Bank of Israel as a central element of a forward-looking
approach to monetary policy. Directors urged the passage of an updated Bank of Israel law to
help reinforce central bank independence, enhance transparency and accountability, and aid
in achieving price stability.
Directors noted that while the banking system has strengthened—as reflected in the
improvement in key indicators—the level of problem loans remains high and the rapid
development of the capital market has introduced new challenges to the supervisory and
regulatory agencies. While welcoming the measures already taken to reduce the banks’
exposure to credit risk and to increase banks’ provisioning, Directors stressed that continued
supervisory vigilance of the systemically important financial institutions will be essential to
maintain financial stability. The need to pay close attention to the division of supervisory
responsibilities to prevent regulatory arbitrage was also emphasized.
Directors saw scope for the supervisory authorities to enhance their oversight by cooperating
and coordinating with their foreign counterparts, especially in the area of anti-money
laundering. To that end, Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a review of their
practices given the revised Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations.
Directors took note of the progress made in structural reforms, including measures to enhance
public sector efficiency. Directors also welcomed the efforts to alleviate poverty, such as the
work of the advisory group headed by the director general of the ministry of finance.
They emphasized, however, that any measures should be accommodated within the current
fiscal envelope and that they should be well-targeted to ensure adequate incentives to work
and consistency with growth-promoting policies. Directors also stressed that cuts in some
welfare benefits have contributed to social hardship, and that it is therefore important to ensure
that there is a safety net to protect children, the elderly, and the disabled.
Directors observed that Israel meets the Special Data Dissemination Standards and its
macroeconomic statistical system is generally adequate for Fund surveillance.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Israel
and Nir Klein, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 22, 2006
General remarks
On behalf of the Israeli authorities we thank the staff for an insightful set of papers,
which provide a fair and balanced description of the consultation discussions and economic
developments in Israel.
Following three years of a deep recession, in 2001-03, economic growth has since
picked up, and the Israeli economy now shows a strong and consistent recovery. A relatively
benign global economic environment and improvement in the security situation, together
with a continued policy mix of fiscal tightening alongside accommodative monetary policy in
2005, provided favorable conditions for business sector activity. Fiscal policy was geared
towards further consolidation with a lower tax burden and a substantial reduction in the
relative size of the public sector. These policy measures together with considerable progress
in implementing structural reforms, including much privatization, enabled the government to
reduce its budget deficit and to renew progress in reducing the size of the public debt as a
percentage of GDP. Monetary policy remained expansionary, yet in keeping with the
authorities' determination to meet inflation targets. In this respect, recent inflationary
pressures brought about a policy of interest rate increases. In light of recent policies, and in
view of recent macroeconomic outcomes, the authorities have succeeded in enhancing
credibility and boosting confidence of market players.
The authorities are committed to pursuing prudent policies to support strong and
sustainable economic growth alongside price and financial stability. In view of the challenges
ahead, the authorities are determined to make every effort to reduce economic vulnerability
by promoting development that increases the economy’s competitiveness and flexibility. As
output is still below its potential, the authorities concurred with the staff’s projection that
strong economic growth will continue in the medium term, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
GDP
Following GDP growth of 4.4 percent in 2004, economic activity further picked up in
2005, recording a remarkable growth of 5.2 percent. Economic expansion continued to
reflect the rapid expansion of the business sector, while the public sector continued to decline
(as a percentage of GDP). The robust growth was led by a confluence of external and internal
favorable conditions, particularly the continued global growth and the improvement in the
security situation, and was supported by prudent fiscal policy and an accommodative
monetary stance. These policies helped restore market participants’ confidence and raise
domestic demand. In 2005, private consumption increased by 3.9 percent and together with
export growth, particularly in the high-tech sector, continued to be a major force of economic
expansion. Investment in fixed capital grew by 2.4 percent after several years of continuous
decline.

-2The external position continued to be positive. While export growth remained
relatively strong at 5.6 percent––albeit slower than the remarkable increase in the previous
year––imports recorded a more moderate growth of 4 percent. As a result, the 2005 current
account balance ended with a surplus, for the third consecutive year after a decade of
continuous deficits. The capital and financial accounts demonstrated great vigor in 2005.
Notwithstanding the record-high level of foreign direct and portfolio investments, net capital
exports increased in 2005 to 4.5 billion US dollars, a reflection of the removal of several
restrictions on institutional investors’ investments abroad as well as the reduction of the tax
rate differential on investments in Israel and abroad.
The fact that output level was still below its potential enabled a relatively quick
response in supply with only a mild commensurate price increase. Higher oil prices
continued to have an adverse effect on the supply side, though this was limited as the share of
industry with heavy oil consumption in total production is relatively low. As part of the
supply-side response, the labor market absorbed 93,000 new employees in 2005––a
3.9 percent increase––mainly in the trade and services sectors. The unemployment rate
declined from 9.7 percent at the end of 2004 to 8.8 percent in the last quarter of 2005, while
the labor participation rate increased.
Fiscal issues
In 2005, the authorities continued with ongoing efforts to downsize the public sector
and further enhance the fiscal position. To promote transparency and credibility, fiscal policy
was placed within a medium-term framework––for the years 2005-2010––anchored in 2004
legislation, and stipulating a budget deficit ceiling of 3 percent of GDP and real growth in
public expenditure of no more than 1 percent a year. The budget deficit ceiling for 2005 was
temporarily increased by 0.4 percent of GDP to allow for one-time spending related to the
disengagement, but the contingency was unnecessary, as the 2005 budget balance recorded
the lowest deficit in the past five years, amounting to only 1.9 percent of GDP compared to
3.9 percent in the previous year. This significant improvement in the fiscal balance can
mainly be attributed to lower-than-budgeted government spending while revenues were
broadly in line with earlier projections, despite the tax cuts that were introduced in the middle
of the year. This is the third consecutive year that such underspending has taken place.
The low budget deficit and considerable revenues from privatization, together with
rapid economic growth led to a sharp reduction in 2005 in the general government debt ratio–
–contracting by 3.8 percent of GDP to 102 percent of GDP––following a moderate decline in
the previous year. The high level of public debt underlines the need for further reduction. The
authorities reiterate their commitment to continue with a firm fiscal retrenchment, noting that
the budget deficit rule of not exceeding 3 percent of GDP should be regarded as a ceiling and
not a target. The proposed 2006 budget, which was approved by the government, adheres to
the budget deficit and expenditure's real growth restrictions, with the aim of continuing to
reduce the debt to GDP ratio.
Given currently high tax rates, the authorities intend to continue with implementing
an agreed multi-year tax reduction plan. However, the implementation of tax reform is

-3conditional on a continuation of the downward-moving debt-to-GDP ratio, meaning that it
could be postponed in the event of a sharp or unforeseen decline in revenues.
Monetary issues
The staff views the current monetary stance as accommodative and appropriate. In
2005, Israel continued to benefit from favorable external macroeconomic conditions, such as
the relatively low foreign interest rates, a decline in emerging markets’ risk premium and a
surge in capital inflows. These conditions, which supported foreign currency market stability
despite the narrowing interest rate differentials, enabled the Bank of Israel (BoI) to reduce
the policy rate to its historically lowest level––of 3.5 percent––and maintain this low rate for
a consecutive eight months (February-September). Starting in October 2005, given the rise in
global interest rates and the NIS depreciation against the US dollar, together with the rapid
economic growth, the BoI gradually raised its interest rate cumulatively by 1.25 percentage
points to 4.75 percent.
During 2005, the CPI rose by 2.4 percent, slightly more than during the previous year,
yet still within the target range of price stability (1-3 percent). The increased inflationary
pressures can be mainly attributed to the global increase in energy prices, the rapid growth in
economic activity, which led to further contraction in the excess capacity of production, and
to the depreciation of the NIS against the US dollar, particularly in the second half of the year
as interest rate differentials narrowed. The CPI excluding housing, fruit and vegetables––a
usual measure for core CPI1––rose during 2005 by 1.8 percent, 0.3 percentage points less
than during the previous year. Continued price adjustments alongside the continued
narrowing of Israel’s excess production capacity are also expected to exert upward pressure
on prices in 2006. The BoI also noted that several factors, such as changes in foreign interest
rates and the interest rate gap between the US and Israel, the geo-political uncertainty,
possible reversal in capital flows to emerging markets, exchange rate developments, and the
rapid economic growth, continue to pose upside inflation risks. The Bank of Israel will
continue to closely monitor economic developments, with the intention of achieving the
government's price-stability target.
Within the framework of inflation targeting, the authorities use several forwardlooking market indicators to formulate monetary policy. Efforts are being made to further
improve existing macroeconomic statistical models in order to better understand the
macroeconomic structure as well as the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In this
regard, the authorities appreciate the recent cooperation between the BoI and the Fund’s
staff, which has helped to enhance their analytical capacity.
Financial and banking sector
In 2005, significant progress was made in reducing the dominance of the banks in the
financial markets as legislation forcing the divestiture of the banks’ holdings in mutual and
provident funds was enacted and implemented. Within three months after the legislation, a
significant part of the banks’ mutual and provident funds had been sold to domestic insurance
companies or foreign investors. Despite these welcome developments, the new market

-4configuration, which reflects a significant change in the financial and banking systems,
demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be reduced. In this regard, the authorities
acknowledge the staff’s recommendations as described in the selected issues paper (Chapter
IV, paragraphs 37-43).
The authorities express considerable satisfaction at their succeeding in raising the
banking system's capital ratio from 9.5 percent in 2000 to 11.5 percent in 2005 (during and
despite the recent economic recession), although they are aware that the system has relatively
low capital levels compared to its international peers. The banks' recent higher earnings,
which reflected favorable macroeconomic conditions, as well as one-time revenues from
their divesture of mutual and provident funds, clearly provide an opportunity to further
improve these rates.2 The authorities have taken several measures to reduce the risks of
problem loans, including pursuing extensive series of on-site inspections and further
enhancing the banks’ internal procedures for detecting, classifying and provisioning of
problem loans. The authorities are quite confident that despite the considerable level of
problem loans, there are no immediate risks to financial stability. In this regard, a recent
stress testing performed on the problem loan portfolio showed endurance of the banking
system despite heavy losses under extreme scenarios.
AML/CFT
In 2005, the AML/CFT regime was further strengthened as the "Prohibition of
Financing Terrorism" was enacted and the Banking Supervision Directive was modified
appropriately. The main modifications include the implementation of guidelines for customer
identification to combat the financing of terrorism and for treating the risks embedded in
check deposits. In addition, the criteria of countries bearing high risk have been elaborated
and a list of countries that require heightened scrutiny of money transfers has been furnished.
Action is also being taken to encompass credit card companies in the Directive on combating
the financing of terrorism. The authorities share the staff's view that more needs to be done to
ensure appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements for AML/CFT,
particularly in the foreign offices of Israeli banks. Therefore, the Banking Supervision
department recently undertook some measures to strengthen those foreign offices'
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements of the host country as well as with
internal procedures and regulations of a banking group.
Structural reforms and poverty reduction
The authorities are continuing with their reform agenda to boost competition and
efficiency in the markets. In the banking sector, following the privatization of Israel Discount
Bank, the third largest bank in Israel, the authorities completed in 2005 the privatization of
one of the country's two largest banks and the last publicly-owned bank, Bank Leumi, to
international institutional investors. In addition, an agreement was signed between the

The divesture of mutual and provident funds, although eliminating a potential source of income,
may lead to higher revenues in the future, as banks are now allowed to widen their fee base by
offering advisory and brokerage services in pension funds, an area in which banks were previously
forbidden to operate.

with an intention to privatize them in the future. The split of the Ports Authority into three
separate companies is expected to enhance competition, raise productivity and significantly
reduce labor costs. Furthermore, the authorities took measures to improve transportation
infrastructure standards by transforming the public works department, Maatz, a unit of the
Transportation Ministry, into a state-owned company. Ongoing efforts are also being made to
privatize the Israel Military Industries (Taas) and the Oil Refineries company (Bazan).
Following extensive cuts in welfare payments in recent years, which led to a
significant rise in measured poverty,3 there seems to be a consensus among political parties
on the need for implementing––after the elections––policies targeted at reducing poverty,
particularly among working, low-income families. In this regard, the government will
consider adopting various policy measures that provide incentives for low wage individuals
to participate in the labor market, and thus to allow their families to rely on a productive
income source. Such considered measures include the “Earned Income Tax Credit” (EITC)
plan, a subsidy to low wage working families.

Poverty in Israel is based on a relative measure and not on an absolute one.
