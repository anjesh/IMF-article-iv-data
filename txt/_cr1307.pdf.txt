STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 16, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Albania has successfully avoided a serious economic slowdown since the
outbreak of the global crisis four years ago. But now, policy buffers are absent, and
macroeconomic imbalances persist. With the ongoing eurozone problems, the
economy has slowed, and the financial sector is exposed to domestic and external risks.
Fiscal Policy: Arresting the upward trend in public debt in the near term to anchor
market expectations, and undertaking sustained but gradual fiscal consolidation over
the medium term would strike an appropriate balance between signaling the
government’s commitment to debt sustainability, and limiting the adverse impact of
fiscal consolidation on the weak economy. Adjustment could entail modest increases in
tax rates, as well as trimming current spending. Improving the debt trajectory would
also mitigate fiscal financing risks emanating from high rollover needs.
Financial Sector: Containing spillovers from the eurozone crisis and minimizing
negative feedback from a slowing economy will require close banking supervision and
continued close cooperation with foreign regulatory authorities. The problem of rapidly
rising nonperforming loans should be addressed by clearing unpaid government bills
and improving collateral execution. Work on deepening public debt markets and
lengthening maturity should continue.
Structural Reform: Strengthening property rights, improving contract enforcement,
and simplifying the tax system would encourage investment and medium-term growth.

CONTEXT: UNFINISHED REBALANCING AND
REFORMS
1.
After successfully avoiding a serious decline in growth and financial instability since
2009, the economy is weakening and macroeconomic imbalances are elevated. Albania has
largely avoided a sharp fall in output since the crisis broke, kept inflation low and stable, and
maintained banking system stability, thanks to a fiscal stimulus, sound monetary policy and effective
macroprudential actions. But today, policy buffers are exhausted, macroeconomic imbalances
persist, and with the ongoing eurozone problems, the economy has slowed. The financial sector is
exposed to domestic and external risks, and incomplete investment climate reforms constrain
medium term growth.
2.
Implementation of earlier Article IV consultation recommendations has been mixed.
The authorities have strengthened financial sector supervision, crisis preparedness, and bank
resolution frameworks in line with 2011 Article IV consultation recommendations, but have made
limited headway toward sustained fiscal consolidation.
3.
The possibility of EU accession is an anchor for consensus on reforms, but the
upcoming election season could polarize positions. In October 2012, the European Commission
recommended that Albania could be granted EU candidate status, subject to completion of key
measures in the areas of judicial and public administration reform and revision of the parliamentary
rules and procedures.1 While there appears to be wide support for moving toward EU membership,
bipartisan consensus on reforms is unlikely in the run up to parliamentary elections in June 2013.

A TOLL
A. The Economy: Weakening Amidst Elevated Imbalances
4.
Albania has so far managed the headwinds from the global crisis reasonably well. The
growth shock was less severe than elsewhere in Europe, thanks in part to the use, albeit modest, of
the public sector balance sheet, which partially offset weak private demand. Monetary
accommodation also helped mitigate the impact on domestic demand. Other factors, notably
exports of hydroelectricity in 2010 and crude oil in 2011—driven by good rains and coming on
stream of oil production, respectively—also helped. The financial system has proved broadly
resilient, notwithstanding the preponderance of foreign banks, thanks largely to strong
macroprudential regulations.

5.
The eurozone crisis is weighing down on the economy. Output grew by 1.0 percent
during 2012:H1 (in part because of severe winter weather), compared to 2.7 percent in the same
period in 2011, and could slow further, in line with other countries in the region. Core inflation has
also been on a declining trend. Credit growth fell sharply between January and August, as consumer
and investor confidence weakened with the worsening outlook in eurozone neighbors. As a result,
the economy is expected to operate below potential (about 2.6 percent growth) in 2012. While the
current account deficit has begun to adjust on account of weakening imports (Figure 1), the narrow
export base and sluggish external demand limit the extent of the correction. Heavy exposure of
exports and remittances to Italy and Greece carries near-term risks (Box 1).

B. Public Finances: In Need of Adjustment
6.
There are no fiscal buffers to stimulate the economy. At nearly 60 percent of GDP, the
debt-GDP ratio today has reached the statutory ceiling and is among the highest in the region. As a
result, new debt-financed fiscal stimulus would be counterproductive.


Tax revenues continue their downward
trend. Since 2008, revenues have fallen
steadily, by about 1.5 percentage points of
GDP, and budgetary projections have
repeatedly proven optimistic. The
economic slowdown has affected tax
revenues, but tax reform, motivated by the
need to enhance competitiveness—such
as the introduction of a flat personal
income tax and a low corporate income
tax in 2007–08—has also limited the scope
for additional revenues.

Box 1. Spillovers from the Eurozone Crisis
Albania’s close export, banking and migration links with the eurozone make it vulnerable. So far the direct effects of
export and banking shocks from the eurozone have largely been contained or dealt with, but the worsening outlook in
Europe and declining remittances have affected confidence and demand, and possibly added to joblessness.
Despite Albania’s strong export links with the crisis-affected countries, to date direct trade spillovers have
not been as severe as would be expected. Near 80 percent of Albania’s exports go to the EU, with Italy alone
accounting for about 60 percent. Weakening demand in the eurozone, particularly in Italy, is expected to affect
Albania’s exports. However, direct trade related spillovers have been rather modest so far. While Albania’s traditional
exports (e.g., textiles and clothing), which typically have high employment content, have fallen since 2008, there has
been a reorientation to new products (e.g., oil and minerals exports) and markets (e.g., China and Turkey). As a result,
aggregate exports have not declined. The relatively low share of exports in Albania’s GDP also means that direct
trade related spillovers in future could have a muted impact on growth.

Banking spillovers are also broadly contained, despite the preponderance of European banks. The banking
crisis in Greece has impacted Greek subsidiaries (Greek banks account for one-fifth of Albania’s banking system),
though the effects have been mitigated. Even though Greek

Migration links with Greece and Italy have affected Albania;
indirect confidence effects have been strong. Remittances
from Greece and Italy comprise more than two thirds of all
remittances. While the crisis has adversely impacted
remittances, which have been falling since 2008, the magnitude
of the impact may be masked by the repatriation of returning
emigrants’ savings. Nevertheless, the loss of permanent
remittance income has affected domestic consumption, while
return migration, particularly from Greece, could have added to
joblessness. An important spillover has been indirect—a
worsening economic outlook in Greece and Italy has dampened
consumer and investor confidence in Albania.

Fiscal Financing Needs, June-December, 2012
(Percent of GDP)

Source: IMF staff estimations and projections.
1/ For Czech Rep., Estonia, Latvia, Turkey, and Ukraine, there is no breakdown available. Full
year figures for Bosnia, Estonia, and Turkey.

Most of the expenditure cuts have been unplanned, and focused on capital. With revenue tending
to disappoint by midyear, the authorities, in an attempt to restrict fiscal deficits ex post, have
been curtailing capital spending, as scope for cuts to discretionary spending has been limited. In
2012, the government has also accumulated liabilities in the form of unpaid bills to contractors
(about 1–2 percent of GDP).

7.
Fiscal financing risks are elevated. Albania’s fiscal financing needs are the highest in the
region, and with short-term debt representing more than half of public debt, the government faces
significant rollover risks. About 70 percent of public debt is held by commercial banks, some of
whom have recently been under pressure to shed exposure to public securities (Appendix II),
although with ample bank liquidity and limited credit demand, rollover risk has moderated
somewhat recently.

C. Banking System: Stability Amidst Continued Risks
8.
The banking system has been resilient so far, but domestic and external spillover risks
are concerns (Figure 4). Unlike many regional countries, Albania did not experience a big boombust credit cycle, in large part because of prudent limits on external borrowing prior to the crisis.
Banks today exhibit high liquidity and solvency ratios (Table 5), supported by continued stringent
liquidity and capital requirements. Nonetheless, NPLs have risen sharply over the last two years and
now exceed one fifth of all outstanding loans, the highest ratio in SEE (80 percent of NPLs are in the
corporate sector—largely in trade, construction and manufacturing). Further, a large pool of “watch
loans”—representing the leading edge of possible new NPLs—could add another 5–10 percentage
points down the road. Provisioning has been adequate, but bank profitability has suffered, and
some banks are shrinking their loan portfolios to meet capital requirements.
9.
Exposure to Greece is a near-term risk. Greek bank subsidiaries have made considerable
progress in re-aligning lending with their domestic deposit base and increasing capital (Box 1).
However, economic distress in Greece could adversely affect parents’ ability to inject new capital in
their Albanian subsidiaries, if needed. To address possible risks, the Bank of Albania (BoA) has
applied more stringent capital and liquidity requirements on Greek banks, and heightened
coordination with Greek authorities.

D. Monetary Policy: An Anchor of Stability
10.
Albania’s success at maintaining low inflation has been vital in buttressing
macroeconomic stability. The inflation targeting regime has been highly effective in overcoming
various shocks and keeping inflation low and stable. Not surprisingly, despite a global food and
commodity price-related uptick in inflation recently, expectations remain well anchored within the
BoA’s 3±1 percent annual target range. With the economy showing signs of weakness, the BoA has
lowered its policy rate (1-week reverse repo

Bank’s Doing Business indicator, a
deterioration of 8 places over the past three
years (Figure 5). Continued weaknesses in the legal framework (e.g., property rights and contract
enforcement), along with known difficulties in obtaining construction permits, paying taxes, and
accessing electricity affect Albania’s investment climate. Moreover, perceptions of corruption and
weak governance affect the view of Albania as an investment destination. Arbitrariness of tax
collection undermines the attractiveness of Albania’s low tax rates for businesses.

12.
Energy security has deteriorated recently, and poses fiscal risks. With hydropower
accounting for 95 percent of electricity production, Albania’s energy security hinges on adequate
rainfall, and output is often inadequate to meet domestic demand. A brewing dispute between the
privatized distributor and the public power generation company over cross claims, the inadequacy
of the former’s infrastructure investments and a lack of tariff adjustment by the regulator also
threaten electricity supply.2 These problems pose fiscal and growth risks—the government has thus
far committed about 0.7 percent of GDP in 2012 in loans and guarantees for energy imports.

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
13.
Staff expects weak confidence to affect growth over the near term. Staff expects growth
to decline to about 0.5 percent in 2012, from 3 percent in 2011, as weakness in Albania’s external
partners exacerbates sluggish domestic demand. Staff’s projection for Albania is broadly consistent
with those in other neighboring countries. Inflation would remain within the central bank’s
3±1 percent target range.
14.
The authorities expect a more modest
slowdown. While agreeing with staff that
economic growth was slowing, the authorities
ascribed the economic weakness in 2012:Q1 to
exogenous factors (weather) and expect a more
robust recovery in 2012:Q4 than staff. They expect
2012 GDP growth at about 1–2 percent.

activity in 2013, aided, to some extent, by
monetary easing, a modest recovery in confidence Source: WEO and IMF staff projection
in H2 and progress in alleviating financial market stress. Under the baseline (unchanged medium
term policies) scenario, the economy would recover but remain weak as high deficit and debt
constrain growth. In particular, until 2017 actual output could hover below potential (which has been
experiencing a secular decline in recent years) and would reach potential by 2017 only.3 This is
largely because:


A strong rebound in external demand is unlikely. Although immediate risks have recently receded
in the euro area, economic weakness is likely to persist, affecting external demand as well as
domestic confidence, including through weak remittances.



Financial sector problems could feed back to the real economy. High and rising NPLs are likely to
unwind only gradually, keeping credit rather tight and affecting the corporate outlook.

16.
The authorities’ view of the medium term outlook is more sanguine. They pointed to
the country’s untapped natural resource wealth, notably mining and hydroelectricity, which promises
opportunities for new investment. They also underscored the flexibility in Albania’s productive base,
which has led to some export diversification, thereby limiting the adverse impact of a protracted

slowdown in Europe. They agreed with the need for structural reforms, particularly those related to
property rights, but noted the constraints imposed by lack of political consensus.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that reducing external vulnerabilities would require
further improvements in competitiveness. In the absence of well-coordinated efforts to boost
competiveness, staff estimates that the real exchange rate, which has contributed to maintaining
competitiveness and stability, thanks in part to a cumulative nominal depreciation of 20 percent
since 2008, could become moderately overvalued over the medium term (Box 2). Non-price
factors—such as the high cost of doing business emanating in part from perceptions of governance
problems, and business environment distortions—could, if left unaddressed, also affect
competitiveness. The authorities considered the stability of the real exchange rate, the minor loss in
export share (which is still higher than in 2009), and the ability to sustain FDI given the country’s
natural resource wealth, as limiting the risk of a disorderly current account adjustment.
18.
Staff sees risks to the outlook as largely weighted to the downside. Spillovers could
transmit through trade, remittances and banking channels (Box 1). A larger-than-expected
deterioration in the eurozone could significantly worsen Albania’s growth outlook and debt
sustainability, and weaken the financial sector. Ongoing domestic weaknesses, including an erosion
of fiscal discipline and political uncertainty in the run up to elections could also adversely affect the
fiscal outlook and lead to a sudden reversal of investment sentiment. Potential government funding
problems, particularly the large rollover need, could exert a negative feedback to banks (Appendix II,
and Table 6).
19.
The authorities saw some upside to the baseline scenario. While they agreed with staff
on the risks emanating from high debt and rollover needs, they did not see these as excessive; they
pointed to Albania’s high pre-crisis level of funding need. The authorities also saw a significant
upside to the baseline scenario emanating from the privatization of the state oil company, Albpetrol,
receipts from which they expect as early as Q4: 2012.4

A winning bid has been announced and subsequent discussions are ongoing.

Box 2. Albania: Exchange Rate Assessment
Competitiveness indicators remained broadly unchanged in 2011 and 2012:H1. The average lek-euro value has been largely
flat in 2011 and first half of 2012, contributing to a stable average REER relative to a year earlier. Nonetheless, after gaining world
trade market share till 2010, Albania’s export share decreased slightly in 2011 and could decline further in 2012.

However, in recent years, persistent fiscal deficits and worsening terms-of-trade have put pressure on the current account
balance. Relative to the 2005–2006 period, the current account has deteriorated, reflecting, a twin-deficit phenomenon as well as
a downward trend in the terms-of-trade. Most recently, in the first half of 2012, the current account and trade deficits narrowed
because of weak imports of goods and services.

the current account norm calculated under the MB and ES approaches could be lower than estimated.

B. Advancing Fiscal Sustainability through a Credible Anchor
Background
20.
Unchanged fiscal policies would
not address underlying fiscal
vulnerabilities. Under staff’s baseline
(unchanged) policy scenario, where the
primary fiscal position would register a
surplus of about 1 percent of GDP, public
debt would remain near the 60 percent of
GDP statutory limit over the medium term. In
this scenario rollover risk would remain
elevated.

Re-commit to a credible debt ceiling and consolidation path to re-anchor fiscal policy. The
first priority should be to arrest the upward trend in public debt and other government
obligations (including unpaid bills) by preparing a 2013 budget that stabilizes debt at the 2012

and financial sector risks. Staff proposed
reducing public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2022 (about 53 percent by 2017)—a target it
believes would allow for an appropriate gradual pace of adjustment during the period the
economy is operating below potential (till 2017), while also enabling Albania to restock its fiscal
buffers to a higher than the pre-crisis level so as to reduce rollover risk. This target would entail
a gradual yet sustained cyclically-adjusted annual consolidation of the primary balance
averaging about 0.3 percent of GDP till 2017 (Figure 6).5

Staff projections under the adjustment scenario are consistent with a fiscal multiplier in the moderate range
(0.4–0.7), reflecting the impact of tax and capital expenditure increases and current expenditure reductions. As a

climate issues are addressed (see below).



Address the fiscal burden of social security. Given Albania’s young population and the
dramatic rate of aging expected in the coming decades, the current large social security
burden—in part the result of contribution rate cuts in 2006 and 2009, and the recent unfunded
increases in pension benefits and social insurance outlays—is unsustainable. Widening the net of
contributors, including those in agriculture, and removing the asymmetry between contributions
and benefits, will help.7 Ad hoc increases in wages and pensions, which has been recent practice,
should be avoided, and instead a rules-based system that uses inflation as the upper bound
should be used.



Avoid cuts to capital and other priority expenditure. Albania’s high development needs and
weak cyclical position call for avoiding cuts to investment and targeted social spending. Staff
suggested increasing the volume and quality of capital spending over time, and ensuring
adequate funding for social safety nets that effectively protect the vulnerable.



Utilize privatization receipts in a balanced manner. To the extent natural resource wealth
belongs to current and future generations of Albanians, the bulk of privatization receipts should
be used to retire debt. Given the weak state of the economy today, and the recent buildup of
unpaid bills and VAT refunds, part of the receipts could also be used to clear the backlog, which
will support growth in the near term.

result, the proposed fiscal consolidation would have a marginal impact on annual growth (about 0.1–0.2 percentage
points over the medium term, with a somewhat higher effect in 2013).
6

These taxes could be replaced by other measures such as streamlining VAT exemptions and raising property taxes.

7

Worker contributions vary with income and the highest can be as much as five times the lowest contribution, while
benefits are at most twice the minimum benefit. This encourages high income earners to evade the pension system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ALBANIA



Manage short-term rollover risks. Progress is needed on deepening public debt markets by
diversifying government paper holdings away from banks, including by following Fund TA
advice, and lengthening maturity of public securities.

Authorities’ views


The current statutory debt ceiling has been useful but needs to be used flexibly. The
authorities saw Albania’s fiscal record as having been prudent despite the crisis—they pointed to
the moderate post-2008 increase in Albania’s public debt—and that debt service is manageable.
The large domestic component also makes the debt less risky than the headline public debt
number would suggest. They felt the statutory 60 percent debt limit had provided an anchor for
fiscal policy, but felt that using it as a hard target in the near term is inappropriate, especially
given the weak cyclical position of the economy.



The current low level of income taxes has helped reduce informality. The authorities
explained the recent decline in tax revenues as largely cyclical—resulting from automatic
stabilizers and weak confidence related to the eurozone crisis—and expected tax collection to
recover as the outlook improved. They feared an increase in tax rates could harm Albania’s
investment competitiveness. Instead, they preferred to focus on improving tax administration.



Social insurance reform is necessary. The authorities agreed on the need for smaller increases
in the public wage and pension bills, and adding those employed in agriculture into the
contribution net. However, they also cautioned about the lack of political consensus on the
issue.



Higher capital expenditure is desirable, but future increases have to take debt
sustainability into account. The authorities will increase capital spending if and when
privatization receipts (or other non-debt-creating flows) are available and other priority
spending (unpaid bills and emergency electricity imports) are accounted for. In the absence of
such flows, they will cut capital spending further, if necessary, to achieve debt sustainability.
They rejected the idea of increasing tax rates to finance higher capital spending.



Rollover is high, but does not necessarily pose a high risk in the current environment. The
authorities agreed with staff’s suggestion to take measures to lengthen maturities and deepen
public securities markets. However, they also pointed to the commercial banks’ ample liquidity
and limited lending opportunities as helping to mitigate rollover risks.

C. Maintaining Financial Stability in the Face of Continued Challenges
Background
21.
Eurozone spillover risks are a concern, but significant actions have been taken. The
preponderance of foreign subsidiaries in Albania and banking troubles in Europe raise the specter of
potential spillovers to the country’s banking system. However, the low reliance on external funding

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

and greater dependence on local deposits prior to the crisis (the loan-to-deposit ratio of the
Albanian banking system has remained below 65 percent in the past decade) has helped to mitigate
the risks. Also, regulatory changes introduced in late 2011 have helped to protect against possible
contagion effects, particularly related to Greece (Box 1 and Figure 4).8
22.
Asset quality deterioration has both cyclical and structural reasons. The increase in NPLs
is explained by the economic slowdown, which has been exacerbated, in part, by the increase in the
government’s nonpayment of supplier’s bills. In addition, banks’ efforts to resolve problem loans
have been hindered by an inefficient collateral execution process, including lengthy legal
procedures, weak judicial enforcement of creditors’ rights and a regulated floor on real estate prices
at auctions, which hinders foreclosure sales. Banks appear to be relatively well-provisioned against
NPLs, but not surprisingly, the increase in NPLs has adversely affected both their profitability and
their ability to extend credit. If NPLs continue to rise, some nonsystemic banks may need to bolster
capital or shed assets. Given that the system is dominated by European subsidiaries, it may be
ambitious to expect parents to fully satisfy additional capital needs, if necessary.

Staff advice


Strictly monitor capital and liquidity. Supervisors should be vigilant to ensure that banks
continue to proactively recognize and provision against nonperforming loans and, based on
stress test results, ensure that capital and liquidity levels provide appropriate buffers. Close
coordination with other national regulators about evolving challenges, including regional
deleveraging, should also continue. Following up on the considerable progress made in recent
years with Fund technical assistance, the priority should be to develop contingency plans for
individual banks, and develop simulations to test the authorities’ preparedness. Staff
encouraged the authorities to request an update on the 2005 FSAP.



Intensify efforts to arrest the deterioration in asset quality. Concrete actions to ease
collateral execution, reduce delays in the legal process, and clear unpaid government bills and
VAT refunds are essential. In particular, allowing property prices to adjust to market forces by
removing the regulated price floor at auctions would help facilitate foreclosures sales,9 while
backloading the fees paid to bailiff offices would create greater incentives for timely execution.
Implementation of the guidelines on loan restructuring, recently issued by the BoA (and
prepared in cooperation with the World Bank), should also encourage increased out-of-court
workouts of nonperforming loans.

8

Foreign bank branches were converted to subsidiaries and the required ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities
raised from 20 to 25 percent, with a more restrictive definition of liquid assets, and haircuts applied to eligible assets
based on their credit rating. The regulation on related party exposure was tightened, and the risk-weighting on
unhedged foreign currency lending increased from 100 to 150 percent.

9

The direct impact of a decline in real estate prices on banks’ balance sheets would be limited as the amount banks
are required to provision is unrelated to the estimated value of underlying collateral.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ALBANIA

Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities concurred that the near term priority is to contain possible Eurozone
spillovers. They viewed continued close bank supervision and cooperation with regional regulatory
authorities as having been critical in containing risks so far and planned to further strengthen these
efforts. They also indicated a readiness to reinforce the regulatory framework and contingency plans,
guided by stress test results. They plan to request an FSAP update for late 2013.
24.
Reducing NPLs is a priority. There was broad agreement about the causes of rising NPLs
and the need to reduce their level. At the same time, the authorities noted that with adequate
capitalization, the increase in NPLs had been rather manageable so far, and even if it were to
increase further, only a handful of nonsystemic banks would fall below regulatory capital
requirements. The authorities were also confident about the ability of parent banks to bring in
additional capital, if needed. Instead, they expressed concern about the tendency of European banks
to ascribe high risk weights to Albanian government securities. They saw scope for more aggressive
execution of collateral but also underscored the social sensitivities associated with rapid foreclosure
sales.

D. Use of Monetary Policy to Ease the Economic Slowdown
Background
25.
Despite significant monetary easing, credit growth is weak. Despite repeated cuts in the
policy rate, credit has remained sluggish. With fiscal buffers absent, there appears to be persistent
pressure on the BoA to continue to ease monetary policy. A slowdown in credit has sparked a
debate about creating a public development finance institution that channels credit to the
underserved microfinance sector and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Staff advice


The scope for further monetary policy easing is nearing its limits. Staff advised that in the
event of further weakening of domestic demand and drying up of credit, the authorities could
consider additional monetary easing, provided inflation expectations remained well anchored. In
this regard, the BoA could accept inflation rates at the upper end of its tolerance band. However
any further monetary policy easing may provide only a limited boost to domestic demand unless
market confidence improved.



Further monetary easing also carries risks. Since monetary transmission operates primarily
through the exchange rate (Appendix III), continued monetary easing runs the risk of generating
exchange market pressures and adversely impacting bank balance sheets, the latter primarily
because of unhedged foreign currency lending (although significant foreign currency deposits
provide a cushion).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA



In setting up a development finance institution to channel credit to underserved sectors,
risks should be taken into account. While such an institution could help improve SME’s access
to finance, a well-defined mandate with careful governance and independent oversight is
essential to ensure that lending decisions are on commercial lines and fiscal risks are
minimized.10

Authorities’ views


The authorities agreed to exercise caution on further easing. They felt the recent monetary
easing had some beneficial effect on domestic demand, and economic conditions would have
been worse without it. However, they agreed to proceed cautiously with further easing by
assessing implications for financial stability.

E. Accelerating Reforms to Boost Medium-Term Growth
Background
26.
Private sector-led growth could unleash the country’s potential. The downward trend in
potential growth in recent years has coincided with the deceleration of structural reforms. In the
absence of structural reforms, staff sees potential growth to continue to decline over the medium
term. Staff envisages substantially higher medium-term economic growth than under the baseline,
particularly in the outer years, if there is significant macroeconomic and structural adjustment
(adjustment scenario; Figure 6). Attracting investment is key for transferring technology and
innovation, and boosting productivity and high-wage employment. In particular, structural reforms
could help broaden the productive base, reduce the informal economy, and diversify exports.
Energy, mining, tourism, and agricultural sectors offer high potential for growth.

Staff advice


Reduce existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities in order to support private sector growth.
Undertaking sustained but growth friendly fiscal consolidation would allow the crowding in of
private sector credit and investment and increase infrastructure-related capital spending. The
scenario would also result in a gradual improvement in the current account imbalance as higher
investment strengthens export capacity (adjustment scenario, Figure 6).



Proceed with targeted reforms to improve the investment climate. Staff argued for renewed
focus on correcting weaknesses in property rights, land titling, and contract enforcement.
Reducing arbitrariness in tax collection would lower the effective tax burden on businesses.



Implement improvements in the post-privatization regulatory framework of key
industries, notably electricity. Given the importance of the energy sector for growth and risks,

10

International experience on the effectiveness of such institutions is largely unfavorable, with low repayment rates
often translating into a much larger eventual drain on budget resources than initially anticipated.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ALBANIA

staff advised the authorities to continue to work closely with the World Bank to correct existing
impediments in the functioning of the electricity market. Staff underscored the importance of a
self sustainable model which does not depend on government involvement (e.g., energy
imports, or investment).


Continue improvements in economic statistics. Improving data accuracy and timeliness,
particularly in national and external accounts, will contribute toward better surveillance and
policymaking. Adequate resources should be made available to ensure effective use of Fund TA.

Authorities’ views


Attracting foreign investment requires further upgrading of infrastructure. While agreeing
on the need for FDI to achieve and sustain high medium-term growth, the authorities
emphasized the importance of continued infrastructure development to attract investment. They
appeared optimistic about the prospects for renewed investment flows, once conditions in
Europe stabilized.



Resolving energy sector problems is critical. The authorities ascribed the existing weaknesses
to the failure of the distributor to make the required investments, and did not see adjustments
in retail prices as necessary, since tariffs in Albania are broadly comparable to those in
neighboring countries. Until these problems are addressed, government support, including
financing emergency electricity imports, will be essential to avoid power cuts.



The authorities agreed on the need for continued improvements in economic statistics.
They acknowledged that annual national account statistics on expenditure basis have not been
published since 2008, while quarterly GDP statistics are subject to considerable revisions and
often available with significant lag. They are committed to continue working with Fund technical
assistance in order to develop capacity.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Until this year Albania had weathered the Eurozone crisis relatively well. Between 2008
and 2011, Albania avoided a sharp fall in output and was able to maintain banking system stability,
thanks to a fiscal stimulus, sound monetary policy and effective macroprudential actions.
28.
The economy is now slowing at a time when external risks remain high. GDP growth is
expected to decline sharply in 2012, on the back of low consumer and business confidence
emanating from the weak outlook for Greece and Italy. The ongoing eurozone crisis could continue
to bear both direct and indirect headwinds in 2013, resulting only in a modest recovery growth in
Albania.
29.
Underlying imbalances and vulnerabilities are elevated. The large share of short–term
public debt translates to high fiscal financing risks. In the medium term, rising public debt could also

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

hamper growth prospects by crowding out private credit and investment, and limiting the
government’s ability to finance crucial development projects. While the current account deficit has
begun to decline, it remains high.
30.
Fiscal consolidation is essential for lowering elevated debt risk. The statutory debt limit
of 60 percent of GDP has served Albania well in anchoring the economic policy debate. While strict
adherence to this ceiling may have no particular economic rationale, the authorities would be well
served to recognize that there is no debt financing fiscal buffer available. Breaching the limit could
undermine market confidence in the government’s commitment to macroeconomic stability and
debt sustainability, something which Albania can ill afford, given the high public debt rollover need.
31.
The authorities should commit to a credible long-term debt anchor, and firm nearand medium-term fiscal consolidation paths. A feasible long-term debt target that ambitiously
lowers the debt-GDP ratio would strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks, while allowing for a
gradual adjustment to accommodate development needs. For 2013, the government’s immediate
priority should be to commit to a budget that is consistent with maintaining the debt-GDP ratio at
the 2012 level. This would strike an appropriate balance between consolidation and growth, financial
sector stability, and social outcomes. Building consensus on the medium term consolidation path
would also ensure sustainable growth and macroeconomic stability.
32.
Tax and expenditure reforms are needed to help achieve the long-term debt target,
while supporting growth. With inflexibility in a large part of expenditures, lowering the fiscal
deficit would require higher revenues over a sustained period of time. While tax administration
efforts would help, increases in tax rates will be essential. Social security reform and restraint on
current spending would also be key. Revenue increases and current spending restraint are also
required for a much-needed increase in capital spending, in a way that does not magnify fiscal risks
or crowd out private investment. Needed capital spending should not rely on privatization inflows
alone, which any way should be utilized mainly to reduce debt and clear unpaid bills. Utilizing
realistic ex ante revenue estimates, would make for effective fiscal policy, and help avoid the
accumulation of unpaid bills.
33.
Monetary policy has anchored macrofinancial stability, but its ability to support the
economy is reaching its limits. If domestic demand were to weaken further and credit to contract,
the authorities could consider further monetary easing, provided inflation expectations remain well
anchored and financial stability is not threatened. However, sluggish credit demand and bank risk
aversion would likely limit effectiveness. It could also risk exchange market pressures and adverse
impact on bank balance sheets. While the authorities’ frustration with weak credit growth is
understandable, any attempts to direct credit to preferred sectors should take into account the weak
credit demand in the economy, and the budgetary impact of such an action.
34.
Despite the preponderance of European bank subsidiaries, the banking system has
proved resilient, but continued vigilance is needed. Stress tests should continue to guide
decisions on capital and liquidity buffers, while close cooperation with foreign supervisory
authorities is key to mitigating cross-border risks. The rising level of non-performing loans is a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ALBANIA

concern and requires prompt action. Not all of the recent increase in NPLs can be ascribed to the
slowing economy. Removing structural distortions in collateral execution—including streamlining
legal processes, strengthening judicial enforcement of creditors’ rights , and increasing the efficiency
of private bailiff offices—and clearing unpaid government bills and VAT refunds would be
important.
35.
Business environment weaknesses are an obstacle to investment and hence medium
term growth. Continued weaknesses in the legal framework, notably in property rights and contract
enforcement, should be tackled urgently. Tax collection should be made less arbitrary. Remedying
structural impediments in the electricity market is essential for putting the sector on a selfsustainable path, supporting growth and avoiding fiscal risks. Improvements in data accuracy and
timeliness, particularly in national and external accounts, will contribute toward better surveillance
and policymaking.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Albania be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

The adjustment scenario is based on the following assumptions: 1) faster growth, driven by the most critical
structural reforms (e.g., property rights, business climate) and fiscal consolidation, which boost private
investment; 2) fiscal consolidation, notably a tax rate increase, zero real growth in the wage and pension bills, and
higher capital spending; 3) reduction in public debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2022; and 4) gradual reduction in
the external current account deficit, as higher investment strengthens export capacity, and interest payments
decline as a result of lower debt.

crisis.

Relative Likelihood of Severe Realization of
Threat in the Next 1–3 Years
(high, medium or low)
Medium
Heightened financial stress could further
reduce consumer and business confidence
and stifle growth. European banks
subsidiaries could suffer greater losses as a
result of higher nonperforming loans,
making it difficult to meet capital
requirements.

4.

Weakening
confidence
in the
banking
system.

Rollover of
governme
nt debt.

Sharp
increase in
oil prices.

 Continued uncertainty in Greece and
Italy, could trigger deposit withdrawals,
especially in their subsidiaries.
 Weak bank profitability, to a large
extent because of persistently high non
performing loans, may further weaken
credit.

Impact if Realized
(high, medium or low)
High
Negative impact on export demand,
tourism, remittances, and foreign direct
investment. Albania’s foreign-dominated
banking system may be directly hit,
including through deleveraging.

High
A worsening of liquidity pressures will
lead to a contraction in bank lending,
which will further weaken domestic
demand. Lower revenues could
adversely impact public finances and
debt sustainability, while funding
pressures and higher interest rates could
further exacerbate the situation.

Medium
Uncertainty about economic conditions,
especially in the run up to elections, and
concerns about debt sustainability, may
make banks hesitant to rollover government
debt, a large part of which is short term.

High
Higher borrowing costs will exacerbate
debt sustainability and possibly lead to a
disorderly fiscal adjustment that will
further weaken growth prospects.

Low
Geo-political risks could lead to a sharp
increase in oil prices.

Medium
Higher energy prices would depress
domestic and external demand.
Economic activity and public finances
would suffer. The external current
account deficit would worsen, putting
pressure on the exchange rate and
reserves, while inflation would rise.

1/The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report
(which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The RAM reflects staff’s views on the source of
risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities. The relative likelihood of risks listed
is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline.

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Although external debt will remain sustainable over the medium term, concerns about
public debt sustainability could undermine the government’s capacity to rollover its debt.
Shocks could lead to a further deterioration of debt indicators.

Public Debt Sustainability
1.

Under the baseline scenario, public debt is expected to remain broadly unchanged at about

60 percent of GDP. Debt at that level will require primary surpluses of 1 percent of GDP to stabilize.
More importantly, that level of debt constitutes about 245 percent of revenues, which could cast
doubts on the government’s ability to rollover its debt.
2.

Various stress tests highlight the possibility for further deterioration of the debt-to-GDP

ratio. The biggest deterioration would come from a one–time depreciation of the real exchange rate
by 30 percent, which would lead to an increase in the debt–to–GDP ratio to 73 percent by 2017.
Also, noteworthy is the impact of growth deceleration. If growth were to slow down to an average of
1.5 percent over the medium term (compared to 2.5 percent under the baseline scenario), the
debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 65 percent. Finally, a worsening of the primary deficit by
0.7 percentage point would lead to an increase in the public debt to 64 percent of GDP.

External Debt Sustainability
3.

External debt appears sustainable in the medium-term, although it is expected to rise in

relation to GDP in the short-term as economic growth slows and public external borrowing takes
place to smooth the adjustment to the external shock. Over the medium-term, the external current
account is expected to decline as: (1) import growth slows down due to moderating demand
pressures; and (2) remittances recover from global shock, though converging to a lower level than
before the crisis. Foreign direct investment and external borrowing are expected to be just sufficient
to finance the projected level of the external current account deficit in the coming years.

4.

External debt would remain sustainable under shocks represented by standard bound tests.

A combined shock to interest rates, real GDP growth, and the external current account deficit of
¼ of a standard deviation around historical averages would bring the ratio of external debt to GDP
to 40 percent in 2013 through 2016. A one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2013 would
increase external debt to 55 percent of GDP in that year, but it would fall to 48 percent by 2017.

Appendix II. Albania: Fiscal Deficits, Rollover Risk, and
Banking System Stability
If left unaddressed, Albania’s high public debt could pose significant challenges in the
current environment. Rollover risk could worsen because of large financing needs,
which banks may be unable to cover, and inward shocks to the domestic debt market.
These problems could also have feedback effects on banking stability.
1. Albania’s key challenge is to put its public debt on a downward trajectory. Under
the baseline scenario, even if the authorities maintain a small primary fiscal surplus over the
medium term, the debt burden will not improve. Instead, it will hover around the statutory ceiling
of 60 percent of GDP by 2017, because of rising interest spending.

2. With an adverse external
environment, the government will have to rely increasingly on raising money domestically.
The prospects for external financing are not rosy today—Albania’s five-year Eurobond spread
was about 665 basis points at end-September 2012—and are likely to continue to be relatively
unfavorable over the near term, till eurozone markets return to stability. The government would
therefore continue to rely on the more expensive, albeit safer domestic financing over the
medium term, not only to finance the deficit, but also to retire maturing external debt. As a
result, the domestic debt stock could rise from about 33 percent of GDP in 2011 to about
38 percent by 2017 (with domestic debt accounting for 62 percent of total).
3. Most of Albania’s domestic public debt is short term, and largely held by
commercial banks. About 56 percent of the 2011 debt stock was of 12-month maturity or less.
Longer term debt is primarily in the form of 5-year and 2-year notes. Almost the entire stock of
domestic debt is in local currency. Commercial banks are by far the largest holders—with the
nonbanking system accounting for only about 15 percent of the debt stock.

4. The government’s ability to continue to attract investors in the future is subject to
considerable risks. There has already been a significant shift in bank balance sheets away from
public debt over the past five years—the share of government securities in total assets has fallen
by 10 percentage points over the period. Going forward, the projected baseline increase in public
domestic debt over the medium term poses significant rollover risks mainly because of:

Inward spillover. Given the
predominance of foreign-owned banks
in Albania’s banking system (about 90
percent of assets), unexpected stress in
parent European banks could
potentially spill over into Albanian
subsidiaries, in turn putting at risk the
government’s ability to rollover and
issue new public debt. The recent
offloading of government paper by a
major foreign bank subsidiary is a case

Changes in perceived riskiness of government securities. If public debt were to increase—
above the publicly known statutory debt limit—potential creditors might reassess the risk
profile of government securities. An explicit downgrade may force creditor banks to
reallocate their securities portfolios—recently, banks appear to be moving away from
government securities, driven by their internal risk models.

1

Following the decision of the parent bank (based in the Euro area) to reduce its risk-weighted assets—
ostensibly to meet more stringent capital requirements at home—the subsidiary, which is the biggest bank in
Albania with about one third of domestic public debt, reduced exposure to Albanian government paper by
150 million euro (about 5 percent of public securities maturing in 2012). In the event, another bank picked up
most of the offloaded securities.

Profitability pressures. Because of the economic downturn and more stringent liquidity
requirements, banks have shrunk their loan portfolios, which in turn has impacted their
profitability. To boost profitability, banks may in the future decide to gradually reduce their
exposure to the relatively loweryielding government securities in

Financial innovation. Over the long
term, the introduction of new
savings schemes is likely to lead to
a shift in savings away from
traditional bank deposits. As a
result, the availability and reliability
of government funding could suffer.

5. The government’s projected financing needs over the medium term will likely be
too large to be covered by commercial banks. An examination of bank balance sheets
suggests that if the stock of government securities continues to increase by the annual historical
average of 5 percent, banks would be able

government security yields could rise,
putting further pressure on the fiscal deficit and public debt. If left unaddressed, investor
nervousness could ultimately lead to an adverse shift in perceptions. A disorderly fiscal
adjustment could then trigger bondholder losses and banking system instability.

government bonds, and 6.5 percent on treasury bills.

7. Cross-country experience confirms the potential negative effects of high public
debt on banking system stability.3 Foremost, higher public debt is associated with lower return
on assets and equity for the banking system. This association may be driven by higher interest
rates, which hamper borrowers’ ability to stay current on loans. Cross country evidence also
shows that high public debt is associated with low provisioning and capitalization.

Appendix III. Inflation Targeting in Albania
1. Albania’s record on inflation since the move to inflation targeting has been
impressive. Inflation has remained within the central bank’s target range of 2–4 percent for most
of the period since 2006, a performance that compares favorably to other countries in the region,
including other inflation targeters such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Serbia and Romania
(Figure 1).
2. The inflation targeting framework has evolved gradually since the shift to inflation
targets in 2000. The central bank has moved from quantitative targets for monetary aggregates
toward an interest-rate based monetary policy, while gradually eliminating direct credit to the
government and building the analytical capacity needed for a full-fledged inflation targeting
regime. The monetary policy stance under the current framework is signaled by the central
bank’s reference rate, with open market operations used to align short-term interbank rates with
that rate. The annual growth rate of broad money (M3) is monitored as an intermediate target,
along with a floor for international reserves (4 months’ import cover). While the target range
applies to headline inflation, the central bank also closely monitors core inflation; food accounts
for nearly 40 percent of the basket, making headline inflation highly sensitive to supply shocks.
3. As a small, open and highly euroized economy, inflation in Albania remains closely
linked to exchange rate movements. Half of bank deposits and two-thirds of lending are in
foreign currency, while imports of goods and services amount to roughly 55 percent of GDP,
ensuring that changes in exchange rates have an immediate balance sheet effect and pass
through relatively quickly into domestic prices. In addition, the effect of interest rates on
domestic demand through the credit channel remains relatively modest (bank loans amounts to
only 40 percent of GDP, well below regional comparators), while the high level of liquidity in the
banking system limits the scope for a significant impact on lending activity through changes in
domestic interest rates.
4. As a result, interest rate policy works primarily through the exchange rate. While
the credit channel continues to strengthen as the level of financial intermediation rises with the
development of the financial system, at the moment, the most significant transmission of interest
rate changes is through their impact of the exchange rate. Interest rate cuts have largely followed
the course set by the ECB over the past two years, maintaining a sufficient differential to stabilize
the exchange rate against the euro after the depreciation in the wake of the financial crisis in
2009, and keep inflation close to eurozone levels.

Safeguards Assessments:

The latest safeguards assessment of the Bank of Albania, completed on July 14, 2006, found that
some weaknesses existed in the central bank's safeguards framework. The main vulnerabilities
identified by the assessment concerned the quality of the external audit, poor oversight of the
external and internal audit functions and the system of internal controls, and certain weaknesses
in the controls over the Fund data reporting process. Subsequent to the assessment completion,
external audit quality has been improved by adding cosignature from the larger office of the
audit firm, and the data reporting process was modified as recommended. The authorities are
working to address remaining vulnerabilities in the areas of governance oversight and internal
audit function.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system. The de jure
exchange rate system is classified as free floating, but the de facto exchange rate arrangement is
floating, with the monetary authorities occasionally intervening in the foreign exchange market
in order to avoid excessive and short-term disruptions in the functioning of the market and to
accumulate reserves. The country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article
XIV and maintains an exchange restriction in the form of outstanding debit balances on
inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became a Fund
member. These relate primarily to debt in nonconvertible and formerly nonconvertible
currencies. Staff is currently assessing Albania’s exchange system for potential exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices. The exchange rate stood at lek 109.57 per U.S. dollar
on November 16, 2012.

Article IV Consultation:

The conclusion of the 2011 Article IV consultation took place in September 2011 (IMF Country
Report No. 11/313).

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

An FSAP was carried out in early 2005. The Financial System Stability Assessment was considered
by the Executive Board on August 1, 2005 concurrently with the staff report for the sixth review
of the PRGF-supported program and financing assurances review. An action plan for
implementing the FSAP recommendations has been prepared in consultation with the IMF. A
data module ROSC was published on the Fund’s website in June 2000. A fiscal ROSC was
completed in June 2003. Albania participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
and a complete set of GDDS metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well as
for the socio-demographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (http://dsbb.imf.org). A data module ROSC reassessment using the Data Quality

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
October 17, 2012
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The main obstacles
are in real sector statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts are compiled from insufficient and poor quality sources. While
technical assistance has been provided on methodological procedures, source data still do not provide
sufficient information to compile reliable estimates on the unobserved economy. In November 2005, the
Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) released major revisions of the national accounts estimates for
1996–2003 and updates for 2004, reflecting methodological improvements.
INSTAT has benefited from technical assistance from the Fund and the European Union, mainly to address
weaknesses in methodology, basic data sources, and coverage of the private sector. STA continued to
provide technical assistance through peripatetic missions in 2010 and 2011. The Labor Force Survey was
incorporated into the estimates of the unobserved economy in the annual national accounts while attempts
were made to use the Household Budget Survey to develop a new benchmark estimate of private
consumption. A new methodology for gross fixed capital formation based on a commodity flow approach
was developed. Quarterly national accounts were compiled during the project and are now being published
and revised. Due to severe resource constraints at INSTAT, the improvement in the national accounts has
been relatively slow.
Price statistics: Compilation generally follows international standards, and the estimation of imputed rent
within the CPI was improved in 2003. In December 2007, INSTAT has updated the CPI weights using the
results of a new national-level HBS conducted during the period October 2006-September 2007. PPI has
been published only quarterly due to financial constraints. The weights were derived from the 1998 annual
Structural Business Survey.
Government finance statistics: GFS generally follow the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986.
External donor financed-projects that do not pass through the treasury system represent a weakness in
source data. There are adequate source data to establish a GFSM 2001 presentation for Albania, but data on
financial assets need to be compiled and further disaggregation of debt instruments is necessary to report a
financial balance sheet of government that reconciles stocks and flows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ALBANIA

Monetary statistics: The monetary data compilation framework conforms to the methodology
recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) 2000. The depository corporations
survey covers the Bank of Albania (BoA) and all the other deposit-taking institutions (commercial banks and
savings and loans associations (SLAs)). The accounts of the SLAs, with the exception of loans, are produced
on a cash basis, which contrasts with the MFSM’s recommendations of accrual accounting. Another deviation
from the MFSM’s methodology is that the BoA’s and commercial banks’ holdings of nontradable long-term
securities are recorded at book value.
External sector statistics: The Balance of payments data compiled by the BoA are methodologically sound,
although some of the estimates, particularly for international transactions outside the banking system need
to be refined. Problems remain in the areas of service transactions and remittances, and in the monitoring of
financial account transactions, foreign assistance (grants from abroad to regional and local governments are
underreported), and external debt.
A September–October 2007 mission noted strong progress in adopting earlier recommendations but advised
that estimation methods for transactions outside the banking system (mostly remittances and investment
transactions by nonresident Albanians) require further improvement.
The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external government debt (including
commitments of state-owned enterprises). However, there have been some irregularities in the recording
and presentation of external arrears. The collection of data on external grants is not timely, with lags of
several months frequently encountered.

Statement by Mr. Montanino, Executive Director for Albania
and Mr. Spadafora, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
Executive Board Meeting
December 3, 2012

On behalf of the Albanian authorities, we thank staff for the continued close and constructive
cooperation, as well as for the very informative report.

Main Issues
Albania weathered the global crisis better than most other regional and European
economies. A timely fiscal response, sound monetary policy, and effective macroprudential
actions have allowed escaping a recession despite the challenging external environment
which affects that specific geographical area.
After years of severe recession in some neighboring countries, Albania is now being
increasingly affected by the slowdown in the euro area. Output growth slowed to 1.0 percent
during the first half of 2012 (from 2.7 percent in the same period of 2011), as consumer and
investor confidence suffered from worsened external conditions, remittances declined, and
credit growth fell sharply. Part of the economic weakness was due to exogenous factors
(severe winter weather).
The authorities expect a more robust recovery than staff starting in the current quarter. Some
upside to the baseline scenario emanates from the privatization of the state oil company
(Albpetrol) and further positive effects might come from stabilization in external
conditions expected from the initiatives agreed on November 26 by the Eurogroup on
Greece.
Public finances remain manageable. The authorities’ conduct of fiscal policy during the crisis
was prudent, as public debt-to-GDP ratio remained fairly stable around 60 per cent of
GDP during the last years.
In the medium term, the authorities value the country’s untapped natural resource
wealth (notably mining and hydroelectricity). Also, flexibility in the Albania’s productive
base shows capacity to reorient export to new products and markets.
Fiscal Policy
The statutory 60 percent debt limit is an anchor for fiscal policy, but it needs to be used in a
flexible manner in the near term. Given the current economic environment, an excessively

2
rigid rule might be procyclical, with counterproductive effects on growth, particularly
if investment is cut further in order to comply with the rule.
The authorities are aware of the rollover requirements and agree with the staff’s suggestion to
take measures to lengthen debt maturities and deepen public securities markets. However,
they consider the debt service as manageable: rollover risks are mitigated by the fact that
about 70 percent of public debt is held by commercial banks, which have ample liquidity and
face limited lending opportunities.
The overall balance is expected to improve in 2012, as fallen tax revenues have been
more than offset by cuts in capital expenditure. The authorities consider a prevailing part of
the fall in revenues as cyclical, resulting from automatic stabilizers and weak confidence
related to the eurozone crisis. Almost all the decrease in the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio
between 2009 and 2011 might be explained by the reduction in VAT receipts. Tax collection
is thus expected to recover as the outlook improved.
In the authorities’ view, the current low level of income taxes has helped reduce informality.
They are thus concerned that an increase in tax rates could harm Albania’s investment
competitiveness, and prefer to focus on improving tax administration.
While recognizing the desirability of higher capital expenditure, the authorities reject the idea
of increasing tax rates to finance it. Increases in capital spending are conditioned to the
availability of privatization receipts (or other non-debt-creating flows) and to the financing of
other priority spending (unpaid bills and emergency electricity imports).
The authorities agreed that social insurance reform is necessary and on the need for smaller
increases in the public wage and pension bills. However, they also cautioned about the lack
of political consensus on the issue.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
With the economy showing signs of weakness, the Bank of Albania (BoA) has lowered its
policy rate five times since August 2011, to a historic low of 4 percent. Against this
background, the authorities share the staff’s call for caution on further monetary easing,
given the implicit risks for financial stability. In fact, since monetary transmission operates
primarily through the exchange rate, continued monetary easing runs the risk of generating
exchange market pressures that may adversely impact bank balance sheets, because of
unhedged foreign currency lending (although significant foreign currency deposits provide a
cushion).
The financial system is dominated by foreign banks, and has proved resilient thanks largely
to strong macroprudential regulations by the central bank. In fact, prudent limits on external

3
borrowing prior to the crisis avoided a large boom-bust credit cycle. Banks exhibit high
liquidity and solvency ratios, supported by continued stringent regulatory
requirements. Risks are further mitigated by the banks’ low reliance on external funding and
greater dependence on local deposits (the loan-to-deposit ratio of the Albanian banking
system has remained below 65 percent in the past decade).
However, potential spillovers from the euro area to the country’s banking system are a
concern, and the authorities concurred that the near term priority is to contain these
spillovers. In particular, the banking crisis in Greece has impacted Greek subsidiaries, which
account for one-fifth of Albania’s banking system, though the effects have been mitigated.
Greek subsidiaries responded by shrinking their balance sheets and slowing lending, so that
they now rely mainly on domestic funding.
To address possible risks, the BoA has applied more stringent capital and liquidity
requirements on Greek banks, and heightened coordination with Greek authorities. More
generally, the authorities view continued close bank supervision and cooperation with
regional regulatory authorities as critical in containing risks so far and planned to further
strengthen these efforts. They also indicated a readiness to reinforce the regulatory
framework and contingency plans, guided by stress test results. They plan to request an
FSAP update for late 2013.
The sharp rise of NPLs over the last two years is another source of concern, given the impact
on bank profitability and the ability to extend credit, although provisioning has been
adequate. The authorities share the staff’s views on the causes (cyclical and structural)
of rising NPLs and the need to reduce their level. At the same time, the authorities noted
that with adequate capitalization, the increase in NPLs had been rather manageable so far,
and even if it were to increase further, only a handful of non-systemic banks would fall
below regulatory capital requirements. They saw scope for more aggressive execution of
collateral but also underscored the social sensitivities associated with rapid foreclosure sales.

Structural Reforms
The authorities agree that a favorable investment environment is a vital condition for
further attracting large-scale international investors and boosting productivity. They
thus agree on the need for structural reforms, particularly those related to property rights;
further improvements in competitiveness are also critical so as to reducing external
vulnerabilities. The authorities however noted the constraints imposed by lack of political
consensus.
The authorities emphasized the importance of continued infrastructure development to
attract investment. They are broadly confident about the prospects for renewed investment

4
flows, once conditions in Europe stabilized.
The authorities recognize the importance of resolving problems in the energy sector, but they
ascribed the existing weaknesses to the failure of the distributor to make the required
investments; they did not see adjustments in retail prices as necessary, since tariffs in Albania
are broadly comparable to those in neighboring countries. Until these problems are
addressed, government support, including financing emergency electricity imports, will be
essential to avoid power cuts.
Finally, the authorities agreed on the need for continued improvements in economic statistics.
They are committed to continue working with Fund technical assistance in order to develop
capacity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 11, 2013

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Albania
On December 3, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Albania. 1
Background
Albania has successfully avoided a serious economic slowdown since 2009, but with
euro zone problems persisting, the economy slowed considerably in the first half of
2012. Credit growth fell sharply between January and August, as consumer and investor
confidence weakened. Inflation has been low and relatively stable, largely within the
central bank’s 2-4 percent target range. The current account deficit has begun to adjust
on account of weakening imports but still remains high. Heavy exposure of exports and
remittances to Greece and Italy carries near-term risks.
Fiscal imbalances are rising. At nearly 60 percent, the debt-GDP ratio has reached the
statutory ceiling and is among the highest in the region. Tax revenues have been
trending downward, partly due to cyclical conditions, while most expenditure cuts have
been focused on capital. Rollover needs are high as more than half of public debt is
short term.
The banking system has been resilient so far, with banks having high liquidity and
capital ratios. Strong macroprudential actions have mitigated risks. However,
nonperforming loans have risen sharply over the last two years and now exceed one
fifth of all outstanding loans—the highest ratio in the region. Greek bank subsidiaries,
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

which account for one-fifth of bank assets, have made considerable progress in realigning lending with their domestic deposit base and increasing capital.
Progress in reforming the business climate—critical for attracting investment and
achieving sustained growth over the medium term—has been limited. Albania has
dropped 8 places on the World Bank’s Doing Business Index to a rank of 85.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for prudent policies that have supported
growth in the midst of the global financial crisis. However, Directors noted that the
economy is slowing, policy buffers have been depleted, and macroeconomic imbalances
persist. Against this backdrop, they recommended actions on a variety of fronts to
preserve fiscal sustainability, safeguard financial soundness, and improve the
investment climate.
Directors underscored the importance of a sustained fiscal adjustment that would
reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term without unduly dampening growth.
Budgetary consolidation should center on both tax and expenditure reforms. Taking note
of proposed legislation to remove the statutory debt limit, Directors agreed on the need
for a renewed commitment to a credible ceiling for public indebtedness to anchor the
authorities’ fiscal plans. Improvements in debt management are also a priority, given
rollover risks. In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to utilize prospective
privatization receipts mainly for debt reduction and clearance of unpaid bills.
Directors observed that inflation targeting in the context of a flexible exchange rate
regime has been effective in keeping inflation low and stable. However, they noted that
the scope for easing monetary policy further is limited by weakness in the economy as
well as the risk of an adverse impact on unhedged positions in banks’ balance sheets.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
modestly overvalued, and urged the authorities to accelerate fiscal and structural
reforms to foster competitiveness and external adjustment.
Directors commended the authorities for policies that have safeguarded the soundness
of the financial system. At the same time, they recognized that financial risks remained
elevated, and called for continued supervisory vigilance. In particular, Directors
encouraged the authorities to take action against rising nonperforming loans at banks,
including by clearing unpaid government bills and improving collateral execution.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ request for an update in 2013 under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program.
Directors stressed the need to accelerate structural reforms in many areas to boost
potential growth. Priorities include strengthening property rights and contract

3
enforcement which would enhance the investment climate. Impediments in the energy
sector also need to be addressed to make the sector self-sustaining and lower fiscal
risks. Directors highlighted the importance of further improving Albania’s economic
statistics, particularly as regards the national and external accounts, to help policy
design and evaluation.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Albania
Executive Board Meeting
December 3, 2012

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since issuance of the
Staff Report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Negotiations on a contract agreement for Albpetrol privatization could not be
concluded within the stipulated 30-day period (since the announcement of the winning bid on
October 3). The deadline has been extended by thirty days.
3.
Recent data (January–October) indicate that the fiscal deficit was 1.9 percent of
annual GDP, compared to 2.4 percent of annual GDP in the first 10 months of 2011.
Revenues grew by 2 percent (y-o-y), while spending was broadly unchanged, largely because
of a 15 percent reduction in capital spending.
4.
Under the budget approved by the Council of Ministers on November 19, the 2013
fiscal deficit would increase to 3.4 percent of GDP, from the authorities’ projected 2012
deficit of 3 percent. Tax revenues are projected to increase by 5.4 percent, more than double
their expected rate of growth in 2012. Pensions will continue to rise well above inflation,
though wage bill growth is expected to be contained. Capital spending is projected to
rebound strongly. No privatization receipts are assumed in the draft budget. Public debt
would to climb to 62.4 percent of GDP next year.
5.
Earlier this month, the Albanian Regulatory Entity (ERE) decided to proceed with
revoking the private electricity distributor’s (CEZ) license because of the latter’s failure to
abide by the terms of the privatization contract (e.g., loss reduction and investments to
improve the grid). CEZ has 30 days to rectify the situation.
6.
Financial soundness indicators for September suggest that nonperforming loans rose
further to reach 22.7 percent of gross loans. The profitability of the banking system
weakened further in the third quarter, while provisioning was broadly unchanged. Credit to
the economy grew by 5.5 percent, compared to 14.5 percent in the first 9 months of 2011.
