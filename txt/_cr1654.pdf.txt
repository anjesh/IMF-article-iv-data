IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Fiji
On February 5, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Fiji.1
Fiji is enjoying strong growth momentum, due to higher investment, robust tourism and strong
remittances, supported by an improvement in the terms of trade. The historic elections of
September 2014 marked the return to democracy, leading to a normalization in relations with
development partners, further boosting investor and consumer confidence.
The Fijian economy entered its third year of above 4 percent annual growth in 2015, with GDP
projected to expand by 4.3 percent, following growth of 5.3 percent in 2014. Headline inflation
has remained low, benefiting from low global energy prices and wide-ranging administered
prices. In addition, delayed pass-through of low global food prices is likely to keep inflationary
pressures at bay. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) has kept the overnight policy interest rate near
zero, at 0.5 percent, and excess liquidity in the banking system persists. Despite some recent
moderation, credit growth has remained strong, reflecting in part the accommodative monetary
conditions, improved business confidence, and pent-up demand for credit. The 2015 fiscal deficit
is estimated at 3.2 percent of GDP and key budget targets have been met, but slower execution of
capital projects contributed to a smaller deficit. As a result of the shift in capital spending from
2015 to 2016, the fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2016, and
consolidation has been deferred to 2017. Public debt is sustainable, and is forecast to gradually
decline over the medium term. Foreign exchange reserves remain adequate.
The authorities continue to make progress in several structural reform areas, with a view to
lowering the cost of doing business and improving the overall business climate. However, much
scope for further liberalization remains, including with regard to consumer prices and exchange
controls. Efforts in these areas and continued impetus on structural reforms would also help
sustain broad-based inclusive growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that political stability had contributed to Fiji’s strong growth
performance and favorable economic outlook. Macroeconomic policies have also been
supportive. Nevertheless, Directors noted that risks to growth remain, and derive mostly from
external developments. At the same time, prolonged accommodative policies and delays in
reform implementation could generate imbalances and undermine growth prospects.
Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and
implement structural reforms to generate sustainable, inclusive growth.
Directors emphasized the need for a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to build buffers and
maintain sustainability. They commended the authorities’ focus on addressing public
infrastructure gaps, and recommended prioritization of capital projects and social spending while
containing current expenditure. They welcomed efforts to broaden the tax base and strengthen
administration. Directors also commended the successful refinancing of external sovereign debt,
which reflected favorable market conditions and an improvement in Fiji’s macroeconomic
fundamentals.
Directors recommended a gradual tightening of monetary conditions. They also supported the
use of appropriate macro-prudential policies to help moderate credit growth, especially to the
housing sector. While financial stability indicators are generally sound, Directors recommended
strengthened bank and non-bank supervision.
Directors noted that the broadly favorable macroeconomic conditions provided an opportunity to
increase exchange rate flexibility over the medium term to cushion against external shocks.
Directors encouraged the authorities to review and adjust the level of the exchange rate basket
peg more frequently to prevent protracted deviations from fundamentals.
Directors underlined the need for structural reforms to cement gains in potential growth, bolster
resilience, and reduce poverty. Directors encouraged the authorities to further streamline
government regulation, implement civil service and state-owned enterprise reforms, and remove
impediments to land use. Directors also recommended a gradual relaxation of price controls and
exchange restrictions.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to improve data which can help improve policy
making and reform efforts.

KEY ISSUES
Context. Fiji is enjoying a strong growth momentum due to accommodative policies,
robust tourism and strong remittances, and an improvement in the terms of trade. The
smooth and peaceful elections in September 2014 marked the return to democracy—
leading to a normalization in relations with development partners, further boosting
investor and consumer confidence. While addressing infrastructure gaps and further
improving the business climate will be critical to ensure strong, sustainable and more
inclusive growth, this must be balanced against the need to consolidate fiscal policy.
Risks are tilted to the downside, related to external developments and prolonged
accommodative policy settings.
Key issues and policy recommendations


Accommodative macroeconomic policies have supported growth, but the
exceptionally strong momentum and the robust credit cycle call for a removal of
policy accommodation. This would make policies more countercyclical, enhance
resilience against external risks, and help reduce the risk of emerging
macroeconomic imbalances.



Fiscal consolidation would help reduce external imbalances and ensure that the
medium term fiscal path is sustainable and prudent buffers are built. A withdrawal of
excess liquidity in the banking system and monetary tightening would help ensure
that the credit cycle is sustainable. Stronger financial sector supervision is also
needed to safeguard financial stability, especially as the credit cycle moderates.



Faster implementation of structural reforms would help to address infrastructure
bottlenecks and investors’ concerns, enhancing the business climate. Continued
structural reforms will also help reduce economic distortions and maintain
sustainable and inclusive growth, thereby lowering unemployment and poverty.

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

CONTEXT
1.
The historic September 2014 general elections marked Fiji’s return to democracy. Voter
participation was high at 84 percent and FijiFirst—the party of Prime Minister Bainimarama—
received nearly 60 percent of the popular vote, securing a two-third majority in Parliament.
Parliament has supported reforms and government policies more generally, helping lay the
foundations of the ongoing strong economic performance. Moreover, relations with traditional
development partners have normalized, further enhancing economic sentiment and access to
concessional financing.
2.
Political and macroeconomic stability have underpinned rising confidence in the
economy. Business confidence picked up in the lead-up to the elections and has remained strong,
contributing to a gradual pick up in private domestic investment. Tourist arrivals reached new peaks
in 2014, and are on track for another strong performance in 2015. Despite some moderation, the
credit cycle has remained strong, reflecting pent up demand, improved optimism, and
accommodative monetary policy settings. In May 2015, Standard and Poor’s raised Fiji’s credit rating
from B to B+, further boosting confidence in the economy. The authorities have accelerated reforms
in recent years—including improved infrastructure, civil service, pension system, and the
restructuring of the sugar industry.
3.
Long-standing structural challenges remain. For three decades prior to 2013, growth was
sluggish, averaging 2–2.5 percent per annum, owing to recurring political turmoil, external shocks,
and slow progress in structural reforms. The transition to the higher growth path has reduced slack
in the economy, but unemployment and poverty remain relatively high, particularly in rural areas.1
The main policy challenge is to accelerate reforms to sustain the growth momentum in an inclusive
manner, while at the same time consolidating the fiscal position and normalizing monetary policy to
build policy buffers against shocks and avoid the risk of overheating.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
4.
Fiji’s growth momentum has been exceptionally strong in recent years. The economy
entered its third year of above 4 percent annual growth in 2015, with GDP projected to expand by
4.3 percent, following growth of 5.3 percent in 2014. Growth has been broad-based and several
sectors (for example, transportation, financial intermediation, retail) have benefited from strong
foreign exchange inflows (from both tourism and remittances) and a continuation of the credit cycle
upswing. Tourist arrivals reached new peaks in 2014 and, despite significant exchange rate
appreciation relative to New Zealand and Australia, arrivals from both countries continued to grow –
while at the same time Fiji has also been expanding into Asian markets. The sugar industry, which
has been restructured, performed relatively well in 2014 and is estimated to have done so again in
1

Official unemployment data was last reported at 9 percent (2012, ILO), and poverty at 35 percent (2008,
World Bank).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

2015. Retail and commerce also continued to improve, benefiting from remittances. Strong
economic performance, favorable market conditions, and the credit rating upgrade (to B+ by S&P)
contributed to Fiji’s successful issuance of a new global bond to refinance part of a maturing bond.
5.
Despite robust domestic demand, inflation has remained low. Inflation increased modestly
in 2015, but remains low at 1.8 percent (November) due to lower oil prices, wide ranging administered
prices, and the appreciation of the exchange rate against major trading partners. The strong growth
momentum has diminished slack in the economy, but following several years of lackluster growth,
demand-induced inflationary pressures remain relatively muted. Moreover, price pressures from domestic
demand have been alleviated by higher imports (Table 4), with imports benefitting from exchange rate
appreciation against the Australian and New Zealand dollars (countries which represented 25 percent of
imports in 2014). Finally, the introduction of fee-free primary and secondary education in early 2014 also
helped to contain price pressures.
6.
While reserve coverage has declined somewhat, it remains adequate. International reserves
remain adequate but fell modestly to about 5.1 months of imports in 2015, reflecting strong import
growth.2 Fiji’s merchandise underlying trade deficit (after excluding aircraft purchases in 2013)
widened in 2014 with the growth of imports (15 percent) exceeding that of exports (7 percent).
However, the balance of payments remained in surplus in 2014 on account of strong growth in
tourism (5 percent) and remittances (13 percent), as well as robust FDI. Preliminary data for 2015 suggests
that the trade deficit is estimated to have narrowed, owing in large part to lower global oil and food
prices and a pickup in export growth. Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate, after appreciating
by about 1.5 percent in 2014, was broadly stable in 2015.
7.
Notwithstanding some moderation in 2015, credit growth has remained strong,
reflecting in part accommodative monetary conditions. Interest rates (both lending and deposit)
are low, as the RBF has kept its policy rate at 0.5 percent since November 2011. Low real interest
rates and the strong demand momentum have helped fuel a sustained period of rapid credit growth,
particularly in certain segments such as automobiles and real estate. The latter has contributed to
rapidly rising house prices, further propelling credit growth. Although commercial bank lending has
moderated to 12.8 percent (provisional as of October 2015), it is still high after adjusting for
inflation. Liquidity conditions have remained comfortable, aided by strong foreign exchange inflows
and the accommodative monetary stance.
8.
Reflecting the strong growth in recent years, commercial banks remain profitable and
financial stability indicators are generally sound. The capital adequacy ratio declined marginally,
reaching 14.7 percent at end-September 2014, well above the minimum prudential requirement of
12 percent, while Tier-1 capital ratios dropped to 11.3 percent, while remaining at strong levels.
Interest margins have also remained broadly stable as have non-interest expenses (relative to gross
income), while the return on assets has declined only modestly last year. The NPL ratio has been on
2 The level of adequate reserves is estimated at 4-4.5 months of imports, based on the standard IMF metric which is
a function of the weighted average of short term external debt, longer term debt arising from portfolio investment
and other investment liabilities, broad money, and exports of goods and services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

a declining trend since 2012, reflecting the strong upswing in the credit cycle. Banks’ balance sheets
are liquid: the liquid asset ratio has remained comfortable at 17.6 percent, albeit lower compared to
2014.
9.
Fiscal policy has remained accommodative. The fiscal deficits in 2014 and 2015 are
estimated at 4.3 and 3.2 percent of GDP, respectively, considerably larger than in previous years. The
authorities financed part of the spending increase (especially on roads and other capital projects)
with receipts from privatization, although these fell short of original targets.3 Following the 2014
budget, civil servant wages were raised by an average of 20 percent, although the pay hike does not
cover all civil servants, and follows several years of wage freezes.4 For 2015, key budget targets are
estimated to have been met (for example, VAT revenues) and there is some over performance in tax
revenues (partly due to stronger-than-expected growth), though the slower execution of capital
projects contributed to a smaller-than-projected deficit in 2015.
10.
Privatization continued to fall short of targets. Receipts from the sale of assets are
estimated to have reached F$80–100 million, well short of the F$507 million (6 percent of GDP)
planned for 2015. Similarly to last year, delays in the sale of the Fijian Electricity Authority, which
accounts for about half (F$250m) of the initially-envisaged privatization program, reflect uncertainty
about electricity tariff policies. Other SOEs including the port (F$80m) and airport operator (F$125m)
were only partially privatized. Given shortfalls the authorities have relied on sales of domestic bonds
and loans from banks and the FNPF to finance the budget.
11.
Fiji has successfully issued a US$200 million 5-year bond to refinance part of the
US$250 million (6 percent of GDP) global bond that will fall due in March 2016. The remainder
of the maturing bond will be paid using accumulated savings (US$43 million from the government’s
sinking fund), and a residual of US$7 million remains outstanding until they mature in March 2016.
The coupon rate of the new bond (6.6 percent) is about 240 basis points lower than that of the
maturing bond, in line with government estimates and reflecting favorable market conditions as well
as S&P’s upgrade of Fiji’s credit rating (to B+) in May 2015.

B. Outlook and Risks
12.
The near-term outlook is favorable. Growth for 2015 is estimated at 4.3 percent, propelled
by strong tourism earnings and remittances, robust credit growth, low oil prices, as well as high
public investment. The momentum is expected to moderate this year, with GDP projected to expand
by 3.7 percent supported in part by accommodative policies. Inflation is projected to remain stable
in 2016, and low oil and food prices will continue to keep inflationary pressures at bay. The current
account deficit is projected to widen slightly to 6.1 percent of GDP reflecting a pickup in non-oil
import growth, with reserve coverage projected to remain at 5 months of imports.
13.
The medium-term outlook is also favorable, but Fiji needs to address infrastructure
gaps and improve the business climate. Growth is expected to remain strong at around 3–
3

As the authorities’ convention treats privatization receipts as revenues, the deficit by the authorities’ definition is
somewhat smaller at 4.1 and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

6

In real terms, taking into account cumulative CPI inflation in the last 5 years, the increase was about 4 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

4 percent over the medium term (Appendix III), partly driven by robust public and private
investment, as well as buoyant tourism and remittances inflows, despite a gradual tightening in
macro policies. Strong FDI inflows are also expected in the medium-term, due to regained political
stability and positive investment sentiment, albeit with downside risks from external conditions as
discussed below. The current account deficit is expected to decline gradually, stabilizing at around
5 percent of GDP and public debt is also projected to decline in relation to GDP (to about 40 percent
in 2020), owing to fiscal consolidation and strong GDP growth. Inflation is expected to remain low
and stable, in line with developments in main trading partners and global commodity prices.
14.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and are largely related to external
developments, including Fiji’s exposure to natural disasters, but prolonged accommodative
policies have increased the risk of macroeconomic imbalances. Over the medium-term, risks to
reform implementation are also relevant (see RAM, Box 1).


A sharper-than-envisaged growth slowdown in China would hit Fiji directly as tourism revenue,
FDI, and exports would be impacted. Slower growth in China would also have indirect effects, as
it would adversely affect Australia and New Zealand economies, which would in turn hit Fiji’s
tourism revenues as well as remittances. While Fiji is relatively insulated from global financial
markets, higher global borrowing costs and financial volatility could result in higher market
volatility and interest rates, denting FDI and other foreign exchange inflows into Fiji.



Prolonged policy accommodation could lead to macroeconomic imbalances (such as rising
current account deficits and financial sector vulnerabilities) associated with continued low
interest rates and fiscal expansion. In addition, further delays in asset sales could affect the
financing of the planned infrastructure spending, adversely impacting growth potential.



Sustaining strong growth will also depend on timely and effective implementation of reforms to
further bolster the business climate, boosting private investment and fostering private sector
development more broadly. Private sector development could also slow if capacity constraints
and supply bottlenecks (e.g., labor skills mismatch) are not eased and the provision of
infrastructure by the public sector falls short of envisaged levels.



Fiji, like other small states in the Pacific, is highly exposed to natural disasters, including cyclones
and flooding, which could severely affect macroeconomic performance and the livelihood of
Fijians. Building fiscal buffers will increase Fiji’s resilience to natural disasters and weather-related
shocks.

Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s macroeconomic outlook, but consider risks to
be more balanced than in the staff’s assessment.


While they expect the economic momentum to moderate slightly more than in the staff’s
baseline, they noted that private investment should provide a bigger impetus going forward,
especially as business expectations remain strong. In their view, credit growth has been the result
of strong economic growth and has not been a key autonomous driver of the current
momentum.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI



The authorities see risks as broadly balanced: while they recognized the risk factors outlined by
the staff, they pointed to the positive sentiment, increased domestic private sector investment,
and upside for more foreign direct investment. They also pointed that there is an upside risk to
tourism inflows as connectivity continues to improve with the addition of direct flights to
Singapore. The budget announcement was also noted as an additional factor that will further
bolster business sentiment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Implementing reforms and gradually removing policy accommodation will be key to sustaining the
growth momentum with macrofinancial stability. A recalibration of policy settings, including the
removal of monetary accommodation, medium term fiscal consolidation, and a tightening of
macroprudential measures to tame the credit cycle is appropriate to prevent the building of cyclical
imbalances. Ensuring sustainable and faster potential growth would require a continued impetus on
structural reforms to address infrastructure bottlenecks and improve the business climate.

A. Monetary and Financial Policies
16.
While CPI inflation has been subdued, low interest rates and excess liquidity in the
banking system have fueled credit growth and house prices. Inflation pressures have remained
subdued partly due to low global fuel prices as well as a significant share of administered prices in
the CPI (Appendix IV). In contrast, house prices have risen rapidly and the credit cycle has remained
strong, and combined with low interest rates, has further propelled the house price momentum.
Despite the relatively weak monetary transmission mechanism, there is some econometric evidence
that low interest rates have fueled credit growth and contributed to the run-up in house prices
(Appendix V).5
17.
Given strong economic momentum and rapid credit growth, a removal of monetary
accommodation is warranted. The RBF should start by mopping up excess liquidity (with open
market operations or raising reserve requirements) and then gradually raising the policy rate. Growth
has been above trend for the past three years, and as a result, the output gap is estimated to be
positive. With the real policy interest rate in negative territory, a tightening of the monetary policy
stance is needed to ensure that the credit cycle is sustainable and does not accentuate the economic
cycle, increasing the economic volatility and the likelihood of a boom-bust cycle (Appendix V). The
removal of monetary support will also be important as broader efforts to deregulate administered
prices take place, especially as the transitory factors holding inflation down (such as the low level of
oil and other commodity prices) wane.
18.
Strong credit growth also calls for intensified financial sector supervision and the
implementation of macroprudential policies. While banks have capital ratios above regulatory

House price data are somewhat incomplete and covers mostly the capital Suva. The rapid increases in house prices
in recent years were partly driven by scarcity of freehold land and a surge in purchases by foreigners before measures
to restrict foreign purchases were taken by the authorities. Nonetheless, loan growth in the real estate and housing
segments has remained strong, pointing to strong domestic demand as well.

requirements and low levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), the RBF should actively monitor their
exposures to interest rate and credit risks, including by regularly conducting stress tests. This is
important given that NPLs are a lagging indicator (particularly when credit growth is robust) and
asset quality has not been tested given the strong economic momentum. The RBF should also
actively monitor and supervise the lending activities of non-bank financial institutions as a step
toward enlarging the regulatory perimeter, given that closer supervision of banks may create
incentives for regulatory arbitrage and growth in the non-bank financial sector. The RBF should also
consider imposing loan-to-value restrictions for real estate loans to help tame the steep credit
growth in the real estate segment and rapid increases in house prices. Measures to address the fast
growth in automobile and unsecured personal loans should also be considered. Efforts to promote
financial inclusion, particularly access to banking services, are welcome.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities noted that monetary policy should continue to support growth. While
they agreed that interest rates are low, they see the liquidity situation stabilizing in the near term
and noted that lending rates have already started to increase. They also argued that while they are
monitoring credit growth closely, it is too early to tighten monetary policy as there is still pent up
demand for credit.
20.
In response to the staff’s recommendation of enhanced financial sector supervision,
the RBF noted that they have been proactively conducting onsite supervisions. They also noted
that they have access to more data following the implementation of the macro-prudential survey to
assess lending conditions and creditworthiness.
21.
The RBF underscored that they would consider the use of macro-prudential tools such
as loan-to-value ratios for real estate, particularly if the run-up in house prices continue, but that
changes in policy and regulations would remain data dependent. The authorities have also added
that measures to restrict foreign purchases of land and real estate have helped somewhat cool the
momentum in house prices.

B. Fiscal Policy
22.
Fiscal policy has played an important role in supporting demand and raising potential
growth with a focus on infrastructure spending. The government contributed to recent strong
growth by boosting public demand and improving the business environment. Public spending
increased from 27.6 percent of GDP in 2013 to an estimated 31.4 percent in 2015 mainly due to
larger public investment, but also on account of greater health and education spending as well as
increases in public sector wages. For instance, the government introduced free primary and
secondary education program and loan schemes for tertiary education. Both are expected to
improve Fiji’s growth potential (see Appendix III) by enhancing human and physical capital, in
addition to supporting near-term demand. Although sales of the government’s assets, which were
supposed to finance the expenditure increase, has been behind the schedule, the government has
managed to maintain capital spending while containing current expenditure in 2015. Public
investment is expected to further increase in 2016, financed through additional asset sales.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23.
The approved 2016 budget remains accommodative. It targets a deficit of 4.4 percent of
GDP, and includes tax reform measures and continued high public investment. The VAT rate has
been cut from 15 percent to 9 percent, but exemptions on certain goods (food and medicine) will be
removed to broaden the tax base and improve revenue buoyancy. Along with other smaller changes
to the tax system, the services tax has been increased from 5 to 10 percent, which should cover
nearly 40 percent of the loss of VAT revenue. The budget incorporates capital projects which have
been delayed in 2015, with a prospective deterioration in the fiscal balance of about 1 percent of
GDP in 2016.
24.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to build buffers and reduce policy pro-cyclicality. The
envisaged deficit reduction this year has been postponed (resulting in an increase in the deficit by
1 percent of GDP), in part because of slower implementation of capital projects in 2015 which
resulted in a smaller-than-expected deficit. Staff, however, urged the authorities to tighten fiscal
policy in order to lower the risk of overheating and create fiscal buffers. Implementation of the
envisaged fiscal adjustment over the medium term is critical, while taking into account the need to
support investment to address infrastructure bottlenecks and raise productivity and potential
growth. Greater efforts should also be made to secure privatization receipts.
25.
Containing current spending and maintaining robust revenue growth should remain an
important part of the strategy of sustaining high public investment and bolstering fiscal
sustainability. While revenue buoyancy and spending restraint have been maintained, the
government rightly intends to further contain wage growth (after a rapid increase in recent years) as
well as rationalize other current spending. On the revenue front, the authorities’ efforts to implement
many of the recommendations of the TADAT (tax administration and diagnostic tool) and the
measures to increase the efficiency of the tax system are welcome. Ongoing efforts to improve rates
of filing compliance and taxpayer registry have been important to maintain tax buoyancy. The
elimination of VAT exemptions, effective in January 2016, will also contribute to broadening the tax
base and reducing administration and compliance costs. In this connection, both tax incentives and
tax expenditures should be reviewed and gradually phased out in a predictable fashion, especially in
areas where job creation has fallen short of expectations or costs are estimated to be too high.
26.
Public debt remains sustainable, with an important roll-over risk eliminated. While the
debt to GDP ratio has been on a steady decline reflecting favorable growth and debt dynamics,
maintaining the envisaged medium-term fiscal consolidation path will contribute to reducing public
debt from around 50 percent of GDP to about 40 percent by 2020. This would create policy space
and fiscal buffers to deal with contingent liabilities and shocks, especially natural disasters. External
debt is relatively low at 21 percent of GDP and is expected to decline modestly to about 19 percent
of GDP. The external debt profile has also improved with the pre-payment of the global bond that is
due in March 2016 and the issuance of a new bond at much lower rate.
27.
Pension reform has restored sustainability, but more needs to be done to increase
investment opportunities and diversify risks. The pension system, which is managed by the Fiji
National Provident Fund (FNPF), is fully funded and financially viable, thanks to a comprehensive
reform implemented in 2012, which among other things, raised the contribution rate (initially to
15 percent from 8 percent) and restricted contributors’ withdrawals from their retirement accounts.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

The FNPF remains heavily exposed to government debt, but has also been diversifying its portfolio
and gradually increasing its exposure to external investments to improve risk-adjusted returns.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities have emphasized that a prudent approach to fiscal policy remains their
priority and that it will continue to guide the formulation of their fiscal policies. In particular,
they noted that the goal of a declining debt to GDP ratio is consistent with the budget. The tax
reforms enacted will be largely revenue neutral and should help improve compliance, which is
consistent with their goal of improving efficiency and equity of revenue collection. They noted that
the shift in capital spending to 2016 will lead to a temporary increase in the fiscal deficit in 2016, but
that this will not compromise macroeconomic stability or the medium-term orientation of fiscal
policy. They agreed with the mission on the need for fiscal adjustment over the medium term—
starting in 2017—to deliver on the goals of lowering the public debt and bolstering the credibility of
the fiscal framework.
29.
The authorities also argued for the need to continue to look into tax policies to
enhance the business climate while at the same time improving compliance, which will help
maintain revenue buoyancy. They also noted that while tax incentives for investment will remain
a part of their policy package, they will continue to review incentive regimes to ensure that
ineffective incentives are gradually phased out, although this could take time. The authorities also
noted that the FNPF will continue to pursue a diversified strategy to enhance investment returns,
including through gradual increases in its overseas investments, with due consideration for Fiji’s
foreign reserve coverage.

C. Exchange Rate Policy, Reserves, and External Balance
30.
The external balance has improved in 2015, owing to low global commodity prices and
strong foreign inflows. The trade balance narrowed in 2015 given weaker-than-expected import
growth, due to low global commodity prices.6 Exceptionally strong earnings from tourism and
remittances have also contributed to the improvement of the current account balance from a deficit
of 10 percent of GDP in 2013 to an estimated deficit of 5.6 percent of GDP in 2015. While the
tourism earnings and visitor arrivals are expected to continue to grow strongly due to an increased
connectivity to Asia, the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat going forward with
growing imports. Reserve coverage remains stable at about 5 months of imports using standard
reserve metric.
31.
While the real effective exchange rate has depreciated slightly in 2015, it remains
somewhat above the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. In September 2015, the
REER declined slightly by 0.2 percent from a year ago.7 Reflecting its peg to a currency basket, the
Fiji dollar appreciated against the Australian and New Zealand dollar but depreciated significantly
6

Imports have been substantially revised downwards due to improved data collection by the authorities.

7
Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s five major
trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the Euro; and the Japanese yen. The weights used in
the basket, based mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed annually.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

against the US dollar. According to the Fund’s exchange rate assessment models, estimates of the
deviation of the real effective exchange rate from its equilibrium level point to an average
overvaluation of about 8 percent, with a range that encompasses a small undervaluation of 3 percent
to an overvaluation of 15 percent (see Box 3 for further details).
32.
The current favorable environment provides a good opportunity to lay the foundation
for a more flexible exchange rate regime. Periodic reviews and adjustments as needed of the level
of the basket peg would avoid protracted deviations from fundamentals and the need for large
adjustments. As noted in previous consultations, allowing greater flexibility from a position of
strength (particularly strong economic growth and robust foreign exchange inflows) would facilitate
the eventual transition to a more flexible regime while helping cushion the blow from external
shocks.
33.
Relaxation of capital account restrictions should continue towards fully meeting Article
VIII requirements. A gradual liberalization of capital controls and exchange rate restrictions will
encourage foreign investment as it will improve investors’ perception (particularly of the ease of
remittance of profits and funds and the elimination of tax certification requirements). Given the
prospect of robust reserve coverage over the medium term, the challenges associated with
liberalizing exchange restrictions should diminish and the measures would have a minimal impact on
the balance of payments. Moreover, recent efforts to strengthen the current AML/CFT regime,
including the role of the Financial Intelligence Unit in assisting the National AML Council, are
welcome and should continue.
Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities noted that the current exchange rate regime has served the country
well and has contributed to macroeconomic stability. They noted that reserves are at
a comfortable level and that foreign exchange inflows have continued to surprise on the upside.
While they noted that more flexibility could be desirable over the longer term as the economy
develops, they are closely monitoring the foreign exchange market and see no need for adjustments
in the near term.
35.
The authorities also argued that exchange restrictions should be gradually liberalized,
but this should happen in tandem with broader economic development. They underscored that
those restrictions have helped insulate Fiji from volatility in international financial markets, while at
the same time they have not adversely affected the country’s overall openness to international
investors.

D. Structural Reforms
36.
Continued structural reform will be key to cement recent gains in potential growth,
bolster resilience, and reduce poverty. The authorities’ focus on structural reform is welcome.
Progress in key areas such as civil service reform and state-owned enterprises has accelerated after
years of slow progress, which has held back growth in the past decades. The implementation should
continue to proceed apace. Recent improvements in access to health and education, including free
primary and secondary education, loan schemes for tertiary education, as well as infrastructure
investment in hospitals and schools, will help alleviate poverty and make growth more inclusive.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

37.
Robust growth in private investment will crucially hinge on the effective
implementation of reforms. Key reforms to achieve this goal include:


Further scaling back price controls. As of end-2014, a third of the CPI basket remained subject to
price controls. Further relaxation is needed to enable prices to act as signals for resource
allocation and investment. Relaxation of price controls can be supplemented with targeted
support for low-income consumers and competition policies.



Improving the predictability and streamlining of government regulation. Building on recent efforts,
further reduction of policy uncertainty through transparent and consultative policy processes will
further enhance the business climate and lower the costs of doing business.



Improving land-leasing efficiency. Although the Land Use Decree 2010 allowed for the
establishment of a land bank, only a small share of land has thus far been deposited. Further
progress is needed in laws, policy and implementation to provide a predictable and stable
supply of land that can be leased for long-term investment.



Relaxing capital controls. Relaxation of foreign exchange restrictions would improve investors’
perception (particularly of the ease of remittance of profits and funds), thereby further
encouraging foreign investment.

38.
While Fiji has a relatively well educated labor force, improving the quality of labor will
help address skills mismatch in the labor market and boost labor productivity. Efforts are being
made to ensure the access to, and the quality of education, but labor skills mismatch remains
a challenge to raise productivity and in some cases an obstacle to growth in many industries, and
have contributed to the loss of skilled labor through emigration. Further improvement in human
capital in key sectors such as tourism and sugar would complement efforts to address infrastructure
gaps, raising overall productivity and lowering unemployment and poverty.
39.
Improving data quality will help better guide policy-making. The authorities have
improved the quality of statistics on many fronts, in some cases with help of development partners,
including the IMF’s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), the Asian Development
Bank, and the World Bank. Enhancing the capacity of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) to address
challenges posed by the recent national accounts rebasing, the need for better integration of
balance of payment and national accounts, and the breakdown of GDP by expenditure, remains key
to enhancing the monitoring of the economy. More timely provision of information to FBOS also
remains a priority. Cooperation across different government agencies could be improved to speed
up the resolution of gaps in data coverage, quality, and timely provision, as well as other challenges.
Authorities’ Views
40.
The authorities concurred with the assessment that timely and effective
implementation of reforms will be critical to sustaining the growth momentum. They argued
that recent budgets have been a focal point to launch far reaching reforms, and budget
announcements and the subsequent implementation of reforms have boosted investor sentiment,
acting as catalysts for investment. They underscored that Fiji will continue to implement reforms in
a number of areas to lower the cost of doing business while maintaining the goals of inclusive
growth and poverty reduction.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

41.
The authorities highlighted that they prefer a more gradual approach to phasing out
of price and capital controls. In their view, price controls have been an important mechanism to
protect the poor given the insufficient competition in key sectors of the economy due to its small
size and, in some cases, the remoteness of certain areas. They also noted that regulated prices are
frequently reviewed and that the needs of businesses are fully taken into account in those reviews,
hence the distortions typically associated with prices controls are minimized.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Fiji’s growth has been strong, reflecting higher potential growth and accommodative
policies. Following many years of low growth, the economy has benefited from supportive
macroeconomic policies and external tailwinds and has grown at above 4 percent for the past three
years, while inflation has remained subdued. In addition to policy support and favorable terms of
trade, improved confidence amid the return to democracy and the re-engagement of development
partners have strengthened investor sentiment and provided renewed impetus to the growth
momentum. Growth is expected to moderate in the near term but remain strong at around
3-4 percent over the medium term, partly reflecting robust investment and higher potential growth.
43.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Risks to growth are largely related to
external developments and prolonged accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, and, over the
medium-term, to reform implementation. Fiji is subject to risks from lower trading partners’ growth
and its exposure to natural disasters. Further delays in asset sales could constrain the financing of
the planned infrastructure spending, adversely impacting growth potential. Easing capacity
constraints and supply bottlenecks are critical to further unleashing private sector development.
44.
To secure sustainable growth and enhance resilience against shocks (including from
natural disasters), Fiji needs to consolidate, build policy buffers, and accelerate structural
reform implementation. Fiscal consolidation should proceed apace to avoid policy pro-cyclicality
and build strong policy buffers that could be deployed in the event of a large external shock. At the
same time, the authorities should continue to address the infrastructure gaps and streamline
government regulations to further bolster the business climate.
45.
A removal of monetary accommodation is warranted, while stronger financial sector
supervision and macroprudential policies should be employed to moderate the credit cycle.
With the real policy interest rate in negative territory amid strong growth, the withdrawal of
monetary accommodation is needed to moderate the credit cycle and prevent the emergence of
macroeconomic and financial imbalances. In addition, the RBF should also actively monitor banks’
exposures to interest rate and credit risks, including by regularly conducting stress tests. Given still
strong credit growth and rapidly rising house prices, the RBF should adopt macroprudential
measures to tame the credit and housing price momentum, including through the use of loan-tovalue ratios.
46.
Fiscal consolidation would help create fiscal buffers and avoid policy procyclicality, and
maintain fiscal sustainability. Efforts to broaden the tax base, improve compliance, and strengthen
tax administration should also continue to ensure that buoyancy gains are not reversed and the
efficiency of revenue collection is maintained. Both tax incentives and tax expenditures should be
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

reviewed and gradually phased out. On the spending side, while capital projects and social spending
should continue to be given priority, restraint on current expenditures remains critical to create
policy space and ensure a growth-friendly consolidation strategy.
47.
Continued structural reform will be key to cement recent gains in potential growth,
bolster resilience, and reduce poverty. Notwithstanding recent progress, further streamlining
government regulations could help improve the business climate; implementation of reforms in key
areas such as civil service and state-owned enterprises could be accelerated. Lowering the cost of
doing business and improving economic efficiency would also require further reform efforts, such as
relaxing price controls, addressing bottlenecks to land usage, as well as easing capital controls and
exchange restrictions.
48.
A more flexible exchange rate regime should be gradually introduced. The real effective
exchange rate remains somewhat above the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
Against this backdrop, greater exchange rate flexibility would help cushion against external shocks,
while minimizing the risk of large exchange rate movements. Although the exchange rate regime
remains appropriate, the level of the basket peg should be periodically reviewed and adjusted in
order to prevent protracted deviations from fundamentals.
49.
A number of exchange restrictions are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
Restrictions arise from tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends,
and on the proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance
payments, and from direct limits on large payments. These should be made compatible with
requirement under Article VIII.
50.
Improving data quality will help better guide policy-making. The authorities have
improved the quality of economic statistics on many fronts, in some cases with help of technical
assistance by development partners. Enhancing capacity to address challenges remains key to
enhancing the monitoring of the economy. This could be helped by, inter alia, closer cooperation
across different government agencies to speed up the resolution of gaps in data coverage, quality,
and timely provision.

Box 2. Fiji: Authorities’ Responses to Past Fund Advice
Fund Recommendation
Fiscal Policy
 Restrain accommodative fiscal policy settings
to avoid overheating.
 Avoid funding recurrent expenditure with asset
sales.
 Adopt base-broadening revenue measures,
curtailing income-tax holidays and tax
incentives.
 With regard to the global bond, debt
management should be prudent.
Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate
 Lay the foundation for a more flexible
exchange rate to help absorb shocks and
protect the reserve position.
 Adopt a tightening bias to moderate credit
growth. Tighten monetary conditions through
open market operations and raising the
reserve requirement. Consider raising the
overnight policy rate.
Macro-prudential Policy
 The RBF should enhance its supervision and
conduct stress testing of banks.

Structural Reforms
 Structural reform priorities include the
relaxation of price controls, increased
efficiency of land use, improved consultative
process, predictability and streamlining of
government regulation and implementation,
infrastructure upgrades, and better aligned
incentives for expanding electricity production
and transmission.
Statistics
 Improve the quality of data for informed policy
making.

Policy Actions
The envisaged deficit reduction has been
delayed to 2017, due to delays in capital project
implementation and asset sales. Budget 2016
states that asset sales will be used to fund
capital expenditure. Recent tax reforms have
broadened the tax base. The authorities have
successfully refinanced the global bond.

While increased exchange rate flexibility is
desirable over the longer term, the authorities
do not consider adjustments to be necessary in
the near term. Exchange restrictions should be
liberalized gradually as the economy develops.
Current accommodative monetary policy
settings are considered appropriate given low
inflation and sufficient reserves.

The RBF is conducting onsite supervision, and is
conducting a macro-prudential survey to
improve data collection on lending conditions
and creditworthiness. Changes to and
implementation of macro-prudential tools will
be considered, and are data dependent.
Progress has been made on infrastructure
development, particularly on new roads. Other
key structural issues remain to be addressed,
including with regard to land. As of end-2015,
one-third of the CPI basket remained subject to
price controls.

Efforts to improve statistics, including the
national accounts, is currently underway with

Box 3. Fiji: Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff model-based estimates indicate that that the Fiji dollar is somewhat stronger than the value
consistent with medium term fundamentals. Three complementary approaches are applied to estimate
the equilibrium level of the real effective exchange rate (REER) or gauge the exchange rate adjustment
needed to bring it in line with equilibrium implied by medium term fundamentals.
i) Macroeconomic balance: First, a current account norm is estimated based on a panel regression of
146 countries from 1995 to 2015 of the current account on a set of fundamentals. They include:
(i) relative old age dependency; (ii) income growth forecast; (iii) cyclically adjusted fiscal balance;
(iv) private credit to GDP and (v) remittances. The current account deficit “norm” for Fiji is estimated at
-5.5 percent of GDP, while the “underlying” current account balance, which measures the current
account balance after adjusting for cyclical factors, is estimated at -8.1 percent of GDP. Given that the
underlying current account deficit is larger than the norm, the exchange rate has to depreciate to
“close” this current account gap. In this case, the difference between the norm and the underlying
current account indicates an overvaluation of the REER of about 10 percent.
ii) Equilibrium exchange rate approach: The equilibrium value of the REER is based on a panel
regression of the REER on a set of fundamentals, including (i) terms of trade; (ii) relative productivity;
(iii) relative government consumption; (iv) net foreign assets; (v) aid inflows; and (vi) remittances flows.
The fitted value from the regression yields the equilibrium REER level. A comparison of the current
value of the REER and an estimate of its medium-term equilibrium value indicates that the REER is
about 3 percent lower than the equilibrium value. The growth in reserves position and positive output
gap in recent years explain the strengthening of the equilibrium REER level.
iii) External sustainability: The external sustainability approach calculates the current account norm by
pinning down the level of the current account balance that stabilizes net foreign assets (NFA) at their
current level (or some other benchmark level consistent with macroeconomic stability). Given the NFA
estimate of about -70 percent of GDP, Fiji’s current account norm is estimated at -3.1 percent of GDP.
Taken together with the underlying current account deficit of 8.1 percent of GDP, this suggests the
REER is overvalued by about 14 percent.

Box 4. Fiji: Findings of the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool
In 2015 Fiji carried out an assessment of its tax administration, using the Tax Administration Diagnostic
Assessment Tool, or TADAT – becoming the first Pacific Island country member of the IMF to have
done so. The TADAT provides a baseline assessment of tax administration performance relative to
international good practices that can be used to determine reform priorities and highlight reform
achievements over time.
The assessment found several areas of strength in Fiji’s tax administration. These included: initiatives to
detect unregistered tax payers, tax payer awareness and education initiatives, sound arrears
management, consistent achievement of revenue targets, external oversight and transparency in
reporting, and monitoring of taxpayer perceptions of service. High rates of on-time payments were
found to be one of Fiji’s strengths, particularly regarding VAT system: approximately 95 percent of VAT
payments received on time, or around 88 percent of total VAT payments by value (2014 figures).1
The TADAT also called for improvements in areas such as: the taxpayer registration database, on-time
filing rates, a national compliance improvement strategy and plan, monitoring and evaluation of
compliance risk mitigation activities, use of audit activity to deter inaccurate reporting, and use of
empirical analysis, among others. Fiji’s on-time filing rates were found to be on the low side, at
16.3 percent for corporate income tax (CIT), and 28.5 percent for personal income tax (PIT). The most
recent cross-country filing rate data is currently dated from 2010, but by comparison upper-middle
income country peers averaged 53.5 percent for CIT, and 47.3 percent for PIT.
The Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority (FRCA) has quickly made use of the TADAT findings, starting
with a focus on how to improve filing rates with technical assistance from PFTAC. In addition, an
improved taxpayer registry would enable the authorities to more easily follow up on non-compliant
but active taxpayers, and thereby improve filing rates – in turn raising the potential for increased
revenue collection and reduced compliance gaps.

__________
1 The

VAT has been the single largest source of revenue: around 40 percent of tax revenue in recent years. The
share has increased with a gradual rise in the VAT rate from 10 to 12.5 percent in 2003, and then to 15 percent in
2011. Some items are tax exempt (e.g., financial services, education goods), while some are taxed at the zero rate
(e.g., kerosene, rice, edible oil). The share of the zero-taxed food items in the food consumption basket is around
20-25 percent.

Box 5. Fiji: Progress on Selected Structural Reforms
Fiji has made significant and steady progress on structural reforms over the last few years. Efforts have
been made in a number of areas with a view to lowering the cost of doing business and improving the
overall business climate. This box outlines some of the major reform areas.
Infrastructure. The main emphasis has been on new roads and road upgrades, following the creation
of the Fiji Roads Authority in 2013.
Civil service reform. The 2015 Budget initiative aims to improve performance and efficiency of the
civil service with World Bank assistance.
Cost of doing business. Companies Act 2015—modernization of the legal framework concerning
companies.
Restructuring the sugarcane industry. Sugar’s direct contribution to GDP has fallen to around
2 percent, from approximately 16 percent in the early 1980s. Despite this decline in its direct economic
importance, the industry reportedly employs 40,000 people, and sugar cane accounts for around threequarters of Fiji’s arable land. Operational inefficiencies and lack of capital investment have steadily
pushed up production costs, and uncertainty regarding the renewal of land leases has also reduced the
prospective profitability of new investments in production. In addition, labor costs have risen as it has
become difficult to hire younger workers who generally prefer to seek employment in urban areas and
other sectors. With the EU preferential treatment set to expire in 2017, modernization of the industry is
urgently needed to improve international competitiveness.
Pension fund sustainability. Fiji National Pension Fund’s (FNPF) sustainability – implementation of
IMF TA recommendations, including increases in contributions and withdrawal restrictions by
members, which have reduced contingent liabilities to government. Also, the review of the Pension
Supervision act is expected to be finalized this year.
State owned enterprise reform. Including asset sales to increase efficiency of service provision and
private sector participation.
Foreign investment. Has increased and benefitted from the single window for processing of
applications. Would benefit from relaxation of exchange restrictions, particularly those pertaining to
fund repatriation.
Public financial management. The ministry of finance is implementing key requirements for the
adoption of the new International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which is expected to
improve the provision of funding support and roll-out of capacity building programs.
Data quality improvements. Enhancements to data provision and quality are underway, including
with the assistance of PFTAC and other IFIS to better underpin policy decisions.
Enhanced financial access. Government agencies are assessing ways to enable the regulatory
frameworks to eliminate barriers to financial access, aided by the National Demand Side Survey which
will also help with the Financial Inclusion Strategy for Fiji.

Appendix III. Potential Growth in Fiji: Updating the Estimates
Fiji’s growth momentum has accelerated, reflecting a combination of structural and cyclical
factors. The economy is entering its third year of above 4 percent annual growth in 2015, following
GDP growth of 5.3 percent in 2014. In 2015, growth is projected at 4.3 percent, and has been driven
by strong foreign exchange inflows (remittances and tourism) and robust credit growth. Public
investment has been strong, as the government has focused on upgrading the country’s roads as
well as addressing other infrastructure gaps. These factors have bolstered investor sentiment, which
in turn has propelled private domestic investment.
Potential growth is currently estimated at around 3.5–3.8% in the medium-term. This is
significantly higher than the 2.5 percent

and with the authorities. In the production
1/ Potential growth rate estimated using production function approach
function approach, a standard CobbDouglas production function with capital and labor is used. Given the aforementioned increase in
the investment share of GDP, the contribution of capital has increased since 2013. The recent rise in
growth has also been associated with a slight increase in TFP, given some productivity gains
associated with the upgrades in infrastructure. In the forecasting period, given some fiscal
consolidation, there is a noticeable decline in the capital contribution. Labor growth is assumed to
follow population growth, and TFP growth is expected to remain broadly constant at its historical
average of 1 percent. These assumptions yield an estimate of about 3.5–3.8 percent potential GDP
growth.
The growth accounting approach suggests
that recent strong growth is supported by
public and private investment growth.
Political stability along with the recent reform
efforts to promote investment sentiment have
translated into strong investment activity.
Continued structural reforms and streamlining
government regulations can help secure
recent gains in potential growth by improving
the business climate, which could in turn
attract more FDI

Appendix IV. Understanding Price Movements in Fiji
Fiji has benefited from low inflation primarily due to lower global oil prices. However, inflation
has been even lower than previously anticipated and strong growth has not led to noticeable price
pressures. This box tries to shed light on the pass-though from global commodity prices to domestic
inflation as well as on the role of the exchange rate and monetary policy. Despite the very low policy
rate of 0.5 percent since November 2011 and recent strong economic growth, CPI inflation has been
relatively subdued since 2012, averaging about 2 percent. Does this justify a continuation of
monetary easing? Answering this important question requires a more careful examination of the
subcomponents of the CPI and the role of global prices and the exchange rate.
Since inflation has been stable, it is likely that price pressures from strong domestic demand
may have been offset by favorable terms of trade shocks and price controls. As Fiji’s import
dependency is high with imports of

While the exchange rate has been

In addition, still prevalent price controls complicate the understanding of price movements of

this case, the pass-through from external
prices (and other factors such as input

costs and exchange rate changes) to
domestic prices can vary across different types of goods, as illustrated by the text table and chart.
Taking into account the potential heterogeneity of the pass-through to different components
of the CPI, several VARs are estimated using disaggregated CPI data. The VARs are estimated
using [monthly] data from 2005-2015 and include international price (oil or food index from the
WEO), domestic activity, domestic CPI (or CPI subcomponent), and the domestic interest rate. The
variables are ordered as listed from the most exogenous to the most endogenous.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

As expected, there is significant heterogeneity in the pass-though from global prices:


The VAR estimates show that the pass-through of global oil prices to overall CPI is gradual and
muted (about 50 percent). But the pass-through from global oil prices to domestic
transportation sector prices is almost one-to-one, despite some prices controls affecting the
transportation sector1



Exchange rate movements have not significantly affected headline CPI, but have impacted
sectors with higher import dependence. Exchange rate pass-through to overall CPI is only about
25 percent after 10 quarters and statistically insignificant (using the more conservative twostandard deviation bands for impulse responses), despite high overall import dependency. The
relatively small exchange rate movements (excluding the 2009 devaluation) may make it difficult
to gauge the exchange rate pass-through with precision. Nonetheless, the use of more
disaggregated price data points to some evidence of pass-through: the cumulative exchange
rate pass-through to the transportation sector after 10 quarters is about 60 percent.

The following variables, ‘doil’ and ‘dtransport’ in the charts refer to the changes in log oil prices and log
transportation prices, respectively.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI



Meanwhile, the pass-through effect of global food prices on the overall CPI and the domestic
food CPI subcomponent is relatively muted, mostly likely reflecting price controls. The
cumulative pass-through to CPI and food prices is about 45 percent and 65 percent, respectively,
after 10 quarters, and in both cases it is statistically insignificant (using 16 and 84 percent
confidence bands).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Appendix V. The Role of Credit in the Monetary Transmission
Fiji’s monetary policy has been guided by the dual mandate of keeping inflation low and
stable and foreign reserves at an adequate level. While the RBF has no explicit inflation target, it
has stated in its policy documents that it is comfortable with an average inflation rate of about
3 percent, a level broadly consistent with that of Fiji’s main trading partners. While the reserve
coverage depends to a large extent on imports, the RBF has set a benchmark cover of 4-5 months of
imports of goods and non-factor services.
Fiji’s main monetary policy instrument is the overnight policy rate (OPR). This is the rate that
the RBF uses to communicate its monetary policy stance. In addition, the RBF also operates an
interest rate corridor, with the repo (reverse repo) rate set 50 basis points above (below) the OPR.
Open market operations (conducted with RBF notes) and occasionally changes to the statutory
deposit ratio are the main tools to influence the interbank and other interest rates as well as liquidity
and credit conditions.
While the OPR is adjusted according to the outlook for inflation and reserve coverage, it has
remained unchanged since late 2011. Inflation pressures remain low (owing largely to external
factors) and reserves have increased on the back of strong tourism inflows and remittances, but the
OPR has been very low, and negative in real terms. This accommodative stance has also been
reflected in market interest rates, and while Peiris and Ding (IMF working paper 12/176) find that the
direct effect on GDP is small for PICs, the low interest rate environment in Fiji has been associated
with strong growth in credit, particularly in real estate, housing, and auto segments.
Several factors are behind the credit cycle upswing. The robust growth in credit has been from a
low base and reflects in part pent up demand

To test the role of interest rates in the credit cycle and their indirect effect on activity, this box
applies a VAR to Fiji macroeconomic data. The VAR is estimated with quarterly data from 1994
until 2014. The VAR model comprises [GDP CPI IR Credit] with GDP* and Poil as exogenous (small
economy assumption), where GDP * is the average of trading partners’ real GDP, IR is the interest
rate, and credit is adjusted for CPI inflation. The quarterly GDP series proxy is computed using ChowLin interpolation method using imports as the auxiliary variable (the results are robust to using other
series including credit or using a simple linear-quadratic interpolation of the GDP series). The model
is estimated in log-levels (except for the interest rate) with seasonally adjusted data for GDP, credit,
40

and CPI. The ordering of the VAR is as listed above starting from the most exogenous. The baseline
model is estimated with 2 lags as indicated by the BIC lag selection criteria, but the qualitative
results are broadly similar if 4 lags are used. The results are also robust to using the deposit rate
instead of the lending rate in the VAR, but the OPR cannot be used in the estimations because it did
not change during a significant part of the sample. Finally, exogenous time-shift (dummy) variables
were included (2002Q2, 2007Q1) to ensure well-behaved residuals.
The results point to a powerful indirect effect of
interest rates on activity operating through credit.
According to the impulse response functions, the
direct effect of credit on GDP (not shown here to
conserve space) is relatively small and not statistically
significant, though it is economically significant. In
contrast, the effect of interest rates on credit is sizable,
and peaks at 8 quarters, with a one standard deviation
drop in interest rates boosting credit by about 4
percent (above baseline). In addition, the effect of
interest rates on GDP is also large and economically
significant (as well as statistically significant using the
standard 16-84 percent confidence bands). As
expected, GDP also exerts significant influence on
credit, suggesting a powerful positive feedback loop
making it important to control for that effect when
gauging the effects of credit on activity and other
variables. Consistent with an incomplete transmission
mechanism, credit shocks do not exert a significant
effect on the CPI.

Finally, additional econometric evidence also
suggests that credit might be systematically associated with house prices. While data limitations
prevent the inclusion of housing prices on the VAR, simple Granger causality tests also suggest that
real credit is an important predictor of real house prices, though interestingly the causality only goes
from credit to house prices and not the other way around.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: Fiji’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg.
Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies of Fiji’s
five major trading partners: the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound sterling (replaced
by the Euro at the beginning of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights used in the basket, based
mainly on the value of trade and tourist transactions are reviewed annually. The exchange rate of the
Fiji dollar against U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is determined daily by the Reserve Bank of Fiji

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

(RBF) in relation to the currency basket. The RBF’s buying and selling rates for transactions in
U.S. dollars are communicated to commercial banks. The exchange rate was F$2.18 per U.S. dollar as of
September, 2015.
Exchange and capital controls were tightened significantly in early 2009 following the devaluation of
the currency. Some of the exchange restrictions have been eliminated and amended since then.
Remaining exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII arise from the Fiji Revenue and Customs
Authority tax certification requirements on the transfer abroad of profits and dividends, on the
proceeds of airline ticket sales, and on the making of external debt and maintenance payments and
from limits on large payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends repatriation of foreign banks).
Approval of most current payments was delegated to commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers
in the late 1990s. However, the extent of delegation was tightened during periods of stress on foreign
exchange reserves, most recently in April 2009. In December 2009, the RBF announced an increase in
the delegated ceilings for commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers for most current payments,
effective January 1, 2010, and further increases in delegated limits were announced to come into effect
in January 2014. Banks have also been allowed to have net forward contracts of up to F$40 million, and
the delegated limit on dividends and profits for companies per annum was raised from F$500,000 to
F$1,000,000 per invoice. In November 2015, the RBF further announced further exchange control
relaxations effective January 1, 2016, to include further increases to the delegated limits of certain
payments and offshore investment by Fiji residents. Deposits into external accounts were raised from
up to $500 per month to $2,000 per month. Also, ceilings on offshore investment by Fiji residents were
raised from $15,000 per family per annum to $25,000.
Last Article IV Consultation: The 2014 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Suva during
July 17–30, 2014. The consultation (Country Report No. 14/321) was completed by the Executive
Board on October 31, 2014. Fiji is on a 12-month cycle.
Safeguards Assessment: The first-time safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) was
finalized in January 2011 and found key safeguards elements in place. The RBF publishes annual
financial statements that are both prepared and audited in accordance with internationally
recognized standards. The assessment confirmed, however, that the level of autonomy of the RBF is
very low with the legislation supporting a wide scope of political interference. Proposed
amendments would address some but not all of these weaknesses; alternative measures were
recommended by the staff for others. An action plan has been put in place where there is capacity
to prepare IFRS financial statements and commenced with the financial statements for the year
ended 2010 during 2011.
Resident Representative: The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Islands based in
Suva, Fiji was opened on September 13, 2010 and the office covers Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
Mr. Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan is the resident representative.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of November 13, 2015)
The Fund and the Bank teams maintain close cooperation in various areas. During the current
cycle, the Bank staff has joined the IMF missions, including the 2015 Article IV mission. The Fund and
the Bank have also been engaged in provision of technical assistance and advice in public financial
management and debt management policy. The two institutions extensively shared information and
closely coordinated policy advice during the government’s preparation of the refinancing of the
$250 million global bond in September.
During the current cycle, the Bank’s engagement with the Fiji government has deepened. On
March 11, 2015, the World Bank Group’s Board endorsed a two year Country Engagement Note
(CEN) and approved the US$50 million IBRD Transport Infrastructure Investment Project, the first
World Bank project in Fiji in 23 years. The CEN is structured around two themes: (i) strengthen the
foundations for inclusive, private sector led growth, and (ii) protect vulnerable population. Specific
areas of support from the WBG in the near term include:


Strengthening public infrastructure—to help the government address the huge backlog in
transport infrastructure repair that is urgently needed to support private sector investment
and better service delivery;



Technical assistance in civil service reform—to help improve public accountability and
transparency;



The IFC advisory services on regulatory and administrative reforms—to improve the
business environment.

The program anticipates that IBRD lending envelope of US$100-125million, including the US$50
million Transport Infrastructure Investment Project that was presented to the Board together with
the CEM. A second IBRD operation is under preparation based on further consultations and
analytical work. On the analytical front, the Bank will collaborate with the government to undertake
poverty assessment based on the 2013/14 household survey data, public expenditure review, and
the country growth diagnostics, all of which will inform a country partnership framework that will
outline a 4-6 year program following this CEN cycle.
The Fund and the Bank teams continue to agree that Fiji's main macroeconomic challenges
are to safeguard fiscal and external stability and raise potential growth through structural
reforms. The authorities have accelerated reforms in recent years, but the key policy challenge
remains to raise the potential growth, reduce unemployment and increase resilience to shocks.
While the latest information is from 2009, poverty remains widespread at just over one third of the
population according to the basic needs $3.10 a day threshold, though extreme poverty is relatively
rare. Despite the above-trend growth in recent years, continued structural reform is needed to
unlock Fiji’s potential and sustain growth. In addition to improving infrastructure, the government
needs to improve the investment climate (Fiji’s Doing Business ranking has slipped from 60 in 2013

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

to 81 in 2015) to take full advantage of potential increases in domestic and foreign investment. Key
structural reforms needs as seen by the Fund and the Bank as critical include:


Increased efficiency of land use, which is critical for Fiji’s growth prospects and economic
diversification.



Price decontrol, to re-establish price signals and encourage investment.



Public enterprise reform. The pace of implementation of reforms of other public
enterprises aimed at improving services and reducing fiscal costs needs to be accelerated.
These reforms will help reduce direct and contingent liabilities of the government, help
ensure fiscal sustainability, and promote growth.



Tax policy and administration reform. Efforts to broaden the tax base should continue,
including review of the tax incentive regime. Fiji continues to benefit greatly from TA in this
area provided by the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) located in Suva.



Strengthening statistical capacity and statistics. Fiji should ensure that it continues to
develop personnel with the capacity to produce accurate and timely economic statistics.
Good statistics are important both for macro policy formulation and good public financial
management (e.g. establishment payroll and wage bill control). Fiji continues to benefit from
a broad range of statistical advice from PFTAC.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of September 30, 2015)
Background
Fiji has been PFTAC’s largest user of TA in recent years. The revenue sector has been the main
area of focus. PFTAC has supported FRCA in a comprehensive modernization process including the
development of enhanced corporate planning, simplified income tax legislation and streamlined
personal income taxation policies and procedures. There has also been significant progress made in
the statistics area with improved national accounts, balance of payments and price statistics. In the
Public Financial Management (PFM) area, support has been focused on improving the quality of
budget documents, developing a PFM Reform Roadmap, revising the Financial Management Act,
and building accounting and financial reporting capacity. In macroeconomics the focus has been on
building modeling skills, including for potential natural resource revenues.
In the PFM area, the main focus will be assisting in remedying weaknesses identified in the 2012
PEFA assessment and prioritized in the Ministry of Finance’s 2015 draft PFM Reform Roadmap. This
may include assistance in looking at the roles, responsibilities and structure of the Ministry of
Finance. Areas of specific follow-up assistance could include strengthening accounting and financial
reporting consistent with IPSAS, revision of financial instructions, review of non-tax revenues, further
improvements to budget documentation, including adding more information on medium-term
expenditure forecasts, and continued training of budget officers in methods for budget
preparation/analysis. Assistance in cash and debt management may also be provided, if resources
are available. PFTAC will coordinate closely with the AsDB’s PEM TA project. In the next PFTAC
program period (2017-22), additional areas of TA could include improving budget execution
controls and internal audit, as well as developing an asset management framework.
In the revenue area Fiji requested an assessment of the tax administration system using the Tax
Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT) which provides an assessment baseline of tax
administration performance. FRCA, upon reviewing the diagnostic, appointed a reform project team
to address identified areas of weakness. With PFTAC support, the selection of a new customized offthe-shelf IT system has progressed with the selection of a vendor currently taking place. Other areas
of PFTAC assistance include: (a) the restructuring of the audit department; (b) improving the

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance institution
operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, New Zealand, Govt. of Korea and the EU. The
Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

collection of tax arrears; (c) setting new processes in place to improve on-time filing and collection
of outstanding tax returns; and (d) assisting in the design of a Compliance Improvement Strategy
targeted for implementation from 1 January, 2016. Legal drafting assistance to finalize the Income
Tax Bill was also recently provided.
In statistics, the focus of support will be further development of the national accounts. The ultimate
aim is to have quarterly national accounts estimates being produced by 2016. PFTAC assisted with
the finalization of rebased estimates using base year 2011 supported by the compilation of supplyuse tables for 2011. PFTAC also supported the development of GDP estimates by expenditures
which were expected to be published in December 2015. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has
provided assistance to develop a producer price index. IMF HQ has provided support for enhancing
balance of payment statistics and government finance statistics.
In financial sector supervision, the PFTAC advisor will continue to be available for consultations
with RBF staff and will work on regional issues with the RBF’s head of bank supervision who is
executive director of AFSPC. RBF is increasing its involvement with TA programs provided by PFTAC,
especially pertaining to Risk Based Banking Supervision training with the staging of a consolidated
supervision of conglomerates workshop. It is further receiving technical assistance with the drafting
of a new Credit Union Act, the deployment of a capacity building program for credit unions and the
establishment of an oversight program for that sector.
In the macroeconomic area, work will focus on building macroeconomic modeling and analysis
capacity with the aim of having better forecasts to feed into policy making. Key projects include
assessing the monetary transmission mechanism, further development of the Fiji financial
programming framework and toolkit for external and debt sustainability analysis, and improving
government expenditure and revenue forecasting methodology and processes.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 12, 2015)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with the Government of Fiji since 1970. As of
31 December 2014, $417.26 million in loans and $30.72 million in technical assistance has been
provided to the country, largely supporting infrastructure development in the transport (roads) and
urban water and sanitation sectors. In December 2014, ADB and the government formulated a new
country partnership strategy (CPS), 2014–2018. The CPS provides the foundation for higher, more
inclusive growth, and will assist Fiji to achieve its Millennium Development Goals.
Consistent with the priorities of successive governments, ADB engagement in Fiji has focused on
promoting inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. Strides have been made toward these
goals through direct investments in transport and urban water and sanitation infrastructure, and
improved public sector management. Road transport investments in Fiji over a 20-year period have
helped disadvantaged groups participate in the cash economy by reducing transport costs and
traveling times. This has increased access to employment opportunities and social services. An
improved transport system in Fiji has helped to bolster market efficiencies, and to broaden access to
education, health, and business services.
In December 2014, ADB built on its commitment to ongoing infrastructure development through
receiving Board approval for a new $100 investment in the transport sector. This project, which has
received additional cofinancing from the World Bank, will upgrade and rehabilitate roads, wharfs
and jetties in line with priorities identified in the Government’s 20-year National Transport Plan. In
December 2016 ADB will seek Board Approval for an Urban Water and Sanitation Project with
cofinancing from the Green Climate Fund and the European Investment Bank. The project will
ensure that residents of some of Fiji’s most densely populated areas have improved access to safe
piped water and an environmentally friendly sewerage system.
ADB also provided emergency assistance in 2009 and 2012 to help meet humanitarian and relief
expenses following devastating floods in the Western Division. This allowed the retroactive financing
of unforeseen government spending, and improved the government’s fiscal position.
Fiji also continues to participate in ADB technical assistance projects in the region, covering areas
such as climate change, public sector management, information and communication technology,
and trade facilitation.
ADB’s presence in Fiji has been enhanced by the location of its Pacific Subregional Office in Suva,
strong coordination and harmonization with other development partners, and significant analytical
work—including an ongoing country diagnostic study and a private sector assessment—on behalf of
the country. However, Fiji faces similar operational and implementation challenges to other Pacific
island countries, with limited public sector capacity and frequent staffing changes in key public and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

private sector positions. These constraints are reflected in the design of ADB projects, and
accompanying technical assistance is an important component of the overall support package.
ADB maintains ongoing dialogue on country operations with the Government of Fiji and its key
development partners. This ensures that external support is coordinated and reflects the
comparative advantages of individual partners. ADB has a strong track record of cooperative
programming in Fiji and will continue to seek opportunities to support poverty reduction and
development. ADB cooperates with the private sector and civil society organizations in the
implementation of national and regional operations involving Fiji.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Macroeconomic data are in the
process of improving, owing in part to the considerable technical assistance provided by the
Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (BoS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoF) issues the Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an annual basis.
All of these publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last updated
in November 2002.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2014. Revised data were published in August 2015 using the 2002 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the informal sector.
Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and expenditure-side GDP data in
current prices are only available through 2005. The authorities are currently refining the
methodology for estimating GDP from the expenditure side. In addition, GDP broken down by
income is only available through 2005.
Price statistics: CPI data are published monthly, with data available up to October 2015. The BoS
has rebased the CPI weights and is currently working on connecting the 2008 base data and
updated 2011 base data.
Government finance statistics: While Fiji has provided metadata for central government
operations and central government debt, the metadata were last updated in 2005. Fiji last
reported data for publication in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) in
2006. The authorities have participated in the regional GFS capacity building project funding by
the Government of Japan and held a regional GFS seminar in Suva in November 2015. Data for
budgetary central government has been compiled and advances have been made in collecting
the source data required to expand coverage to general government. The authorities are
encouraged to review and update the GDDS fiscal metadata and resume reporting data for
publication in the GFSY and commence reporting in the International Financial Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics: Data on the central bank, other depository corporations
(ODCs), and other financial corporations (OFCs) are comprehensive and provided to APD and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF FIJI

STA on a regular and timely basis. Progress has been achieved by the RBF in most areas of the
collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics (MFS), leading to
the introduction of the standardized reporting forms for the central bank, ODCs, and OFCs. This
resulted in the publication of data aligned to the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM) in the RBF’s website and International Financial Statistics. The full implementation of the
November 2005 workshop and January 2008, July 2011, and April 2012 missions’
recommendations will constitute a very important step towards the compilation in a timely and
efficient manner, of monetary statistics fully consistent with the MFSM and Monetary and
Financial Statistics Compilation Guide. Efforts are now concentrated in improving source data for
ODCs and OFCs and compiling a financial corporations survey with full institutional coverage.
Financial soundness indicators are not reported to STA.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics weaknesses persist and there is a need to
improve the coverage, classification and compilation methodology of the external sector
statistics (ESS). Fiji reports its balance of payments data for dissemination purposes in the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook (BOPSY). BoS has undertaken a number of actions that were recommended to improve
timeliness in ESS dissemination and to enhance consistency with the sixth edition of the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), albeit at a slow pace.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Fiji is a GDDS participant.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director, and Petaia D. Tuimanu,
Advisor to the Executive Director of the Republic of Fiji
February 5, 2016

Overview
1.
The Fijian authorities would like to express their sincere appreciation to the IMF
team for the constructive and engaging dialogue during the 2015 Article IV Consultation.
The authorities are in broad agreement with staff assessment of the economy as well as
the proposed policy and reform priorities to enhance broad-based inclusive growth of the
Fijian economy.
2.
Economic activity in the lead-up to and after the National Elections in September
2014 remains strong, supported by an expansionary fiscal stance, accommodative
monetary policy and a wide array of structural reforms aimed at creating an environment
conducive to private sector-led investment and job-rich growth. Improved confidence,
together with a holistic and effective macroeconomic management framework have
bolstered private sector investment, strengthened growth prospects and paved the path
towards a stronger and more dynamic economy. Since the conclusion of the Article IV
mission late last year, there have been several major developments, chief amongst which
was the announcement of the 2016 National Budget themed “The Future: A Strong Fiji,
A Fair Fiji, A Healthy Fiji”. This statement provides an update on recent developments
and elaborates on key policy issues for clarification and emphasis.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
3.
Following an expansion of 4.7 percent in 2013 and 5.3 percent in 2014, the Fijian
economy is estimated to have expanded further, albeit at a slower pace of 4.0 percent in
2015. The above-average growth performance over the last three years is attributed to
robust performance across most major sectors, driven by the increase in public and
private investment, strong domestic demand fueled largely by remittance inflows, and a
favorable external environment underlined by high tourism receipts and windfall gains
from low commodity prices. For 2016, the economy is projected to grow by 3.5 percent,
underpinned by positive contributions from the transport, manufacturing, finance, retail
and accommodation sectors. Over the medium term, the authorities concur with staff
assessment that growth is expected to remain strong at around 3-4 percent.
4.
Staff estimates for 2015 are generally in line with the authorities’ own
assessment. Latest indicators suggest that the economy is on-track to achieve the 4.0
percent annual growth forecast. For the second consecutive year, annual tourist arrivals
soared to a new record level in 2015 with a growth of 9.0 percent over the previous peak
in 2014. The sugar industry, despite prolonged dry weather conditions, performed better
than expected. Investment activity remained strong, marked by notable increases in
domestic cement sales, value of construction work put-in-place and a surge in new

lending for investment purposes. Similarly, consumption activity remained robust,
evident by strong Value Added Tax (VAT) collections, higher new lending for
consumption purposes, and an upturn in retail trade. Domestic credit expanded by 13.6
percent in 2015 on account of higher bank lending to the household, real estate,
construction, agricultural, retail trade, and transport & storage sectors. The fiscal deficit
for 2015 is projected to be lower than originally expected, due partly to the slower
implementation of capital projects. With fiscal consolidation planned for the medium
term, government debt of around 47.9 percent of GDP at end-2015 is expected to remain
stable going forward. Reflecting low global commodity prices and below-trend domestic
inflationary outcomes, the headline inflation rate was 1.6 percent at end-2015, 0.4
percentage points below the earlier projection of 2.0 percent. The 3.0 percent headline
inflation rate currently forecast for 2016 is likely to be revised downward due to the
reduction in the VAT rate, changes in excise duties announced in the 2016 National
Budget and persistently low commodity prices. On the external front, foreign reserves
stood at a comfortable level of FJ$1.9 billion, equivalent to 5.9 months of retained
imports. Tourism and remittance inflows are expected to increase further this year and
provide additional buffer for the external sector.
Monetary and Financial Policies
5.
The authorities continued to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance
in 2015, with the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) keeping its overnight policy rate at 0.5
percent, consistent with the assessment on its dual mandate of low inflation and adequate
level of foreign reserves. As a consequence of monetary accommodation, interest rates
over the last few years have trended downwards, contributing to higher private sector
credit growth. The rapid credit growth in the last few years, however, also reflect the
strong economic growth, pent up demand, firm investment activity and improved
business and consumer confidence. Nevertheless, recent data shows that commercial
bank lending and deposit rates edged-up in December, in part due to the decline in
liquidity, further compressing aggregate interest margins that have generally narrowed
for most of 2015. Notably, new bank lending in 2015 slowed sharply, growing by 14.5
percent, compared with 43.2 percent registered in 2014. This triggered a slowdown in the
overall domestic credit growth to 13.6 percent in the year to December compared with
18.7 percent in the corresponding period in 2014.
6.
Financial stability continues to be strengthened and remains a key priority, with
the authorities ensuring, through robust supervisory framework that banks are well
capitalized, hold ample liquidity, have low levels of non-performing loans and operate in
a competitive environment. While the latest financial soundness indicators point to a
robust financial sector, the rapid growth in credit to certain sectors (such as real estate
and private individuals for housing and automobile purposes) and upsurge in house prices
have led to more vigilance by the RBF in monitoring activities of banks. The RBF
remains closely engaged with financial system stakeholders and continues to enhance its

supervisory framework, by undertaking more risk-based assessment of banks, pro-active
on-site supervision, macro-prudential surveys to assess lending conditions and
creditworthiness, regular stress tests, and ongoing training for staff. The central bank is
also closely monitoring non-bank financial institutions and has been recently mandated
by the Government to supervise the operations of credit unions.
7.
Given the favorable outlook on inflation and foreign reserves, the moderation in
credit expansion, and the expected deceleration in growth this year, monetary policy in
the near term will be pragmatically geared towards supporting the economy. The RBF
will continue to closely assess macro and sectoral developments and, if warranted,
implement appropriate macro-prudential tools to curb excesses in the financial system
without bluntly curtailing credit flows.
8.
The authorities recognize the importance of a vibrant and stable financial sector.
In this regard, a Financial Sector Development Plan spearheaded by the RBF in
consultation with industry stakeholders has been finalized and is now awaiting the
government’s endorsement prior to implementation. The plan recognizes key reform
areas for the financial sector and is designed to boost its contribution to growth and
position Fiji as a regional financial hub. As part of broader reform efforts, the RBF is
progressing with, and aims to complete in 2016, the drafting of the Pension Savings Act,
Secured Transactions Act and National Payments Act, jointly with the review of the
Insurance Act 1998 and Credit Union Act 1978. Furthermore, a Macro-prudential
Surveillance Framework that focuses on analyzing the interrelationship between key
players in the financial system and macro-prudential factors such as asset prices was
enhanced in 2015 and will be used for supervisory work going forward.
Fiscal Policy
9.
On the fiscal front, the authorities are committed to fiscal discipline by adopting a
prudent approach that focuses on growing the economy through investment while
ensuring fiscal sustainability. In the last couple of years, the authorities have intensely
focused on addressing infrastructure gaps by raising the ratio of capital to operating
expenditure mix from 14 percent in 2007 to 40 percent in the 2016 budget. Amid this
spending reorientation, sizable resources were also directed to priority sectors of
education, health and social protection, in line with the authorities’ objective of
delivering broad-based inclusive growth.
10.
The 2016 budget strategy continues along this trajectory by prioritizing
investment in infrastructure and containing recurrent expenditure, streamlining the cost of
government while improving the efficiency of public service delivery. The authorities
have also introduced tax reform measures aimed at broadening the tax base, improving
compliance and enhancing collection efficiency. Along these lines, the VAT rate was
reduced from 15 percent to 9 percent, and previous exemptions on selected goods (basic

food items and medicine) were removed. By contrast, the service turnover tax (STT),
which is applicable mostly to the tourism industry and high-end restaurants, has been
raised from 5 percent to 10 percent. An environmental levy of 6 percent will also be
placed on operators currently paying STT. To promote a health conscious public, the tax
rates on tobacco and alcohol has been raised by 12.5 percent while a new Health Levy of
6 percent has also been imposed on the same products. In addition, a 5-cent/liter levy will
be added to sugar sweetened drinks. Along with other changes to the tax regime, the
overall impact is expected to be a revenue gain of FJ$38.5 million. On the expenditure
front, capital spending is budgeted to increase by FJ$18.7 million, with majority of the
allocation for roads and bridge upgrades as well as for improvement in water and sewer
services. The increase in capital expenditure in 2016 also reflects the shift in
implementation of some capital projects from 2015. Likewise, operating expenditure is
projected to be higher, albeit marginally, by 4.4 percent due to higher personnel expenses
arising from the hiring of additional teachers, nurses and doctors.
11.
Moving ahead, the authorities will continue with the prudent management of
fiscal policy by gradually consolidating and ensuring that government finances are
sustainable in the near to medium term, with acceptable deficit levels and low debt
relative to GDP, while still providing the necessary support for higher, broad-based and
inclusive growth.
Exchange Rate and External Balance
12.
Fiji’s small open economy and reliance on trade, tourism and remittance inflows
make it vulnerable to external shocks, particularly to trading partners’ demand and
commodity prices. While there is merit in allowing greater exchange rate flexibility over
the longer term as the economy further develops, the authorities are of the view that in
the present environment, the current exchange rate regime, where the Fiji dollar is linked
to a basket of currencies of the country’s five major trading partners, continues to provide
an important anchor for inflation and benefits Fiji’s trade with a relatively stable
domestic currency. An exchange rate review is undertaken annually and the authorities
will continue to assess the need for moving to a more flexible framework against Fiji’s
macroeconomic position and development needs.
13.
On exchange controls, the authorities will continue to work with staff to bring
these measures in line with requirements under the Fund’s Article VIII. The RBF has
progressively relaxed exchange control measures over the years in line with
improvements in the external position and will continue to loosen policies taking into
consideration external vulnerabilities. In this context, the authorities underscore the
importance of sequencing reform efforts and of the need to gradually liberalize exchange
restrictions in line with broader economic development.

Structural Reforms
14.
The authorities will continue to press ahead with reforms to raise the productive
capacity of the economy, improve the business environment to facilitate private sectorled development and enhance the economy’s competitiveness.
15.
Public sector reform, in collaboration with the World Bank, is progressing and
remains a top priority for authorities. To this effect, the Ministry of Civil Service was
established earlier this year to manage the reform program and maintain central
coordination of key areas that will ensure consistency across the civil service. The Civil
Service Reform Management Unit is operational and is currently developing and
implementing strategic policies to assist Permanent Secretaries in maintaining
consistency and ensuring transparent, accountable management of their respective
Ministries. Furthermore, the authorities have commenced work on a National
Procurement Strategy and Policy, and have centralized the coordination of capital and
climate change projects at the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning. This will bring
about greater transparency, boost efficiency whilst ensuring that projects are administered
in a holistic and well-coordinated manner.
16.
Tax reforms continue to proceed alongside the financial management reform
initiative. The reform plan involves the upgrade of the Fiji Revenue Customs Authority
(FRCA) ICT infrastructure, an aspect of which involves a direct connection to cash
registers of businesses. To improve compliance and minimize distortions in the taxation
system, a number of tax measures have been removed. These include the exemptions on
VAT, Duty Suspension Scheme and stamp duties on small and medium enterprises. The
Short Life Investment Package incentive introduced to accelerate tourism industry
development through tax breaks will be phased out to existing operators by 2017. The
authorities are appreciative to the Fund for all the assistance provided through the Pacific
Financial and Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) on tax related matters.
17.
The authorities recognize that land reform is crucial to unlocking Fiji’s economic
potential. Ongoing development work via the Land Bank initiative and the iTaukei Land
Trust Board is central to making more land available for productive use and ensuring
equitable returns to both the tenant and landlord via long-term leases and market-based
instruments. Hence, a budgetary allocation of FJ$10 million was provided to iTaukei
landowners to subdivide and develop their lands while a further $2.5 million was granted
to the Land Bank Program for its work on increasing the availability of land for
development purposes. In addition, the authorities have undertaken to develop all vacant,
prime, under-utilized state land near urban areas to lease out for productive purposes this
year.

18.
To improve the quality of labor and address skills mismatch, the authorities have
invested heavily in reforming the education system (it receives the second highest
allocation after infrastructure) including mandating free education in primary and
secondary schools, and raising budgetary provisions for tertiary institutions. In addition,
the authorities have introduced the National Toppers Scheme that provides 600 fullyfunded scholarships to priority areas of engineering, health, education, agriculture,
technology, land and environmental studies. Moreover, 11 training colleges were
commissioned across the country, tasked with providing training and short courses in the
areas of the labor market where there are skills mismatch.
19.
The reform of the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), which constitutes 28.0
percent of total financial sector assets, is critical to ensure sustainable returns to
members’ funds and to safeguard financial system stability. The RBF, which supervises
the FNPF, is progressing with the drafting of the Pension Savings Act that will include a
provision for new entrants, enabling competition in the pension fund market. Investment
diversification is also being pursued by FNPF, particularly as it seeks to boost long-term
returns to members by venturing into infrastructure assets and overseas investments. The
authorities are supportive of FNPF’s overseas investment strategy and will continue to
assess and allow such transactions in consideration with the external position of the
economy.
20.
The smallness, isolation and lack of competitive nature of local markets
sometimes exacerbate the negative impact of price increases in commodities on the most
vulnerable segments of the population. To soften the impact on consumers, the authorities
therefore deem market intervention – by adjusting the transmission lag for price changes
through controls – appropriate. Nevertheless, the authorities are aware of the need to
improve price signals in the market and will continue to assess this need by encouraging
competition, scaling back controls where appropriate while ensuring that the low income
segment of the population are not disadvantaged.
21.
The authorities concur with staff that improving data quality will better guide
policy-making. To signal the authorities’ ongoing commitment on this front, appropriate
budgetary allocation have been provided to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) to hire 17
additional staff, strengthen its analytical capacity and develop new economic indicators.
In collaboration with PFTAC, FBOS has released the GDP by Expenditure accounts for
Fiji after a lapse of several years. The Bureau will continue to work with development
partners such as PFTAC, the World Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to
improve statistical analysis and releases.
Final Remarks
22.
The Fijian authorities are committed to the implementation of appropriate
economic policies and further strengthening the reform momentum to ensure that the near

term needs of the economy are met and that macroeconomic stability and sustainable
growth are achieved over the medium to long term.

23.
The authorities acknowledge the support and assistance provided by the Fund,
World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other development partners, particularly the
technical assistance through PFTAC in the area of public financial management, revenue
administration, statistics, financial supervision and macroeconomic analysis. The
authorities will strengthen collaboration and partnership with the Fund, and continue
close engagement through regional forums, training, and surveillance missions.
24.
Finally, the authorities wish to thank the Mission Chief, Mr. Roberto GuimaraesFilho and his team for an insightful analysis and useful policy suggestions presented in
the Staff Report.
