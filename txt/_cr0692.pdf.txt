•

The Article IV and Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) discussions were held in Manila during
November 10-22. The staff team comprised Messrs. Takeda (Head), Gordon, Singh, Brooks, Baqir
(Resident Representative), Ishi (all APD), Seshadri (PDR), and Ms. Zakharova (FAD). Ms. Amador
(OED) joined the discussions.

•

The mission met with senior government officials including Finance Secretary Teves, Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Tetangco, Budget and Management Secretary Neri, Energy
Secretary Lotilla, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Santos, and several legislators including Senate
President Drilon and House Speaker de Venecia, as well as with academics, financial market
participants, and business representatives.

The 2004 Article IV Consultation discussions were concluded on March 7, 2005. Executive
Directors’ views and comments can be found on http://www.imf.org/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0535.htm.

•

The Philippines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Fund's
Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

The authorities are attempting to strengthen the statistical base, which suffers from several
deficiencies that hamper surveillance. The data ROSC published in August 2004 identified national
accounts and balance of payments statistics as particularly weak. With STA assistance, the authorities
have made progress in improving the nonfinancial public sector debt and balance of payments data.

•

The exchange arrangement is classified as an independent float. The BSP intervenes on occasion in
the spot and forward markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate and
to build reserves for strategic purposes.

•

The Philippines is expected to engage in PPM through April 30, 2007. The authorities see benefits
from continuing PPM until the fiscal position strengthens further, even though outstanding borrowing
from the Fund is down to 30 percent of quota. The next PPM mission is expected to take place in
June 2006.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic reforms have moved ahead. The authorities have made important progress with
reforms, most notably with a sharp reduction in power sector losses following large increases
in generation tariffs, and with the passage of a landmark VAT reform law in May 2005. The
reform momentum was interrupted in mid-2005 amid political turbulence. Since then,
however, political uncertainties have receded and the reform momentum has been regained.
A large reduction in the public sector fiscal deficit appears to have been achieved in 2005 and
a further reduction is being targeted for 2006. Meanwhile, important steps have been taken to
strengthen bank balance sheets, although power sector privatization has been delayed.
The discussions took stock of the progress made in reducing short-term vulnerabilities
and in laying the foundations for higher investment and growth. The economy has
displayed considerable resilience to the recent oil price shock and foreign reserves have been
built up to a more comfortable level. However, the investment climate remains weak and the
transition to a higher growth path is not yet assured.
The staff report makes the following recommendations:
•

the next critical milestone is to raise the VAT rate on schedule in February and to ensure
that tax administration is strong enough to collect the new higher VAT liability;

•

after the VAT reform, further fiscal measures will be needed to achieve the authorities’
goal of balancing the budget over the medium term;

•

recent increases in policy rates are welcome and monetary policy should remain vigilant
against possible second-round effects of supply shocks;

•

power sector privatization needs to be accelerated;

•

priority should be given to passing long-overdue legislative amendments necessary to
strengthen bank supervision.

In sum, the challenge is to maintain the reform momentum. Further financial and other
structural reforms are needed to increase the low rate of domestic investment. If reforms
were to stall, the adverse effects of a downward revision by markets of the Philippines’
economic prospects could be substantial, and the opportunity to undertake fundamental
economic reforms created by President Arroyo’s 2004 election victory could close.

-5I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Since mid-2004, when the administration took office, economic reforms have
moved ahead. Two reforms stand out as particularly significant. First, power generation
tariffs were raised so as to substantially cut the National Power Corporation (NPC)’s losses.
Second, the VAT reform law was passed, with the first phase coming into effect in
November 2005. Aided by tight curbs on government spending, the nonfinancial public
sector (NFPS) deficit has been reduced from 5½ percent of GDP in 2003 to an expected
3¼ percent of GDP in 2005. If the second phase of the VAT reform, an increase in the VAT
rate, occurs as scheduled in February, the NFPS deficit should fall further to 2¼ percent of
GDP in 2006. In other sectors, important steps have been taken to strengthen bank balance
sheets, but power sector privatization has been delayed.
2.
The challenge going forward will be to maintain the economic reform
momentum. Economic reforms were temporarily blown off course in mid-2005 by political
turbulence following allegations of wrongdoing against the President. During this period, key
members of the economic team resigned and the VAT reform was suspended by the Supreme
Court. The authorities quickly regrouped and succeeded in keeping fiscal consolidation on
track. Impeachment charges were dismissed by Congress in September, and political
uncertainties have since receded. However, political events such as possible constitutional
change are likely to absorb the attention of legislators during 2006. With vulnerabilities still
high and the investment climate still weak, the remaining reforms should be pursued
vigorously and without delay.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth has slowed in 2005. GDP grew by 4.6 percent y/y in the first three quarters
of 2005, down from 6 percent in 2004. Weak exports and a decline in investment served as a
drag on activity. Private consumption has been supported by surging remittances and, to date,
has shrugged off the effects of high petroleum prices. On the production side, services such
as business process outsourcing (BPO), telecommunication, and tourism remain key growth
drivers. Job growth was limited to 2¼ percent in 2005, insufficient to substantially reduce
unemployment, which remained high at 10.3 percent in the fourth quarter.

4.
The balance of payments has been in surplus. Exports grew by only 2½ percent in
the first 11 months of 2005 (y/y), weighed down by anemic electronics exports which are not
benefiting from the regional recovery (Chart). Oil-related imports are estimated to have been

-6$1.3 billion higher in 2005 than in 2004; however, this was offset by a decline in non-oil
imports and a jump in remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). There have also
been sizable equity inflows, while the government has successfully tapped sovereign bond
markets, most recently with a $2.1 billion issue in early January. Foreign reserves (adjusted
for pledged assets) were $18.0 billion at end-2005, $2.8 billion above the end-2004 level.

Markets have been volatile, but
have reacted positively to the better fiscal news. The stock market has risen by 8 percent in
peso terms, and the peso has strengthened by 4 percent against the U.S. dollar, since the
November 1 implementation of the first stage of the VAT reform.
7.
Inflation has risen, and monetary policy has been tightened. Due in large part to
the oil price shock, inflation rose to 8.5 percent in April 2005 y/y, but with base effects
coming off, declined to 6.6 percent by December. Nonetheless, inflation averaged 7.6 percent
in 2005, well above the target range of 5-6 percent. Monetary aggregates have grown at
annual rates of 14 percent, driven primarily by the accumulation of net foreign assets. The
authorities raised policy rates in April, September, and October (25 bps each to 7.50 percent),
and also increased reserve requirements in July.

Development Goals, especially those related to child malnutrition and maternal mortality (Annex VI).

-8A. Managing Short-Term Vulnerabilities
9.
Soaring oil prices presented a major challenge for the VAT reform. With the
petroleum sector deregulated since 1998, the jump in oil prices immediately translated into
higher domestic prices. This complicated the VAT reform, since a central component was to
extend VAT to energy products. However, the authorities resisted attempts by Congress to
re-exempt power and petroleum products from the VAT for fear that the whole VAT reform
package would unravel. Nonetheless, to mitigate the impact on the poor, the authorities
introduced measures such as a reduction in oil import duties and lower petroleum excises.
The authorities regarded these measures as critical to maintaining political support for the
reform. The VAT base expansion was made easier by the softening of international oil prices
in November and the appreciation of the peso.
10.
Staff welcomed the progress made with reducing vulnerabilities. The relatively
smooth introduction of the VAT reform to date owed much to the authorities’
communication efforts to explain the mitigating measures that were being taken. The
authorities’ commitment to increasing the VAT rate from February 1, 2006 was also
welcome (Box 1). Markets had already responded positively, and, if the VAT reform was
fully implemented and delivered the envisaged revenue, sentiment could improve further.
Staff noted that the more comfortable level of reserves would allow the government to tilt its
borrowing mix more toward domestic financing. The authorities agreed, noting that the BSP
was already reducing its foreign borrowing, and there might be scope for the government to
do likewise in 2006.
11.
Higher oil prices had also posed challenges for the monetary authorities. Inflation,
already above target on account of supply shocks in 2004, stayed high during 2005 as a result
of the further rise in oil prices. The authorities tightened monetary policy out of concern that
continued above-target inflation would increase inflation expectations at a time when liquidity
was growing rapidly and interest differentials had narrowed. With regard to liquidity growth,
staff questioned whether one-off factors related to regulatory changes might be overstating M3
growth in 2005. However, the authorities considered such factors to be a relatively minor
explanation of high liquidity growth compared to the increase in net foreign assets.
12.
Steps have been taken to reduce vulnerabilities in the financial system. Some
banks in the Philippines are weak and undercapitalized, while others have been intervened
and are being rehabilitated. The authorities have strengthened prudential regulations, but
continue to be hamstrung by the lack of legal protection for bank supervisors. Amendments
to remedy this weakness were tabled in Congress in 2004, but have yet to achieve any
traction. Nonetheless, solid progress has been made under the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
framework, with banks selling one fifth of their stock of NPAs. Consolidation of the banking
system has also moved ahead, with a number of deals recently concluded, while one large
intervened bank, the Philippine National Bank (PNB), has been privatized. A new soft spot
has recently emerged in the pre-need sector, with several firms experiencing financial
distress (Box 2). However, with only one such firm having a direct link with a bank, the
authorities did not perceive this as a systemic risk.
13.
The vulnerabilities that remain weigh on the outlook. Staff expected growth to be
little changed at about 5 percent in 2006. There was upside to this projection if private
investment was to respond strongly to continued progress with reforms and the better

-9macroeconomic environment. On the other hand, growth might be lower if the negative
effects of the VAT reform on consumption were larger than expected and oil price effects
were still to come. The heavy reliance on external commercial borrowing also put the
Philippines at risk should there be a reversal of the currently benign financing environment in
emerging markets, perhaps reflecting higher risk aversion or a disorderly resolution of global
imbalances. Avian flu posed another risk and although there had yet to be a case in the
Philippines, the authorities indicated that they had developed a contingency plan.
14.
Extension of Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) was discussed against this
background. The Philippines is currently expected to engage in PPM through April 30,
2006. Even though outstanding Fund credit is down to 30 percent of quota, and the fiscal
position has improved, the authorities see benefits from continuing PPM for a further year
through April 30, 2007.
B. Laying the Foundations for Higher Investment and Growth
15.
The medium-term outlook depends on the pace of reforms. Higher economic
growth will require increases in investment and productivity. Foreign direct investment,
currently at very low levels, can play an important role in achieving both objectives. Staff
have prepared two scenarios for the medium term that differ depending on the pace of
reform. In the first scenario (Table 5), which is the staff’s recommended scenario, reforms
proceed beyond the VAT reform and include tax measures additional to those the authorities
are currently contemplating, as well as bold measures to improve the investment climate. In
such a world, investment increases by 5½ percentage points of GDP, raising growth to
6½ percent and pushing the unemployment rate down to single digits. The authorities achieve
their objective of balancing the budget over the medium term and the debt dynamics become
highly favorable. On the other hand, if reforms were to stall─the VAT reform is not fully
implemented and the deficit is reduced no further than the 2005 level─the outlook for
investment and growth would be less rosy. Table 6 shows a scenario where growth declines,
unemployment increases over time, and debt sustainability is far from assured. So as to
illustrate that vulnerabilities would remain very high if reforms were to stall, the Debt
Sustainability Analysis is presented for this scenario (Annex I).
16.
Improving the investment
climate is critical. The authorities
recognized that competition from China
and the region explained some of the
recent weakness in export growth,
particularly in the electronics sector.
This situation does not seem to
primarily reflect an overvalued
exchange rate, as this is rarely cited as a
factor impeding investment in the
Philippines (Chart). Rather, in
explaining the relative unattractiveness
of the Philippines as an investment
destination, investors tend to emphasize: (i) macro-instability and the unsustainable fiscal
position; (ii) poor infrastructure and power sector problems; (iii) financial market constraints;

- 10 and (iv) corruption and governance.2 The discussions covered each of these impediments to
investment:
(i) ensuring fiscal sustainability and macro stability
17.
The fiscal position will be strengthened further in 2006. Provided that the VAT
rate is increased as planned, the NFPS deficit is projected to fall to 2.3 percent of GDP in
2006. While applauding this adjustment, which would amount to over 3 percentage points of
GDP since 2003, staff noted that the outlook was subject to several risks. First, VAT
collections may be lower than expected, particularly if there is a delay in raising the rate, or
there are administrative difficulties in collecting the new tax. Second, the food subsidy
provided by the National Food Authority (NFA) might increase substantially if prices of
imported rice continue to rise and the prices at which NFA sells imported rice to consumers
are not adjusted.3 Third, the financial position of local government units (LGUs) may weaken
in the run up to the 2007 local elections. In response, the authorities agreed that NFA’s
finances required close scrutiny, but considered local governments to be a low fiscal risk.
18.
The authorities plan to eliminate the remaining fiscal deficit over time. While
welcoming the authorities’ intention to balance the budget during the term of the
administration, staff cautioned that this would require additional fiscal measures. Possible
options included the rationalization of tax incentives and raising and indexing excise taxes.
The authorities noted that a fiscal incentive bill was already before Congress, although they
recognized that this would yield limited revenue in its present form. In any case, their
strategy was to first strengthen tax administration before going to Congress with requests for
more tax measures.
19.
The authorities' strategy to rely primarily on tax administration to close the
remaining fiscal gap highlights the pressing need to increase collection efficiency.
Improving tax compliance is particularly important in the Philippines because tax policy
measures have often been strongly opposed as inequitable because they imply collecting
more from those who are already paying tax. It is therefore critical for the Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR) to broaden the tax net by strengthening taxpayer registration, addressing stop
filer problems, and formulating better audit strategies. The Bureau of Customs (BOC) needs
to make better use of information and communication technologies to improve efficiency and
reduce discretion. But going beyond these technical changes, what is needed, both for BIR
and BOC, is to institute better management and incentive systems, so that tax officers will be

These factors are also recognized as constraints on investment in the MTPDP (see Box 2 in IMF
Country Report No. 05/105). A recent survey by McKinsey shows that similar factors account for the
Philippines being ranked below India and Vietnam as a destination for BPO operations.

- 11 properly motivated to pursue sustainable and equitable tax collection, instead of short-term
revenue gains.4
20.
The discussions covered other medium-term fiscal issues. One challenge was to
ensure that the GOCCs do not undermine the fiscal consolidation effort. To this end, staff
argued for the development of medium-term deficit targets for individual enterprises. The
authorities’ preferred strategy was to closely monitor the most important enterprises,
including NPC and NFA, and then to extend the process to all 14 GOCCs.5 With regard to
the pension funds, preliminary estimates from an actuarial review show that the Social
Security System (SSS) may run out of assets in 2027, which is later than previously
estimated. Nevertheless, to ensure long term solvency, the contribution rate will need to be
gradually increased over time. Staff welcomed SSS’s plans to strengthen its investment
strategy and improve collection efficiency including by intensifying audits and reducing
fraudulent claims.
21.
The inflation targeting framework is key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. Staff welcomed recent policy rate increases. The absence of strong signs that
inflation had become more generalized suggested that monetary policy had so far been
effective in limiting the inflation caused by supply shocks to first round effects.6 Assuming
that there were no further shocks, and that the recent strengthening of the exchange rate is
sustained, staff expect that inflation will return to the target range in 2007 (4-5 percent).
Upside risks to this forecast include second-round effects from the VAT reform, further
increases in international oil prices, or a delay in reforms that serves to weaken the exchange
rate. By contrast, in the event of full implementation of the VAT reform, a more pronounced
rally in the peso could bring inflation back within target more quickly.

A joint Fund/World Bank mission recently provided technical assistance in the areas of tax and customs
administration. The authorities are studying the mission’s recommendations, including those listed above,
with a view to developing a comprehensive plan for improving collection efficiency.

5

Staff discussed with the authorities the scope for improving the coverage of public enterprises in the
fiscal statistics. The authorities were of the view that the current coverage is adequate and that all
public enterprises that present fiscal risks are currently covered among the 14 monitored GOCCs.
6

See Box 3.

- 12 22.
The authorities indicated that monetary policy would remain vigilant. Continued
rapid liquidity growth and narrow interest differentials were viewed as risks to the inflation
outlook, although the authorities noted that some offset was being provided by the existing
slack in the economy. Staff observed that interest differentials would be a particular concern
if reforms were to stall, since in such a scenario the risk premium was likely to rise. More
generally, the authorities assured staff that they stood ready to raise rates again should the
inflation forecast look less favorable.
(ii) improving infrastructure and power sector reform
23.
Fiscal reforms should create space within the budget for increased
infrastructure spending. Pressure on the budget has led to public investment falling sharply
in recent years, and the poor quality of infrastructure is cited as a deterrent by investors.
Infrastructure investment is likely to have high returns, particularly in tourism, as well as in
mining (where a Supreme Court ruling in early 2005 allowing foreign control of projects has
opened the way for foreign investment). The authorities are appropriately allocating a portion
of the proceeds from the VAT reform to boosting capital expenditure as well as social
spending and the Reforms Proceed scenario considered by staff envisages public investment
rising from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 3.1 percent of GDP by 2007.
24.
Progress with power sector reform had been mixed. Given the importance of
sustaining the turn-around in NPC’s finances, staff welcomed the proposal for a new
generation rate adjustment mechanism to recover fluctuations of fuel costs in a timely way.
Privatization remained key to ensuring adequate investment in the power sector and thus to
avoiding future supply shortages. However, the authorities have made little headway in
selling power sector assets (Box 4). The deadline for rebidding the concession for the
transmission company (Transco) has been postponed to the second quarter of 2006, and the
deadline for the sale of 70 percent of generation assets (Gencos) has been pushed out by six
months to June 2006. The recent decline in electricity demand (in response to the hikes in
tariffs) has provided the authorities with some respite since it now appears that power supply
shortages will not re-emerge until the early 2010s. Nonetheless, given that power projects
have long gestation periods, staff argued that privatization should remain a top priority.

25.
The prospects for power sector reform are uncertain. The authorities plan to
introduce the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM) in early 2006, followed by open
access (retail competition), although under the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA),
this is contingent on 70 percent of Gencos being privatized. The authorities explained that

- 13 slow progress with Gencos privatization partly reflected difficulties in concluding power
supply contracts between NPC and distributors, as well as uncertainty about the prospects for
market reforms such as WESM and open access. As a measure to accelerate privatization the
authorities were considering selling Gencos contingent on the implementation of open
access. Staff, however, argued that a successful Transco sale might break the current
deadlock.
(iii) strengthening and deepening financial markets
26.
The cost and availability of financing are additional constraints on investment.
The banking system has a high cost-to-income ratio and low profitability, which hampers the
needed provisioning for the large holdings of NPAs and keeps spreads fairly high. The
significant level of NPAs also tends to inhibit bank lending. As a result, loans have only
grown in nominal terms by about 3 percent on average annually over the last five years,
implying limited private sector access to bank financing. The authorities have undertaken a
number of initiatives to strengthen bank balance sheets, notably by reinforcing the
supervisory framework and by granting regulatory and tax advantages through the Special
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) framework to banks disposing of their NPAs. To stimulate nonbank
financing, the authorities have drawn up a legislative agenda to develop domestic capital
markets.
27.
The SPV framework has reduced NPAs, but some banks remain weak. Sales of
distressed assets to SPVs have amounted to P 97 billion to date, leading to a decline in the
NPA ratio from 26.2 percent in June 2004 to 20.6 percent in June 2005. The authorities
regarded the expiration of the SPV framework in April 2005 as a factor behind the surge in
transactions in early 2005 and noted that the prospective implementation of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) had also encouraged deals. Extending the SPV
framework was therefore important.7 However, discounts on NPA sales have averaged
76 percent to date, and as provided for under the SPV framework, banks can stagger loss
recognition over ten years for the purpose of complying with regulatory capital requirements.
Staff stressed the importance of deferred losses being shown transparently in financial
statements.
28.
More substantial progress in fortifying the banking system will require
strengthening the powers of supervisors. Staff expressed concern about the lack of speed
with which amendments to the BSP charter to strengthen legal protection for supervisors and
the PCA framework were moving in Congress. The authorities acknowledged that it might
still take some time for the amendments to be passed. They were therefore trying to
strengthen supervisory procedures and evidence gathering to maximize the chances of
winning any lawsuits that were filed against bank supervisors.
29.
Effective enforcement of the IFRS provides an opportunity for bank
recapitalization. With effect from the period beginning January 2005, the annual financial
statements of banks are required to comply with IFRS. The authorities noted that the rules
7

The Lower House passed a bill extending the SPV framework for an additional two years in
December.

- 14 governing loan loss reserves, deferred tax assets and more rigorous valuation of foreclosed
real estate properties were likely to have significant implications for certain banks. At the
time of the mission, banks were carrying out simulations to assess the likely impact on
reported earnings and capital. The BSP was considering whether to provide regulatory relief
to any banks that need time to comply. Staff stressed that any such relief should be
conditional on a clear recapitalization plan and again should be transparent to markets.
30.
Steps are being taken to develop the domestic capital market. A centralized
electronic marketplace for domestic fixed income securities was opened in March 2005. The
authorities have given high priority to passing the Corporate Recovery Act, which aims to
rationalize the rules guiding the recovery of financially distressed enterprises and allows for
the appointment of a conservator. A Credit Information System Act is under discussion in
Congress and would create a credit information bureau to help foster transparency in the
market. A Personal Equity and Retirement Account Bill, which would promote retirement
savings, is also pending before Congress. But greater efforts are needed to develop nonbank
channels of financial intermediation and thereby facilitate investment.
(iv) improving governance
31.
The authorities have taken a number of anti-corruption steps. Transparency
International (TI) has consistently ranked the Philippines in the worst one third of countries
in terms of perceived corruption. Moreover, a deterioration in tax administration is regarded
by many analysts as a major cause of the decline in the tax/GDP ratio over the last seven
years, and hence of the current fiscal problems. The MTPDP recognizes that the Philippines’
ability to attract investment requires building an effective government free of corruption.
Indeed, a system of lifestyle checks on government officials was introduced in 2003 to
reduce opportunities for misconduct by revenue collecting agencies. In addition, the
Government Procurement Reform Act was passed in 2003 with the aim of promoting
competitive bidding and transparency and accountability in government procurement.
32.
Progress, however, is difficult to measure. There may have been some gains in
reducing procurement costs over the past year, but how large is unclear. There is also some
evidence suggesting that bribe taking has become less prevalent in recent years, although this
is yet to be confirmed by the TI indicators of perceived corruption. With regard to tax
administration, staff encouraged the authorities to recreate the atmosphere of heightened
enforcement that had existed in the second quarter of 2005, but which seemed to have
dissipated during the political turbulence in mid year.
33.
Civil service reform has been initiated. A Government Rationalization Program
was launched in 2005 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government. Eight
government agencies and one GOCC have submitted their rationalization plans for review by
the Department of Budget and Management and other relevant agencies, and two of these
plans were approved in September. Separated personnel will be given an option of
reassignment to other agencies or availing of separation benefits. Over the medium term, if
all identified employees choose to separate from the civil service, the government expects to
realize annual savings of about 0.1 percent of GDP.
34.
Progress has been made with AML/CFT. The Philippines continues to be
monitored by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as part of its standard monitoring

- 15 procedure for delisted Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs). Staff welcomed
the progress made in two areas of concern for the FATF, namely streamlining the reporting
of suspicious transactions and accelerating the processing of cases.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Recent events have lifted sentiment. The authorities deserve credit for steadying the
economic ship after the political turbulence experienced in mid-2005. With the first phase of
the VAT reform now implemented, and a clear commitment made to raising the VAT rate in
February 2006, the reform momentum has been regained for now.
36.
But the momentum needs to be sustained in the period ahead. Progress with
reforms appears to have already been priced in to some extent by markets. There might thus
be a significant correction if reforms were to be interrupted again. Other near-term risks to
the economy arise from possible further spikes in oil prices or an outbreak of Avian flu. In
light of continued high debt levels, the Philippines is also especially vulnerable to a sudden
end to the current benign external financing environment. Completing the agenda for fiscal
and other structural reforms should make a material difference to the economy’s ability to
absorb such shocks.
37.
A significant improvement in the investment climate is essential to set the stage
for higher economic growth and substantial reductions in poverty. Staff do not view the
level of the exchange rate as a threat to medium-term competitiveness. Rather, what is
needed to improve the investment climate is a stable macroeconomic environment, increased
infrastructure investment, a strengthened financial system, and improved governance.
Immediate priorities are to raise the VAT rate in February, accelerate power sector
privatization, and pass legislation strengthening bank supervision.
38.
Sizable fiscal consolidation is underway. Tight control was maintained over
expenditure in 2005 and the tax-GDP ratio looks set to rise after many years of decline. With
the financial position of NPC and the SSIs also much improved, the NFPS deficit is
estimated to have declined to 3¼ percent of GDP in 2005, an adjustment of 2½ percentage of
points of GDP over the past two years. After raising the VAT rate in February, the authorities
need to ensure that tax administration is strong enough to collect commensurately higher
VAT revenue. Providing that this happens, the NFPS deficit is set to fall further to
2¼ percent of GDP in 2006.
39.
Balancing the budget over the medium-term will require additional measures.
Gains from improved tax administration and interest savings are unlikely to eliminate the
NFPS deficit of 2-2½ percent of GDP that will remain after the VAT reform is implemented.
While strengthening tax administration remains a pressing need, additional tax policy
measures will also be necessary, such as a more ambitious rationalization of tax incentives
than is currently being considered.
40.
Other parts of the public sector should support fiscal consolidation. The
authorities are planning to closely monitor important GOCCs: priorities will be to ensure that
the turn around in NPC’s finances is sustained, and that poorly targeted food subsidies do not
lead to large losses at NFA. The solvency of the pension funds will be enhanced by
strengthened investment strategies and improved collections of contributions.

- 16 41.
Inflation risks remain. In the absence of further shocks, inflation is projected to
return to target by 2007, but this outcome is far from assured. Risks to the outlook include
possible second-round effects from current shocks such as the VAT reform. However, the
recent rate actions by the BSP inspire confidence that rates will be raised again should the
inflation forecast look less favorable. On the other hand, if sentiment continues to improve,
higher capital inflows may put upward pressure on the peso and inflation could return to
target more rapidly. Given the improved foreign reserve cover, the authorities can offset
incipient peso strength by using dollars bought from the market to substitute for external
borrowing.
42.
Power sector privatization should be accelerated. Re-bidding for the Transco
concession has been postponed, while far fewer Gencos have been sold by this stage than
was planned. If needed investment in the power sector is to be made, the challenge is to shift
sufficient power sector assets into private hands. This will require reducing the uncertainties
that are deterring potential deals. Successful bidding of Transco might break this deadlock.
43.
There have been positive developments in the banking system. The SPV
framework has induced banks to take steps to resolve a portion of the stock of bad assets and
bank consolidation is underway. However, the banking sector remains fragmented with some
banks undercapitalized, and the level of NPAs continues to be high. While an extension to
the SPV framework is warranted, greater pressure needs to be exerted on weak banks to raise
capital and encourage mergers.
44.
Passage of the amendments to the BSP Charter remains critical. The proposed
amendments would strengthen the PCA framework and legal protections for bank
supervisors, thus fortifying the BSP’s ability to deal with distressed banks. However, these
proposals have made little progress through Congress over the last few years. Greater efforts
must be made to pass these amendments so as to permit a durable strengthening of the
banking system.
45.
Effective implementation of IFRS should promote bank recapitalization. The
BSP should clarify the conditions under which regulatory relief might be granted to banks
significantly affected by the introduction of IFRS. Such relief should be granted transparently
and conditional on a clear recapitalization plan. Certain banks will also be carrying large
deferred losses from NPA sales under the SPV framework. IFRS will make these losses
transparent to investors, which underscores the urgency of banks raising fresh capital.
46.
There is a need for further financial market development. The authorities should
give priority to advancing the various legislative initiatives to develop domestic capital
markets. The financial difficulties being experienced by pre-need firms are probably not a
systemic concern, but illustrate the need to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory
framework for the industry. On AML/CFT, while noting the FATF’s continued monitoring of
the Philippines, staff welcomes the progress being made with streamlining the reporting of
suspicious transactions and accelerating the processing of cases.

- 17 47.
Data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, although staff’s
analysis continues to be affected by certain deficiencies in the data. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to address these shortcomings, particularly those in the balance of
payments data.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with the Philippines be
held on the standard 12-month cycle. Continuation of PPM is recommended for an
additional year in light of the still vulnerable fiscal position.

- 18 -

Box 1. The Status of Fiscal Reforms
Over the past year, the Philippine authorities have made commendable progress in advancing
fiscal reforms. Since September 2004, power generation tariffs have been raised by over 50 percent.
In December 2004, excises on alcohol and tobacco products were increased by 30 percent on average,
while duties on imports of oil products were raised from 3 to 5 percent.1 Congress also passed the
Lateral Attrition Bill intended to provide financial incentives for tax collectors to meet revenue
targets. The centerpiece of the authorities’ reform agenda is the VAT reform law. Implementation of
the first stage (extending the VAT base to power and petroleum products) began on November 1,
2005 a few weeks after the Supreme Court declared the law to be constitutional.
When fully implemented, the VAT reform is expected to yield 1.4 percent of GDP in revenue
annually. In addition to base broadening measures, the law gives the President authority to raise the
VAT rate from 10 to 12 percent in 2006; the authorities are planning to implement this increase on

1/ Fund staff estimates.
The remaining near-term fiscal reform agenda includes the passage of three pieces of
legislation. The first piece, a bill tackling the proliferation of fiscal incentives, has the highest
revenue potential. However, the version before Congress has only a limited revenue impact; while the
bill reduces the scope of some incentives, it also appears to extend existing incentives to cover a
broader range of activities. The second bill proposes simplified (net income) taxation of the selfemployed (SNITs) and contains a number of useful provisions that could simplify tax compliance and
limit abuse, although they are unlikely to result in a significant revenue gain. Finally, a fiscal
responsibility bill introduces measures to reduce unfunded expenditures and imposes public debt
limits.

This measure was subsequently reversed to mitigate the impact of the VAT reform on fuel prices.

The VAT reform law provides for a VAT rate increase from January 2006 if VAT collections as a percentage of GDP
exceed 2.8 percent, or if the fiscal deficit exceeds 1.5 percent of GDP. Both conditions already look likely to have been met
in 2005. However, the authorities have chosen to wait until February to raise the rate so as to minimize the chances of legal
challenges that the data are too preliminary to tell whether the conditions in fact hold.

- 19 Box 2. The Pre-Need Industry
The pre-need industry in the Philippines offers a popular saving instrument. The sector
consists of nonbank financial institutions that cater for households who want to pre-finance
future expenditure such as their children’s education. First introduced in 1966, pre-need plans
have become a particularly popular savings instrument. As of end-December 2004, the
sector’s assets amounted to 3.3 percent of GDP (equivalent to 4 percent of banking sector
assets), with 4 million plans outstanding.
The industry is facing financial difficulties. The

cover their growing liabilities by using the
proceeds from the sale of new plans to service
maturing obligations. The sale of “traditional” contracts has been discontinued and some firms
have been denied licenses to sell new plans, but existing obligations still need to be met.
The regulatory framework and supervision have been strengthened. The Security and
Exchange Commission (SEC), which is responsible for regulating the sector, has issued
guidelines to improve actuarial assumptions and has imposed tighter accounting standards.
Restrictions were introduced on the investments made by pre-need companies and minimum
paid-up capital was increased. In addition, on-site inspections were initiated and stricter
compliance with reporting requirements was sought.
Further steps, however, are necessary. According to some observers, plan holders need
greater protection, and restrictions on investments should be further tightened, with connected
lending forbidden. The high commissions and operational costs–up to 49 percent of a plan
holder’s contribution–also need to be reviewed. A proposed Pre-Need Code is under
consideration in Congress and would provide a specific legal framework for the sector,
rationalizing its current regulatory environment. Furthermore, SEC’s resources and
enforcement powers probably need to be strengthened.

- 20 Box 3. Assessing the Monetary Policy Stance
The BSP has been less aggressive than other
central banks in the region in raising policy
rates. Since the start of the current tightening
cycle—the Fed began its series of rate hikes in June
2004—the BSP has raised policy rates by a
cumulative 0.75 percent, compared with
5.50 percent in Indonesia and 3.00 percent in
Thailand (Figure 1). This might be interpreted as
implying that the BSP is behind the curve in the
current tightening cycle, especially given the surge
in oil prices during 2005.

However, several considerations suggest that the
BSP’s policy stance is appropriate for now. One
measure of whether the policy stance is appropriate is
the real interest rate, measured as the overnight
borrowing rate minus core inflation. This indicator
suggests that the policy stance tightened substantially
in the course of 2005, due to falling core inflation and
recent rate hikes (Figure 2). In addition, domestic
demand in the Philippines has weakened (Figure 3),
largely due to a fall in investment (excluding
inventories). Going forward, weak electronics exports
suggest investment may stay weak, while
implementation of the VAT reform may also weaken
private consumption. Demand-led inflation is thus
unlikely to be a factor in the near-term.
Nonetheless, the interest differential versus the U.S.
has narrowed, a risk factor if the reform momentum
stalls. Up until September 2004, the BSP’s overnight
borrowing rate exceeded the Federal Funds rate by more
than 5 percent (Figure 4). As of December 2005, this
differential measured 3.25 percent. This decline may be
sustainable if ongoing fiscal consolidation results in
a lower risk premium for the Philippines. If reforms
stall, however, the narrow interest differential could
become a risk factor, if it leads to a rise in inflation
expectations via anticipated weakening of the
exchange rate. A further risk is the possible
emergence of second-round effects from past supply
shocks and the implementation of the VAT reform.

Progress has been mixed. Positive developments
include putting in place a new institutional framework
and raising generation tariffs to close to full-cost
recovery levels. Moreover, the Wholesale Electricity
Spot Market (WESM) is ready for operation beginning
early 2006. However, the privatization program has
been delayed. Bidding for the transmission assets
(Transco) concession has been continuously postponed
over the last year with repeated changes made to the
bidding strategy, while the delays in selling generation
assets (Gencos) apparently reflect limited investor
interest.
Several factors may explain the difficulty in
advancing privatization. First, global investment in the
power sector has remained subdued since 1997. Second,
the transition of the Philippine power sector to a
competitive market structure is raising concerns among
investors about risks such as a possible malfunctioning
of the prospective spot market. The signing of power
supply contracts, which are intended to help mitigate
transition risks, has been delayed, because distribution
utilities are concerned about the effects of market
reform on their business. Third, the investment climate
in the Philippines is perceived to be relatively
inhospitable. Market analysts partly attribute the limited
investor interest to the heightened political noise during
2005.
Demonstration of the government’s commitment to
reform might break the current deadlock. For
example, successful bidding for the Transco concession
might send a signal to investors about the government’s
commitment to greater private sector participation in the
power sector. Smooth introduction of WESM could raise
investor confidence and resolve some uncertainties
associated with market reform. More generally, steady
progress toward the establishment of a competitive
market structure—which itself requires an improvement
in the regulatory environment—might be viewed by
investors as a factor that strengthens the investment
climate in the power sector.

ANNEX I

PHILIPPINES: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The sustainability of the Philippines’ public sector debt depends largely on the strength
of future reforms:
•

Reforms Stall. The scenario where there are no further reforms after 2005 (Table 6)
is considered as the baseline for the Debt Sustainability Analysis (Table A1). In this
scenario, nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt would remain high at 83.6 percent
of GDP in 2010. This is predicated on an assumed average real GDP growth of
4.4 percent over 2005-10 and a primary balance adjustment of about 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2005, reflecting the recent increases in electricity tariffs and in alcohol and
tobacco excises, as well as better-than-expected performance of social security
institutions.

•

Reforms Proceed. Under staff’s recommended scenario (Table 5), reforms would
continue after 2005, beginning with full implementation of the VAT reform in 2006.
In such a world, public sector debt would be placed on a firmly downward path. This
scenario assumes that a stronger primary balance adjustment of 2.6 percentage points
of GDP over 2005-07 would improve debt dynamics both directly and indirectly,
assuming that improved confidence and higher private sector investment would raise
average real GDP growth to 5.5 percent.

•

Reforms Reverse. Alternatively, reforms might reverse leading to an unwinding of
progress made in reducing the fiscal deficit in 2004 and 2005. Under the assumption
that the NFPS primary balance returns to its 2004 level, and that GDP growth
averages 3.8 percent over 2005-2010, debt would begin to climb again.

Future shocks could adversely affect debt dynamics. Under the Reforms Stall scenario,
the Bounds Tests indicate considerable sensitivity of the projected debt ratio to shocks,
especially to the exchange rate and growth. In contrast, debt dynamics would be more
resilient if strong and front-loaded reforms were adopted.
Reducing external vulnerabilities is also strongly dependent on the success of the
reform effort. In the Reforms Stall scenario, external debt would remain high, steadying at
59.2 percent of GDP by 2010, while external financing requirements would remain large at
11 percent of GDP. In the scenario where reforms proceed, external vulnerabilities would be
reduced much more markedly, with nearly twice the reduction in external debt. This is due in
part to larger FDI into export oriented sectors leading to stronger balance of payments
surpluses, taking the external debt level down to 47.5 percent of GDP.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social security institutions, and local governments. Debt is gross and consolidated
(net of intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt). Data on local government debt are not available for 2001; it is assumed that these debts were the same as a share of GDP as in 2002.
2/ Revenue is the sum of all nonfinancial public sector revenue net of intra-public sector payments. It is assumed that 80 percent of Bureau of Treasury revenue represents interest and dividends from other
parts of the nonfinancial public sector.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 9/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

Exchange Arrangement:

The exchange arrangement is classified as an independent float. The value of the Philippine
peso is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes
on occasion in the spot and forward markets in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations
in the exchange rate.
From November 1995 to June 1997 the peso was effectively fixed at around P 26.2–
P 26.4 per U.S. dollar. On July 11, 1997, the peso depreciated to P 29.45 per U.S. dollar
following an announcement by the central bank that the peso would be allowed to find its
own level. Since then, it has gradually depreciated; during the last few months, it has
fluctuated from P 52–55 per U.S. dollar.

efforts being made by the new administration to lay out a comprehensive package of reforms
aimed at addressing the country’s long-standing problems in the fiscal, power, and banking
sectors, and in reducing the high debt levels. They praised the authorities’ commitment to
win the necessary political support for key reform measures, and were encouraged by a
number of recent developments, including the passage of the bill raising alcohol and tobacco
excises, and the provisional tariff increase awarded to NPC.

ANNEX III

PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. World Bank Lending and Non-Lending Activities
Since the World Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed $9.6 billion
under IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (less cancellations) of which
$9.2 billion has been disbursed. As of June 30, 2005, the current Philippines portfolio
consisted of 22 projects, amounting to $1.14 billion (net of cancellations). Based on net
commitments and by sector, the portfolio can be broken down as follows: rural
development ($352 million, 31 percent); human development ($328 million, 29 percent);
infrastructure ($407 million, 35 percent); environment ($35 million, 3 percent); and
governance and economic management ($22 million, 2 percent). During FY05, the Bank
approved three loans for a total of $99 million: Women’s Health II ($16 million), Land
Administration and Management Project II ($19 million), and Manila Third Sewerage
Project ($64 million).
The overarching objective of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Philippines is to improve the lives of Filipinos through sustainable economic growth and
greater social inclusion. Fiscal stability and public institutions that serve the common
good are critical to these objectives. The strategy supports “Islands of Good Governance”
in those government agencies, local governments, and dynamic sectors in the Philippines
that demonstrate how improved accountability and service delivery will lead to better
economic and social outcomes. The CAS seeks to align Bank lending more closely with
the government’s own investment priorities, within the existing national budget, implying
a shift away from financing discrete projects toward programmatic engagement. The
approach also encourages local government units to pursue and finance their own
priorities and to foster a better partnership with the national government. The CAS sets
forth a lending program of up to $1.8 billion for the FY06-08 period. The actual lending
level will be determined by progress on fiscal reforms and country demand.
An important aspect of Bank support to the Philippines is in the form of non-lending
activities. These activities focus on six themes emphasized by the Bank’s current assistance
strategy: fiscal reform; growth and the investment climate; social development and inclusion,
social protection, and poverty; governance, political economy reform, and anti-corruption;
local government units, municipal finance, and fiscal decentralization; and meeting
infrastructure needs. Recent examples of non-lending outputs include a Decentralization and
Service Delivery Report; Development Policy Review; an Investment Climate Assessment;
and a report on Meeting Infrastructure Needs.
In addition to analytical work, the Bank also provides technical assistance to the
Philippines, frequently supported by trust funds such as the Institutional Development

- 44 -

Fund (IDF) and the Bank-managed ASEM Trust Fund.8 In addition, technical assistance
funded by the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant Facility helps the
client prepare lending operations. In FY05 trust funds supported studies, project
preparation, capacity building and technical assistance in such areas as: pension reform,
international competitiveness, banking supervision, procurement reform, financial
management capacity, corporate governance, community managed agrarian reform, public
sector strengthening, poverty mapping, and rural power.
The Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge
sharing. Currently there are eight Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around
the country that make available Bank publications and development literature either
through on-line access or through hard copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian
Institute of Management (AIM) to create a Global Distance Learning Network that offers
distance learning sessions for a broad national, regional, and international audience. In
addition, the Bank also maintains an external country website (www.worldbank.org.ph).
B. Consultative Group
The Philippine Development Forum (PDF), formerly called the Consultative Group (CG),
is next scheduled to convene during the first half of 2006 in the Philippines. The Bank will
co-chair the meeting with the Philippine Government. An innovation to the development
partner collaboration has been the formation of five subgroups focused on: social
progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms; governance and
anti-corruption; and decentralization and local government. These five groups each meet
regularly throughout the year (in the Philippines) to discuss key issues and reform
measures related to their relevant topics.

PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, the Philippines has received
194 loans for a total of $8.65 billion, and 312 technical assistance grants amounting to
$139 million. Forty-three percent of the loans were for projects in the energy and agriculture
sectors. As of September 30, during 2005 approvals include $25 million loan for the Small &
Medium Enterprise Support project and three technical assistance grants for $2.1 million.
ADB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amount to
$561.2 million, including 17 loans for $520.3 million and 20 equity investments for
$36.8 million. The Philippines is one of the largest clients for such activities.

ANNEX V

PHILIPPINES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Although data are generally published on a timely basis, weaknesses in the statistical
base continue to hamper surveillance. The 2004 Data Module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) noted that the most serious deficiencies relate to
the national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
The Philippines has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
A. National Accounts
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, serious weaknesses remain in the
national accounts. These include large discrepancies between GDP estimates calculated
from the expenditure and production sides (the official GDP estimates), with consequent
differences in estimates of GDP growth.
The data ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems.9
•

Deaths and births of establishments are not adequately captured. This gap is of
growing importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years,
with a large number of new establishments, in particular in the electronics and
information technology industries.

•

Compilation relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output (I-O)
ratios. The estimates are derived by extrapolation of the 1988 benchmark year using
fixed input-output ratios. For example, GDP statistics for the electronic sector suggest
that value added remained at 10 percent of exports over the past years in spite of industry
evidence that the domestic component of exports has been rising sharply.10

•

Statistical techniques in estimating GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most
activities, not all components of the production accounts are compiled, instead only value
added is estimated. Value added at current prices is calculated by extrapolating the
benchmark year value with an indicator for the value of output; data in constant prices are
estimated using a price deflator for output. In addition, the national accounts constant
price estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed by multiplying 1985
values by quantity data (weights) from the foreign trade statistics for current years.
Because of this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products
appear high compared with developments in world market prices.

9

Currently, the authorities are compiling new national accounts series based on the 1993 SNA
guidelines.
10

Industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly, to around
30 percent in recent years.

- 48 -

ANNEX V

B. Balance of Payments
Steps have been taken to improve the quality of the balance of payments. The Fund has
fielded several technical assistance missions since 1995, including the assignment of a
peripatetic advisor in 2003. In 2005, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas created a new Department
of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on compiling, analyzing, and
publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. There has been
important progress since 2004, including a significant improvement in the measurement of
imports to correct an underestimation of imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis,
improvements in the classification and recording of remittances, the introduction of a new
methodology for measuring trade credits, and progress in the direct investment survey. Major
revisions to the 2003-04 accounts were made in March 2005 and work to backtrack the series
to 1999 to make the series comparable is expected to be completed in the first quarter of
2006.11 Data for external debt and reserves are generally of good quality, although the data
ROSC mission identified scope for improvement.
The revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data and those
of partner countries on a net basis. An interagency task force on import statistics was
established in July 2002 to improve the measurement of activity in the electronics sector,
which accounts for about 43 percent of trade flows. Results of surveys covering electronics
sector raw material imports confirmed that imports were routinely underestimated in reports
to the NSO. Import figures have therefore been revised substantially, back to 2000.12 As a
result, the estimated trade balance for 2001 changed from a surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP to
a deficit of 1 percent of GDP. A comparison of the revised figures with trade data of partner
countries suggests that the revised trade balances of 2001–02 are reasonably well measured.
However, substantial differences remain with partner country data on gross flows of exports
and imports, with the latter about 15 percent higher than the corresponding national data. The
BSP is continuing research on the factors behind discrepancies in data related to trade in
processed goods, such as electronics and textiles.
Challenges remain for addressing certain compilation issues. Since deregulation in the
early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The major gap
relates to Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about 70–75 percent
of foreign exchange settlements, where because of strict secrecy rules banks are not
mandated to report information. Steps have been taken to measure cross-border transactions

11

Errors and omissions prior to 2003 are sizable, making the data very difficult to interpret. Errors
and omissions and “trade credits” accounted for balance of payments outflows of US$4.4 billion
(5.6 percent of GDP) in 2002. Trade credit data, previously calculated as the difference between
export receivables (export shipments less export receipts) and import payables (import arrivals less
import payments) were unreliable, as indicated by continued accumulation of trade credit balances.
They are therefore grouped with errors and omissions in the IMF presentation of the Philippines
balance of payments accounts.

12

Data from 1996–99 have not been revised and remain underestimated.

- 49 -

ANNEX V

that skirt the domestic banking system, such as flows through inter-company accounts.13 A
couple of enterprise surveys, for example, have been introduced. However, these are
conducted on a voluntary basis and will take time to implement fully. Unless modifications
are made to secrecy rules associated with FCDU accounts to facilitate the collection of data
for statistical purposes, compilation of the balance of payments will continue to face
challenges in securing adequate source data.
C. Monetary Accounts
While compilation of the monetary statistics largely conforms to the Fund’s
methodology, structural changes in the financial system following liberalization affected
data on the central bank, commercial banks, and nonbank financial intermediaries.
However, the authorities have recently made progress in implementing some of the
recommendations of the data ROSC. They have introduced the Depository Corporations
Survey, which now includes operations of thrift and rural banks. They have also introduced
uniform procedures for converting foreign currency denominated accounts to local currency
in the monetary aggregates. However, weakness remain, including in the treatment of nonoperational banks, valuation of securities, and treatment of accrued interest.
In October 2004, STA introduced standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary
statistics to the IMF and requested that countries submit test data by January 2005. However,
BSP has yet to submit the data to STA.
D. Fiscal Data
While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important
respects, the recent fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An
important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligations basis, while the deficit is
reported on a cash basis, complicating comparisons of budgets and outcomes. In addition, for
levels of the public sector beyond the budgetary central (national) government, consolidated
fiscal outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally not available. The August
2004 GFS mission addressed shortcomings in the reconciliation of debt stocks and financing
flows and advised on improving the consolidation of debt data for the public sector (and its
subsectors). This has allowed publication of revised nonfinancial public sector debt data
since early 2005.
Annual data covering only the budgetary central government are reported for publication in
the GFSY, and monthly budgetary central government data are published in the IFS. A
dedicated unit in Department of Finance was created to compile government finance statistics
in accordance with GFSM 2001 framework.

13

According to recent household surveys, typically about 30 percent of remittances of Overseas
Filipino Workers were not channeled through the banking system, suggesting that remittances may
have been underestimated by about US$3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) in 2002.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 13, 2006
1.
This statement provides an account of developments since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board on January 20, 2006. Recent developments do not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Fiscal performance in 2005 was substantially better than target. The National
Government deficit amounted to P 146.5 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) last year, substantially
below the target of 3.4 percent of GDP, and a pronounced improvement relative to the 2004
outturn (3.9 percent of GDP). Buoyant revenues and expenditure under-runs contributed
about equally to the overperformance.
3.
As scheduled, the government increased the VAT rate from 10 to 12 percent on
February 1, completing implementation of the VAT reform package. A first round of
measures, including broadening the base of the VAT to power and petroleum products and
raising the corporate income tax rate, went into effect on November 1, 2005. Assuming that
tax collection matches expectations, the VAT reform package should help bring the nonfinancial public sector deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP this year, down from 5.0 percent in 2004
and an estimated 2.7 percent in 2005, while also providing additional resources for capital
and social spending, which have been compressed in recent years.
4.
Real GDP growth registered 5.1 percent in 2005, slightly above expectations, but
down from 6.0 percent in 2004. In the fourth quarter, growth rose to 6.1 percent (y/y), up
from 4.5 percent in the previous quarter, driven in part by stronger private consumption due
to surging remittances. For 2005 as a whole, the slowdown relative to 2004 mainly reflects
substantially weaker investment and net exports.
5.
Financial markets have continued to reward the sustained reform momentum.
The peso has strengthened around 2.6 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of
the year, in line with other currencies in the region. Against the U.S. dollar, the peso is now
at its highest level since September 2002, and the BSP has taken advantage of this strength to
build reserves. Against this background, gross international reserves reached an all-time high
of $20.5 billion at end-January, up by $2 billion since end-December, in part also reflecting
the successful external bond placement in early January. The EMBI-PHL spread has
continued to narrow since the beginning of the year and now measures 272 basis points,
around 180 basis points below its level last July, when the Supreme Court suspended the
VAT reform package and the former economic team resigned.
6.
The attachment updates Table 1 in the Staff Report to incorporate these
developments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Philippines
On February 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Philippines.1
Background
Since mid-2004, when the current administration took office, economic reforms have moved
ahead. In particular, power generation tariffs have been raised to substantially cut the losses of
the National Power Corporation (NPC). The VAT reform has been fully implemented, including
an extension of VAT to energy products in November 2005 and an increase in the VAT rate
from 10 to 12 percent on February 1 of this year. Economic reforms were, however, temporarily
blown off course in mid-2005 by political turbulence following allegations of wrongdoing against
the President. During this period, key members of the economic team resigned and the VAT
reform was suspended by the Supreme Court. The authorities quickly regrouped and
succeeded in keeping fiscal consolidation on track. Impeachment charges were dismissed by
Congress in September, and political uncertainties have since receded.
GDP grew by 5.1 percent y/y in 2005, down from 6 percent in 2004. Weak exports and a decline
in investment served as a drag on activity. Private consumption has been supported by surging
remittances and, to date, has shrugged off the effects of high petroleum prices. On the
production side, services such as business process outsourcing, telecommunication, and
tourism remain key growth drivers. Due in large part to the oil price shock, average inflation for
the year was 7.6 percent, significantly above the target range of 5-6 percent.
Fiscal performance in 2005 was substantially better than target. The National Government
deficit amounted to 2.7 percent of GDP, substantially below the target of 3.4 percent of GDP,
and a pronounced improvement relative to the 2004 outturn (3.9 percent of GDP). Buoyant
revenues and expenditure under-runs contributed about equally to the overperformance.
The deficit of the 14 monitored Government Owned and Controlled Corporations fell sharply, led
by National Power Corporation, which is estimated to have cut its losses to ½ percent of GDP in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-22005, a third of the 2004 level. In addition, increased surpluses are expected for the social
security institutions reflecting lower net lending and increased contributions, including from
overseas workers. Taken together, the nonfinancial public sector deficit is estimated at 2.7
percent of GDP in 2005, compared to 5 percent of GDP in 2004.
Export growth was 2½ percent in the first 11 months of 2005 y/y, weighed down by anemic
electronics growth which has lagged the region. Oil-related imports are estimated to be
US$1.3 billion higher in 2005. However, this has been offset by a jump in remittances. There
have also been sizable equity inflows, while the government has successfully tapped sovereign
bond markets, most recently with a US$2.1 billion issue in early January. Foreign reserves
(adjusted for pledged assets) reached US$18.0 billion at end-2005, US$2.8 billion above the
end-2004 level.
A risk to the near-term outlook for the Philippine economy is that political events, such as
possible constitutional change, serve to sideline economic reforms. If reforms were to stall,
investment is likely to remain subdued, and GDP growth will likely remain below 5 percent in
2006. The outlook would be brighter were strong reforms to continue. The heavy reliance on
external commercial borrowing also puts the Philippines at risk should there be a reversal of the
currently benign environment in emerging markets. Avian flu poses another risk, although there
has yet to be a case in the Philippines.
Executive Board Assessment
The overall performance of the Philippine economy in 2005 was positive, with solid economic
growth despite weaker investment and net exports, and moderating inflation. Moreover,
notwithstanding higher oil prices and intense regional competition, the balance of payments
remained strong. Directors commended the authorities for steadying the economic ship after the
political turbulence in mid-2005 and for regaining momentum on their reform agenda—as
evidenced by the sharp reduction in power sector losses and the full implementation of the
landmark VAT reform law. Directors welcomed the large reduction in the public sector fiscal
deficit in 2005. These policies have helped to turn around investor sentiment, boost market
confidence, and strengthen the peso.
Directors considered that notwithstanding these notable achievements, the Philippines faces
two key challenges going forward—namely, to strengthen its defenses against the remaining
significant short-term vulnerabilities, and to move the Philippine economy to a higher and more
sustained economic growth path. Directors noted that with its still high debt levels, the
Philippines remains vulnerable to a sudden turn in the current benign external financing
environment. In addition, further spikes in oil prices or an outbreak of avian flu pose additional
near-term risks. Directors therefore urged the authorities to sustain the reform momentum by
completing the remaining agenda for fiscal and other structural reforms and thereby enhance
the economy’s ability to absorb such shocks.
Directors underscored the importance of further enhancing the investment climate to set the
stage for higher economic growth and substantial reduction in poverty. They expressed concern
about the recent weakening in export performance, and stressed that a stable macroeconomic
environment, increased infrastructure investment, a stronger financial system, and improved
governance, including in the area of property rights, will be key to increasing the rate of
investment and enhancing competitiveness over the medium term. By contrast, Directors did
not consider the recent appreciation of the exchange rate as a threat to the economy’s
competitiveness. Directors welcomed the priority the authorities attach to raising public
awareness of the benefits of reform, pointing in this context to the recent positive experience

-3that has highlighted how improved market confidence can reduce the costs of tough but
necessary policy measures.
Directors welcomed the sharp reduction in the nonfinancial public sector deficit that is
underway. They underlined the importance of the steps being taken to strengthen tax
administration to ensure that the recent VAT reform package translates effectively into
commensurately higher VAT revenue. Directors noted that balancing the budget over the
medium term will require additional measures. They therefore encouraged the authorities to
consider and pursue additional tax policy measures, such as a sufficiently ambitious
rationalization of tax incentives, to broaden the tax net and improve efficiency and equity.
Directors agreed that rebalancing the composition of public expenditure, with reduced current
outlays providing space for capital and social spending, should form an integral part of the fiscal
consolidation. In this regard, many Directors welcomed the planned use of part of VAT reform
proceeds for the financing of priority infrastructure projects and social programs.
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to continue closely monitoring the performance of the
major Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCCs). They observed that firmspecific deficit targets can contribute to their improved governance and enhanced performance.
In this context, it will be important to ensure that the turnaround in National Power Corporation’s
finances is sustained, and that the National Food Authority’s losses are minimized by improved
targeting of food subsidies.
Directors welcomed the recent interest rate actions by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)
consistent with its commitment to price stability and with a view to ensuring the credibility and
effectiveness of the inflation targeting regime. They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to raise rates promptly to bring inflation down within target by 2007 should inflationary pressures
emerge and the inflation forecast look less favorable, for example due to second-round effects
of the rise in oil prices or the VAT reform. However, Directors noted the possibility that inflation
could return to target more rapidly if improving market sentiment propels higher capital inflows
and peso appreciation.
Directors stressed that power sector privatization should be accelerated. They considered that,
in order for needed investment in the power sector to be made, the challenge will be to shift
sufficient power sector assets into private hands. This will require reducing the uncertainties that
have so far deterred potential deals. Most Directors believed that successful bidding of Transco
might break this deadlock. The importance of designing a comprehensive regulatory framework
for the power sector, based on lessons from similar experiences in other countries, was also
underscored.
Directors underlined the importance of strengthening and deepening financial and capital
markets and enhancing financial sector soundness. They welcomed the recent initiatives to
strengthen bank balance sheets, the progress toward bank consolidation, and the steps taken
to reduce nonperforming assets including through the special purpose vehicle framework.
Nevertheless, the banking sector remains fragmented and some banks weak, with the still
significant level of non-performing assets (NPAs) inhibiting bank lending. Some Directors
suggested that greater pressure should be exerted on weak banks to raise capital and that
mergers should be encouraged. Noting the large stock of Republic of the Philippines (ROP)
bonds held by domestic banks, Directors urged supervisors to monitor potential risks.
Directors expressed concern that passage of the amendments to the BSP Charter aimed at
strengthening bank supervision has made little progress through Congress over the last few

-4years, and urged the authorities to redouble their efforts to pass this legislation to permit a
durable improvement in the soundness of the banking system. Provision of appropriate legal
protection for financial supervisors should remain a critical element of this effort.
Directors noted that effective enforcement of the International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) could provide an opportunity for bank recapitalization. They suggested that any
regulatory relief that may be granted by the BSP to give time to banks to comply with the IFRS
should be transparent to the markets and be made conditional on a clear recapitalization plan.
Directors considered that improving the capacity of financial institutions to price credit, based on
risk, would strengthen financial intermediation. Improved transparency and more complete and
accurate information disclosure by banks and other market participants will be key in this
regard. Directors considered that the financial difficulties being experienced by pre-need firms,
while probably not of systemic concern, illustrate the need to strengthen the supervisory and
regulatory framework for the industry. On Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT), Directors welcomed the progress being made with streamlining the
reporting of suspicious transactions and accelerating the processing of cases.
Directors observed that strengthening governance will be central to the Philippines’
development. This will facilitate the delivery of essential public services, and contribute to a
supportive business climate. A predictable regulatory environment should enhance efficiency,
boost confidence, and attract investment.
Directors noted that data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, and welcomed
the authorities’ efforts to effect required strengthening, particularly in the balance of payments
data. In this context, Directors encouraged the authorities to take on board the
recommendations of Fund technical assistance missions.
Directors agreed to continue post-program monitoring (PPM) for an additional year. Although
the significant progress in reform and the low level of the Philippines’ outstanding borrowing
from the Fund have reduced the need for PPM, Directors saw merit in extending PPM for
another year in light of its facilitating role in reducing the country’s remaining fiscal and external
vulnerability.

reserve assets of the BSP and so are considered part of GIR. However, they are not as readily usable as other

Statement by Jong Nam Oh, Executive Director for the Philippines
and Cyd Amador, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 13, 2006
Key Points
•

The economy has continued to advance, with growth supported by steadfast
implementation of prudent policies and reforms. The authorities remain committed
to sustaining strong policies.

•

Progress toward fiscal consolidation has lifted confidence. The better shape of fiscal
finances will create room for maneuver to meet priorities, reduce vulnerabilities, and
help ensure debt sustainability.

•

Raising the growth trajectory requires meaningful structural reforms on a broad front,
particularly in the power and financial sectors. Improving the business environment
is also a key plank of the reform program.

Our authorities welcome the productive exchange of views with the staff during the mission,
which provided the opportunity to assess economic performance and policies as well as
policy challenges over the medium term. They thank the staff for the well-structured and
thoughtful analysis and helpful insights on issues that have a bearing on long-term growth.
Staff presentations on important issues during the mission added value to, and improved the
quality of, dialogue. Our authorities are particularly appreciative of staff advice grounded on
cross-country analyses, which disseminate lessons learned from wide-ranging reviews of
policy experiences. They also value highly the Fund’s support in knowledge transfer and
capacity- building activities.
The economy has continued to grow at a solid pace on the back of the authorities’
commitment to prudent policies and reform.
The economy delivered a good performance last year, as output grew at a respectable rate of
5.1 percent, price pressures abated, progress toward fiscal consolidation gathered steam, and
the external position remained comfortable. Viewed against the headwinds of high oil prices,
rising global interest rates and political developments, these gains attest to the
implementation of sound economic policies and the headway made in advancing reforms.
Yet, the authorities are keenly aware of underlying vulnerabilities. Oil prices, if they
continue to spike, would fuel inflation and could weigh down on demand and confidence.
The international economic environment could become less supportive, and benign global
financial conditions could reverse, exposing the Philippines to adverse shifts in market
sentiment due to its debt load and financing requirements. The central challenge confronting
the authorities is to buttress the foundations of the economy against downturns and
unanticipated shocks through disciplined policies and sustained reform efforts that will
strengthen the economy’s flexibility and competitiveness and lay the contours for robust

-2growth and enduring development. The challenge is daunting but achievable, and steady,
careful steps are being taken to meet it.
Meaningful social and economic progress require that tangible advances are made toward
meeting the people’s development aspirations. Realizing the full gains from sound economic
policy, however, takes time. Continued, strong macroeconomic conditions will help propel
the reform engine. Apart from this, the authorities are mindful of the need to raise social
ownership for reform and prudent policies. They have continued to raise public awareness of
the benefits of reform as well as the costs of adjustment. They have shown that they are not
averse to delivering difficult messages if such are needed to shift reform efforts to higher
gear. Since many reforms require political action, they continue to work closely with
legislators to advance the economic agenda.
Responsive monetary policy continues to focus on containing the risk of inflation while
allowing room for the economy to grow. The external position has benefited from
stronger confidence stemming from disciplined macroeconomic policies.
Recent policy moves clearly demonstrate the BSP’s commitment to price stability. Monetary
policy was tightened to pre-emptively address inflation risks, particularly price jolts that may
come from rising inflation expectations (due in part to the possible narrowing of interest
differentials) and rapid liquidity growth. Prudent policy tightening and the peso appreciation
helped trim the inflation rate toward the end of 2005. The inflation outlook supports the need
for continued caution in the policy stance. Monetary authorities will continue to evaluate the
impact of recent policy actions, stay alert to signs of emerging inflation pressures, and stand
ready to calibrate policy settings, as warranted, while taking care not to hit the brakes too
hard to avoid restraining growth.
Monetary authorities continue to improve their communications on policy intentions and
actions. Policy clarity is particularly important with the implementation of the VAT reforms
in order to minimize any build-up in inflation expectations from this event.
The external position remains comfortable, buttressed by higher remittances and investments.
The peso firmed, as revenue-raising reforms have had a salutary effect on investor sentiment.
Sovereign bond spreads tightened on the back of improved fiscal accounts and in line with
emerging market trends. The authorities have continued to build cushions against shocks by
accumulating reserves and undertaking early financing of external requirements. Export
growth, however, was quite modest. This highlights the need for reforms that will strengthen
competitiveness and help power exports. Well aware of this, the authorities continue to press
ahead with their efforts to strengthen the business climate, including through complementary
reforms in the power and financial sectors.
Fiscal discipline has started to pay off. The authorities continue to put a premium on
fiscal prudence to ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term and create fiscal
space for growth-supporting infrastructure and social programs.
Responsible fiscal stewardship has led to an overperformance in deficit reduction, and this
has had strong, positive confidence effects. The 2005 National Government budget deficit—
which settled at 2.7 percent of GDP—was better than expected due to higher revenues,

-3prudent spending and savings in interest payments. This, together with the improved
position of other public sector entities, contributed to the significantly lower consolidated
public sector deficit. Our authorities are committed to sustaining the headway that has been
achieved toward fiscal consolidation.
Enhanced revenue generation has played a key role in bridging the fiscal gap. There are
welcome signs that revenue-raising efforts (both administrative and legislative) are yielding
desired results, with the tax effort expected to turn around in 2005 after the trend decline for
the past seven years. A further increase in the tax effort could be realized this year as a result
of the recent VAT reforms and the increase in corporate income tax. At the same time, care
has been taken to temper the impact of fiscal adjustments on the poor and the vulnerable
through well-targeted and affordable mitigating measures. The effective implementation of
tax policy reform is a crucial test of the authorities’ commitment to fiscal soundness.
Better tax compliance and more effective enforcement of tax laws are important in boosting
revenue and in ensuring fairness in tax burden-sharing. To plug tax leaks, our authorities
continue to strengthen tax administration through improved taxpayer registration, expanded
automation, intensified benchmarking and audits, and the system of rewards and sanctions
for revenue personnel that starts to take force this year. There are also programs to train tax
officials in the assessment and collection of the higher VAT liability to lock in the potential
revenue gains from the landmark VAT reforms. Furthermore, the high-profile campaigns
against tax evaders and erring revenue personnel will continue and will be strengthened by
better equipping revenue agencies with technical knowledge on criminal investigation and
financial accounting that will tighten case build-up. These efforts require sustained, strong
commitment and the authorities are single-mindedly pursuing these initiatives.
Asset sales have continued, and the government plans to step up the privatization of nonenergy assets with a view to bolstering the fiscal position and reducing the government’s
direct involvement in economic activity.
Expenditure reform is an integral part of fiscal consolidation. Civil service reform is gaining
momentum. The rationalization of the bureaucracy is aimed at both pruning costs and
restructuring the government through closure of offices that have outlived their purposes and
the integration of agencies with shared objectives and overlapping functions. The
government continues to guard against fiscal laxity in the operations of the public sector as a
whole. The authorities are intensifying the monitoring of GOCCs, improving governance in
these institutions, reinstituting GOCC performance contracts, and pursuing reforms in the
social security agencies, government financial institutions and local government units, with a
view to improving their financial conditions. In particular, they have started developing
medium-term deficit targets for the National Food Authority (NFA) and continue to consider
ways to stem its losses through streamlining of operations and better targeting of rice
subsidies.
Well aware that additional measures will be needed to promote fiscal soundness in the period
ahead and achieve a balanced budget, the authorities are considering further fiscal reforms.
They are championing before the legislature the rationalization of fiscal incentives as well as
the passage of the simplified net income tax system for self-employed individuals and
professionals and the enactment of a fiscal responsibility bill.

-4While the VAT reforms could have some cyclical dampening impact on consumption, its
effects on growth will be determined by accompanying policies. The authorities believe that
perseverance with fiscal reform will create much-needed space for deficit reduction and win
back room to meet priorities, such as infrastructure, sorely needed to address gaps that have
hindered regional competitiveness and stronger growth, and social programs (particularly
nutrition, health, education and housing) that are critical for poverty reduction as well as
economic and social stability. Any expansionary fiscal impulse will be responsibly pursued
to preserve hard-won gains toward fiscal prudence and avoid compromising the objectives of
fiscal consolidation and sustainability. In this connection, and consistent with its
commitment to greater transparency, the government intends to give updates on the
utilization of the revenues from the VAT reforms. In 2006, the government plans to use
70 percent of the VAT reform proceeds for deficit reduction and the remaining 30 percent for
budgetary support to fund priority infrastructure projects and social programs. The authorities
are hopeful that this reporting mechanism will help discipline the budget and marshal popular
support for reforms.
Prudent public debt management will improve debt dynamics and help ensure debt
sustainability, reducing the economy’s exposure to destabilizing shifts in market sentiment
and associated volatilities in capital flows. Priority is being given to improving the liability
portfolio by optimizing ODA financing, lengthening the debt maturity profile, diversifying
the currency mix, and reducing the reliance on external borrowing.
Deepening fundamental reforms will help raise the economy’s growth potential.
Structural reforms have advanced, but further steps are needed to solidify recent gains and
achieve durable growth. The authorities are well aware of the need to sustain the pace of
reforms across a broad front to unlock the economy’s productive potential and strengthen its
capacity to withstand shocks. The recent reforms, particularly in the fiscal area, have
sparked a strong response in investment. There are indications that foreign direct investment
has picked up in manufacturing and ICT-related businesses. The recent opening up of the
mining industry should also stimulate investment. Foreign portfolio investment has also
responded favorably to the better fiscal news. There is, however, further scope for
addressing remaining weaknesses in the business environment.
Meeting infrastructure shortfalls is a key challenge, and the policy space created by fiscal
discipline will help the authorities respond more decisively to this concern. Good
governance is central to the country’s development and is an important policy concern for
our authorities. Improving public governance will facilitate the delivery of essential public
services, decrease the cost of doing business, and help create a predictable regulatory
environment for investment, generating large efficiency gains and confidence effects. The
government is wide awake at the wheel in this regard, with—among other things—a proactive campaign against corruption through better standards in public tendering and
procurement, enhanced transparency and intensified lifestyle checks to promote probity
among civil servants. There have been some palpable results, with the dismissal, suspension
and reprimand of errant personnel. The authorities will persevere in this difficult but
necessary task.

-5Boosting competitiveness will also require that reform efforts in the power and financial
sectors shift to higher gear. In the power sector, important progress has been made in raising
generation tariffs. This has reduced the sector’s losses and its call on public finances.
Beyond contributing to the achievement of fiscal policy objectives, a financially viable
power sector will help ensure adequate, reliable and affordable power that, in turn, will help
lay down an enabling environment for more dynamic private sector activity. Delays have
been encountered in the privatization schedule, partly as the authorities continue to work on
design, contractual and regulatory issues. Privatization of power assets remains a top priority
for the authorities, and they are hopeful that further progress can be made this year on the
sale of these assets, including the transmission infrastructure.
A strong and well-functioning financial sector is an engine of growth. Financial sector
reforms will continue to be pursued to ensure that banks and the capital market meet the
needs of the growing economy. Progress has been made in strengthening bank balance
sheets, as evident in improved asset quality indicators. Banking reform priorities will
continue to focus on improving risk-based supervision technology and capacity, promoting
corporate governance, and aligning the regulatory framework with international standards
and best practices. The authorities continue to encourage banks to intensify efforts to clean
their books, and they are hopeful that the extension of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Act
will be approved early this year to sustain the momentum in the sale of non-performing
assets and spur lending activity. The adoption of international accounting and financial
reporting standards and the forthcoming compliance to the Basel II framework will further
realign local banking practices with global standards. While the BSP is rapidly aligning the
Philippine banking system with international norms, it is also carefully studying the banks’
sensitivity to these changes. The possibility of granting temporary regulatory relief to banks
that will be significantly affected by the new international financial reporting standards is
currently being examined. The authorities will consider this only after a careful assessment
of the results of the quantitative impact study. They are also mindful of the importance of
keeping any relief temporary and of clearly disclosing the conditions under which relief will
be granted, such as the need for those banks to have well-considered plans for bridging
capital gaps.
The BSP will continue to strongly advocate for amendments to its charter, which include
those that will strengthen bank supervision by extending legal protection to its officials
performing their duties as regulators and bank examiners. At the same time, the BSP is
working on a liability cover plan for its bank examiners.
Work is underway to strengthen the capital market with a view to developing alternative and
efficient vehicles for mobilizing long-term funds for investment. The authorities continue to
work with Congress on the legislation for the credit information system, the personal equity
and retirement account and the pre-need code. The latter will include a regulatory
framework that will help ensure investor protection and market integrity. Other legislation
that our authorities continue to pursue are the Corporate Recovery Act, the Revised
Investment Companies Act, and the amendments to the Insurance Code and the Corporation
Code.

-6Concluding remarks
Our authorities are fully committed to macroeconomic prudence and purposeful structural
reform. They are also committed to continued close and constructive engagement with the
Fund through policy dialogue, which has been pivotal in anchoring good policies and guiding
the reform process.
