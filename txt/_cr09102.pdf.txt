EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
•

Growth rebounded in 2007 to 21.4 percent and is expected to remain strong in 2008
based on increased production of hydrocarbons. Higher government capital spending will
be the main engine of near-term growth. Inflation is expected to rise to 6 percent, driven
by increased food prices. Refined fuel prices are set administratively and are unchanged.

•

High oil prices have led to strong fiscal and external current account surpluses. The nonoil fiscal deficit has declined recently to 49.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007, with
spending largely kept within budget. But going forward, softening oil prices and higher
spending may lead to a decline in the fiscal and current account surpluses and a widening
of the non-oil deficit.

•

The Social Development Fund is ready to initiate critical projects but the authorities have
not yet authorized disbursement of project funds.

•

Equatorial Guinea’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI) is moving forward slowly. The World Bank is expected to assist with meeting the
substantive requirement on civil society participation.

•

The financial system, though underdeveloped, appears generally sound.

Policy discussions
•

The mission felt that the proposed expansionary 2009 budget will sustain inflationary
pressures. At the same time, the significant increase in capital spending insufficiently
addresses social needs. The authorities felt that higher spending was warranted for
infrastructure projects. Over the longer term, the authorities agreed that the non-oil deficit
needs to decline, once essential capital spending priorities are met.

•

Improvements in public financial management are essential. The authorities remain
committed to the EITI.

•

The mission strongly urged the government to implement the Social Development Fund
projects promptly, which the authorities indicated had been delayed because of political
changes. They are proposing a modest food subsidy in the 2009 budget, which the
mission suggested should be structured as a direct transfer to vulnerable households.

•

There was agreement on the need to expand access to credit for small and medium
businesses, including through restructuring of government assistance.

•

In the mission’s view, the real effective exchange rate seems to be somewhat overvalued.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Equatorial Guinea’s petroleum-based economy has become an important
contributor to growth in central Africa. Medium-term prospects are good, but sustaining
growth, diversifying the economy, and generating employment will require improvements in
the business environment.
2.
Poverty remains high and social indicators weak. The analysis of the 2006
Household Expenditure Survey showed that about 77 percent of the population fell below the
poverty line in 2006, a strikingly high rate of poverty.
3.
The National Development Plan (NDP) adopted in 2007 will guide the
government’s economic strategy until 2020. It provides a reform framework to diversify
the economy and enhance external competitiveness. The four main pillars are improvements
in infrastructure, human capital, governance, and social welfare. Its macrofiscal policy, based
on a permanent income model, will help contain inflation and improve long-run fiscal
sustainability. Structural deficiencies are obstacles to the success of the NDP. The financial
system, though underdeveloped, appears generally sound. The weak statistical base hinders
macroeconomic assessments.

the non-oil economy, other than
petroleum derivatives, mainly reflect public-sector related construction.

1

The largest components of the measured non-oil economy are manufacturing of petroleum derivatives,
construction, and other services. Other than derivatives, the non-oil economy is poorly measured and probably
understated.

6
5.
Rising international food and oil
prices are contributing to inflationary
pressures (Figure 2). Though the price for
staple foods surged in 2007, the strong euro,
lagged adjustment of refined fuel prices,
public spending restraint, and better monetary
management helped avoid a sharp rise in
prices.2 Inflation is expected to jump in 2008,
mainly because of pent-up pressures from
rising import prices.

appreciated against the U.S. dollar (Figure
3). The appreciation of the REER is consistent with recent movements in the terms of trade,
but has been accompanied by a contraction of non-petroleum exports that raises concern that
the REER may be somewhat overvalued (Figure 4 and Box 1).3

Box 1. Equatorial Guinea: Assessment of the Real Effective Exchange Rate
Staff analysis suggests that the REER is somewhat overvalued, although this assessment is complicated by the
significant structural changes in the economy since oil production began in 1992, as well as persistent data
deficiencies in measuring the non-oil sector and the domestic price level. At the regional level, the latest CEMAC
staff report found that the REER is broadly in line with its fundamentals.
The CPI-based REER has steadily appreciated in recent years and stood at 75 percent above its 2000 level by
mid-2008. However, official data appear likely to have significantly understated the actual increase in consumer
prices during 2006–07, suggesting a similar understatement of real appreciation. This appreciation has mirrored a
significant improvement in the terms of trade since 2000, reflecting the increase in oil prices over this period.
Although non-oil export volumes have risen because of new production of petroleum-related derivatives, nonpetroleum-related export volumes have declined with traditional exports contracting substantially, raising concerns
about long-term competitiveness.

Estimates of Equatorial Guinea’s FEER,
derived from these long-run elasticities, produce results from modestly undervalued to substantially overvalued, but
generally suggest that an improving terms of trade implies FEER appreciation.

7.
High oil, gas, and derivatives prices contributed to a strong external current
account and an overall balance of payments surplus in 2007 (Table 3 and Figure 5). Gross
official foreign assets, held in both the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and abroad,
rose to about 21 months of non-oil imports of goods and services by the end of 2007. The
current account and balance of payments are expected to strengthen in 2008 because of the
rise in oil prices, though the government’s purchase of Devon Corporation’s assets in
Equatorial Guinea is expected to produce a net outflow of foreign direct investment and a
decline in foreign asset cover.4 Though diversification is occurring in petroleum derivatives,
other non-oil exports have contracted considerably.
8.
The fiscal outcome has been good.
The fiscal surplus was high, though it
narrowed in 2007 as a result of increased
capital spending and some weakening of
revenues relative to GDP (Tables 4a, b, and
c and Figure 6). The depreciation of the
U.S. dollar against the CFA franc largely
offset the effect of higher dollar oil prices
on oil revenues. Expenditures were in line
with the budget. The non-oil primary
deficit, a key fiscal indicator, improved to
about 49½ percent of non-oil GDP,
reflecting budgetary restraint and growth of
non-oil GDP.5 The 2008 non-oil deficit is
expected to improve slightly, with a minor
weakening of the overall surplus. Spending
is expected to stay within budgetary limits.

Implementation of the Social Development Fund has been slow. About 12 projects
were agreed on, to be implemented with assistance from the U. S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), in education, health, water and sewerage, gender equality, and
community development. Funds were allocated in the 2008 budget but the government has
yet to approve their disbursement so work can begin.

4

Devon held a significant minority share in the largest oil field. The government purchased Devon’s assets,
mainly by drawing down bank deposits, to gain an active participation in the field.
5

Staff revised the fiscal accounts to put equity purchases below the line, consistent with the Government
Finance Statistics methodology.

Steps are being taken to improve public financial management. The tax
administration is strengthening training and monitoring of taxpayers, and expanding use of a
taxpayer identification number. The customs administration is automating and adopting preshipment inspection. The treasury is improving the classification of government
expenditures. Two international fiscal advisors, who started work in March 2008, are making
progress.
11.
Equatorial Guinea has made only modest progress toward implementation of the
EITI. In late 2007, it met the EITI international secretariat’s nominal requirement for EITI
candidacy, including civil society participation, but has not yet met the substantive
requirement on this participation. A civil society trainer will likely be jointly funded by the
World Bank and international civil society groups. In addition, a World Bank advisor is
expected soon to begin assisting with preliminary steps to preparing the first EITI report,
including establishing terms of reference for the aggregator.

12.
BEAC managed liquidity more actively in 2007, by introducing negative
auctions and raising bank reserve requirements to reduce liquidity.6 Broad money (M2)
is estimated to have grown about 41½ percent in 2007, and private credit expanded
40½ percent (Tables 5a and b). The expansion of private credit largely reflects short-term
lending for working capital on public infrastructure projects. M2 velocity relative to non-oil
GDP (excluding derivatives) declined slightly (Figure 7). Money and credit are expected to
expand at about the same rate in 2008

mainly concentrated in public
infrastructure projects. Consumer credit remains modest and the mortgage market is
undeveloped. Relatively few households have bank accounts.

2007

14.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable, provided public
spending returns to a moderate path. Growth is expected to remain positive, though it will
likely slow significantly over the medium term absent any significant new petroleum-related
projects (Table 7 and Figure 8). Continued public capital spending should support
infrastructure development and, in combination with rising incomes and private investment,
lead to expanded commercial trade, but overly high increases in infrastructure spending will
strain implementation capacity, lead to lower project quality, and generate higher inflation.
Realization of the government’s NDP objectives would encourage diversification of exports
into areas of potential comparative advantage such as fishing, timber, agriculture, and
petroleum-related services, but developing these sectors faces many challenges. Rural
occupations face labor shortages as workers migrate to the cities. Discussions are underway
to double liquefied natural gas production capacity.7 Hydroelectric power holds promise but

Reserve requirements rose by 2.5 percentage points to 14 percent on demand deposits and by 1 percentage
point to 10.5 percent on time deposits.
7

Primary oil and gas resources are expected to last until around 2030 but output is expected to decline
significantly after 2012. The production of derivatives would be significantly strengthened with realization of
agreements to import regional natural gas.

needs to be supported by private sector funding. The proposed major increase in public
capital spending in 2009 will sustain inflationary pressures, but the high import content will
contain any worsening and instead weaken the current account.
15.
The fiscal surplus is expected to diminish sharply in line with slowing economic
growth, a decline in oil prices, and the proposed rise in capital spending. Achieving the
NDP objectives will depend on the government’s success in choosing public investments that
support human capital and non-oil economic development. Continued reinforcement of tax
administration and a determined effort to reform customs administration are essential to
improve non-oil revenues.
16.
Though generally robust, the external sector faces vulnerabilities. Foreign direct
investment is expected to remain strong, led by investment in oil and derivatives. Although
better monetary management and structural measures to enhance supply of food and other
products are expected to bring inflation down, a relaxation of the fiscal stance makes it
harder to avoid inflation and real exchange rate appreciation. The concentration of exports in

12
petroleum-based products renders the external sector highly vulnerable to petroleum price
swings. The forecast decline in oil prices in 2009, in combination with a surge in government
spending and hence imports, is expected to put the external current account into deficit.
Sustained increase in public spending would significantly weaken the external position.
17.
Equatorial Guinea currently has a minimal debt service burden and no
outstanding arrears. In 2006, the government agreed with China, through its Eximbank, on
a credit line of up to US$2 billion at 5.5 percent interest, but so far has not drawn on it.
18.
Apart from concerns over the weakening of the fiscal stance, there are several
other risks to the generally positive outlook. A prolonged and deep drop in oil prices
would weaken the external current account and budget execution, though the high stock of
public financial assets should buffer against temporary moderate shocks. Private sector
development is still deterred by a lack of clarity on how key laws will be applied, the slow
pace of confidence-building initiatives such as the EITI, limited financing for small and
medium-sized businesses, and poor skills of workers. The high cost of imported goods
suggests a lack of genuine competition and other distortions in the market that could hinder
the competitiveness of products other than petroleum. Like other CEMAC countries, the
country’s scores on the World Bank’s “Doing Business” indicators are low.
19.
The government is committed to reforming Equatorial Guinea’s inadequate
statistical apparatus. An expanded inflation survey covering the whole country will
improve the accuracy of price statistics. Other work is underway to improve foreign trade
data. However, bringing macroeconomic statistics in line with the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System will still be a considerable challenge.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
20.
The mission discussed with the authorities the fiscal policies embodied in the
2009 budget, and the fiscal, structural, and financial policies that underlie the NDP.
21.

The discussions focused on the following key issues:

•

The appropriate fiscal path to sustain recent consolidation of the non-oil deficit and
cushion the medium-term decline in oil revenues;

•

Measures to firm up the social safety net and build human capital, especially through
implementation of the Social Development Fund;

•

Measures to improve fiscal management and transparency, ensure sound management of
accumulating public sector assets, and implement the EITI; and

•

Steps to enhance the private sector climate, the financial system, and the capacity to
assess economic developments.

13
A. Designing Fiscal Policies for Stability and Sustainability
22.
The authorities’ framework, which is based on a reduction of the non-oil
primary deficit, is an appropriate guide for fiscal policy, if implemented. The reduction
of the non-oil deficit has helped contain inflationary pressures and improve fiscal
sustainability. However, the authorities’ proposed 2009 budget moves strongly away from
this framework, with high spending increases, which the mission estimates would worsen the
non-oil deficit from 47½ percent of non-oil GDP to 73½ percent of non-oil GDP (Box 2,
line 1).
23.
The 2009 proposed budget significantly increases infrastructure spending.
Although the proportion spent on the social sectors would rise, it would still be relatively
small in relation to social needs. The authorities pointed out that the spending on ports, roads,
and hydroelectricity is essential to economic development and spending on hotel and related
infrastructure is necessary to meet upcoming international obligations (the summit of the
African Union, in 2011, and the Africa Cup of Nations, in 2012).
24.
The mission recommended that capital spending in the 2009 budget be scaled
down as the increase would considerably strain the economy and implementation
capacity, and likely erode the quality of projects. The capital budget should shrink
slightly relative to national output, which would sustain the gradual reduction in the non-oil
deficit even while allowing some scaling up of current expenditure (Box 2, line 2).
25.
The mission suggested that a further decline in the non-oil deficit is required for
longer-term fiscal sustainability. A fiscal benchmark based on the notion that the
government should maintain a constant real level of spending suggests that the government
should target reduction in the non-oil deficit from about 26 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008
to 13 percent in 2020 (Box 2, line 3 and Figure 9), assuming there is a gradual improvement
in non-oil revenues and oil revenues are projected with some softening of prices. A similar
profile would result from a fiscal benchmark based on the government maintaining a constant
level of spending relative to GDP (Box 2, line 4). More productive government spending,
increased non-oil revenues from an invigorated non-oil economy, and new discoveries of
reserves could relax the implied spending limits; a longer planning horizon or a lower return
on financial investments would imply tighter spending limits.

Petroleum revenue projections are based on staff assumptions for government intake and projected oil price from WEO.

2

The projections for government expenditures assume capital expenditures declining as a percent of GDP after 2009 and current expenditures increasing as a percent of GDP (see Table 9b).

3

Expenditure based on the Permanent Income Model is equal to an annuity from oil revenues plus non-oil revenue for that year (excluding interest earned).

4

The annuity is computed by distributing evenly in real terms until 2060 all the oil revenues, assuming 2 percent real return on assets.

5

The annuity is computed by distributing evenly in terms of GDP until 2060 all the oil revenues, assuming 2 percent real return on assets. Oil GDP projection is based
on oil production profile from the authorities. Non-oil GDP, which includes the manufacturing of oil derivatives, is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent
in real terms, excluding the manufacturing of derivatives, whose projection is based on data from the authorities.

6

The difference between the two specifications reflects the projected decline in real GDP in the long term as oil and natural gas production declines (absent a significantly improved non-oil economy),
reducing future spending.

26.
The economic impact of infrastructure spending is unclear. The marginal
relationship between capital spending and output growth appears somewhat weaker than in
other CEMAC countries (Box 3). 8 The mission advised that projects should be undertaken
only if they generate higher returns than from financial savings. The authorities felt that the
proposed 2009 capital spending would address important priorities. The mission and
authorities agreed that current spending should match the operational needs of the growing
public infrastructure, and foster human resource development. But while the Public
Investment Plan shows a higher share of spending on social sectors, this spending is still low
(Box 4). A World Bank-led public expenditure review, expected to begin in late 2008, should
provide useful guidance.

27.
Reducing poverty remains a high priority. The authorities acknowledged that
poverty is high and their program is geared to reducing it. But they expressed concerns about
the validity of the recent survey and indicated that they are working with development
partners to better measure social indicators.
28.
Implementing the Social Development Fund is critical to mitigating poverty by
raising spending for human capital development. The government has not yet approved
disbursement so that work can begin. The authorities indicated that political changes had
delayed the initiation of these activities. But continued delay would raise questions about
whether the government’s commitment is genuine.
29. Applying a well-designed social safety net will raise social welfare and alleviate
the most dire poverty. The authorities’ plan to include a modest food subsidy in the 2009
budget would help address the rising cost of food for vulnerable households. Their proposed
arrangement would have the government purchase this food and sell it to small retailers who
would then resell it at regulated prices. The mission suggested that this assistance would be
better structured as a direct transfer to vulnerable households through food vouchers. The
retail fuel subsidy mainly benefits well-off households and keeping the price below the
market may lead to gasoline shortages and illegal trade.
30. Better fiscal management is essential. Extensive reform encompassing all stages of
the budgeting process, particularly procurement, audit, and evaluation, is necessary. The
authorities indicated their continued commitment to the EITI and their interest in taking full
advantage of World Bank assistance to ensure that the civil society participation
requirement is met and other hurdles are overcome.

Integrating the social security fund more fully into the state budget would be
beneficial. Benefits and revenues should be structured to ensure that the fund stays
actuarially sound and the mission welcomed the authorities’ interest to strengthen its
sustainability. The BEAC should permit the government to move the social security fund
surplus from commercial banks to the central bank to earn a higher interest rate.

18
32. The authorities today must manage a diversifying portfolio of assets, which
includes reserves in the BEAC, offshore assets, and shares in private corporations. The
authorities were supportive of recent reforms but nonetheless feel that the BEAC needs to
continue raising the return on foreign assets under its management. The authorities
emphasized the benefits they would gain in sharing the management of the key oil field, by
purchasing Devon’s minority share. The mission cautioned, however, that the government
should avoid concentrating its asset holdings in oil-related investments.
33.
The authorities continue to work with CEMAC partners on trade liberalization.
The CEMAC agreement to relax some import surcharges and tariffs on necessities should
help liberalize trade and have immediate benefit for poor consumers.
34. The mission carried out a Debt Sustainability Analysis applying alternative
scenarios for new debt accumulation. Debt sustainability remains strong under likely
scenarios.
B. Strengthening Growth Prospects and Improving the Business Climate
35.
Growth of the non-oil economy will depend on both continued prudent economic
management and success in raising total factor and labor productivity. The authorities
intend to create a robust private economy through the implementation of sectoral reforms, but
they will need to restrict the role of government to developing human capital and key public
infrastructure and providing an attractive legal and regulatory environment. Primary oil and
gas production has a relatively short horizon. Realization of the promise of petroleum
derivatives will depend on securing imported oil and gas and keeping the investment
environment stable and competitive. There are a number of promising areas highlighted in
the NDP, such as timber and fishing, manufacturing of wood products, petroleum-related
services, and hydroelectric power, but the authorities should make sure that the private sector
is the main source of investment. Cocoa and coffee production will be difficult to revive
without significant new investments and the ability to attract a committed labor force, but
small-scale government training and financing could help build nontraditional agriculture.
36. Reducing barriers to private sector activities is critical. The authorities plan to
create a better environment for small and medium businesses by improving training and
access to credit (through restructuring of INPYDE, a public agency). They should ensure
that the interpretation and implementation of the 2006 petroleum law keep Equatorial
Guinea competitive with other oil-producing countries. Also essential are improvements to
financial services, labor quality, education and health care services, and utilities and
transportation infrastructure.
37. Systematic training of the labor force will help achieve full employment. The
extensive use of foreign workers suggests that jobs are available for well-trained workers.
The authorities’ plans to expand vocational training and educational opportunities should
reinforce the trend toward domestic labor.

19
38.
A healthy financial sector is vital for boosting non-oil economic growth and
supporting diversification. The sound banking system is a strength but it does not yet play a
sufficient intermediation role for the private sector and is overly concentrated on
intermediating public spending through short-term lending. The recent abolition of the
maximum lending rate will enable the financial sector to price risks more appropriately.
Strengthening banks’ ability to enforce contracts would further facilitate extension of credit
to small and medium businesses.
39.
The authorities are making efforts to combat money laundering, overinvoicing,
and tax evasion. A 2007 temporary ministerial order requires prior authorization of the
General Directorate of Banking before money can be transferred abroad. Staff are assessing
the consistency of the ministerial order with Equatorial Guinea’s obligations under Article
VIII, Sections 2 and 3. In 2009, the authorities should ensure that the National Agency for
Financial Investigation to combat money laundering and terrorism financing becomes
operational.
40.
Improvements in economic statistics are essential to guide policy making.
Although some work is underway on strengthening price statistics and national
accounts, further progress in these areas continues to be the highest priority (Box 5).
The absence of regular statistics on the labor market outside the public service, and of
indicators of poverty to monitor Millennium Development Goal (MDG) progress are serious
gaps (Table 10). Improving balance of payments and government finance statistics and the
scope of their coverage should remain a priority. Equatorial Guinea should strive to
participate in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. Sufficient resources should be
allocated to statistical collection and analysis and trained personnel assigned specifically to
these tasks.
Box 5. Equatorial Guinea: Measurement of GDP
•

Output data: Authoritative data are not produced by the government’s statistical agencies on petroleum
and other outputs. These data would improve GDP measurement and avoid inconsistencies.

•

Petroleum derivatives: The BEAC methodology does not account for intermediate consumption in
calculating value-added for petroleum derivatives production. In addition, BEAC calculates the national
accounts in 1985 constant prices, an out-dated base year. In contrast, IMF staff have adjusted the
methodology to rebase national accounts estimates to a 2000 base year and take explicit account of
intermediate consumption.

•

Measurement of the non-oil sector: The BEAC data on output in the non-oil economy outside of
petroleum derivatives appear to be implausibly low, in particular in the services sector. IMF staff have
adjusted upward estimates in the non-oil economy to capture informal and unrecorded activities. These
adjustments imply a modest increase in both nominal GDP and the annual real GDP growth rate in IMF
estimates compared to those of BEAC, reflecting the larger weight attributed to the non-oil sector.

20
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Equatorial Guinea’s recent robust economic performance reflects growth and
diversification within its petroleum industry. Sound macroeconomic policies have
improved fiscal sustainability and prudent lending has strengthened the banking system.
42.
The medium-term prospects are favorable, but improvements in the business
environment are critical to sustain growth, diversify the economy, and generate
employment. The economy is vulnerable to swings in the price of oil, and inadequate
governance and transparency may limit private sector development.
43.
The NDP, guiding the government’s economic strategy until 2020, provides a
sound framework to diversify the economy and enhance competitiveness. The four
pillars encompass needed reforms, but the government will need to ensure a proper and
limited role for the public sector.
44.
The NDP’s fiscal policy, based on a model of permanent income, will help
contain inflation and improve long-run fiscal sustainability. However, the proposed 2009
budget is too expansionary; the increase in capital spending is hard to justify when the share
for social sectors is rising only slightly. Strengthening of the fiscal position is thus essential.
45.
Urgent priorities are to ensure that the Social Development Fund programs are
introduced and that the budget emphasize human resource development. The delay in
approving spending under the fund is worrisome. Limited human capital undermines
diversification, job creation, and poverty alleviation.
46.
Continued efforts to improve fiscal management and transparency are essential
to ensure the quality of public spending and build non-oil revenues. Although the
authorities have undertaken useful reforms of tax and customs administration and public
expenditure management, the slow progress on these reforms and the EITI are major
concerns. Improving tax and customs administration and systems of procurement, audit, and
evaluation will require sustained attention.
47.
The authorities’ commitment to working with CEMAC partners to improve the
governance and management of BEAC is commendable. The authorities should remit
offshore assets to BEAC, which is an appropriate venue for asset management; they should
be cautious about concentrating their financial portfolio too heavily in domestic oil assets.
48.
The pegged exchange rate regime has served Equatorial Guinea well. While its
appreciation has been largely consistent with fundamentals, the REER is moderately
overvalued. It will be important to enhance competitiveness with a sound fiscal stance, and to
undertake meaningful structural reforms that enhance total and factor productivity.
49.
A healthy climate for private sector development is a prerequisite for
diversification. Private investments should underpin development of all key productive
sectors. The authorities should ensure that the petroleum and other key laws and regulations

21
are interpreted and administered so that the economy is attractive to petroleum and other
investors.
50.
Although the financial system appears generally sound, it is underdeveloped. It is
crucial that the authorities continue to develop the financial infrastructure to support greater
access to borrowing for small and medium businesses and ensure that the National Agency
for Financial Investigation becomes operational in 2009.
51.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that seriously hamper surveillance and
recent improvements are welcome. The authorities should not only establish the National
Statistical Institute but ensure that it has robust capacity to collect and analyze data.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1

The VAT was legislated in early 2005; previously this was a sales tax. Currently, 40 percent of firms in the
non hydrocarbons sector continue to pay on the basis of a sales tax.
Related to the crash of the banking system during the early 1980s
3
Includes all equity purchases of the government and in 2008-2010 it is mainly related to the $2.2 billion purchase
of Devon Energy's assets in Equatorial Guinea.
4
Errors and omissions financing gap for 2007 is partly influenced by lack of data on deposits abroad for that year.
5
Equal to the overall balance excluding grants minus hydrocarbons sector corporate income tax and non tax revenue
plus hydrocarbons revenue generated in the secondary LNG, LPG and methanol production and purchase of share in hydrocarbons
projects, minus interest on saving funds plus interest expenditure (please see detailed hydrocarbons revenues in table 4c).

1

The VAT was legislated in early 2005; previously this was a sales tax. Currently, 40 percent of firms in the
non hydrocarbons sector continue to pay on the basis of a sales tax.
2
Related to the crash of the banking system during the early 1980s.
3
Includes all equity purchases of the government; in 2008 this is mainly related to the $2.2 billion purchase
of Devon Energy's assets in Equatorial Guinea.
4
Errors and omissions financing gap for 2007 is partly influenced by lack of data on deposits abroad for that year.
5
Equal to the overall balance excluding grants minus hydrocarbons sector corporate income tax and non tax revenue
plus hydrocarbons revenue generated in the secondary LNG, LPG and methanol production and purchase of share in
hydrocarbon projects, minus interest on saving funds plus interest expenditure (see hydrocarbons revenues in table 4c).

1

Current year profits are excluded from the definition of regulatory capital, following the Basel I capital accord guidelines. General provisions
are included in Tier 2 capital up to an amount equal to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital, and the
minimum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
2

The risk-weighted assets are estimated using the following risk weights: 0% - cash reserves in domestic and foreign currency and claims on
the central bank; 100% - all other assets.

3

Current year profits are excluded from the definition of capital (i.e., shareholders' funds).

4

The ratio of after-tax profits to the average of beginning and end-period total assets. The numbers for 2007 are preliminary and to be
confirmed by the authorities.

5

The ratio of after-tax profits to the average of beginning and end-period shareholders' funds (excluding current-year profits). The numbers for

Memorandum items:

1

The VAT was legislated in early 2005; previously this was a sales tax. Currently, 40 percent of firms in the
non hydrocarbons sector continue to pay on the basis of a sales tax.
2
Related to the crash of the banking system during the early 1980s.
3
Includes all equity purchases of the government; in 2008 this is mainly related to the $2.2 billion purchase of Devon Energy's assets in Equatorial Guinea.
4
Errors and omissions financing gap for 2007 is partly influenced by lack of data on deposits abroad for that year.
5
Equal to the overall balance excluding grants minus hydrocarbons sector corporate income tax and non tax revenue
plus hydrocarbons revenue generated in the secondary LNG, LPG and methanol production and purchase of share in hydrocarbons
projects, minus interest on saving funds plus interest expenditure (please see detailed hydrocarbons revenues in table 4c).

1

The VAT was legislated in early 2005; previously this was a sales tax. Currently, 40 percent of firms in the
non hydrocarbons sector continue to pay on the basis of a sales tax.
2
Related to the crash of the banking system during the early 1980s.
3
Includes all equity purchases of the government; in 2008 this is mainly related to the $2.2 billion purchase of Devon Energy's assets in Equatorial Guinea.
4
Errors and omissions financing gap for 2007 is partly influenced by lack of data on deposits abroad for that year.
5
Equal to the overall balance excluding grants minus hydrocarbons sector corporate income tax and non tax revenue
plus hydrocarbons revenue generated in the secondary LNG, LPG and methanol production and purchase of share in hydrocarbons
projects, minus interest on saving funds plus interest expenditure (please see detailed hydrocarbons revenues in table 4c).

APPENDIX
EQUATORIAL GUINEA⎯EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Assuming no new borrowing, the external debt of Equatorial Guinea is expected to
decline from around 1 percent of GDP in 2007 to less than 0.5 percent by 2013 (Tables 1 and
2). The external debt burden could increase substantially (to 18 percent of GDP in 2013), if
the authorities decide to activate a credit line from China negotiated in 2006.1 2
2.
Equatorial Guinea’s external debt is sustainable. A debt sustainability analysis
(DSA)— using the middle income country template—demonstrates that the country’s
external debt would remain below the CEMAC convergence criteria of 70 percent of GDP
under all stress-test scenarios (Figure 1).
3.
In stress-test scenarios, all shocks are calibrated over the period 2003–07. The
shorter calibration period is chosen over the standard ten-year one, because in the late 1990s
the Equatoguinean economy experienced extraordinary volatility related to the development
of newly discovered oil fields, which is unlikely to recur in the future. The most relevant
scenario in the case of Equatorial Guinea is the current account shock, reflecting the
vulnerability to a sudden decline in oil prices that would result in a marked worsening of the
current account. Given the very low level of Equatorial Guinea’s external debt, the impact of
the interest rate, growth, and exchange rate shocks in the DSA is minimal.
4.
Similar to last year’s DSA, staff revised the balance of payments data, leading to
an improvement of the current account and gross financing needs. In the 2007 Article IV
Consultation it was established that in the official balance of payments data, the outflows of
government deposits to banks abroad had been implicitly subsumed in current account
outflows. Staff revised the historical data to explicitly account for government deposits
abroad, which implied a level improvement in the current account and corresponding
weakening in the financial account.
5.
The explosive path of the external debt to GDP ratio under the current account
stress-test results from technical assumptions that are unlikely to hold as they use a
standardized assumption that Equatorial Guinea would continue to accumulate
reserves at the same pace as in the baseline scenario, if faced with a severe negative
external shock. This assumption is too stringent, as in reality any widening of the current
account deficit relative to GDP is likely to result in a one-on-one decrease of the ratio of

1

Equatorial Guinea and China signed a framework agreement in 2006. This could eventually result in China
lending up to US$2 billion to Equatorial Guinea. The framework contains a list of investment projects, which if
awarded to Chinese companies and if the Treasury is unable to meet its obligations on the contracts, will be
financed from the credit line. At present, there is no outstanding credit.
2

During the 2008 Article IV consultations, the authorities insisted that there are no immediate plans to draw
upon the China credit line, given the very large foreign assets of the government. Based on this statement, the
mission team did not include any drawings from the China credit line in the external debt forecasts.

38
accumulated foreign assets to GDP.3 This issue does not typically arise in other DSAs,
because the ratio of accumulated foreign assets to GDP in most countries is small.
6.
Compared to last year, debt sustainability has improved. External debt was
2 percent of GDP in 2006, while it stood at 1 percent of GDP in 2007. Medium-term external
debt has also been halved as compared to last year’s projections. Domestic debt is minimal
and expected to remain so. Hence there is no distinction between public debt sustainability
and external debt sustainability under the projected scenario.
7.
The main difference of alternative scenarios of the current DSA with that of last
year is a significant improvement in debt sustainability in the growth and real
depreciation shock scenarios (Figure 1). These significant improvements stem from the
limited applicability of the DSA exercise to Equatorial Guinea. In 2008, in the medium term,
foreign assets are projected to be accumulated at a much slower rate than was estimated in
2007, as a result of newly announced capital spending plans and the government’s purchase
of domestic private sector assets. Lower asset accumulation in the DSA exercise leads to
lower external debt. However, this is not the case for Equatorial Guinea, which does not
finance its foreign asset accumulation by increasing debt.

3

The DSA template assumes that the evolution of the ratio of external debt to GDP reflects changes in the debt
service as a share of GDP (with an increase in this variable increasing external debt to GDP), and the current
account to GDP ratio, the ratio of net foreign direct investment to GDP and the ratio of accumulated foreign
assets to GDP (with an increase in these variables decreasing external debt to GDP). The last category is a
residual equal to the difference between the predicted evolution of the external debt to GDP ratio, given by
changes in the other variables, and its actual realizations. In Equatorial Guinea, this residual is sizeable,
reflecting government savings of oil revenues.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks.
Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario
being presented. Five-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Similar to the 2007 Article IV Consultation, staff revised the BOP data to explicitly account for government
deposits abroad, which implied a level improvement in the current account and corresponding weakening in the
financial account.
3/ The historical scenario has different assumptions than the baseline scenario. While the baseline assumptions
are the same as the framework assumptions for the financial program of the 2008 Article IV consultation, the
historical scenario assumes GDP growth, the GDP deflator, and the nominal interest rate will remain at their
current 5 year historical averages for the projection period. The rest of the assumptions are similar for these
scenarios.
4/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to the real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
5/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2009.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth
rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of
the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Safeguard Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States, of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. The safeguards
assessment completed on August 30, 2004 found that the BEAC has implemented a
number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since an earlier 2001
safeguards assessment, but further progress needs to be made in key areas. The main
recommendations of the 2004 assessment were reported in IMF Country Report No. 05/3.
Equatorial Guinea’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed exchange
rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. A 2007 temporary
ministerial order requires prior authorization of the General Directorate of Banking
before money can be transferred abroad. Staff are assessing the consistency of the
ministerial order with Equatorial Guinea’s obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2
and 3.
Article IV Consultations
Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the Executive
Board on June 8, 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 08/156).
Technical Assistance
FAD provided an 18-month technical assistance during 1992–94 to reorganize the tax
department and personnel training.
FAD conducted a review of PEM and tax administration systems in 1997.
FAD conducted a diagnostic mission on key deficiencies and training needs in public
finance in May 2003.

ANNEX III. EQUATORIAL GUINEA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
The deficiencies in quality, timing, and coverage in most macroeconomic data are related to
insufficient administrative and technical capacity. Technical assistance has resulted in some
progress but there is still a need to consolidate these gains including through participation in
the General Data Dissemination System and the establishment of the National Institute of
Statistics (NIS). The Banque des États de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) regularly reports
monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS), but the timeliness of these data need improvement.
Real Sector and Price Statistics
2.
National accounts and price data suffer from weaknesses that are compounded
by poor centralization of information from the island and continental regions. National
accounts are compiled at current and constant prices, but often contain significant
inconsistencies. The compilation of the official CPI has benefited from technical assistance
of the Economic and Statistical Observatory of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there remain a
number of deficiencies. The weights and composition of the basket of goods and services are
outdated, and the geographical coverage is not comprehensive, though it will soon cover the
entire country.
3.
STA TA missions visited Malabo in July 2005, January 2006, and March 2007.
The 2005 mission reviewed the methods and data sources used to compile both the national
accounts and the CPI, and assessed the adequacy of statistical legislation and the resources
devoted to the statistical function, and made recommendations for improvement. The 2006
mission reviewed the work for implementing the recommendations of the previous mission,
and delivered a short seminar on national accounts. The mission found that little progress had
been made, mainly due to persistent management problems and severe human and computing
resource constraints.
4.
The 2007 mission found that some progress had been made in implementing
previous missions’ recommendations. The pilot of the Agricultural Production Survey
(APS) 2005–06 was being conducted with the support of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, and a Quick Household Survey (QHS), with national coverage, was conducted
between December 2006 and February 2007 in a sample of 5,240 households. The APS will
be useful for revising the coverage of production and value-added for agriculture. Even
though the QHS did not collect data on income and the collected expenditure data reflect
seasonality, the results of the QHS, if adjusted, would be valuable to update the basket and
weights of the CPI (currently, corresponding to 1986) and compile poverty and other social
indicators.

7
5.
The 2007 mission provided hands-on assistance to prepare a business
register/sample frame and a database on employment and compensation of employees,
basic source data for improving the coverage of the national accounts. The mission
revised estimates on oil and non-oil GDP for the period 2000–06 with 2000 as base year, and
reclassified manufacturing of oil and gas derivatives in the non-oil sector following the UN
International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC,) Rev. 3.
According to ISIC, the division 11 of Mining and Quarrying includes the extraction of crude
petroleum and natural gas, owing to their extractive nature and the exhaustibility of the
output. On the other hand, production of liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and
methanol are classified in manufacturing, a division of the secondary sector. The mission
explained the methodology of the revised series to the authorities and the General Directorate
of Statistics and National Accounts (GDSNA) staff and left a methodological note describing
the results for 2006, suggesting institutional implementation of the revised approach.
6.
The collection of prices for the CPI was discontinued in June 2005 because of
budgetary reasons, and reestablished in February 2006. Priority had been given to the
International Comparison Program (ICP) exercise. The GDSNA revised the official figures
for the period July 2005–January 2006 by using the data from the ICP, which include a
limited subset of prices, and carrying the last reported price for the CPI forward. The 2007
mission observed that some relative prices for February 2006 were atypical and
recommended revising price imputations for the period July 2005–January 2006 by using the
price change of similar products, the price change of the related group/class of products, or
its historical trend.
7.
As regards the institutional framework, the statistical legislation is quite recent
(2001) and is, in general, adequate to regulate the statistical system. However, the decree
to create the NIS has not been passed. In addition, the resources devoted to the statistical
function are insufficient as only one person is assigned to the national accounts unit and three
to the CPI unit. GDP estimates are prepared by the BEAC, rather than by the GDSNA. The
Minister of Finance and Planning informed the mission of his commitment to improve
statistics and requested assistance to establish the NIS and train the staff. The assistance will
be provided by Central AFRITAC. The World Bank has also signed a service agreement with
Equatorial Guinea to provide technical assistance for compiling poverty indicators and other
assistance in statistics.
8.
Real sector statistics reported to STA (IFS) are limited to GDP (without
breakdown by sector or expenditure category), exports, and imports. The February 2007
issue of IFS includes data for GDP through 2005 and exports and imports through 2005.
Export and import data are provided to AFR. Priorities for the period ahead include
production of basic statistics, implementation of the System of National Accounts, 1993,
updating the reference period of the national accounts (1985), and updating the CPI’s basket
and weights.

8
Government Finance Statistics
9.
Following technical assistance from France, there have been some improvements
in fiscal accounting. Further improvements are needed, particularly in procuring timely and
accurate data from the Debt-Service Unit (Caja Autónoma de la Deuda Pública). Equatorial
Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics
and the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. However, the authorities provide budget
execution data to AFR although full information on the reconciliation with the monetary
accounts is still lacking. The 2006 STA mission reviewed government finance statistics and
found that coverage remained incomplete, there was no functional classification of
expenditure, which was critical, and dissemination practices needed improvement. The fiscal
data are not subject to any internal process of verification as internal and external audit
capability remains weak.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
10.
The BEAC regularly reports monetary, interest rates, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in IFS, but delays occur in the submission of data to STA. A 2002 monetary and
financial statistics mission (1) reviewed the structure of the financial system and the
procedures used for compiling monetary and financial statistics; (2) provided technical
assistance to the staff of the BEAC National Directorate in addressing data collection,
compilation, and dissemination problems, and in improving the analytical usefulness of the
monetary statistics; and (3) briefed the authorities on the methodology in the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM), and initiated steps to facilitate its implementation. An
action plan has been designed for implementing the recommendations but action is pending.
In particular, the grouping of institutional units in general government and the public sector
should be permanently revised and updated to facilitate the reconciliation of monetary and
fiscal indicators on net credit to government.
11.
The accuracy of monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border movements
of BEAC issued banknotes among Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l'Afrique
Centrale (CEMAC) member countries. About 60 percent of banknotes issued in Equatorial
Guinea by the BEAC national directorate circulate in Cameroon and only 26 percent remain
in the country, while currency in circulation in Equatorial Guinea includes some 18 percent
of banknotes from Cameroon and as much from Gabon.
12.
The BEAC started in mid-2007 a project to migrate monetary statistics of member
countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the MFSM. As a part of this project, a
regional workshop was organized by the BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of
source data from commercial banks to the MFSM concepts and framework. STA participated
in this workshop to provide guidance and advice. Submission of data by the BEAC using the
standardized report forms is pending.

9
External Sector Statistics
13.
Although the BEAC produces balance of payments data, delays are long and the data
suffer from significant inconsistencies with other datasets. At present, BOP data are often not
derived from records of current stocks or flows. Statistics are still largely constructed on a
historical basis from estimates rather than actual financial and customs records, including
information on the hydrocarbons sector available to some parts of the government. Customs
data have improved since the implementation of the Central African Customs and Economic
Union reform and the deployment of customs brigades. However, data analysis is still
hampered by the lack of computerization. While some progress has been made in compiling
current and financial account items, the lack of current source data is a key concern. Balance
of payments data are published in the International Financial Statistics Yearbook through
1996 only.
External Debt
14.
Data on the outstanding stock of external debt and projections of debt-service
payments are hampered by serious inconsistencies. The debt service paid—reported by the
Debt-Service Unit—is often significantly different from that reported by the budget and the
Paris Club, as the unit usually lacks precise information on payments made. Also, details
regarding scheduled debt-service obligations are not incorporated into the budget in a
systematic and timely manner. Debt-service projections beyond the following year are only
provided in a highly aggregated form and some debt service takes place outside the DebtService Unit. The authorities have started a major inventory of debt and are beginning to
address the capacity constraints in the Debt-Service Unit through training and new staffing.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
November 3, 2008
1.
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued. It does not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Staff have revised the projections for Equatorial Guinea to reflect the significant changes in
hydrocarbons prices and exchange rates in the WEO projections of October 28, 2008 compared to
those in September 2008, which were used in preparation of the staff report. The revised projections
show a weaker overall fiscal balance, relative to GDP, and non-oil fiscal balance, relative to non-oil
GDP, and a weaker external current account balance and balance of payments, relative to GDP.
However, foreign asset cover remains ample over the projection period. The revised estimates
reinforce a key message on the need to scale back the proposed large increase in 2009 capital
spending.
3.
This revision incorporates revised price projections for 2008 to 2013 for oil, natural gas, and
hydrocarbon derivatives, and for key bilateral exchange rates, chiefly the U.S. dollar-euro exchange
rate. Oil prices have been lowered by 7 percent for 2008 (annual average) and by 24 percent for
2009-13. Other hydrocarbons prices have also been reduced. The U.S. dollar-euro exchange rate
shows an average 9 percent more appreciated U.S. dollar over the projection period. Given the
conservative price assumptions that hydrocarbons investors had incorporated into their investment
profiles, staff have left foreign direct investment and hydrocarbons sector growth assumptions
unchanged. In combination with largely unchanged public spending assumptions, non-oil growth
should be little affected.
4.
Table 1 presents the revised key projections. The fiscal surplus is now projected at
16.9 percent of GDP in 2008, declining to a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2009, compared to an
estimated surplus of 17.1 percent and 3.2 percent of GDP, respectively. The non-oil deficit is
projected to remain at 47.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2008 and worsen to 78.4 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2009 compared to 73.1 percent of non-oil GDP. Similarly, the external current account
balance is projected to weaken to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2008 and -15.8 percent of GDP in 2009
and the overall balance of payments would decline to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008 and -3.0 percent
of GDP in 2009. Given the high foreign asset cover, it is projected to decline to a still ample
12.7 months of next year’s imports in 2008 and to 11.5 in 2009 and remain at comfortable levels
through the medium-term projection.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 27, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
On November 3, 2008 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea.1
Background
Equatorial Guinea’s petroleum-based economy has become an important contributor to
growth in central Africa. The National Development Plan (NDP) adopted in 2007 will
guide the government’s economic strategy until 2020.
Economic growth recovered sharply in 2007. The opening of a new oil field in late 2006
and a liquefied natural gas facility in mid 2007, supported by increased public
infrastructure spending, lifted 2007 economic growth to an estimated 21.4 percent. In
2008, despite a small decrease in primary extraction of oil, a full year of liquefied natural
gas production is expected to lead to moderate growth. Rising international food and oil
prices are contributing to inflationary pressures. The price for staple foods rose sharply
in 2007, while the strong euro, lagged adjustment of refined fuel prices, public spending
restraint, and better monetary management helped avoid a sharp rise in prices. Inflation
is expected to jump in 2008, mainly because of pent up pressures from rising import
prices.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
High oil, gas, and derivatives prices contributed to a strong external current account and
a balance of payments surplus in 2007. Gross official foreign assets, held in both the
Bank of Central African States (BEAC) and abroad, rose to about 21 months of non-oil
imports of goods and services by the end of 2007. The current account and balance of
payments are expected to strengthen in 2008, reflecting the rise in oil prices.
The fiscal surplus was high though it narrowed in 2007 as a result of increased capital
spending and some weakening of revenues relative to GDP. The non-oil primary deficit,
a key fiscal indicator, improved to 49.7 percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting budgetary
restraint and growth of non-oil GDP. The 2008 non-oil deficit is expected to decline
slightly, with only a minor weakening of the overall fiscal surplus.
Implementation of the Social Development Fund has been slow. About 12 twelve
projects were agreed on, to be implemented with assistance from the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), in education, health, water and sewerage, gender
equality, and community development. Funds were allocated in the 2008 budget but the
government has yet to approve their disbursement so work can begin.
A number of measures are being taken to improve tax and customs administration,
including the use of pre-shipment inspection. In late 2007, the authorities met the
nominal requirement for civil society participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), but have not yet met the substantive requirement. A
World Bank advisor is expected soon to begin training civil society and establishing a
terms of reference for the aggregator as a preliminary to preparing the first report.
Financial soundness indicators show a reduction in nonperforming loans and increased
returns on both assets and equity in 2007. Bank lending rates have come down in real
terms reflecting a more competitive environment, but lending is mainly concentrated in
public infrastructure projects. Consumer credit remains modest.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Equatorial Guinea’s recent robust economic performance
and sound macroeconomic policies that have strengthened fiscal sustainability. While
medium-term prospects are favorable and there has been some diversification within the
petroleum industry, the economy remains susceptible to swings in the price of oil.
Directors emphasized that a strengthening of governance and transparency and steps
toward creating a more conducive business environment will be critical to sustain
growth, promote economic diversification and private sector development, generate
employment, and reduce poverty, which remains widespread.
Directors welcomed the National Development Plan, which provides an appropriate
framework for economic and institutional reforms to diversify the economy and enhance
external competitiveness. The Plan’s focus on reducing the non-oil fiscal deficit is

3
commendable, and will help to contain inflation and to achieve long-run fiscal
sustainability.
Directors were concerned that the proposed 2009 budget is overly expansionary, and
that it contains only a small increase in the share of spending for social sectors.
Most Directors suggested reining-in capital spending on less pressing infrastructure
projects, while at the same time giving greater emphasis to human resource
development in order to raise the employment potential of nationals, reduce poverty,
and help prepare for the future tailing-off of oil production. Directors called for initiating
rapidly the programs of the Social Development Fund aimed at achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. They looked forward to the public expenditure review that is to be
undertaken by the World Bank.
Directors welcomed recent efforts to improve tax and customs administration, but noted
the scope to strengthen fiscal management and transparency as a means to promote
high-quality public spending and increase non-oil revenues. Public financial
management reforms need to be accelerated. Directors encouraged the authorities to
work with the World Bank and civil society organizations with the aim of pressing ahead
more rapidly with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and of issuing
the first EITI report for Equatorial Guinea in 2009.
The authorities are committed to working with Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC) partners to improve the governance and management of the
regional central bank (BEAC). Directors encouraged the authorities to remit Equatorial
Guinea’s official offshore assets to the BEAC and to develop a prudent strategy for
managing the country’s growing asset portfolio.
Directors considered that the pegged exchange rate regime has served Equatorial
Guinea well, and remains an appropriate anchor for macroeconomic stability. They
observed that the real exchange rate has appreciated significantly, consistent with
recent movements in the terms of trade. Going forward, it will be important for the
authorities to focus their efforts on enhancing productivity and improving
competitiveness by pressing ahead with structural reforms and maintaining a sound
fiscal stance.
Equatorial Guinea’s banking sector appears generally sound, with improvements in the
financial soundness indicators. Directors emphasized the importance of intensifying and
extending financial intermediation over the medium term, and of ensuring that small and
medium-sized businesses gain access to needed credit. They looked forward to the
operationalization of the National Agency for Financial Investigation in 2009 as part of
efforts to counter money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.

4
Directors emphasized the need to foster a supportive climate for private sector and
foreign direct investment, in part through legislation that aims to reinforce confidence
and safeguard the competitiveness of Equatorial Guinea’s oil and other investments.
Directors welcomed recent progress in improving statistics, but much work remains to
be done to ensure the adequacy of current data for surveillance. They encouraged the
authorities to establish speedily the National Statistical Institute and to ensure that it has
sufficient capacity to collect and analyze data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for the
Republic of Equatorial Guinea
November 3, 2008
I. Introduction
I would like on behalf of my Equatoguinean authorities to express sincere appreciation to
Executive Directors and Management for their valuable and continued support to Equatorial
Guinea. I also would like to thank staff for the policy advice and the constructive dialogue
during the recent discussion under the 2008 Article IV Consultation held in Malabo and Bata.
My authorities welcome the balanced set of papers on the challenges facing the country
notably in the areas of diversification of the economy, management of natural resources and
capacity building with a view to reduce poverty and meet the millennium development goals
(MDGs).
My Equatoguinean authorities are mindful of the need to seize the opportunity given by the
oil wealth to lay down solid foundations for broad based and sustained economic growth.
They are also aware of the adverse impact the current decline in oil prices will have on the
fiscal and external current accounts. In this context, they are determined to adjust their
policies accordingly and pursue their macroeconomic stabilization efforts and far-reaching
structural reforms.
Given also the need to further improve social indicators, my authorities are making progress
in the implementation of projects under the Social Development Fund (SDF) and have
adopted in 2007 the National Development Plan (NDP) defined as a reform framework for
economic diversification and the strengthening of competitiveness. Four main pillars have
been identified in implementing the NDP namely improvements in infrastructure sector,
development of human resources, good governance, and promotion of social welfare. Due to
the need for strong institutional and human capacity to speed up the implementation of the
NDP and prudent macroeconomic policies, my authorities would like to further benefit from
technical assistance from the Fund.
II. Recent Economic Developments
The economy of Equatorial Guinea has largely benefited from increases in world oil prices
which translated in an impressive economic growth and strong fiscal and external account
surpluses. After a slight decline in 2006, economic growth has picked up at 21 ½ percent in
2007 and is expected to remain strong in 2008. This performance has been supported by the
output from the new oil field opened in 2006 and a liquefied natural gas facility in mid-2007,
together with the increased public infrastructure spending.

2

Gross official foreign assets rose to about 21 months of non-oil imports of goods and services
by the end of 2007. However, for 2008, given the decline in world oil prices, gross official
foreign assets will drop to 12.7 months of imports cover. Inflation driven by increased food
and fuel prices is expected to rise to 6 percent in 2008 from 3.7 in 2007. Broad money and
private credit increased by 41.5 percent and 40.5 percent respectively in 2007 due mainly to
the expansion in public spending and short-term lending for working capital on public
infrastructure programs. The financial sector remains sound in 2007 with the reduction in
nonperforming loans, the decrease in banks’ lending rates and increase in returns on both
assets and equity.
The fiscal surplus narrowed in 2007 following increase in capital spending and some
weakening of revenues relative to GDP. Nevertheless the non-oil primary deficit, defined as
a key fiscal indicator improved to about 49.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007 against 64
percent in 2006 reflecting budgetary restraint and growth of non-oil GDP. Moreover,
expenditures were kept in line with budget projections, and this trend is expected to continue
in 2008.
The authorities made a strategic purchase of petroleum assets from Devon, one of the oil
companies operating in the country, for a total amount of USD 2 billon, which increased the
government share from 5.0 to 23.75 percent in Zafiro field. As Zafiro is the main oil
producing field in the country, this expenditure today will increase government revenues
tomorrow.
On the external front, sustained high international prices of export commodities, including
oil, gas, and derivatives, coupled with tight fiscal policy have helped consolidate both, the
current account surplus and the overall balance of payments in 2007. In 2008, the significant
decline in world oil prices has led to a revision of the current account surplus which is now
projected to stand at 10.2 percent of GDP against 11.4 percent.
The authorities have pursued their efforts in implementing the EITI Initiative and improving
fiscal management and transparency. They are hopeful that the World Bank technical
assistance will help them facilitate the active participation of the civil society in the EITI
exercise and prepare the first EITI report as well as the terms of reference for the aggregator.
III. Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
Real Sector
The global financial crisis together with the surge in world food prices and the volatility of
oil prices are causes of great concerns as these external shocks could deter the country’s
ability to sustain its strong economic growth. Against this background growth is predicted to

3

remain around 5 percent on average during the next five years owing to output of the new oil
field and gas facilities of Amerada Hess whose commercial production started in December
2006, and to the commercialization of oil and gas derivatives since mid 2007.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are committed to reduce the non-oil primary deficit defined as an appropriate
guide for fiscal policy in the context of high dependency on the oil sector. To achieve this
goal, the authorities increased capital expenditures to put in place supportive infrastructure.
To meet their fiscal targets and foster fiscal sustainability, the authorities are determined to
cautiously implement the budget with a view to take appropriate measures aimed at aligning
the budget with the strategic framework and pursue targeting expenditure on priorities sectors
to reduce poverty through social development and infrastructure projects. In this regard, they
plan to introduce a modest food subsidy in the 2009 budget to help alleviate the rising cost of
food for the vulnerable segment of the population. They are also hopeful that the upcoming
expenditure review with the World Bank will provide them useful guidance in the
management of public investment plan.
On the revenue side, the authorities intend to increase revenue through broadening the tax
base, including expanding taxpayers monitoring, using taxpayer identification number within
the main cities of the country, strengthening custom administration through computerization,
and the adoption of pre-shipment inspections. Moreover, the creation of a single unit in
charge of large tax-payers, in addition to reducing the number of VAT exemptions is
envisaged to enhance revenue collection. Furthermore, the authorities intend to move the
Social Security surplus from commercial banks to the central bank. They also intend to
transfer to the BEAC all government deposits held in foreign banks as the ongoing reforms
within the central bank is leaning to competitive remunerations for all public deposits.
Monetary and Financial Policies
The pegged exchange rate regime has served the economy of Equatorial Guinea well. The
authorities are aware on the need to pursue structural reforms in order to enhance
competitiveness. In 2007, BEAC, the regional central bank stepped up its efforts to mop up
excess liquidity and inflationary pressures through negative auctions and increasing bank
reserve requirements.
Equatorial Guinea’s financial system remains healthy. The authorities intend to foster the
development of the financial sector in order to help the sector further boost the non-oil
economic growth and support diversification of production and exports. In this regard, it is
important to underline the recent abolition of the maximum lending rate to enable banks to

commercially price risks of their lending function. Furthermore, the banks’ ability to enforce
contracts will be strengthened.
My authorities are also committed to pursue their efforts geared towards combating money
laundering, over invoicing and tax evasion. To this end, the National Agency for Financial
Investigation will be fully operational in 2009.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
My authorities will continue to implement needed structural reforms in order to improve the
business climate, external competitiveness and make great inroads in poverty reduction. They
are also determined to further improve fiscal management with reforms in the budgeting
process.
In their sustained efforts to promote private sector development, the authorities plan to
improve the business environment through training of the local work force, access to credit,
sound interpretation and implementation of the 2006 petroleum law to keep Equatorial
Guinea competitive with other oil-producing countries. The authorities are also committed to
bring about significant improvements in financial services, labor quality, education and
health care services as well as utilities and transportation infrastructure. With regard to labor
force in particular, vocational training and educational opportunities will be reinforced.
With regard to the fight against poverty and accelerate the pace of meeting the MDGs, my
authorities have established a Social Development Fund (SDF) and a National Development
Plan (NDP). The projects under these initiatives are fully integrated into the fiscal
framework. Furthermore implementation of the Social Development Fund (SDF) created in
2006 with the assistance of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is
underway. In its current phase, 12 projects have been identified in education, health, water
and sewerage, gender equality, and community development. All of these projects have been
incorporated in the 2008 budget.
In order to address poverty reduction in a broader program, my authorities are fully
committed to implement the National Development Plan (NDP) adopted in November 2007
following the second Economic Conference: Equatorial Guinea 2020 Vision, held in Bata.
The realization of the NDP objectives will foster diversification from the dependence on the
oil sector and accelerate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
On statistical issues, my authorities in their decision to establish a National Statistical
Institute are determined to improve the quality and timeliness of data needed for better policy
formulation and implementation. In particular, the authorities are making efforts to enhance
human capacity, improve the quality of the CPI by extending its coverage to the other cities

besides Malabo and Bata as well as strengthening the treatment of national accounts. They
are grateful to the Fund and other development partners including the World Bank,
AFRISTAT and AFRITAC for the TA provided in this area.
IV. Conclusion
I would like to reiterate the strong commitment of my Equatoguinean authorities to continue
implementing Fund policy advice in pursuing their NDP in order to achieve a sustained
higher and diversified economic growth and reduce poverty. They will continue to build
capacity and enhance transparency in oil resources management through implementation of
EITI with the assistance of the World Bank and other development partners
