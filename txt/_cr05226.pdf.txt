Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
For the 2005 Consultation with the Netherlands
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Michael T. Hadjimichael
May 25, 2005

The 2005 Article IV discussions were held in Amsterdam and The Hague during March 31–
April 11, 2005. The staff team comprised Messrs. Feldman (head), Hofman, and Nadal De
Simone (all EUR), and Mr. Walsh (ICM). It met with the minister of finance, the governor
and other representatives of the central bank (DNB) and financial supervision, senior staff of
several government ministries and agencies, including the Bureau for Economic Policy
Analysis (CPB), the Competition Authority (NMa), and the head of the Social and Economic
Council, representatives of labor unions and employer organizations, parliament, the
financial sector, including banks and pension funds, and academics.
After early elections in January 2003, a center-right coalition government comprising the
Christian Democrats, Liberals, and the center-left D66 took office in May 2003. Its term is
through 2007. While a deputy prime minister from the small D66 party resigned in late
March, testing the cohesion of the coalition government, his party did not break away.
In concluding the 2004 Article IV Consultation on September 8, 2004, Executive Directors
expressed concern over the depth of the recent downturn, the significant weakening of the
public finances in recent years, and the prospect of falling potential growth. While
commending the authorities’ efforts to restore fiscal balance, they emphasized the need to
sustain such efforts and continue with labor and product market reforms to raise potential
output.
The Netherlands has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Appendix I). It subscribes to
the SDDS, and economic data are adequate to conduct effective surveillance (Appendix II).
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and agreed to the publication of
the staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The recovery has so far failed to gather steam, and growth is expected to
remain significantly below potential this year, with large uncertainties over confidence and
its effect on consumption. However, fundamentals are showing improvement, and the
expansion is expected to gather pace in 2006. After breaching the Maastricht deficit ceiling
by a small margin in 2003, the fiscal deficit was reduced to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2004—the
result of significant expenditure-led structural adjustment of about 1¼ percentage points of
GDP. Raising participation and productivity are important for boosting the economy’s
potential and reducing pressures on the public finances in the face of population aging. The
authorities are moving ahead with various reforms in this regard, though political
compromise tends to affect the pace and final design of some policies.
Policy discussions focused on the following areas:
●
Fiscal policy. There was broad agreement on the merits of sustaining fiscal
consolidation in the medium term, with a view to preparing for aging and buttressing
confidence. While part of the way there, further measures are needed to ensure cumulative
fiscal adjustment of ¾ percentage point of GDP during 2005–07 as recommended by staff.
Moreover, in light of elections scheduled in 2007 and the need to bolster confidence, early
action would be beneficial. Recommended measures exploit the synergies between fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms that raise employment rates and potential growth—for
example by rationalizing and restraining unemployment benefits and rent subsidies.
Staff found that the CPB, as an independent economic forecaster and evaluator of
public sector policies, plays an important role in disciplining fiscal policy. Recent measures
to improve coordination between various levels of government also strengthen fiscal policy,
but such coordination should be made a permanent feature of the fiscal framework.
Refinements to the expenditure ceilings would further enhance their transparency and
effectiveness.
●
Structural reforms. The authorities have implemented or are in the process of
implementing key reforms, including by tightening disability and unemployment benefits and
early retirement arrangements, lessening inactivity traps, enhancing competition, and
reducing the administrative burden. While welcoming the progress being made, staff urged
greater ambition, notably by cautioning against a potential weakening of disability reform
and actions that offset the impact of eliminating fiscal incentives for early retirement, and by
further shortening the duration of unemployment benefits. Staff also recommended additional
measures to enhance innovation and productivity.
●
Financial sector. The financial system remains sound, resilient to potential adverse
shocks, and well supervised. The authorities’ efforts to preserve financial stability are
welcome, including their responsiveness to the recommendations made in the Fund’s
Financial Sector Stability Assessment of last year.

-5-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
After a long period of comparatively strong economic performance (Figure 1),
the Netherlands hit a difficult stretch going into the new millennium (Figure 2). Growth
was relatively poor during 2000–03 (Table 1). It turned negative in 2003 for the first time
in 20 years. A weakening external environment contributed to the sharp slowdown of
activity. Wealth effects amplified the cycle, as the positive effects of equity and house price
increases before 2000 were later reversed when equity prices fell sharply while the
momentum of house price increases moderated. Pension fund exposure to equities also
amplified the cycle, with contribution rates being cut during the stock market boom of the
late 1990s, only to be hiked during the bust in recent years.
2.
Deteriorating external competitiveness has also been restraining export
performance and overall growth. Wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices
(with inflation peaking at over 5 percent in 2001) and, along with a later appreciation of the
euro, weakened external competitiveness. Wage pressures reflected tightness in the labor
market that had built up in the second half of the 1990s (Text Figure). Although the
Netherlands still had a considerable labor reserve, it went untapped for lack of reform. This
was especially the case with respect to disability, a long-acknowledged haven of hidden
unemployment. The loss in export competitiveness has not been especially apparent in
aggregate market share data, but more detailed assessments using constant market share
analysis raise warning flags.1 In addition, falling market shares have been in evidence in
volume terms (Figure 3).

3.
A recovery that looked reasonably firm at the start of 2004 failed to gather
steam. The pickup in growth in 2004 was much weaker than during past upswings
(Figure 4). While fiscal tightening withdrew stimulus, the weak performance was mostly due
to the behavior of private consumption, which remained unusually lackluster. Disposable
income and (un)employment cannot fully explain the sharp fall in consumption growth
since 2000. In addition to wealth effects, less tangible factors affecting confidence, partly
related to policy uncertainty, have clearly been at play.2
4.
Inflation is now subdued, and there is little pressure from wages looking ahead.
Despite the increases in energy prices, year-on-year CPI inflation was only 1½ percent in
March 2005. A special factor has been the ongoing “supermarket war,” in which increased
competition has contributed to a 3½ percent decline in food and beverage prices in 2004.
Wage growth was subdued in 2004 (about 1½ percent), reflecting the two-year economywide wage moderation agreement of the social partners that aimed at improving
competitiveness. Although the agreement allows for somewhat more discretion in 2005, the
strength of the euro, moderate pace of economic activity, and slack labor market conditions
are expected to keep a lid on wage pressures.
5.
Public finances deteriorated markedly during 2000–03, but there was a
significant reversal in 2004. The general government balance worsened by almost
5½ percentage points of GDP during 2000–03 as a result of both cyclical and structural
effects (Table 2). Structural effects—amounting to roughly 2 percentage points of GDP—
included the 2001 tax reform and increases in health care and education spending. The
3 percent Maastricht deficit ceiling was unexpectedly breached in 2003, also reflecting a
surprise deterioration in local government accounts to a deficit of 0.6 percentage point of
GDP after years of running close to balance. The deficit was then reduced in 2004 to
2.3 percent of GDP, primarily through expenditure restraint (see below).
6.
Monetary conditions have tightened in the last few years (Figure 5). They were
loose through much of the late 1990s, contributing to the boom. They tightened after 2000,
compounding the downturn.3
II. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
The discussions focused on key measures to bolster confidence and enhance
growth prospects while ensuring fiscal sustainability and resilience to population aging.
The marked deterioration in the public finances during 2000–03 underscored the benefits of
ensuring significant fiscal consolidation during an economic upturn and the confidence it

would bring. On top of strengthening fiscal policy and confidence, restoring external
competitiveness was seen as an essential element of sustaining economic recovery. A key
goal of structural reforms was to stimulate high employment and growth, with a view to
generating the resources without which it would be virtually impossible to keep the public
finances sound while maintaining social expenditure in the face of an aging population.
Box 1 summarizes the implementation of previous IMF recommendations.
Box 1: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal Policy: Past recommendations included structural fiscal adjustment of at least ½ percentage point
of GDP per year during the government’s term, closer coordination between the central government and
the local governments, and refinements to enhance the transparency of the fiscal framework. Fiscal
consolidation in 2004 of about 1¼ percentage points of GDP, in structural terms, represents substantial
progress. The authorities have improved coordination between various levels of government. Any
decisions on the fiscal framework would not be taken before a new coalition agreement, although some
preparatory analysis is being considered.
Labor Market Reform: Broadly in line with Fund advice, fiscal incentives for early retirement were
abolished; reform of the disability scheme has started, with further reforms planned for 2006; the
authorities have been gradually raising the labor tax credit to reduce inactivity traps; reform of
employment legislation is being discussed; and decisions on tightening the unemployment scheme are
expected soon (but will probably be less ambitious than Fund recommendations). Recommendations not
yet taken on board include adjusting the minimum wage and taking into account life expectancy in
determining the retirement age. Calls for greater wage differentiation have not resulted in notable
changes.
Product Market Reform: The Fund has generally supported the authorities’ liberalization program.
The government remains committed to a 25 percent reduction of the administrative burden by 2007, a
new corporate governance code was introduced in 2004, and the powers of the competition authority are
gradually and continually being increased.
Financial Sector: The authorities are making significant progress in implementing the recommendations
from last year’s Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA).

A. Near-Term Outlook
8.
Although there was major uncertainty over
confidence and its effect on private consumption, there
was consensus that fundamentals had shown
improvement. Corporate balance sheets had strengthened,
and profit margins were starting to turn up, boding well for
investment (Text Figure). The foreign sector was seen as the
main near-term driver of growth. Both the authorities and
staff saw wage moderation bringing the deterioration in
external competitiveness to an end, with competitiveness
then starting to improve in 2006. With respect to the outlook
for consumption, the considerable margin of uncertainty was

reflected in the range of official forecasts (Text Table). The CPB projected negative private
consumption growth in 2005 in light of an estimated drop in disposable income. The DNB’s

All agreed that certain downside risks would bear
close watching. Higher-than-expected oil prices, a
significant further appreciation of the euro, and slower-thanexpected growth in trading partners were downside factors.
Staff recognized, relative to its baseline, that the DNB’s and
CPB’s projections of private consumption suggested both
upside and downside risks.4 However, there was a particular
concern that a possible decline in house prices, resulting
from an increase in interest rates, could have a negative
effect on consumption.5 Staff emphasized that this downside
risk was accentuated by high household debt, which could
result in a renewed increase in household saving
(Text Figure). Mitigating the risk from falling house prices,
the authorities pointed to empirical work at the CPB
suggesting that house price adjustments were more sluggish
when prices were falling than when they were rising.6

10.
Separately, as a statistical matter, the authorities identified several institutional
changes that would have a significant impact on economic data (Appendix II). The
authorities and staff agreed that the impact would have to be communicated effectively to
avoid misunderstandings. For example, while the statistical adjustments required to reflect
the institutional changes would produce significant movements in expenditure components, it
would need to be made clear that overall GDP growth would not be affected.

The DNB, at the time of the discussions, was, however, starting to update its projection for June publication
and indicated it might revise its 2005 forecast, especially for private consumption.

In addition, the concentration of debt is toward high-income earners, which may also serve to mitigate some of
the risk.

-9-

B. Fiscal Policy
11.
Recent developments give reason for optimism. The deficit reduction to 2.3 percent
of GDP in 2004 resulted in a structural narrowing by about 1¼ percentage points of GDP, of
which 0.9 percentage point was from discretionary spending measures.7 The fiscal effort
reflected a virtual freeze of public sector wages and social security benefits, a reduction in
the coverage of public health insurance, the abolition of a disability insurance scheme for the
self-employed, and many smaller measures. It also helped that government departments did
not exhaust their budget ceilings. A somewhat lower-than-expected deficit of local
governments and unexpected windfalls from tax and gas revenues and social security
spending contributed as well.8
12.
The discussion turned to fiscal policy for the remainder of the government’s
term. Staff pointed to the considerable benefits of structural fiscal adjustment of at least
½ percentage point of GDP per year, on average, during the government’s term (2004–07),
which is broadly consistent with the original amount implied by the coalition agreement.9
Adjustment of this magnitude would help to return to a sustainable path for the public
finances and help prepare for population aging (also see ¶16). However, the authorities had
recently diverged from the 2005 budget in response to increasing demands for additional
spending and acknowledged that the political environment made new spending cuts difficult
going forward. Nevertheless, there was margin under the spending ceilings, and structural
adjustment of about 0.4 percentage point of GDP had already been embedded in the
government’s plans and was therefore in the

windfalls for deficit and debt reduction.

7

While estimating the structural deficit has its difficulties (see Table 2), a much smaller part of the structural
adjustment here was from the revenue side, which is where the breakdown of cyclical and structural
components is the most problematic.
8

As analyzed in Recent Fiscal Developments in the Netherlands, IMF Country Report 04/301, temporary
windfalls were in the past used to fund permanent spending increases, contributing to earlier fiscal difficulties.
9

When a new government is formed, the coalition partners negotiate a detailed policy program outlining the
measures to be implemented during the government’s term in office and including expenditure ceilings.

- 10 -

13.
While noting the strengths of the Dutch fiscal framework, staff pointed to
possible refinements.10 Strengths include multi-year real expenditure ceilings, the
specification of measures to achieve them, and the play of automatic stabilizers on the
revenue side (subject to the Maastricht deficit ceiling). However, the local government
accounts are compiled on a different basis than those of the central government, which has
allowed relatively wide fluctuations in local government fiscal balances when put in EMUconsistent terms. Therefore, ensuring timely information-sharing and close coordination
between central and local governments was deemed essential for avoiding the adverse fiscal
surprises of the past. To this end, the authorities explained that they were experimenting with
a kind of “national stability pact”—aimed at improving the coordination of policies at
various levels of government—with a view to putting durable measures in place. To enhance
the transparency of the expenditure ceilings and their accessibility to a broader audience,
staff recommended aligning the ceilings more closely to national accounts concepts and
broadening their coverage, while focusing strictly on spending by ending the practice of
treating nontax revenue as negative expenditures. The authorities expressed interest in these
recommendations, but changes to the framework would not be made before the next coalition
agreement.
14.
The CPB plays an important role in keeping fiscal discipline. The authorities
explained that the CPB is a highly valued independent bureau providing macroeconomic
forecasts and economic policy analysis. One of its key roles is to publicly assess consistency
between the government’s policies and its fiscal and other economic objectives, thereby
fostering accountability and fiscal discipline. While the CPB does not explicitly prescribe
fiscal targets or policy measures, its analysis strongly influences perceptions—on the part of
a range of economic players including representatives of parliament, the business sector, and
the public at large—of what constitutes “good policy.” This is especially the case because the
CPB has established a strong reputation for high standards and impartiality, and thus enjoys
considerable credibility.
15.
Over the longer term, the Netherlands is
in a relatively favorable position to deal with
population aging. In addition to lower dependency
ratios (Text Table), the Dutch pension system has
built up large reserves through the fully-funded
second pillar. Private sector pension income is also
taxable and provides a substantial offset to the
fiscal cost of aging. Consequently, pressures on
Dutch tax and premium rates may be lower than in
other countries with more pronounced population
aging (also a favorable situation from the
standpoint of external competitiveness).

16.
Staff analysis suggests that fiscal pressures from aging should be manageable. In
their earlier analysis, the authorities had developed a strategy to cope with aging, involving a
swift buildup of fiscal surpluses by 2007 and a corresponding run-down of debt, thus
generating savings on the interest bill that would be used to cover the cost of aging.11
However, the fiscal balance has been worse than the strategy envisaged. Recognizing this,
the authorities were beginning to update their aging strategy. Appendix III presents long-term
debt and fiscal sustainability scenarios prepared by staff, and the standard debt sustainability
analysis template. In finding that the situation is manageable, the analysis also shows the
need for sustained fiscal adjustment (with staff recommending continued adjustment in
structural terms after the government’s term) and illustrates the importance of undertaking
structural reforms.
C. Raising Participation and Productivity
17.
Raising participation and productivity are important not only for boosting the
economy’s growth potential, but also for reducing pressures on the public finances.
Structural reforms aimed at these goals would therefore help avoid undesirable tax increases
in the future (which would impair economic activity and burden later generations) or unduly
sacrifice public services (including those related to population aging). While overall
employment rates in terms of workers are at about the European average, the Netherlands has
the lowest employment rate when measured in hours (Figure 6). In addition, there have been
considerable pockets of inactivity, with a large portion of the potential labor force on the
disability rolls. Against this background, the discussions focused on efforts to lower
inactivity. In addition, while the overall level of productivity is high, it was recognized that
productivity growth was an important second plank for boosting the economy’s potential.
18.
Staff was encouraged by the already favorable effects of disability reforms. The
authorities explained various contributing factors. First, as
the result of a more effective “gate-keeper” and the impact Inflows into the Disability Scheme
(In thousands of persons)
of firm-level experience rating in premiums, inflows into
disability were falling (Text Table). Second, the extension

19.
While further reforms of disability are expected to be introduced in 2006, there
was some question about their effect.12 The new reforms aim to restrict access to those that
are fully disabled while strengthening work incentives for the partially disabled—goals
welcomed by staff. However, staff noted that, under current proposals, the replacement rate
for the fully disabled may be increased and experience rating of disability premiums
abolished, depending on certain criteria with regards to new disability inflows. As evidenced
by studies by the CPB, such actions run the risk of weakening the overall effect of the
disability reforms and putting additional pressure on public resources.
20.
The abolition of fiscal incentives for early retirement should help to raise
participation, though some recent actions would appear to have a dampening effect.
Staff emphasized that moving to actuarially neutral pension arrangements would, over time,
boost participation because pension entitlements would fairly reflect each additional year of
work. In this sense, removing the fiscal incentives for collective early retirement
arrangements—which had unduly favored older workers—was a step in the right direction.
However, the effects in the near term depended on the extent to which the social partners
would offset the intent of the reform in new collective agreements. In addition, the authorities
were introducing a new “life-course scheme,”13 whose impact on participation was uncertain.
The broad objective of this individual time-saving scheme, which would receive favorable
tax treatment, was to increase personal and career flexibility. This, various officials noted,
could advance economic objectives, by having a positive effect on investment in human
capital and enhancing the attractiveness of the workplace, thus raising the supply of labor.
However, this scheme subsidizes time off work, as some officials noted. In addition, there is
still a significant risk that the scheme—including because prefunding could be a part of
collective bargaining agreements—will be used as a subsidized route to early retirement. In a
broader context, staff continued to emphasize that changes in life expectancy should be taken
into account in determining the official retirement age.
21.
Though more is needed to lessen significant poverty and inactivity traps, recent
measures have moved in the right direction. The authorities noted that recent changes to
the real estate tax and the planned amendments to the child credit,14 due to come into effect
in 2006, should reduce spikes in marginal effective tax rates.15 In addition, the scheduled
increases in the earned income tax credit for 2005–06 would further reduce poverty traps.
However, more could be done on this front. Staff also indicated that reform of rent subsidy

arrangements could have a particularly large effect in making work pay for lower-income
earners. Rent subsidy arrangements, as some officials noted, entail large budgetary costs and,
due to abrupt withdrawal, contribute to high marginal effective tax rates. To balance housing
market benefits across income groups, this could be combined with a withdrawal of mortgage
interest tax relief, implemented in a way that avoids disruptive macroeconomic effects. Staff
also encouraged the authorities to examine the minimum wage and its links to several social
benefits, with an eye toward finding ways of further lessening traps and stimulating the
demand for low-skilled labor.
22.
The merits of reducing the generosity of unemployment benefits was widely
recognized. The importance of comprehensive benefit reform to avoid shifts from one
category of inactivity to another was widely recognized, too. Staff emphasized that while
high replacement rates can be justified in the initial months of unemployment, over time
benefits should decline quickly to encourage a rapid return to employment and avoid benefit
dependency. In addition, staff expressed the view that a maximum period much shorter than
three years would seem sufficient for unemployment benefits to serve their purpose from the
standpoint of job search. Subsequent to the mission, on April 15, the Social and Economic
Council proposed, among other things, to reduce regular benefit duration from 5 years to
3 years and 2 months, a period longer than recommended by staff.
23.
To raise productivity growth, labor market reforms would need to go beyond the
narrow focus of raising participation. Productivity depends, in part, on innovation, and the
authorities’ “Innovation Platform” emphasizes the need to improve the innovation potential
of the Netherlands, including by creating a more favorable climate for entrepreneurs and
knowledge workers. Staff noted that innovation is related to the ease in undertaking
experimentation and exiting when appropriate—a process that works best when resources
can be reallocated smoothly.16 Thus, staff suggested that the agenda include an assessment of
employment protection legislation, which is among the most restrictive in Europe according
to information compiled by the OECD and acts as a tax on new hiring and labor
reallocation.17 Staff also encouraged the social partners to allow for greater wage
differentiation in collective labor agreements. This would help to attract labor to higher
productivity companies and sectors, while strengthening the incentives for human capital
investment. As the authorities have noted, it would, however, be difficult to implement in
light of traditional preferences for an egalitarian wage distribution.
24.
Product market reform was seen as another avenue for boosting productivity
growth. Although the Netherlands has made significant progress in improving the
functioning of product markets—including through the liberalization of network industries—
the benefits of enhanced competition have not yet reached all markets. In this context, the
16

A survey of SMEs, published a month after the discussions, indicated that a prime concern on their part was
that such legislation hampered their ability to adjust quickly enough to market conditions.

increasingly effective enforcement efforts of the competition agency (the NMa) are most
welcome. Looking ahead, the NMa will be made formally independent in July of this year.
The NMa’s powers could also be extended to assess fines on members of associations (in
restricting competition), implement structural remedies against abuse of dominance, and
introduce criminal penalties and individual sanction.
25.
The authorities are progressing in their goal to reduce the administrative burden
by 25 percent. They were confident that this ambitious goal would be met, aided by
estimates of the size of the administrative costs from which the reduction would take place.
D. Financial Sector18
26.
The financial system continues to be sound, resilient to potential adverse shocks,
and well supervised (Table 3). Despite reduced interest margins, banks’ returns improved
last year as credit (especially for mortgages) increased. Insurance firms and pension funds,
like banks, also benefited from higher security prices, though the current low-yield
environment, especially if prolonged, poses challenges. However, the quality of supervision
is high, and stress tests under the FSAP have demonstrated the resilience of the financial
system. The new supervisory arrangements for pensions improve transparency and represent
a more risk-based approach than before. In addition, with respect to solvency requirements,
the flexibility in the timeframe for making up shortfalls in the coverage ratio is welcome.19
This timeframe rightly tries to balance the goal of avoiding procyclical effects without
unduly prolonging adjustment. Supervisors and policymakers will, nevertheless, have to
monitor the macroeconomic implications of any changes in contribution rates that result from
new solvency requirements, and the risks taken by banks and insurance companies in a lowyield environment, including in view of high loan-to-value ratios.20 In addition, it is

18

This section draws on the more detailed material in an accompanying selected issues paper on the financial
sector.

19

Under the new arrangements, scheduled to come into effect in January 2006, the anticipated payout to
beneficiaries with respect to indexation will be made clearer, and pensions funds will be required to achieve a
coverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of the present value of assets over liabilities) implied by a 97½ percent probability
of meeting their obligations. In cases where indexation is not guaranteed, the latter implies a coverage ratio, on
average, of 130 percent (the current average is 124 percent), to be met within a period agreed on with the
supervisor not exceeding 15 years. However, if the ratio falls below 105 percent, it has to be restored within one
year, except at times of severe macroeconomic downturns or systemic risk, in which case more latitude would
be given.
20

As mortgage lending has picked up, loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) for new loans have reached an average of
about 105 percent—though the average for all loans is considerably lower. While LTVs are not regulated
directly, supervisory regulations generally pertain to the ratio of income to value—that is on the ability to pay
rather than on the ability to reclaim value. High LTVs reflect the tax deductibility of mortgage interest
payments.

important to ensure that the solvency requirements for health insurance funds after the
planned reforms in 2006 are at an appropriate level.21
27.
Staff recognizes the authorities’ efforts to help preserve financial stability with
their responsiveness to the recommendations made in last year’s FSSA. As shown in
Box 2, actions have already been taken on virtually all of these recommendations. The
authorities’ desire to move to a risk-based solvency framework for the insurance sector,
broadly analogous to what has been done in the banking sector, was also welcomed. While
they felt that current supervisory practice met high standards, the authorities considered that
the prudential norms being discussed under the so-called Solvency I framework were not
sufficiently risk-based. Thus, they wanted to accelerate the development and introduction of
recommendations for prudential supervision of insurance under the Solvency II framework.

Actions Taken

Spell out clearly the role of the minister of finance, as applicable
in those few areas where autonomy is not fully delegated
to the supervisor.

Starting in 2004, the approval of the minister of finance is only
needed if one of the five largest banks or insurers takes a participation
in each other.

Ensure that the Authority for Financial Markets has the power to
cooperate with securities supervisors internationally even when there
is no "domestic interest."

In the new Financial Supervision Act to be enacted on
January 1, 2006.

Continue to work with cross-border counterparts to further improve
securities settlement arrangements.

Improvements being made through promoting the use of delivery of
securities against payment and supporting Euroclear's single settlement platform. The market infrastructure part of the new Financial
Supervision Act is expected to come into effect on July 1, 2006.

Ensure that the new pensions supervisory arrangements allow
sufficient flexibility in the specified timeframe for making up
shortfalls in the coverage ratio to prevent procyclical effects, but
without allowing unduly prolonged adjustment.

Implemented (see paragraph 26).

Continue the development of the framework for dealing with crisis
situations both through (i) further work with other supervisors
internationally; and (ii) completing the review of the domestic
deposit guarantee scheme.

(i) Bilateral discussions and coordinating at the EU level.
(ii) The authorities are completing a review of the domestic deposit
guarantee scheme, including considering the introduction of
prefunding and possibly risk-based premia.

Continue the development of macro prudential surveillance to help
strengthen the early identification of risks and vulnerabilities.

DNB established a new division, improved its models and indicators,
developed an analytical framework for financial stability, and started
producing stability reports.

Over the medium term, phase out tax deductibility of mortgage
interest, avoiding disruptive effects.

As of January 1, 2005, fiscal incentives for paying off mortgages were
strengthened. No further actions currently planned.

Currently, insurance funds have a solvency ratio of 24 percent or 8 percent depending on whether they are
private or public. When basic health insurance is moved from state to private provision in 2006, the implicit
government guarantee affecting those health funds now in the public sector domain may eventually disappear.
Ensuring solvency requirements at an appropriate level will require taking this into account, along with trying to
establish a level playing field in circumstances in which different funds will start with different solvency ratios.

- 16 -

E. International Trade and Development Assistance
28.
The authorities enthusiastically support overseas development assistance. Even
when under budgetary pressure, the Netherlands has still exceeded the United Nations’ ODA
target of 0.7 percent of GNI. While expressing disappointment at the slow rate of progress at
the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations, the authorities, also with an eye to
development in LDCs, supported the Doha objectives of agricultural trade liberalization,
market access, and trade facilitation.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Coming out of a difficult period, the challenge in the Netherlands is to support
and sustain economic recovery. The recovery in 2004 failed to gather steam. This was
largely due to lackluster private consumption, with low consumer confidence a key factor,
partly related to policy uncertainty. Against this background, there is a need to bolster
confidence while enhancing growth prospects and ensuring fiscal sustainability. This
underscores, after the marked deterioration in the public finances during 2000–03, the
benefits of securing significant fiscal consolidation during an economic upturn. This also
underscores the advantages of quickly making further advances on the structural front. The
successes of the 1980s and 1990s—buttressed by synergies between fiscal discipline,
structural reforms, and wage moderation that improved external competitiveness—amply
demonstrate the benefits of strong policies and the ability of the Netherlands to deliver them.
30.
While the prospects for consumer spending are subject to uncertainty,
fundamentals have improved in other respects. Corporate balance sheets have
strengthened, and profit margins have turned up. This augurs well for investment, as does
favorable prospects for exports unless the recovery in trading partners falters or the euro
appreciates significantly further. The recent moderation in wage increases has been helping
to restore external competitiveness; such moderation must continue if exports are to be a
sustained driver of growth.
31.
The authorities succeeded in reining in the fiscal deficit in 2004. After
unexpectedly breaching the Maastricht deficit ceiling in 2003, the 2004 deficit was reduced
significantly thanks in large part to considerable expenditure restraint. This contributed to a
structural narrowing of about 1¼ percentage points of GDP—an impressive accomplishment
that brought the deficit to 2.3 percent of GDP. At the same time, unexpected windfalls from
tax and gas revenues and social security spending were saved. This avoided the pitfalls of the
past, when windfalls were used to fund structural expenditures, later compounding fiscal
deterioration when the cycle turned around.
32.
Building on recent fiscal success, continued vigilance is needed in consolidating
the public finances to ensure fiscal sustainability, and resilience to population aging—
with significant benefits from early action. With additional cumulative structural
adjustment of ¾ percentage point of GDP for 2005–07, the authorities would meet the target
recommended by staff of adjustment of at least ½ percentage point of GDP per year

- 17 -

structurally, on average, during the government’s term. This would also be broadly consistent
with the original intentions in the coalition agreement. Achieving this goal would provide
further impetus for returning to a sustainable fiscal path in the face of an aging population. It
would also help to build a buffer against unanticipated shocks and the continuing risks in
containing health care costs. Indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, earlier fiscal problems
reflected insufficient adjustment during an upturn. In this light, and with elections scheduled
in 2007 and the need to bolster confidence, there is considerable merit to early action to
secure the recommended adjustment and using any future windfalls for deficit reduction. In
identifying measures, the authorities are encouraged to exploit synergies between fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms that aim to raise employment rates and potential
growth—for example by rationalizing and restraining unemployment benefits and rent
subsidies.
33.
The Dutch medium-term framework has many favorable features—though some
refinements would be helpful. Multi-year real expenditure ceilings along with specified
measures to achieve them provide a commendable anchor to the framework. In addition, the
CPB, as an independent economic forecaster and evaluator of public sector policies, plays an
important role in disciplining fiscal policy, including by ensuring that the government is not
overly optimistic in its analysis and projections. While recent measures to improve
coordination between various levels of government strengthen fiscal policy, such
coordination should be made a more permanent feature of the fiscal framework. Moreover,
enhancing the transparency and coverage of the expenditure ceilings would increase their
accessibility and buttress the discipline in the system.
34.
Raising labor participation is a key element for enhancing potential growth and
sustaining sound public finances as the population ages. The visible positive effects of a
tightening of the disability scheme are most welcome, and the reforms planned for
January 2006 should aim for further significant progress. However, the possible increase in
replacement rates may dampen progress, as would the elimination of experience-rated
premiums in light of their documented success. Moreover, it remains crucial that the
stringent gate-keeper and assessment processes not be relaxed. While the removal of fiscal
incentives for early retirement is also a positive step, care is needed to avoid offsetting
actions. In this context, the impact of the new “life-course scheme” on participation is
uncertain. Careful monitoring will be essential to ensure that it is not solely used as a route
into early retirement. In addition to dealing with various inactivity traps and taking into
account changes in life expectancy in determining the official retirement age, it is especially
important to significantly reduce the generosity of unemployment benefits. This would help
avoid shifts from one category of inactivity to another. To serve their purpose from the
standpoint of job search, a duration much shorter than three years is appropriate. As the
transfer of responsibility for social assistance to municipalities shows, improving incentives
can quickly lead to significant reductions in benefit dependency and fiscal outlays.
35.
Raising productivity growth is another key element, so structural reforms will
need to go beyond raising participation. One aim is to facilitate a smoother reallocation of
labor. While an important goal on the authorities’ agenda is to improve innovation, the

- 18 -

agenda could usefully include an assessment of employment protection legislation. It acts as
a tax on new hiring and can stand in the way of the reallocation process and therefore
productivity raising entrepreneurial activity. Greater wage differentiation would be helpful in
attracting labor to higher productivity companies and sectors, while strengthening the
incentives for human capital investment. In other areas, the government’s commitment to
reduce the administrative burden by one-quarter is welcome. Although the Netherlands has
made significant progress in improving the functioning of product markets, the benefits have
not yet reached all sectors, particularly those where competition has been weak. Against this
background, the powers of the competition authority should be reinforced.
36.
The financial sector is in good shape. Supervisors and policymakers will,
nevertheless, need to monitor the risks associated with the current low-yield environment,
especially if prolonged, and with the possibility of falling house prices. Fortunately, stress
tests under last year’s FSSA have demonstrated the resiliency of the financial system. In
addition, the authorities’ responsiveness to the FSSA’s recommendations demonstrates their
resolve to preserving financial stability over time. The macroeconomic implications of
changes in pension contributions will be important in deciding on the time path for meeting
new solvency requirements for pension funds.
37.
While data are adequate for surveillance, the impact of institutional changes on
upcoming data will be quite visible. These changes in the economic data must be
effectively communicated to avoid misunderstandings, making it clear, for example, that
overall GDP growth will not be affected.
38.
The authorities’ enthusiastic support of overseas development assistance is
commendable. They have continued to exceed the United Nation’s ODA target, even in the
face of budgetary pressures.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Netherlands remain
on the 12-month cycle.

1/ The introduction of the new health insurance scheme in 2006 will cause a significant shift in health care expenditure from private to public consumption,
thereby lowering private and raising public consumption growth without changing overall GDP. In a related vein, government revenues will rise and private
disposable income fall, without affecting the financial position of the public sector or households net terms. This is because public expenditure for health care also
rises, while the fall in private disposable income is offset by a similar fall in private health consumption, which is now taken care of in the public domain. In
addition, the shift will lower HICP inflation, but only in 2006, as private health expenditures drop out of the consumption basket; otherwise inflation would be
positive.

3/ For 2000 includes UMTS receipts (0.7 percent of GDP) and for 2001 includes purchase of gas rights from DSM (0.3 percent of GDP).
4/ The calculation of the structural balance is based on the standard methodology, which uses fixed elasticities with respect to GDP. Biases can occur,
in particular in the context of asset price boom and busts (as discussed for the Netherlands in IMF Country Report 05/301), but also when the
components of GDP move differently than the overall aggregate.
5/ For 2000, excludes UMTS receipts (0.7 percent of GDP) and for 2001, excludes the purchase of gas rights from DSM (0.3 percent of GDP).
6/ The increase in expenditure growth in 2006 largely reflects the introduction of the new health care system, as in footnote 2.

APPENDIX II

The Netherlands: Statistical Data Issues
The Netherlands publishes a wide range of economic and financial statistics. Specifically,
annual and quarterly national account data are provided by the Central Bureau of Statistics;
financial and balance of payments data are provided by De Nederlandsche Bank; and fiscal
data are provided by the ministry of finance. These data are increasingly available in
electronic form. Macroeconomic data are generally of high quality.
As a one-off matter, a number of upcoming institutional reforms is expected to have a
significant impact on national accounts and other data in 2006. Most importantly, the
envisaged reform of health care insurance will cause a significant reclassification of private
consumption into public consumption. This shift will have a big impact on the growth rates
of the components concerned, but overall GDP will not be affected. In the same vein, the
removal of health care purchases from the private consumption basket will also have a large
negative fall on harmonized inflation in 2006.
The frequency and timeliness of the availability of the core statistical indicators for Fund
surveillance purposes are summarized in the attached table. The authorities subscribe to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard, providing information about their data and data
dissemination practices on the IMF Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

APPENDIX III

Netherlands: Fiscal Sustainability
Like other advanced countries, the Netherlands will face an aging-related increase in fiscal
pressures over the next decades, while potential output growth slows. The CPB has estimated
that the gross fiscal cost of aging would amount to about 7 percentage points of GDP
between 2000–50.22 Some 4 percentage points would be offset by the taxation of pension
income,23 leaving a net cost of about 3 percentage points of GDP. To take stock of needed
fiscal adjustment, three scenarios are presented.
For illustrative purposes, Scenario A shows the dynamics if no further adjustment were
achieved beyond 2007. Clearly, this is unrealistic, but it gives an indication of the problems if
policy were passive. Doing nothing after 2007—i.e., allowing nonaging expenditures to rise
with GDP while aging-related costs rise—would result in unsustainable debt dynamics and in
triple-digit debt levels after 2030.
Scenario B presents a sustainable scenario using the CPB’s growth assumptions
(i.e., potential GDP growth declining gradually to about 1.5 percent by 2030 as the labor
supply falls, then rising to 1.8 percent by 2050). Under these assumptions, achieving a
surplus of about 1 percent of GDP by 2009 (implying structural adjustment of almost
2½ percentage points of GDP during 2005–09) would result in a sustainable path. In this
scenario, government debt would be reduced from its current level of about 56 percent of
GDP to about 25 percent.
However, the favorable growth assumptions of Scenario B cannot be taken for granted. They
are based on an assumed increase in the participation rate by 5 percentage points between
2000–20 and on an average annual rate of productivity growth of 1¾ percent, which is high
in comparison to recent trends. This underscores the need for structural reforms that ensure
that favorable future growth performance materializes. Otherwise, growth could turn out
lower, in which case more fiscal adjustment would be needed to achieve sustainability.
Scenario C illustrates the point, assuming ¼ percentage point lower average annual GDP
growth than in the previous scenario. This case implies a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP
in 2009 to stabilize the debt, albeit at a low level.
The standard debt sustainability analysis template is attached to this Appendix.

22

Assumes that new medical techniques and above-average price increases in the health care sector have a
significant effect on raising aging-related expenditure.

23

The CPB calculated that revenues from the taxation of pensions would rise in line with the expected increase
in the number of pensioners. Meanwhile, taking into account the expected increase in the population, the ratio
of taxable labor income to GDP would fall only slightly, so the overall revenue ratio would rise.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 29, 2005

1.
This staff statement provides information on economic developments that has become
available since the preparation of the staff report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation.
The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On GDP data and projections: Downside risks to the growth outlook appear to have
materialized with much weaker-than-expected activity in the first quarter of 2005.
Preliminary data for that quarter show that GDP fell by 0.1 percent (quarter-on-quarter),
mainly reflecting a sharp fall in investment (of 3.1 percent, following a 4.7 percent rise in the
fourth quarter of 2004) and a negative contribution of the foreign sector (with exports
declining by more than imports). Meanwhile, private consumption remained lackluster.
The weak first quarter, combined with a markdown in export market growth, gives rise to a
substantial revision of the staff forecast for 2005 and—to a lesser extent—2006. This is
shown in the table below.
The revised forecast of the Dutch central bank (DNB), released on June 15, also reflects the
weak first quarter (see table). The reduction in the DNB’s growth projection for 2005 results
especially from downward revisions of private consumption and net exports. For 2006, the
revision predominantly reflects a more pessimistic view of private consumption than before.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands
On June 29, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands.1
Background
After a long period of comparatively strong economic performance, the Netherlands hit a difficult
stretch going into the new millennium. Growth was relatively poor during 2000–03, turning
negative in 2003 for the first time in 20 years. A weakening external environment contributed to
the sharp slowdown of activity. On the side of domestic demand, wealth effects (associated with
developments in equity and house prices) and changes in pension fund contributions (stemming
from the exposure of these funds to equities) amplified the cycle.
Deteriorating external competitiveness has also been restraining export performance and
overall growth. Wage pressures, reflecting tightness in the labor market that had built up in the
second half of the 1990s, weakened external competitiveness. This was later compounded by
an appreciation of the euro. The loss of competitiveness has not been especially apparent in
aggregate, value-based, export market share data. However, falling market shares have
strongly been in evidence in volume terms. More detailed analysis of sector trade shares has
also raised warning flags about competitiveness.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2-

The recovery has so far been weaker than during past upswings. Growth was significantly
below potential in 2004. It is expected to remain that way this year, with large uncertainties over
confidence and its effect on private consumption, which has been unusually lackluster.
Disposable income and unemployment cannot fully explain the sharp fall in the growth of private
consumption since 2000, and less tangible factors affecting confidence, in addition to wealth
effects, have clearly been at play. Fundamentals have been showing improvement, however,
and the expansion is expected to gather pace in 2006.
Inflation is now subdued, and there is little pressure from wages looking ahead. Wage growth
was about 1½ percent in 2004, reflecting the two-year economy-wide wage moderation
agreement of the social partners that aimed at improving competitiveness. The agreement
allows for somewhat more discretion in 2005, but the strength of the euro, moderate pace of
economic activity, and slack labor market conditions are expected to keep a lid on wage
pressures.
After the public finances deteriorated markedly during 2000–03, there was a significant reversal
in 2004. The general government balance worsened by almost 5½ percentage points of GDP
during 2000–03 as a result of both cyclical and structural effects, the latter amounting to roughly
2 percentage points of GDP. While the 3 percent Maastricht deficit ceiling was unexpectedly
breached in 2003, the deficit, primarily through expenditure restraint, was reduced to
2.3 percent of GDP in 2004.
In addition to the near-term outlook, the discussions focused on key measures to bolster
confidence and enhance growth prospects while ensuring fiscal sustainability and resilience to
population aging. In this context, restoring external competitiveness as an essential element of
sustaining economic recovery was an important topic of the discussions. Measures to raise
participation and productivity were also important topics. The authorities had implemented or
were in the process of implementing key reforms, including by tightening disability and
unemployment benefits and early retirement arrangements, lessening inactivity traps,
enhancing competition, and reducing the administrative burden. Finally, the financial sector,
including a follow-up of the recommendations made in the Fund’s Financial Sector Stability
Assessment of last year, was another key topic.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the successes of the 1980s and 1990s—underpinned by
synergies between fiscal discipline, structural reforms, and wage moderation—amply
demonstrate the benefits of strong policies and the Netherlands’ ability to deliver them.
They were also encouraged by the improvement in some key economic fundamentals.
However, Directors expressed concern that the recovery has so far failed to gather steam.
In this regard, they noted that downside risks appear to be materializing, delaying the
anticipated acceleration of Dutch economic growth.

-3Against this background, Directors agreed that the Netherlands’ main challenge ahead is to
support and sustain the economic recovery. In this regard, they stressed the need to restore
external competitiveness after its deterioration in recent years so as to take full advantage of
future export market growth. While commending the authorities’ efforts to rein in the fiscal deficit
and strengthen the structural underpinnings for growth, Directors emphasized the importance of
sustaining efforts in these areas, with a view to boosting confidence and ensuring that the fiscal
pressures of an aging population remain manageable.
Directors welcomed the positive underlying developments that should support recovery,
noting in particular the strengthening of corporate balance sheets and turn-up in profit margins
that should favor future investment. Directors also applauded the impact of the recent
moderation in wage increases in helping to restore external competitiveness. They stressed,
however, that such moderation needs to continue if exports are to be a sustained driver of
growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, reflected in the quick
response to bring the fiscal deficit back into line with the Maastricht criteria. They stressed that
continued fiscal adjustment over the medium term will provide further impetus for returning to a
sustainable fiscal path as the population aged, while also helping to build a buffer against
unanticipated shocks and the continuing risks in containing health care costs. Directors
attached particular importance to those fiscal consolidation measures that would help raise
employment rates and potential growth, and thereby exploit synergies with structural reforms—
for example, by rationalizing and restraining unemployment benefits and rent subsidies.
In addition, Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to use any future windfalls for
deficit and debt reduction. At the same time, Directors supported the full use of automatic
stabilizers. While most Directors also emphasized that in the short run the need for fiscal
tightening and reform should be balanced against the objective of strengthening the fragile
cyclical upswing, they supported the authorities’ choice to underpin confidence with strong fiscal
consolidation and a well-sequenced structural reform program.
Directors lauded the many favorable features of the fiscal framework, including the use of multiyear expenditure ceilings as an anchor and the disciplining role of the Bureau for Economic
Policy Analysis (CPB). However, they encouraged the authorities to enhance the transparency
and coverage of the expenditure ceilings. While welcoming recent measures to improve
coordination of policies at various levels of government, Directors also encouraged the
authorities to make such coordination a permanent feature of the fiscal framework. Directors
looked forward to the results of the forthcoming fiscal Reports on the Observance of the
Standards and Codes.
Directors noted that raising labor participation is a key element for enhancing potential growth
and sustaining sound public finances. Thus, they welcomed the many structural reforms the
authorities have implemented or that are underway. These include tightening disability and
unemployment benefits and early retirement arrangements, and lessening inactivity traps.
Nevertheless, looking ahead, Directors cautioned against a potential weakening of disability

-4reform and urged continued progress to deal with inactivity traps. They also noted that the
shortening of the duration of unemployment benefits could be more ambitious.
Directors agreed that structural reforms should focus on raising productivity growth, in addition
to boosting labor participation. They therefore supported the authorities’ efforts to reduce the
administrative burden on business and urged them to persevere with efforts to broaden
competition, including by reinforcing the powers of the competition authority. Directors
supported the authorities’ objective of spurring greater innovation. In this latter context, with a
view to facilitating more efficient resource allocation, they urged the authorities to review
employment protection legislation, noting that overly stringent protection acts as an implicit tax
on new hiring and can stand in the way of productivity raising entrepreneurial activity.
Directors also urged greater wage differentiation, with a view to attracting labor to higher
productivity companies and sectors and to strengthen the incentives for human capital
investment.
Directors noted that the financial system appears to remain sound, resilient to potential adverse
shocks, and well supervised. They welcomed the authorities’ responsiveness to the
recommendations made last year in the Financial System Stability Assessment, which
demonstrates the authorities’ resolve to preserve financial stability over time. They encouraged
the authorities to monitor closely the risks associated with a possibly prolonged low-yield
environment, the increase in household indebtedness, and the possibility of a decline in house
prices. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen cross-border financial
supervision, and the steps taken in recent years to further strengthen the regime to combat
money laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors strongly commended Dutch development assistance, and the Netherlands’ support for
the Doha Round objectives of agricultural trade liberalization, market access for developing
countries, and trade facilitation. They noted that even in the face of budgetary pressures,
the Netherlands have exceeded the United Nations official development assistance target.
Directors noted that while data are adequate for surveillance, the impact of institutional
changes, in particular in healthcare reform, on upcoming data will be quite visible.
They therefore stressed that these changes in the economic data must be effectively
communicated to avoid misunderstandings, making it clear for example that overall GDP growth
will not be affected.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
