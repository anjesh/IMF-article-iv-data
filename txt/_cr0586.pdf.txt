EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The recent impressive performance of the Indian economy is testimony to the
benefits of the reforms undertaken since the early 1990s. Supported by a strong
monsoon, growth rebounded to more than 8 percent in 2003/04. Staff projects that
growth will remain robust, at 6.4 percent this year, in the face of uneven monsoons
and high oil prices. However, to meet the new government’s goal of accelerating
growth to more than 8 percent on a sustainable basis, fiscal consolidation, enhanced
infrastructure, and further structural reforms are required.

•

The new Fiscal Responsibility law (FRBMA) provides a solid framework for
achieving fiscal sustainability, but steps will also be required at the state level.
Staff strongly supported the rapid implementation of the government’s FRBMA
Roadmap, emphasizing front-loaded tax reform and improvement in expenditure
quality. However, state finances, not covered by FRBMA, need to be strengthened as
well, as states account for half of the general government deficit. The center could
make more effective use of a range of incentive mechanisms to push states to reform.

•

Reconciling the government’s ambitious social agenda with the need for fiscal
adjustment will be difficult. The authorities are well aware of this challenge and
emphasized that large increases in spending envisaged for infrastructure and social
services would be fully implemented only over the long-term and subject to fiscal
constraints. Staff supported efforts to increase private sector participation in
infrastructure by improving the business climate, but cautioned against plans to
utilize foreign exchange reserves to finance infrastructure spending.

•

The acceleration of structural reforms is key to raising growth and employment.
Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to increase foreign direct investment and
liberalize small-scale industry, but urged them to move more rapidly on removing
other key constraints to growth, including by liberalizing trade and labor laws.

•

The financial sector has strengthened considerably, but challenges remain.
Further opening to private and foreign investors, along with continued strengthening
of risk-based supervision, would allow the financial sector to further support growth.

•

The recent tightening of monetary policy was appropriate. While inflation mainly
reflects supply-drive price rises, buoyant domestic demand points to the possibility of
second round effects. In the face of large capital inflows, the RBI has allowed
increased exchange rate flexibility. Should inflows remain strong, increasing
exchange rate flexibility further would be helpful to help fight inflation and facilitate
economic adjustment.

-4-

•

The authorities’ burden-sharing approach to increased oil prices is
understandable, but may not be sustainable. With higher prices likely to remain
for some time, additional pass through would be desirable.
I. BACKGROUND

1.
Last May’s election returned a Congress-led coalition to power. Reflecting the
mandate it received from the poor, the new government has announced an agenda of
“reforms with a human face”—described in the Common Minimum Program (CMP)—aimed
at accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty, and increasing infrastructure and social
spending (Box 1). Infrastructure needs are large, and over a third of the population (more
than 300 million persons) continues to live on less than US$1 a day (Table 1). However, the
need for fiscal adjustment continues to constrain the fiscal space to address these issues. The
challenge is thus to garner political support to advance fiscal consolidation and deepen
structural reforms needed to realize the government’s agenda.
2.
To advance the reform agenda, the government needs to balance the interests of
several coalition partners and supporting parties. The Congress-led government is a
coalition of 12 parties, several of which represent regional interests, that account for
40 percent of the Lower House. It depends on support of the communist Left Front and two
other small parties to form a majority in Parliament. Efforts to build consensus and promote
common interests across party lines will be

moment, recent victory in a major state
election has strengthened the Congress’s
hand at the national level.
3.
Since the last Article IV consultation in July 2003, progress has been made in
several policy areas. Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the
favorable external environment to tackle structural reforms—including in agriculture, labor
markets, and industry—to remove impediments to growth and reduce poverty. They also
noted the opportunity provided by the new fiscal responsibility framework, then under
consideration in Parliament, to restore fiscal sustainability. Since then, the Fiscal
Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) has been adopted. The central
government has embarked on defined-contribution pension reform. Trade tariffs were
lowered and the capital account liberalized further. More recently, the foreign direct
investment (FDI) cap on aviation was raised. Privatization advanced with the sale of minority
stakes in six state-owned companies, and industrial activity has been liberalized with the list
of small industries subject to protection and size restrictions continuing to be narrowed. In

-5-

the financial sector, the authorities took initiatives to improve corporate governance and
migrate gradually to regulatory best practices.
Box 1. The Common Minimum Program (CMP): The Alliance’s Social Pact
The CMP affirms the coalition’s commitment to “economic reforms with a human
face to stimulate growth, investment, and employment.” A few days after taking office,
the new government delineated in the CMP its priorities for policies and reforms. The
CMP reiterates the government’s determination to implement fiscal consolidation and its
focus on improving the well-being of farmers and low-income citizens. The government
puts the promotion of investment at the center of a strategy to achieve sustained growth of
7–8 percent per year over the next decade.
The CMP underscores a number of measures to be taken over the medium term to
reach these objectives. Larger spending on infrastructure and social programs, incentives
for FDI, protection of agriculture from imports, increased credit to agriculture and small
industry are on the agenda. Also, the government promises:
•

A major increase in infrastructure, in particular, for rural areas. Meeting infrastructure
needs are estimated to cost an additional 3-4 percent of GDP per year.

•

Universal access to basic education and health, through a gradual doubling of
expenditure to 6 percent of GDP and 2–3 percent of GDP, respectively.

•

A guarantee of 100 days of minimum wage employment for one person in each poor
household, at an estimated net cost of 1 percent of GDP (two-thirds of which borne by
the central government).

The government expects to fund this higher spending (around 10 percent of GDP) by
better targeting of subsidies to the poor and broadening the tax base. Other revenue
measures would include increased tax compliance, improved efficiency of tax
administration, and an earmarked surcharge on taxes for education. The government also
committed to introducing a state-level VAT.
A number of CMP measures are already implemented or under way. On the revenue side,
the budget introduced a 2 percent education surcharge, as well as a tax on securities
transactions, and broadened the base of the service tax. FDI caps on civil aviation were
increased. The states are expected to introduce the VAT by April 2005.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Economic performance in 2003/04 was impressive. Supported by favorable
monsoons, growth rebounded to more than 8 percent, the highest in a decade and among the
highest in the world (Table 2). The recovery was broad-based, stemming from a vigorous
recovery in agriculture from the previous year’s drought, and spillover effects on industry
and services.1

However, below-average rainfall has
depressed agricultural activity. Staff expects growth of 6.4 percent in 2004/05, within the
range of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s 6–6½ percent forecast, thanks to continued
dynamism in services and industry.
6.
India’s trade deficit is widening, but the current account is expected to end
2004/05 in surplus. Rising imports, reflecting higher oil prices and strong investment
demand, have more than offset strong growth

in goods and services exports (Figure 2,

9.
Inflation has picked up, driven by rising international commodities prices and
supported by buoyant demand and comfortable liquidity. With high international oil and
steel prices, and rising food prices on account of a weak monsoon, WPI inflation accelerated
to close to 9 percent in August year-on-year, before declining to around 7½ percent more
recently on lower food prices (Figure 3, Table 4). Data limitations, in particular the absence
of indices for consumer and nontradables prices, make it difficult to ascertain the extent of
pass-through to domestic retail prices to date.5 CPI inflation for industrial workers and staff’s

estimate of core inflation have, however, accelerated. This, together with the recent surge in
credit, may point to the emergence of demand pressures. Also, the partial sterilization of
large capital inflows in the past year has increased banking system liquidity. The RBI took
several measures in response to emerging inflationary pressures (See Section E). Inflation is
expected to remain around 7 percent at end-2004/05 as domestic demand remains strong and
a larger share of the rise in international oil prices passes through.
10.
For the first time since the mid-1990s, the central government deficit came in
below target in 2003/04. The overall deficit fell to 5.1 percent of GDP, almost 1 percent of
GDP lower than the previous year, owing to strong economic growth (Figure 4, Table 5).
The current deficit declined to 3.5 percent of GDP from 4.4 percent of GDP. Tax revenues
exceeded expectations, as buoyant corporate tax revenues more than offset a shortfall in
excise and customs duties, and spending fell short of budget.
11.
States continued to face financial difficulties. In 2003/04, states’ overall deficit
deteriorated to an estimated 5.1 percent of GDP, nearly 1 percent of GDP worse than the
previous year (Table 6). Part of this deterioration reflects the recognition of past arrears.6
However, states face continued pressure from interest and pension payments, which absorb
about 70 percent of states’ tax revenue, and subsidies, in particular to the power sector, have
increased. States’ debt has risen to 30 percent of GDP. The deterioration at the state level
offset the improvement in central government accounts, and staff estimates that the general
government deficit remained broadly stable at 9.7 percent last year.
III. SIX QUESTIONS FOR THIS CONSULTATION
12.
Against the backdrop of a new political leadership in India, this consultation
focused on discussing the objectives and policies at the center of the government’s
agenda. India has experienced an extended period of solid growth, and positive
demographics and strong institutions provide the opportunity to improve on this performance
in coming years. The new government has placed emphasis on accelerating annual growth to
8 percent to create jobs and improve the livelihood of the poor, especially in rural India. Staff
and the authorities agreed on the broad policy agenda to achieve these objectives—fiscal
consolidation, focus on infrastructure and priority social spending, and structural reforms. A
key issue for this consultation was to understand how the authorities planned to implement
the needed fiscal adjustment, in particular given the anticipated outlays set forward in the
CMP. The related key issue is how to push India to a higher growth path—a question that
also dominated previous consultations. The mission discussed the government’s reform
6

During 2002/03–2003/04, states cleared state electricity distributors’ arrears to power
generating public sector companies, of about 1½ percent of GDP, and issued debt for
financing. Six states classified this debt issuance as current spending, thus overstating the
rise in the deficit.

-9-

agenda and considered whether it goes far enough to foster faster growth. Given the
important role played by the financial system in facilitating economic growth and poverty
reduction, the discussions also covered the government’s plans to build on progress achieved
in strengthening the sector. The other major topic was the more immediate challenge of
tackling rising inflation pressures and oil costs.
13.
The medium-term outlook hinges crucially on the ability of the government to
implement the agenda of macroeconomic policy and reforms. In the staff’s baseline
scenario, growth of 6–6½ percent would be achieved—somewhat above last decade’s
average—as economic reforms continue and the nascent recovery in investment takes hold
(Table 7). With declining world oil prices, as

accelerate growth significantly (see
Section A). On the contrary, domestic policy
slippages—notably failure to bring the deficit under control—could push up interest rates
and hold back investment. Higher-than-expected world interest rates could slow or reverse
inflows to India and necessitate domestic rate rises. Higher oil prices would slow economic
growth and increase inflationary pressures (see Section F).

the period, and the government’s Medium-Term Fiscal Policy Statement sets more ambitious
three-year deficit targets with the view of achieving balance by the targeted date.
15.
Staff strongly supported the FRBMA but argued that additional steps were
needed at the state level. Achieving the medium-term fiscal targets under the FRBMA
would, in the absence of adjustment by states, stabilize the debt ratio at about 82 percent of
GDP by 2009/10 and the general government deficit would remain high, at 7 percent of GDP
(Box 2, Table 8). The profile of public debt—largely domestic, rupee-denominated, and
long-term—and comfortable reserves limit external vulnerability (Tables 9–10). However,
the debt path under this scenario would be vulnerable to an adverse shock to growth, which
could derail debt sustainability. It is critical that states be brought into the adjustment
effort—in an alternative scenario where states consolidate, public debt would decline to
75 percent of GDP—and additional space be freed up for high priority spending.
16.
The 2004/05 budget can be viewed as an interim budget as the government took
office part-way into the fiscal year, and few reforms were introduced. The tax base was
broadened, with inclusion of 13 new taxable services, but some new tax exemptions were
introduced as well. Mechanisms to improve compliance were also introduced, notably a
centralized taxpayers’ information network to enhance cross-checking. The budget did not
envisage significant spending increases for key social or infrastructure needs. Given
overperformance last year relative to budget estimates, the adjustment required to meet this
year’s target is of 0.1 percent of GDP.
17.
The authorities are confident about meeting their fiscal targets this year. Thus
far, budget implementation is broadly in line with plans, as revenue shortfalls have been
offset by slower spending and high loan repayments under the debt-swap arrangement with
states.8 Staff projects a 0.2 percent of GDP revenue shortfall for the year, the result of cuts in
oil excises and steel taxes to dampen the impact of higher world prices on domestic inflation.
The accumulated current deficit exceeded 45 percent of the full-year budget estimate,

8

Under the debt-swap scheme, states can prepay their high-cost debt to the center, by
borrowing at lower rates from the market as well as the national small savings fund (NSSF).
Such loan recoveries reduce net lending in central government accounts, hence the center’s
overall deficit.

- 11 -

Box 2. Implications of the FRBMA Targets for Debt Sustainability
To illustrate the implications of the FRBMA targets for debt sustainability, the staff prepared
two scenarios. The baseline “some reform” scenario assumes that the central government meets the
FRBMA deficit targets, but the states do not adjust. Tax reforms are implemented at a more gradual
pace than projected under the FRBMA Roadmap, resulting in lower revenue projections. To offset
this, additional measures are taken to reduce subsidies, wages, and other non-interest current
expenditures, and to reorient

of GDP, as states implement key tax reforms,
including introduction of the VAT by April 2005, and expenditure reforms, including power sector,
wage and pension, and subsidy reforms. States’ adjustment effort would also be helped by higher
grants and shared revenues. The general government deficit falls to 5¼ percent of GDP by 2009/10.
Growth rises to 8 percent over the projection period as public spending is re-oriented toward more
productive uses and the interest rate falls, reflecting reduced public borrowing needs. The more
positive growth-interest differential helps reduce faster the debt ratio.
The baseline scenario is most vulnerable to a growth shock. A two-standard-deviation, two-year
shock to GDP growth increases debt by 14½ percentage points by 2009/10, which does not stabilize
even after the shock subsides (see also Table 8). Other shocks, including a one-time shock of
10 percent of GDP—the size of government guarantees—would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio
substantially, but the ratio would decline once the shock subsides.

its mid-year target under the FRBMA, and staff urged the authorities to identify contingency
measures in their mid-term review of compliance with the FRBMA in December. The
authorities argued, however, that late budget approval had delayed the implementation of
revenue-raising measures. Such measures would come in effect in the second half of the year
and offset earlier shortfalls. In addition, the authorities indicated that there would be scope
for remedial measures later in the year if need be, in particular through savings
onexpenditure given limited absorption capacity. Thus, they did not take corrective action in
their review of compliance with the FRBMA in December.
18.
Looking beyond 2004/05, there was agreement that the bulk of the fiscal
adjustment should be achieved through a front-loaded tax reform. The Kelkar report,
which provides a roadmap to implement the FRBMA, outlines the desired features of a
comprehensive tax reform: replacing the current state-level cascading sales tax and the
central value-added tax (VAT) on manufacturing with a national value-added tax on goods
and services (GST); removing most

19.
The authorities were confident that states could introduce VAT as planned in
April 2005, but implementing other tax measures might prove more challenging. Most
states have passed the necessary legislation to introduce a VAT on goods. To encourage
implementation, the central government has committed to compensate states fully for
revenue loss in the first year, and partially in the next two years. However, the Kelkar report
proposal to integrate central- and state-level VAT-type taxes into a unique GST was seen as
a long-term project. Instead, the authorities were focused (i) at the state level, on launching
the VAT on goods which has been in the works for several years; and (ii) at the central
government level, on extending the existing VAT to more services. Staff supported this
pragmatic, more gradual approach, but highlighted the importance of continuing to prepare
for the national GST. The authorities acknowledged that a GST would be broader-based and

construction, are not.

more efficient, helping to achieve FRBMA revenue targets with relatively low VAT rates.
They highlighted, however, that similar revenue gains could be achieved with their approach.
The authorities acknowledged that other tax base-broadening measures, in particular the
lifting of most exemptions to the personal and income taxes, would be difficult but could be
achieved with grandfathering.
20.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ intentions to improve the quality of spending.
The Roadmap includes recommendations to improve the efficiency of social spending and
subsidy programs, and restrain the government wage bill. The Planning Commission is
examining how to restructure public spending and should present its recommendations soon.
Staff views improvements in spending quality as critical since, without such gains, FRBMA
targets could only be met by tightly constraining public investment and social spending.
Rationalization of subsidies—including for food, fertilizers, and power—would reduce
government outlays while improving targeting to the truly needy. Staff looks forward to the
recommendations of the ongoing review of subsidies in this regard.
21.
The authorities agreed that more needs to be done to entrench fiscal discipline at
the state level. They pointed to the steps that have already been taken to bail states into
fiscal reform in recent years: the RBI has been developing model states fiscal responsibility
laws; five states have passed their own responsibility legislation; and the center has signed
memoranda of understanding on medium-term reforms with 20 states, with a small portion of
grants being performance-based.11 Nevertheless, these steps have so far not made a decisive
turnaround in overall state finances, and more needs to be done. The staff encouraged the
authorities to push for further state-level reforms, and in particular to:
•

Ensure that state VAT on goods is introduced by the 2005 deadline;

•

Enhance the sustainability of states’ pension systems, through implementation of
defined-contribution schemes and parametric changes to existing pension plans;12

•

Make progress on power sector reforms to restore the financial sustainability of state
electricity companies—and thereby reduce subsidies as well as contingent liabilities.

11

Some states have succeeded in fiscal adjustment. Karnakata, for example, has passed a
fiscal responsibility legislation, reformed its tax system, and improved the quality of
spending. This has helped the state to balance its current budget and reduce its overall deficit
by more than 2 percentage points of GDP in the last two years. See World Bank Report
No. 28849-IN, 2004.

12

See the recommendations of the RBI’s Working Group on Pension Liabilities of States
(www.rbi.org.in).

- 14 -

In this context, a move by several states to provide free power to farmers seems to be
a setback to reforms in this sector.
22.
On center-state relations, the Twelfth Finance Commission is expected to make
recommendations shortly. Staff suggested that consideration be given to the following:
•

The center could use leverage provided by its approval of all states’ borrowing to
harden budget constraints. Currently, the center is not enforcing strictly these
borrowing limits and states can also borrow from the NSSF for deficit financing. The
center should define and enforce all-inclusive borrowing limits for states.

•

Debt write-offs or swaps with the center, tied to policy performance, would reduce
states’ debt burden.

•

Constructing a state finance database would strengthen the center’s monitoring
capacity of states, an area in which the Fund is providing assistance.
B. How Will the CMP be Reconciled
with the Need for Fiscal Adjustment?

23.
The CMP’s ambitious social agenda may be difficult to reconcile with fiscal
adjustment efforts. The anticipated increased outlays for infrastructure and social programs
are estimated to cost up to 10 percent of GDP over the medium term. The authorities expect
to fund this higher spending in particular by better targeting subsidies, broadening the tax
base, and maintaining their surcharge on taxes earmarked for education. However, the CMP
does not specify a full envelope of compensating revenue measures.
24.
The authorities emphasized that, while visible action on the CMP goals is
necessary now, fully achieving them can only be accomplished over the longer term.
They noted that the CMP goals remained subject to fiscal constraints. For example, the
guaranteed employment program was being introduced initially on an experimental basis in
the poorest regions. In the meantime, prioritization was seen as key. For example, health and
education spending would rise, but such spending also needed to be made much more
effective before the full increase contemplated could be justified. Moreover, as the bulk of
envisaged new spending, such as for schooling, healthcare, and rural infrastructure are under
the purview of the states, they also have to intensify reform efforts.
25.
The authorities are also counting on private sector participation to help remedy
India’s large infrastructure gap. They attach priority to responding to infrastructure needs
now, while building the necessary consensus to implement the reforms needed to create
fiscal space. A key focus of the authorities’ efforts is the setting up of a new regulatory
framework for infrastructure, encompassing a transparent policy regime, independent
regulators, and simple rules to enhance the prospects for successful public-private
partnerships (PPPs) and reduce demands for large guarantees by private investors.

- 15 -

26.
With reserves at a comfortable level, a debate is ongoing on whether to use a
portion of these reserves to finance infrastructure. A proposal is to use US$15 billion of
reserves over 3 years (0.6 percent of GDP per year) for infrastructure spending through the
budget. The funds would finance infrastructure projects, including some in rural areas that
may not be commercially-viable. The FRBMA deficit targets would be adjusted upward for
that period of time.
27.
While recognizing the importance of addressing the large infrastructure gaps,
staff underlined a number of concerns with the proposal. First, it would damage the
credibility of the just-introduced FRBMA. Second, the transfer of RBI reserves may
compromise perceived central bank independence. Third, a return to monetizing the deficit
would reverse progress in recent years in lowering inflation and interest rates. Since imports

C. How Far Do Planned Structural Reforms Go?
28.
Progress in addressing a wide range of structural rigidities is key to raising
growth, and the agenda of reforms is well known to the authorities. Building on political
consensus, the authorities are emphasizing advancing agriculture development, further trade
and capital liberalization, and improving the investment climate. Other important reforms,
such as labor market liberalization and privatization, lack consensus for implementation now.

- 16 -

29.
Agriculture reform is critical to growth and poverty reduction. Almost two thirds
of the population depends on agriculture for income, and the majority of the poor live in rural
areas. The authorities are focusing on rural infrastructure and increased priority credit to
agriculture to remedy a long-term fall in productivity. Staff welcomed the priority given to
agriculture reform, but underlined that rural infrastructure requires significant resources,
especially from states, and that efforts to induce banks to lend more to agriculture could
exacerbate risks—especially as NPAs appear to be higher in priority lending. Staff
encouraged the authorities to undertake more fundamental reforms to unleash the potential in
agriculture. This involves changes in the system of crop procurements and price supports to
improve incentives to diversify and export; reducing the fiscal burden of inefficient fertilizer,
water, and power subsidies to free resources for needed infrastructure; and eliminate the
remaining interstate barriers to agricultural trade to expand market opportunities.13
30.
The authorities aim at doubling India’s share in world trade and are committed
to reducing tariffs to ASEAN levels by 2009. India’s trade regime remains restrictive,
although some progress was achieved this year with the reduction in the peak custom rate
from 30 percent to 20 percent. The average tariff has also declined, although it still reaches
22 percent in 2004.14 Considerable scope for trade liberalization remains, and staff
encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the favorable external position to reduce both
tariff and nontariff barriers.15 Staff noted that with tax reform in the works, the pace of tariff
reduction could be increased without undermining efforts at fiscal consolidation. Benefits
from liberalization would be magnified by improvements in infrastructure, especially ports,
and cuts in red tape. In this regard, the authorities were working on simplifying customs
clearance. India has reached a Free Trade Agreement with other South Asia countries
(SAFTA) and is negotiating FTAs with Thailand, ASEAN, and Singapore. It has also signed
a preferential trade agreement with Mercosur. The authorities view these agreements as fully
consistent with multilateral liberalization, since they build on increased regional trade ties
and lay the groundwork for wider economic cooperation (Box 3). Staff encouraged the
authorities to focus on multilateral liberalization to mitigate potential adverse effects of
regional integration, such as trade diversion. In this context, the authorities viewed the
completion of the Doha round of trade negotiations as having potentially important benefits
13

by the Planning Commission in September 2004.

15

India rated an 8 in the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index in 2003 (10 is most restrictive).

While tariffs have been reduced and quantitative restrictions were largely eliminated
in 2001, India has increasingly relied on nontariff barriers, including technical standards and
regulations, sanitary rules, local content schemes and quotas. Also, India has initiated
15 percent of all anti-dumping cases during 1995–2004.

- 17 -

for India, but argued that rolling back agricultural supports in industrial countries would be
key. The authorities also indicates that they expect to benefit from the elimination of textile
quotas as they have been quota-constrained, but agreed with staff that the extent of the gain
would depend on progress in structural reform.
31.
Staff supported the authorities’ cautious approach to liberalizing the capital
account. The authorities thought that fiscal consolidation and further strengthening of the
financial sector were preconditions for fully opening the economy to capital flows. Important
measures were, however, implemented this year. In particular, corporates’ access to
international capital markets was eased, with RBI approval required only for external loans
above US$500 million (from US$50 million) as long as minimum maturity requirements are
met. The ceiling on foreign investors’ holdings of government bonds was raised. Limits on
capital outflows for residents were also relaxed. Staff encouraged the authorities to address
fiscal and financial sector vulnerabilities limiting further opening.
32.
While strongly welcoming the attention given to improving India’s business
climate, staff noted that labor market rigidities remain one of the greatest challenges of
doing business in India (Box 4). These rigidities also deter job creation in the formal
sector—an important priority given India’s rising labor force.16 The authorities
acknowledged that labor rigidities were a problem, but stated that it was necessary to
advance carefully—in particular given the absence of an adequate social safety net—and to
coordinate closely with states. The government has reduced the list of activities subject to
Contract Labor Law, and is proposing to use Special Economic Zones to introduce more
flexible labor markets on a “pilot” basis.
D. How Can the Financial Sector Reach its Full Potential?
33.
The authorities have made commendable progress in strengthening banking
system soundness and supervision. Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) declined to
7.2 percent in 2003/04 from 8.8 percent in 2002/03, despite a tightening of loan classification
norms, and capital adequacy ratios are now well above the 9 percent minimum (Table 11).
Among the specific steps taken are:

16

With India’s youthful demographics, it is estimated that 110 million new jobs need to be
created over the next decade just to keep the unemployment rate from rising.

- 18 -

Box 3. India’s Increasing Regional Integration
India’s increasing integration into regional trade and production chains has often been
overlooked in the context of its emergence as a global leader in service exports. Trade between
India and Asia has surged on the back of strong nonagricultural growth in India and the pickup in
growth in Asia. In the first half of 2004, India’s goods imports from Asia grew by 45 percent, more
than double the rate recorded the previous year, buoyed by strong demand for capital goods,
electronics, and chemicals. Meanwhile, the annual value of goods exports to Asia has surged about
20 percent during the past four years, led by engineering like auto parts, and pharmaceuticals.
Asia has been the major beneficiary of rising Indian imports and is becoming an important
destination for Indian exports.
•

By end-2003, Asia’s share in Indian imports had risen to 29 percent, up 5½ percentage points
since 2000 with growth averaging almost 20 percent per year (see Table). At the same time,
market shares in the United States and European Union have fallen to 5½ percent and
20¼ percent respectively.

•

Almost a third of Indian exports are destined to Asia, up from just over a quarter in 2000,
with exports to China and Sri Lanka growing above 40 percent per year.

India still represents a small market for Asian exports. Even after a decade of trade liberalization,
imports represent below 13 percent of GDP, and India accounts for less than 4 percent of Asian
exports. As a result, the acceleration in Indian import growth in 2003 is estimated to have had a
limited impact on growth in Asia, contributing a total 0.1–0.2 percentage points to growth in
Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
India has the potential to
become an important
export destination for
Asia. Import demand is
likely to remain high as
investment picks up. India
is committed to reducing
tariffs to ASEAN levels and
is working to build regional
trade relations. It recently
set up the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) and
reached a bilateral trade
agreement with Thailand.
Similar agreements are
under negotiation with
Singapore, Japan, and
ASEAN countries.

•

Regulatory burden: Streamlining entry and operation regulations at all levels of government is key to
reducing delays, corruption, and business costs. While improvements in administration have helped
reduce customs clearance times in India to an average of 7 days relative to China’s 10 days, according to
the World Bank, it still takes 84 days to start a business in India compared to 46 days in China.

•

Labor market flexibility: Removing legal restrictions on layoffs and contract work would help. The
experiences of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states show that progress can be made within the existing
legal framework by dispensing with state controls on shift and contract work, and simplifying laborreporting requirements.

•

Credit: Improving bankruptcy
and loan recovery frameworks
would help ease credit
constraints, especially on small
enterprises.

Privatization and liberalization of FDI could improve efficiency and attract investment.

These reforms are particularly relevant for the textile sector where liberalization of labor laws and lifting of
remaining small firm protections are needed if the sector is to maximize the potential from the phase-out of
Multi Fiber Agreement quotas in 2005.

•

The RBI tightened loans classification norms in line with international best practice.
In this regard, staff suggested that accelerating the implementation of provisioning
norms was desirable since, currently, banks have up to 2009 to meet
provisioningstandards on NPAs.17

•

To strengthen governance in UCBs, the government extended RBI oversight to the
boards of those that operate across state borders. It also gave the RBI power to grant
licenses to such UCBs that want to undertake banking activities. Staff encouraged the
authorities to broaden the range of these reforms to all UCBs, particularly given
recent cases in which state governments had to take over the administration of singlestate UCBs with bad management practices.

•

A prompt corrective action (PCA) framework was introduced in 2003 that guides the
intervention of banking supervisors once early signs of distress at banks are
identified.

•

While taking advantage of business synergies, the RBI is also addressing NPAs in
remaining Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) by merging them with public
sector banks. Staff stressed the need to ensure that the new entities—which have
benefited from government rescue packages—are guided by commercial principles in
lending to avoid the reemergence of high NPAs.

34.
The staff welcomed the RBI’s decision in October
to raise the risk-weight on consumer and housing loans.
Consumer credit is low by international standards, and net
NPAs on retail credit remain small, at about 1½ percent of
loans portfolio. However, the rapid expansion of these loans
recently may challenge risk assessment and management at
some banks.

In a rising inflation environment, the RBI is
encouraging banks to protect against interest rate risk.
Banks are required to hold 25 percent of deposits in government securities as reserves but,
with interest rates until recently declining, banks found it profitable to hold these relatively
risk-free, fixed-interest securities well in excess of these requirements, to above 40 percent of
17

Starting in March 2004, banks and urban cooperative banks (UCBs) have to classify a loan
as substandard when it is more than 90 days overdue (instead of 180 days previously) and,
starting in March 2005, as doubtful if it is overdue for more than a year (18 months
previously). Banks have been allowed to phase in the additional provisioning to meet the
latter change in loan classification until March 2008.

- 21 -

assets. To cover for the resulting large interest risk, the RBI has encouraged all banks to
build investment fluctuation reserves (IFR).18
36.
Staff urged the authorities to continue to monitor closely the risk management
practices of individual banks, and provide the incentives and tools for appropriate
market risk management. Staff observed that significant interest rate risk remained for
banks in a rising interest rate environment, and public sector banks were most exposed.19
Asset-liability management techniques, use of interest rate derivatives, and provisioning
should all be encouraged to manage interest risks. Staff encouraged the authorities to push
banks to accelerate the setting aside of capital to cover market risks, now due to be
completed only by 2006, noting that a uniform IFR penalizes sound banks unnecessarily and
may be insufficient for weaker banks.
37.
Building on the important progress achieved, staff suggested further reform to
build a strong, well regulated, and globally competitive financial system. Several factors
inhibit the deepening of bank credit which, at 35 percent of GDP, remains low by regional
standards. The new loan recovery framework (SARFAESI) and the introduction of a
centralized credit reporting system will help, but staff advised that further action was needed,
including:
•

Speeding loan recovery procedures—the authorities are planning to amend the
SARFAESI to eliminate frivolous appeals by debtors;

•

Reviewing the burden on banks of priority lending schemes, in particular to
agriculture;

•

Enhancing competition by further opening to private and foreign investors, including
by raising the FDI cap in private banks and eliminating the 10 percent limit on voting
rights in a bank.
E. How Does the RBI Plan to Respond to the Rising Inflation?

38.
The RBI faces the challenge of balancing the risk of slowing the nascent
investment recovery and preventing supply-side inflation from generating
second-round effects. Staff and the authorities agreed that inflation has thus far been mainly
18

Banks have up to March 2006 to build investment fluctuation reserves (IFR) of 5 percent
of portfolios that are marked-to-market. To reduce exposure to interest risk, the RBI, as a
one-time measure, allowed banks to shift securities to the held-to-maturity category, which
does not require marking to market, after immediately providing for possible losses.

a supply-side phenomenon. However, several factors point to the clear potential for
second-round effects, including buoyant demand, rapid credit expansion, a still comfortable
liquidity, and the fact that the full impact of oil prices has yet to be absorbed in domestic
prices. Staff also suggested that economic activity would likely not be unduly compressed by
a modest hike in interest rates and that timely action would avoid the potential need for more
aggressive action later. Following an increase in reserve requirements (by 50 basis points to
5 percent) in early October, the RBI raised the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to
4.75 percent at its mid-year policy meeting on October 26.
39.
The RBI took steps to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. Staff and the
central bank discussed the need to review the policy operating framework to ensure
consistency among the instruments—policy interest rates, primary and secondary market
sales of government securities, and reserve requirements—to provide a clear signal of its
policy stance and strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. The RBI explained that
a trade-off existed between the flexibility provided by the current use of multiple tools and
the clarity of the policy signal afforded by a single instrument. To increase the efficiency of
policy, the RBI announced at its mid-year policy review it would conduct monetary policy
mainly through secondary market operations with government securities. Staff suggested that
additional measures be considered in the future. Linking administered savings interest rates
more closely to market-determined government bond rates would limit the dampening impact
on policy transmission to aggregate demand. Also, developing more meaningful and timely
measures of consumer inflation and inflation expectations would improve policy analysis.
40.
The RBI intends to maintain exchange rate flexibility. The RBI has allowed
increasing flexibility in the exchange rate, in line with the view that the exchange rate should
be primarily determined by market forces, with intervention limited to smoothing volatility.
Staff agreed with this approach and noted that, while the major structural shifts ongoing in
the Indian economy make it difficult to estimate the equilibrium exchange rate, continued
capital inflows point to the desirability of more exchange rate flexibility. This would enhance
the role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber, help in the current environment of higher
inflation, and ease the burden of sterilization in the conduct of monetary policy. Finally, it
would encourage market players to hedge their exchange rate risk.
F. How Resilient is India to Much Higher Oil Prices?
41.
India’s rapidly growing oil consumption is
dependent on imports. India’s demand for oil has more
than tripled during the past 20 years, the result of a large
elasticity of oil demand to growth, of around 0.8–1, and a
growing population. Oil represents the second largest
element in consumers’ basket after food. About
75 percent of oil needs are imported, and oil imports
represent about 20 percent of total goods and services
imports. The average import price for India is up US$10

per barrel (about 35 percent) in the last year to an average US$38 in 2004.
42.
The authorities have adopted a burden-sharing approach to bearing the costs of
sharp increases in international oil prices. About 60 percent of the rise in import prices has
been passed through to domestic retail prices so far this year. The price band mechanism for
retail petroleum products, which allows oil firms to adjust prices automatically every two
weeks when import prices vary within a +/-10 percent range relative their historical rolling
average, was allowed to work only 3 times since it was introduced last July. Besides limiting
the ability of state-owned oil companies to pass through oil price rises, the government has
lowered selected ad valorem excises and import duties on several occasions to help contain
inflationary pressures. The fiscal cost of these measures is so far limited to about 0.1 percent
of GDP, since the tax rate reduction is partially offset by a higher base value of imports. Oil
companies have borne an estimated loss of 0.6 percent of GDP in profits in the first half of
the year due to the lack of pass-through.
43.
The authorities acknowledged that scope for limiting pass-through was
decreasing. In the short run, high refining margins provided some relief to state oil
companies which are large exporters of refined oil. If oil prices increased again, staff and the
authorities agreed that the reduction in budget revenues from further lowering petroleum
taxes would be difficult to sustain given India’s fiscal position. Further, quasi-fiscal costs on
state enterprises would become increasingly problematic. In this light, the authorities
increased in November domestic retail prices by 5–10 percent for select petroleum products.
44.
Staff highlighted that passing on the price increase to consumers would, in the
longer run, minimize the potential costs to the economy of permanent price changes.
Assuming a full pass-through to domestic oil prices, staff estimates that an additional,
US$10 per barrel increase in oil prices could, in the long term, add 2.6 percentage points to
the WPI. It would lower growth by 1 percentage point, and reduce the current account
surplus by 0.6 percentage points.20 Passing

These estimates assume no policy responses and reflect the net effect of a reduction in
incomes and oil demand in India as a result of the price increase, and of lower exports from a
slowdown in global growth. The Fund’s MULTIMOD simulations predict a 0.25 percentage
point fall in world demand in this context.

targeted subsidies.
45.
Staff also recommended that the authorities move to taxing petroleum products
on a specific basis. Ad valorem excises amplify the cost of oil price shocks for consumers,
and complicate fiscal planning. This is also a recommendation of the FRBMA Roadmap. A
ministerial committee was reviewing excise taxes and its conclusions were expected soon.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The resilience of the Indian economy in the face of high world oil prices and a
weak monsoon is testimony to the benefits of the reforms undertaken since the
early 1990s. India recorded growth above 8 percent growth last year, one of the fastest in the
world, and growth remains robust this year. Shortly after the elections, the new government
announced an ambitious reform agenda and affirmed its commitment to addressing India’s
large fiscal imbalances.
47.
The generally favorable economic environment provides a great opportunity for
India to make a bold push toward achieving its own ambitious goals. The new
government has rightly placed emphasis on accelerating annual growth to 8 percent to create
jobs and improve living standards of the poor, especially in rural India. Such goals are well
within India’s grasp, given India’s positive demographics and strong institutions, provided
the reform momentum is reinvigorated. The policy agenda is well known to the authorities,
and what is needed now is action on as many fronts as possible.
48.
The FRBMA provides a good framework for restoring fiscal sustainability and
implementation is key. The staff supports the thrust of the FRBMA Roadmap, featuring
front-loaded and revenue-led adjustment and improved quality of spending. This approach
has the potential of freeing significant resources for much-needed infrastructure and priority
social spending. Rapid implementation of the tax reform, especially introducing the state
VAT, removing most exemptions, broadening the service tax base, and improving tax
administration, is thus critical.
49.
Revenue reforms need to be complemented by steps to increase the efficiency of
spending. Even with the full implementation of the revenue recommendations of the
Roadmap, achieving the planned increases in public investment and social spending within
the FRBMA targets requires strong efforts to reduce low priority spending.
50.
It is key for the center to meet its fiscal targets and establish credibility in the
first year of implementation of the FRBMA. While efforts to improve tax compliance are
welcome, the 2004/05 budget does not make much headway in advancing tax reform and
rationalizing spending priorities. With the current deficit exceeding the mid-year target, it
would be prudent to prepare contingency measures to ensure that budget targets are met.
Avoiding fiscal slippage is particularly relevant at the current juncture, as private credit
grows strongly and the long-awaited recovery in private investment seems to be taking off.

- 25 -

Looking forward, the 2004/05 budget—the first full-year budget for this government—
provides the opportunity for medium-term fiscal reforms to be implemented in earnest.
51.
Notwithstanding reform efforts to date, much more is needed to strengthen state
finances. State deficits represented half of the general government deficit last year, and
states are responsible for much of the social and capital spending. It is encouraging that some
states have introduced their own fiscal responsibility legislation. The center could also make
more effective use of the range of incentive mechanisms and enforcement devices, such as
borrowing limits, debt swaps and debt forgiveness, to push states to reform. Enhanced
information on state finances would strengthen the effectiveness of this approach.
52.
The staff strongly supports the government’s emphasis on closing India’s
infrastructure gap, but has concerns about using RBI reserves for financing. Clearing
fiscal space for public investment is critical in order for the increased outlays not to
compromise fiscal targets and undermine credibility. The use of reserves would not resolve
these issues, and also has the potential to compromise RBI independence and add to inflation
pressures. Given the large infrastructure needs and tight budget constraints, it is also sensible
to look for ways to bring in the private sector. Improvements to the investment climate,
including by enhancing the regulatory framework for infrastructure, will greatly enhance the
prospects for successful PPPs while limiting fiscal risks.
53.
Sustained progress is needed with other reforms that are critical to generating
growth. The continuing liberalization of small industries is a positive step. Progress is
needed on liberalizing restrictive labor laws. Without the freedom to restructure their
workforce in light of market conditions, firms will have little incentive to create new jobs.
These reforms would be more feasible if efforts are also made to build an adequate social
safety net.
54.
Agriculture reform is critical to growth and poverty reduction. Agricultural
productivity is declining and the government’s focus on rural infrastructure and increased
credit to agriculture should help reverse this trend. However, implementing these measures
faces challenges. Increased investment in rural infrastructure requires creating fiscal space,
especially at the state level, and efforts to induce banks to lend more to agriculture could
impose a burden on the financial system. Accordingly, more fundamental reform and
liberalization is needed to unleash the potential of the key sector. This involves changes in
the system of minimum price supports and procurements; a rationalization of fertilizer,
water, and power subsidies; and lifting the remaining barriers to interstate goods movements.
55.
The continued strength in the balance of payments presents a good opportunity
to liberalize further external transactions. The recent rise in FDI caps in civil aviation
(private airlines only) was an important step, and following through on raising other sector
limits, including for telecom and insurance, would send a clear signal that India is open for
business. In this context, enhancing the business climate, including by easing the burden of
regulations, would help. Trade liberalization should also be accelerated by lowering tariffs,

- 26 -

introducing a more uniform duty structure, and eliminating administrative barriers. This
would also unleash a potentially powerful engine of growth for India.
56.
Commendable progress has been made in strengthening financial sector
performance, but challenges remain. In particular, banks’ interest risk from large holdings
of government securities is significant in the rising interest rate environment. The RBI should
strengthen risk-based supervision, to ensure that the most vulnerable banks are adequately
provisioned. The recent decision by the RBI to increase the risk-weight on personal and
housing loans is welcome given the strong credit growth in these sectors. However, while
increased lending to agriculture is an important objective of the government’s economic
policy, care should be taken that such lending be undertaken on commercial basis to protect
banks’ profitability and soundness. With the move to international best practices in loan
classification, the timetable for tightening of provisioning standards should also be
accelerated.
57.
More remains to be done to build a strong, well-supervised, and globally
competitive financial system in India. Cooperative banks have come under increased
pressure, raising concerns about their governance and oversight. Also, the authorities’
strategy for the future of DFIs needs to be clarified. To avoid the buildup of contingent
claims on government resources, the new institutions should be allowed to base their
investment decisions on commercial principles. More generally, further liberalization and
opening up to private and foreign investors would be desirable, together with commensurate
strengthening of risk-based supervision.
58.
It is understandable that the authorities have adopted a burden-sharing
approach to bearing the costs of sharp increases in international oil prices, but this may
not be sustainable. With WEO projections pointing to high oil prices for some time, the
authorities should allow their automatic price band mechanism to operate fully. Passing
through oil price fluctuations to consumers provides incentives for increasing consumption
efficiency and shifting to energy alternatives. Shifting petroleum taxation to a specific basis
would avoid amplifying oil shocks through the tax system.
59.
The recent tightening of monetary policy was appropriate. Inflation still largely
reflects supply-driven price rises but capacity utilization is high and the investment cycle is
picking up. In this context, the RBI’s 25 basis point increase in the repo rate signaled its
commitment to price stability, stabilized inflation expectations, and likely avoided the need
for a more aggressive move later. Credit is expanding rapidly and the RBI needs to continue
monitoring inflation closely and take prompt action as needed. Staff endorses the RBI’s twoway flexibility in exchange rate management. Should capital inflows remain strong and
upward pressure on the rupee continue, increasing exchange rate flexibility would help fight
inflation, facilitate economic adjustment, and encourage hedging of foreign exchange risk.
60.
There have been improvements in the quality of statistics in several
macroeconomic areas. With assistance from the Fund in some areas, the authorities are now

- 27 -

working to develop more timely and comprehensive indicators of inflation; annual and
quarterly real GDP on an expenditure basis; and more timely and high frequency data on
state finances. The authorities are encouraged to undertake updates of the FSAP and fiscal
ROSC. The previously identified restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII should be
removed as soon as possible.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

columns use the staff's projection of nominal GDP.
3/ For 2002/03, based on actual central government outturn and provisional outturn for the states; for 2003/04, based on provisional unaudited
central government outturn and staff's' projection of state finances. For 2004/05, based on staff's projections.
4/ Tax revenue = Tax revenue of central government (CG), including NCCF and states' share, plus state tax revenue.
5/ Nontax revenue = Nontax revenue of CG (including OCC), less interest payments by states on CG loans, plus nontax revenue of states.
6/ Expenditure and net lending = Total expenditure and net lending of CG, less net loans and grants to states and union territories, plus total
expenditure of states (excluding interest payments on CG loans).
7/ From the RBI Handbook of Statistics , 2003-04; the authorities treat disinvestment proceeds above-the-line as capital receipts.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since March 1, 1993, the Indian rupee has floated against other currencies, although the Reserve
Bank of India intervenes in the market periodically. As per the Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the exchange rate in India is classified as
managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement.
Currently, India maintains some restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
account transactions which are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2: (i) restrictions

India—Relations with the World Bank Group
India is one of the largest borrowers from the World Bank Group. The Bank Group’s program of
support combines policy dialogue with diversified lending, IFC investments and analytical and
advisory activities in the sectors that are important to reducing poverty and sustaining growth.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors discussed a new Country Strategy (CAS) for India on
August 26, 2004. The CAS jointly covers the programs of IBRD/IDA and IFC for the period of
FY05-08. With over one-quarter of the world’s poor in India, the overarching challenge is how
to scale up the impact of Bank Group assistance in order to help India move closer to achieving
its development goals—including the goal of halving poverty by 2015.
Scaling up assistance will entail a strengthened Bank Group program at the Center, as well as
more lending to the states compared to recent years. For state level lending, the strategy is to
retain an essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states, and to also seek new
opportunities for engagement with the largest and poorest states in India in order to help
strengthen the environment for reform. The expansion in lending will primarily be for
investment in infrastructure development, human development and rural livelihoods. Through
adjustment lending, continued emphasis is also being placed on support to fiscal and governance
reforms at the state level.
Adjustment lending to finance state level reforms will be limited to 15 percent of total
IBRD/IDA lending for the CAS period. Overall lending levels will fall within an upper bound of
US$2.15 billion per year for IBRD, on average for the four years of the CAS, and the IDA limits
for India established by the IDA Deputies. Financial operations since 1998/99 are summarized

India—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public
sector loan commitments totaled $12.9 billion as of December 31, 2003 for 72 loans. With an
additional 13 private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total loan
commitments amounted to $13.2 billion. These funds have been provided from the Bank’s
ordinary capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved 19 equity investments. The
AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

The AsDB’s Country Strategy and Program for 2003–2006 was approved on April 30, 2003.
The theme of the new strategy—the first operational strategy for India since adoption of the
AsDB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy in 1999—is mainstreaming poverty reduction. Poverty
will be addressed primarily through high but also equitable, pro-poor growth. Growth
interventions will also be complemented by social development interventions that deal with
poverty reduction. The AsDB’s Country Strategy and Program Update for 2005–07, currently
being reviewed by the AsDB’s Board, proposes to shift state level operations to the poorer
states and the northeastern region, and significantly increase assistance for agriculture, water
resource management and rural development.

ANNEX IV

India—Statistical Issues
1.
India has an elaborate system for compiling economic and financial statistics and
produces a vast quantity of data covering virtually all sectors of the economy. India subscribed
to the SDDS on December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, but
avails of the flexibility options for timeliness of data on general government operations and on
the periodicity and timeliness of labor market data. The authorities are planning further
improvements in the timeliness, periodicity, and coverage of data in a number of statistical areas
as detailed below.
2.
Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis, most of which
are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases. The authorities are
presently addressing a number of data compilation issues which were identified in the
August 2001 Report of the National Statistical Commission. These issues include:
•

The revision of statistical and data reporting methods in order to keep pace with the
shift to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial licensing.

•

The need for the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) to initiate procedures through
which its interaction with other agencies in the decentralized statistical system is made
more proactive as well as effective. The CSO has started this initiative with the proposed
establishment of the National Statistical Commission as a first step.

3.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF
Country Report 04/96) was issued in 2004. It consists of three elements. The first element
assesses India’s data dissemination practices against the SDDS requirements. The second
element assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework
(DQAF) developed by STA. The third element lists prioritized recommendations to improve
national accounts, price, fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. Following are
some issues related to the periodicity, coverage, and quality of statistical series identified by the
data ROSC mission.
•

National accounts: The CSO rebased the annual national accounts statistics and began
publishing quarterly data in 1999. However, quarterly data are only available from 1996Q2
and relate only to production-based data. Information on major expenditure categories is
only available with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year),
providing limited guidance for short-term policies. The CSO is planning to disseminate
quarterly expenditure-based aggregates starting in 2007 and is aiming to reduce the lag in
the currentness of the annual expenditure-based estimates to three months. Another issue in
national accounts is that estimates of value added in constant prices for public
administration and defense may be biased upwards in recent years, as they are based on the
government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated by the
Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

•

Industrial production index (IPI): In May 2000, the CSO took a welcome step of
releasing a completely revised time series for IPI, using the new WPI (base year 1993/94)

- 49 -

ANNEX IV

series as a deflator. The government has also contracted a private company, CMIE, to
increase the number of respondents and products in the sample, as recommended by the
data ROSC.
•

Price statistics: The Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) are based on weights that are at least
fifteen years old and do not fully capture price developments in the economy. However, the
CSO has recently initiated steps to revise the base year of the CPI. Presently, there are four
CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely
industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural
laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. The WPI is published
weekly with a lag of two weeks and are subject to large revisions, especially in periods of
rising inflation. A new WPI series was published in 2000 with updated weights, new
categories, and a revised base year (1993/94). However, the representativeness of the index
may be undermined by the collection of prices from a relatively small sample of products
and the infrequent updating of weights. The government is seeking technical assistance
from the World Bank to construct a producer price index based only on output prices,
excluding intermediate costs.

•

Balance of payments: A significant improvement has been made in the timeliness of the
quarterly balance of payments data, which are now released with a lag of three months.
However, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems. Further, data
on trade prices, volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis.
Starting January 2001, external debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one
quarter lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an
original maturity basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is
only available annually (and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term
nonresident Indian accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the
sectors prescribed in the Balance of Payments Manual Fifth Edition and these data are
disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual data.

•

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The RBI website and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide
array of monetary and financial statistics, including interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, the monetary survey, and results of government securities auctions. The frequency
and quality of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years. However,
some crucial data (e.g., RBI’s forward liabilities and intervention data) are still published
with lags of two to three months. India began disseminating the Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in
December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain variables, such as total foreign
reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are
disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the RBI website.

•

The ROSC data module mission of May 2002 identified that the concepts and definitions
used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the
guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM: (1) the
resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of
domestic credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities

- 50 -

ANNEX IV

subdivide the resident nonbank sector data by (i) central government, (ii) state government,
and (iii) the commercial sector (including other financial corporations, public and other
nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors); and commercial banks add accrued
interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis only. The mission has
recommended that the authorities adopt the full range of sectors prescribed in the MFSM
and include accrued interest on a monthly basis instead of reflecting it only on a quarterly
basis.
•

Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance posts selected monthly fiscal data and quarterly
debt data of the central government on its website. However, no monthly data on fiscal
performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an eight
to ten month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations.
In addition, although data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are
available with considerable lag, the typical presentation of fiscal accounts does not provide
a particularly useful classification for macroeconomic analysis. For example, classification
of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan
obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. Reporting for the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook has been current (latest year published is 2003), but the
coverage of the data is limited to the central government.

India—Core Statistical Indicators

- 51 ANNEX IV

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 24, 2005
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on December 23, 2004. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
The Impact of the Tsunami
2.
Some of India’s poorest regions have been affected by the massive earthquake
and tsunamis of December 26. India has suffered a large number of deaths and many poor
living in the region have been displaced. Many fisheries and local businesses have been
destroyed in this tragic event. The macroeconomic impact itself is not projected to be very
large; the most affected regions are not heavily industrialized. Some effect is possible on
tourism, although there has been no indication of large-scale cancellations by tourists. There
is some concern that the inundation of some crop lands may reduce agricultural output but
damage is yet to be ascertained.
3.
While it is still too early to know the precise economic cost of the disaster for
India, reconstruction and disaster relief appear manageable. The potential public costs
have been estimated by the government, on a preliminary basis, at about ½ percent of GDP.
The government has announced a first package of measures totaling Rs. 23 billion (about
US$500 million, less than 0.1 percent of GDP) to rebuild fisheries and houses in the affected
region. The authorities have indicated that fiscal targets for this year will not be affected.
The 2005/06 budget, due in March, will present the government’s plans to deal with
reconstruction efforts in the next fiscal year.
Other Recent Developments
4.
Recent economic developments are broadly consistent with staff’s growth
forecast for 2004/05. Second quarter growth reached 6.6 percent, slowing from 7.1 percent
the previous quarter, but slightly above staff’s projection. Industrial output rose by
7.9 percent year-on-year in November, slowing from 10.1 percent the previous month.
5.
Inflation has moderated. WPI inflation has declined for five consecutive weeks,
reflecting mainly lower prices of primary products and manufactured goods, and now stands
at 5.8 percent, below staff’s projection for end-2004/05 of 6.4 percent. CPI inflation also
declined in November, to 4.2 percent.
6.
The trade deficit widened in the second quarter of the fiscal year, but the
external position remains sound. The trade deficit rose to US$12.3 billion (1.9 percent of
annual GDP) from US$3.8 billion in the same period last year. Merchandise exports
increased by 10 percent in the second quarter, but merchandise imports rose sharply, by
54 percent, led by oil imports. The rising trade deficit was partially offset by strong growth in
services receipts, in particular software services, but the current account registered a deficit

-2-

of US$6.4 billion. A pickup in capital inflows helped maintain reserves approximately
unchanged at about US$120 billion. Preliminary data indicate that the trade deficit stood at
US$20 billion for April-December, compared with US$12 billion over the same period last
year. However, reserves have increased sharply, reaching US$129 billion in the first week of
January, reflecting strong capital inflows.
7.
Budgetary developments are in line with those described in the staff report. In
the fiscal year to November, the overall central government deficit was contained to
2.4 percent of GDP (about half the annual target), as tight expenditure control continued to
offset revenue shortfalls. The current deficit however reached 2.4 percent of GDP (97 percent
of the annual target).
8.

Several policy measures have been taken to advance the reform process:

•

The government lifted, for new joint ventures, the requirement that foreign firms seek
approval of their partners before setting up enterprises in related fields.

•

The lower house of parliament passed the planned amendments to the Securitization
and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest
(SARFAESI) Act to enable banks and financial institutions to more easily recover
bad loans.

•

The government issued an ordinance to set up the new pension regulator.

9.
The Indian authorities informed the staff that all but one of the restrictions
subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2 have been removed. The
staff is seeking to obtain the necessary underlying documentation to finalize its assessment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 3, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 24, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India is on track for another year of robust growth in 2004/05. Supported by a strong monsoon,
growth rebounded to 8½ percent in 2003/04, the highest level in over a decade. This year, firms
appear to have embarked on a new investment cycle, underpinned by strong credit growth.
In spite of high world oil prices and a disappointing monsoon, staff projects growth of
6½ percent this year, buoyed by the dynamism of industry and services. In 2005/06, a recovery
in agriculture on normal monsoons should support growth in the range of 6½ percent.
Inflation has been running higher, driven largely by supply-side factors. With rising international
oil and steel prices, and the weak monsoon temporarily affecting food prices, Wholesale Price
Index (WPI) inflation accelerated to 8.7 percent in August (year-on-year), before decelerating to
5½–6 percent more recently. With demand pressures remaining strong, capacity utilization high
and liquidity ample, WPI Inflation is projected to end 2004/05 around 6½ percent, before
declining to an average of 5½ percent in 2005/06.
The balance of payments position remains comfortable notwithstanding the higher oil prices.
In 2003/04, strong growth in remittances and services contributed to a current account surplus
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

of 1.7 percent of GDP. While export growth continues to be strong, high oil prices and strong
investment demand have led to a widening the trade deficit (2.6 percent of GDP in the fiscal
year to end-December). However, continued gains in services and strong remittances are
expected to help sustain the current account in broad balance in 2004/05. Capital account
developments appear to be driven by renewed optimism about the Indian economy following a
post-election lull. Rising portfolio inflows are accompanying a pickup in FDI. Reserves remain
comfortable, having reached US$129 billion by mid-January.
Financial market confidence in India remains strong. After posting one of the highest returns
among emerging markets in 2003/04 (83 percent), the stock market experienced a short period
of turbulence at the start of the fiscal year, reflecting election-related uncertainty and
expectations of interest rate tightening in the United States. However, buoyed by renewed
foreign investor inflows, the stock market more than regained the ground lost, rising by close to
30 percent between June and mid-January.
Monetary policy was aimed at curbing inflation pressures while ensuring sufficient liquidity to
support growth. Starting last April, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued Market
Stabilization Bonds to sterilize capital inflows. In October 2004, the RBI also raised banks’
reserve requirements by 50 basis points and increased the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points.
These steps, combined with the increase in credit, have reduced excess liquidity. At the same
time, the RBI has encouraged banks to protect against interest rate risk on their large holdings
of government securities including by building investment fluctuation reserves.
Exchange rate policy has become increasingly flexible, with the RBI intervening to smooth
volatility. In the post-election period, the slowdown in capital inflows and downward pressure on
the rupee led the RBI to sell dollars to limit the depreciation. In recent months, however, the
rupee-dollar exchange rate has recovered the lost ground.
The deterioration in central government finances appears to have been reversed. For the first
time since the mid-1990s, the central government deficit (IMF definition)2 came in below target
in 2003/04 at 5.1 percent of GDP reflecting strong revenues and economic growth.
However, this improvement appears to have been offset by overruns on subnational budgets,
causing the general government deficit to rise to an estimated 9.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04.
Further improvement in general government finances is budgeted for 2004/05. The central
government budget for 2004/05 envisages an overall deficit (IMF definition) of 4.5 percent of
GDP. The budget, which was delayed until after the elections, introduced some tax base
broadening measures, but major tax reform initiatives and significant spending increases for key
social or infrastructure needs were postponed to next year. The fiscal deficit for the first half of
the year was in line with budget plans although achieving the ambitious revenue targets will
require strong efforts. With an improvement expected in state finances as a result of ongoing
reform efforts, the general government deficit for 2004/05 is projected at 9.3 percent of GDP.
2

The IMF definition includes receipts from divestment as financing rather than revenue.

The authorities have agreed to publish the Article IV consultation report.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed their sympathies to the Indian people for the tragic loss of life
resulting from the recent tsunami. Directors viewed the resilience of the Indian economy in
recent years as testimony to the benefits of more than a decade of reforms. They noted that, in
spite of high world oil prices and a weak monsoon, India is on track for another year of robust
growth in 2004/05, following the strong performance of 2003/04, when growth exceeded
8 percent. Directors welcomed the new government’s ambitious reform agenda—especially the
renewed emphasis on creating jobs and reducing rural poverty—and its commitment to
addressing India’s fiscal imbalances. They emphasized that rapid progress on a broad range of
reforms will be required to build on recent successes and for India to achieve its full potential.
Directors considered that the present favorable economic environment provides a good
opportunity for India to make a bold push towards achieving its reform agenda, and encouraged
the authorities to garner the necessary political consensus for it.
Directors emphasized that India’s large fiscal deficits and public debt remain a key constraint on
sustained rapid growth. Directors noted that, with credit to the private sector on the rise, the
government’s large financing needs can increasingly crowd out private investment. Moreover,
they underlined that, without enhancing tax revenues and reducing lower-priority spending, it
will be very difficult to adequately address India’s large infrastructure needs. Directors also
pointed out that fiscal consolidation is a prerequisite for more complete financial sector
development and further opening up of the external sector.
Directors viewed the new Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) as a
good framework for restoring fiscal sustainability. They also viewed as broadly appropriate the
government’s roadmap for achieving the targets of the FRBMA—notably, the elimination of the
current deficit by 2008/09—citing, in particular, the emphasis on frontloaded tax reform and
improvements in the quality of spending. In this context, Directors underlined the importance of
introducing the state value-added tax (VAT) as planned on April 1, broadening the personal and
corporate income tax bases and strengthening tax administration, and appropriate targeting of
subsidies. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to move toward a national goods and
services tax over time. They emphasized the importance of the government meeting its fiscal
targets in this, the first year of the FRBMA, in order to firmly establish its credibility. Directors
also advised vigilance regarding central- and state-government contingent liabilities.
Directors recognized that reforms have been undertaken to strengthen state finances, noting
that these steps have so far not led to a decisive turnaround. They emphasized that more needs
to be done. Directors were encouraged that a number of states have enacted their own fiscal
responsibility legislation. In this regard, they emphasized that states still account for about half
of the general government deficit. Directors pointed to the importance of states introducing the
VAT, strengthening their pension systems, and accelerating progress on power sector reforms.

-4-

They also urged the central government to make more effective use of its leverage over the
states—including via its approval of all state borrowings—to encourage needed reforms.
Directors supported the government’s emphasis on closing India’s infrastructure gap, but
expressed serious concerns with the proposal to use foreign exchange reserves to finance
infrastructure spending. Directors emphasized the importance of undertaking any increases in
infrastructure spending within the limits of the FRBMA. They noted as well that significant
private sector participation in infrastructure will likely be forthcoming if India will step up its
efforts to improve the investment climate and enhance the regulatory framework for
public-private partnerships. Directors also noted that using reserves in this manner has the
potential to compromise perceptions of central bank independence and increase inflation.
Directors viewed continued progress on structural reforms as critical to sustaining rapid growth
in India. They noted that the recent reduction in small-scale reservation and the relaxation of
some sectoral caps on foreign direct investment are important advances. Directors emphasized,
however, that to generate the large number of new jobs needed to meet the rising working age
population, the authorities should enhance the business climate, including by easing the burden
of regulation, and liberalize restrictive labor laws. Directors noted that agricultural reform is
critical to growth and poverty reduction. In this context, they emphasized that the government’s
commitment to improving rural infrastructure is appropriate, but that eliminating structural
impediments to growth—including by reforming the current system of price supports,
guaranteed procurement, and large subsidies for fertilizer and power—is equally important.
Directors saw the continued strength in India’s balance of payments as an excellent opportunity
to accelerate trade liberalization. Directors welcomed India’s progress in bringing down tariff
rates last year and their commitment to further reductions to ASEAN levels over the medium
term. However, they underlined that more rapid progress on reducing tariffs, together with a
lowering of administrative barriers to trade, will help unleash a potentially powerful engine of
growth.
Directors commended the continued progress made in strengthening the financial sector, but
observed that risks remain. They noted that nonperforming loans of banks have declined,
despite a tightening of loan classification norms, and that capital adequacy ratios are well above
the 9 percent minimum. Directors noted, however, that the recent rise in private sector
lending—while generally welcome—requires close scrutiny by the RBI. In this context, Directors
welcomed the recent RBI decision to increase the risk weight on consumer and housing loans,
and encouraged supervisors to strengthen risk-based prudential requirements. Directors also
pointed to the large bank holdings of government securities as a significant potential risk in a
rising interest rate environment, and emphasized the need to monitor more closely risk
management practices of banks. Directors viewed recent steps to merge Development Finance
Institutions with large nonperforming loans and a high cost of funds with public commercial
banks as potentially helpful. However, they underlined the importance of ensuring that lending
decisions by the new institutions be made on purely commercial principles. Directors
commended the authorities for addressing problems of governance in urban cooperative banks.

-5-

Directors emphasized that more remains to be done, over the medium term, to build a strong
and globally competitive financial sector and improve resource allocation. In this context,
Directors encouraged the authorities to open further the banking system to private and foreign
investors, including by raising the FDI cap for private banks and eliminating the 10 percent limit
on voting rights for foreign investors.
Directors viewed the authorities’ burden-sharing approach to bearing the costs of sharp
increases in international oil prices as understandable, but cautioned that it may not be
sustainable. They emphasized that, with oil prices potentially remaining high and volatile for
some time, it is important for the authorities to allow their automatic pricing mechanism to work.
This would protect government revenues, limit losses to state-owned petroleum companies, and
provide incentives for more efficient energy use.
Directors viewed monetary policy as generally appropriate. They noted that the RBI’s timely
increase in the reverse repo rate in October signals its commitment to price stability, stabilizes
inflation expectations, and avoids the need for a more aggressive move later. Directors
emphasized that, while inflation has recently trended downward, strong domestic demand,
comfortable liquidity, and the potential for further commodity price increases will require the RBI
to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
Directors welcomed the efforts by the RBI to increase exchange rate flexibility, and encouraged
the RBI to continue to support this policy going forward. They noted that, should capital inflows
remain strong, increased flexibility will reduce inflationary pressures, facilitate economic
adjustment, and encourage hedging of foreign exchange risk.
Directors supported the Indian authorities’ gradual approach to capital account liberalization.
They commended steps taken during the past year to relax restrictions on capital outflows for
individuals, ease corporate access to international capital markets, and raise the cap on foreign
investor holdings of government securities. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to
eliminate restrictions on foreign direct investment, which tend to be longer-term in nature.
Directors urged the authorities to continue to improve the quality of their statistics. They urged
that priority be given to developing more timely and comprehensive indicators of inflation; and
more timely data on state finances. In this light, they welcomed recent Fund technical
assistance to develop an integrated state fiscal data base and debt register.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
