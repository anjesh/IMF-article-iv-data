EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Dominica has recovered remarkably from the 2001–02 crisis and its near-term outlook
is positive. The authorities undertook a bold economic reform program in late 2002,
supported by the Fund, to restore debt sustainability and pave the way for sustained growth
and poverty reduction. Performance under the program was exemplary. Public finances
improved considerably and public debt declined sharply. Output growth exceeded the
historical average, reaching a near two-decade high in 2006, and is expected to remain
strong. Inflation has been subdued and is projected to remain low. Substantial progress has
been made in indirect tax and social security reforms, as well as in other reform areas.
Key remaining challenges are: (i) maintaining sound fiscal policies to continue to reduce
the public debt ratio, which is still high at about 100 percent of GDP and renders the
economy vulnerable to external shocks, particularly natural disasters and abrupt declines in
aid; (ii) strengthening the resilience of the financial sector, which has contributed to the
strong post-crisis recovery and yet remains weakly regulated and supervised; and
(iii) continuing to undertake structural reforms to help diversify the economy further away
from the waning banana sector and find new growth drivers.
Policy discussions
To address these challenges, the authorities have recently embarked on a
comprehensive reform program, embodied in the Growth and Social Protection
Strategy (GSPS). Key elements of the strategy are undertaking structural reforms to foster
private sector-led growth and reduce poverty while maintaining prudent fiscal policy,
including attaining a primary surplus target of 3 percent of GDP.
The mission endorsed the authorities’ reform agenda, while emphasizing some aspects
of the GSPS including the need to:
•

strengthen public finance management (especially aid and aid-related spending),
maintain the integrity of the value-added tax (VAT), and explore alternatives to the
current tax incentive regime;

•

enhance financial sector regulation and supervision, including intensifying on-site
inspection of banks and creating a fully-functioning regulatory and supervisory body
over nonbank financial institutions (in particular credit unions and insurance
companies); and

•

prioritize structural reforms, in particular, streamline public sector entities along their
core mandates; improve contract enforcement and foreclosure arrangements; and
reform the utilities and customs administration.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Dominica has fully recovered from the 2001–02 crisis. Expansionary fiscal policy
in the 1990s led to an acute economic crisis. In response, the authorities adopted a bold
reform strategy in late 2002, supported by the Fund. Performance under the program was
exemplary. The fiscal primary surplus in 2005/06 was some 10 percentage points of GDP
higher than in 2000/01, and public debt declined by 30 percentage points of GDP (Figure 1).
As a result, economic activity rebounded markedly, inflation remained subdued and
international reserves rose considerably.
2.
Dominica is now in a strong position to address remaining challenges. Key
remaining challenges are: (i) reducing further the public debt ratio, which is still high at
about 100 percent of GDP and renders the economy vulnerable to external shocks, in
particular natural disasters and abrupt declines in aid; (ii) ensuring that the financial sector is
well regulated and supervised; and (iii) diversifying the economy further away from the
waning banana sector and find new growth drivers.
3.
Political support for structural reforms remains unabated. The current
government, in power since early 2000, increased its majority in the 2005 elections with a
reform platform. The government has successfully implemented often unpopular yet critical
reforms, such as nominal wage cuts and imposition of stabilization levies. Following the end
of the PRGF-supported program last December, the authorities publicly launched the Growth
and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS), a home-grown reform strategy that had been
formulated in close consultation with donors. The authorities are currently conducting wideranging public consultations regarding the possibility of a successor Fund program to support
the GSPS.
4.
Dominica has generally been receptive to the Fund’s policy advice. The
authorities have demonstrated strong program ownership both in fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms. Some structural reforms have been slow, mainly reflecting limited
implementation capacity. Technical assistance from the Fund has been active, mostly through
CARTAC, particularly in tax policy and administration, public finance management, and
social security reform.
II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

5.
Dominica’s economic performance has strengthened remarkably. The economy
grew by an estimated 4 percent last year, the strongest in nearly two decades, driven by a
pickup in tourism and buoyant construction (Figure 2, first panel). A recovery in banana
production as well as a boost in offshore school activity also played a role. Annual inflation
was limited to 1.6 percent in 2006, reflecting stabilizing oil prices and the currency peg
regime, despite an uptick in service prices related to the VAT introduction and increasing
shipping costs (Figure 2, second panel).

Grant flows have more than doubled the pre-crisis level. Dominica received
grants of almost 13 percent of GDP for the first nine months of this fiscal year, compared
with a budget projection of 8½ percent and the average pre-crisis level of 4½ percent. The
surge is mainly due to one-off disbursements from the European Union (EU) and new
donors, including Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. A large proportion of the grants has
been saved in bank accounts, reflecting limited implementation capacity and the authorities’
commitment to sound spending.
8.
Credit to the private sector increased apace, underpinned by deposit growth and
fiscal consolidation. Bank credit to the private sector rose by 11 percent in 2006, the highest
in 15 years (Figure 2, third panel). Private sector deposits have continued to increase in part
due to strong inflows from expatriates in Europe. The increase in public savings has also
contributed to funding the credit expansion (Figure 2, fourth panel). The ample liquidity as
well as competition among lenders led to a 70 basis points decline in average lending rates to
9.2 percent during 2006. Bank lending remains concentrated in consumer loans, particularly
mortgages (Figure 2, fifth panel).
9.
Banking prudential indicators have continued to improve. The banks are well
capitalized, profitable and liquid with declining nonperforming loans (NPL). The NPL
decline mainly reflects stricter enforcement of prudential guidelines by the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and write-offs of large bad loans. Strong macroeconomic
performance has also helped improve credit quality. Nevertheless, the average NPL ratio
remains high by international standards and exceeds the ECCB prudential target of 5 percent
(Figure 2, last panel). In addition, provisioning levels are low in part due to the recent writeoffs, while banks face tough competition in a saturated loan and deposit market, in particular
from credit unions and insurance companies.

10.
Supervision of the nonbank financial sector remains weak. Credit unions, whose
deposits amount to about 30 percent of bank deposits, remain under-regulated despite their
systemic importance. A near-insolvent Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AID),
which mostly on-lends concessionary loans, remains to be rehabilitated. The weak
supervision largely reflects resource constraints as well as delays in enacting key regulatory
legislation. After much delay, a draft law providing regulatory and supervisory power to the
Financial Service Unit has recently been submitted to parliament.
11.
The external current account deficit narrowed sharply in 2006. The improvement
mostly reflects stronger tourism receipts. The deficit is likely to remain large at around
20 percent of GDP this year, but continues to be covered almost fully by large capital grants
and foreign direct investment.
12.
Discussions on debt restructuring continue with nonparticipating creditors.
Since the offer of restructuring terms in June 2004, 78.5 percent of eligible debt has been
restructured. The authorities have maintained good-faith efforts in pursuing agreements with
the nonparticipating creditors, including a recent visit by the Prime Minister to Kuwait. The
negotiations with one major private creditor, the most recent of which took place in January
2007, have been particularly challenging, given a complex derivative overlaid by the creditor
to finance the bond purchase.1
13.
Further progress has been made in structural reforms since the end of the PRGF
arrangement. The contribution rate for the Dominica Social Security was raised by
1 percentage point in March and set to be raised further in coming years as part of a
comprehensive reform (see below). The authorities have recently started to merge the port
and airport authorities and to breakup the National Development Corporation into a tourism
board and an investment promotion agency with a view to improve their efficiency.
III.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

14.
Dominica’s near-term economic outlook is positive. The growth momentum is
expected to slow somewhat in the near term, in part due to the closure of a major factory, but
its underlying trend will remain above the historical average. Public investment will remain
buoyant, funded by large aid receipts, while consumption is likely to remain robust, in part
supported by the increases in public sector wages. The momentum in the tourism sector will
likely be sustained, underpinned by a major diaspora event and recent promotional efforts.
Ongoing efforts to improve marketing and quality controls will help boost agriculture and
fishery production although their full effects will take time to materialize. Inflation is
projected to remain low.
1

See IMF Country Report No. 04/286 for details.

10
15.
The medium-term economic prospects hinge on the continued implementation of
the authorities’ reform agenda. The authorities’ reform strategy, as embodied in the GSPS,
envisages above-trend output growth of 3 percent per annum and gradual reductions in
unemployment and poverty, underpinned by structural reforms and prudent fiscal policy.
Public investment is expected to play an important role in achieving the policy objectives by
providing social and physical infrastructure critical for private-sector led growth. The
strategy relies heavily on external grants to avoid an increase in public debt. The
maintenance of the primary surplus at 3 percent of GDP, as envisaged in the GSPS, will
bring about a gradual reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio and enable Dominica to meet the
ECCB target for the debt ratio (60 percent by 2020).

16.
Vulnerabilities remain high, notwithstanding progress made in recent years.
Public finances have been greatly strengthened through sustained fiscal consolidation, debt
restructuring and, more recently, social security reform. The debt dynamics nonetheless
remain vulnerable to external shocks, in part due to the bunching of debt service payments in
2009−11 as well as the high public

REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS

17.
Against this background, policy discussions centered on the medium-term
challenges of sustaining growth and reducing poverty.
A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
18.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework as a
sound and coherent strategy and laid out key fiscal challenges going forward.
Notwithstanding the remarkable fiscal consolidation, fiscal flexibility remains limited in
Dominica due to the high debt and large investment needs under the GSPS. In addition, the
recent surge in aid poses policy challenges, especially since the levels and volatility of past
aid point to unsustainability of the surge (Box 2). In this regard, the mission welcomed the

11
authorities’ fiscal framework that envisages a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP
(excluding grants and grant-related spending) and recommended saving the aid in excess of
budgeted amounts. The mission stressed that the prudent fiscal policy will not only bring
about a gradual decline in the debt ratio but also provide for smooth budget execution in the
event of aid shortfalls. Key policy challenges are to continue to keep current expenditures
under control, maintain revenue strength, and improve the management of aid and aid-related
investment.
19.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the mission’s recommendations,
particularly on the need to meet the primary surplus target and manage aid prudently.
They reaffirmed their commitment to the primary surplus target, and indicated that, if
necessary, saving would be sought from nonwage current spending. They also stressed that
the scaled-up aid would not be used to increase the overall budget envelope unless
sustainability is assured. They noted however that there is scope for tax reductions, given
strong revenue performance in recent years and successful reform of indirect taxes. They also
noted that some measures for a major taxpayer are being considered to compensate its loss of
tax privileges at the time of VAT introduction. After five years of nominal wage freeze, there
is a consensus about compensating public employees adequately in consideration of strong
economic activity and the need to improve and retain the quality of public services.
20.
The mission cautioned that tax cuts need to be modest and wage increases be
consistent with the fiscal framework. The mission noted that fiscal flexibility is
constrained for the next year even without tax reductions. Tax revenues are likely to fall
relative to GDP as the VAT refund process normalizes and the effect of the factory closure
filters through the economy.2 At the same time, current expenditures will likely remain
elevated due to large project-related expenses, while the aid outlook is uncertain. The
primary surplus will hence likely decline next year under the existing policies although its
target will be met by a narrow margin. The mission hence emphasized the importance of not
undermining underlying revenue strength while recognizing the scope for modest reductions
in income taxes, in particular for low-income brackets. It also urged the authorities to keep
the deviation in the wage bill to a minimum,3 and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
adopt compensatory expenditure measures, if needed to ensure meeting the primary surplus
target.
21.
The mission further advised the authorities to explore alternatives to the current
tax incentive regime. The income tax yields are very low due to a myriad of tax incentives
2

The direct budgetary impact of the closure is limited due to tax holidays granted to the factory.

The PRGF-supported program envisaged that the wage bill would fall from 13¾ percent of GDP in 2004/05 to

their commitment to continue to publish all government decisions on tax concessions and, to
the extent possible, their cost estimates to ensure transparency.
22.
There was agreement that maintaining the integrity of the VAT is critical for a
successful implementation of the GSPS. The VAT has performed well in terms of the
revenue yield and compliance, accounting for one third of tax revenues. Given the substantial
resource needs for social spending, quality public services, and crucial infrastructure
investment, it would be critical not to undermine the integrity of the VAT and to continue to
improve revenue administration. Legitimate concerns about small business and low-income
earners would be better addressed by improving refund arrangements, raising the VAT
threshold, or increasing income tax allowances, as highlighted by a recent FAD/CARTAC
mission. In this regard, the mission welcomed the authorities’ reaffirmation to undertake a
comprehensive review of the VAT by September 2007.
23.
The mission urged the authorities to strengthen public finance management, in
particular of aid and aid-related spending. Public investment represents about 40 percent
of total investment in Dominica, with two thirds of it financed by aid. However, public
investment in Dominica, while sizable, is far less productive than in countries in other
regions.4 In this regard, consideration could be given to establish an aid-coordination unit
within the Ministry of Finance that integrates aid administration, including aid negotiations
as well as planning and monitoring of aid-financed expenditure. Further progress will also be
needed in multiyear budgeting, procurement and auditing as well as donor coordination, as
highlighted by a recent EU-sponsored study. The enactment of the Financial Administration
Act, as committed by the authorities, would help in this regard. The authorities agreed on the
need to improve aid management but noted that donors could also play an important role by
improving predictability of aid and streamlining disbursement procedures.

The mission welcomed the progress made in social security reform. The social
security system had become unsustainable due to adverse demographics and inadequate
reserves.5 The authorities responded by adopting a comprehensive pension reform in mid2006, the implementation of which began

improved administration, have increased the
number of contributors significantly. Changes
are also being considered to increase the fund’s overseas investments by up to 5 percent of its
portfolio.
25.
The mission urged further progress in debt restructuring. It would be important
that the authorities continue their good-faith efforts toward collaborative debt agreements
that maintain inter-creditor equity, including making payments into the escrow account and
regular attempts to discuss with the remaining holdout creditors. The authorities indicated
that they are considering closing the three-year long negotiations if not much progress is in
sight. The mission stressed the importance of continuing to uphold the good-faith efforts.
B. Strengthening Resilience of the Financial Sector
26.
The mission expressed concern whether supervision keeps pace with ongoing
financial sector expansion. The recent credit expansion is a positive sign of increasing
domestic activity and a welcome reflection of increased confidence instilled by fiscal
consolidation. Nonetheless, its rapid

intensify on-site inspection—in order to safeguard financial sector stability. It also noted that
extensive financial linkages in the region and increases in cross-border transactions require
closer coordination among supervisory bodies in the region and, ultimately, the
establishment of a regional framework for consolidated supervision.
27.
The weak oversight of the nonbank financial institutions is a matter of concern.
Given the systemic importance of the nonbank financial institutions, in particular credit
unions, a proper regulatory and supervisory framework needs to be put in place as a matter of
priority. Further progress is needed in rehabilitating the AID Bank and improving its
supervision. In this context, the mission welcomed the progress made in enacting the
Financial Services Unit Act and urged that the unit rapidly become fully operational with
adequate resources and supporting legislation—in particular the amendment of the
Cooperative Societies Act and new insurance legislation. The mission also noted that a
regional approach to regulation and supervision would be useful given the extensive regional
financial linkages as well as resource constraints.
28.
The authorities agreed that further progress is needed in improving financial
sector supervision. The authorities indicated that they are keenly aware of potential
systemic risks from credit unions, and put a priority to ensuring that the Financial Services
Unit is fully functioning. The lack of resources and expertise remains the biggest challenge
and, in this regard, the authorities are considering outsourcing part of supervisory functions
to other regulatory bodies in the region. There are also challenges in establishing a regulatory
framework for credit unions due to the need to harmonize it with the position of the
Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions.
C. Fostering Growth and Reducing Poverty
29.
Dominica, a small island economy, faces unique challenges in sustaining growth.
Structural factors—such as high transportation costs and the lack of economies of scale—
continue to pose challenges to the economy, as exemplified by a recent decision of a
multinational company to close one of its factories in Dominica. The economy is also more
vulnerable to external shocks than larger countries. The outlook for the banana sector will
likely remain challenging due to the erosion of trade preferences although the Fair Trade
niche that relies on organic branding could bring some support to the sector. In addition,
tourism, while promising, will remain sensitive to external factors. In this regard, the
authorities agreed with the mission that efforts for diversification to nonbanana crops need to
be pursued further, with a focus on improving productivity including through better
marketing and quality control.
30.
The staff noted that, while some sources of vulnerability are unavoidable, sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms would offer Dominica the best prospect
for sustainable growth. There was broad agreement between the mission and the authorities
that reforms are necessary in public entities, the judiciary, utilities and customs. The mission

15
also discussed deficiencies in statistics, in particular the national accounts, that hinder
analysis of economic developments and formulation of policy. The authorities reaffirmed
their commitment to structural reforms while noting that the effects of prior structural
reforms need to be assessed.
•

Public sector entities need to be streamlined along core mandates. Many
national development agencies—notably, the Dominican Export Import Agency
(DEXIA), the AID Bank, and the National Development Corporation (NDC)—have
not fully fulfilled their mandates and lack efficiency and adequate oversight. While
the recent start of the NDC restructuring is a positive move in this regard, further
progress is needed in restructuring other entities, in particular DEXIA, which
remains in a large loss and is widely seen as competing with private sector
activities.

•

Utilities reform. Notwithstanding the abundant nonhydrocarbon energy sources,
electricity tariffs are among the highest in the region due in part to an outdated
regulatory system. The recently approved electricity supply act is an important step
forward, but a properly functioning utilities commission is needed without delay.

•

Customs reform. Customs administration needs to modernize its operations,
introduce manifest control, rationalize the appeals process and improve its
efficiency, especially regarding processing time, as recommended by a recent
FAD/CARTAC mission.

31.
Dominica’s external competitiveness remains broadly appropriate. The CPIbased real effective exchange rate has declined since 2001, reaching at end-2006 its lowest
level in nearly 20 years. This reflects relative price stability in Dominica, associated with the
fiscal consolidation, and the depreciation of the EC dollar against the currencies of trading

16
partners (Box 3). Other indicators of competitiveness, in particular tourism costs and recent
developments in the tourism sector, as

32.
The authorities’ poverty reduction strategy is coherent and properly balanced.
The strategy, as laid out in the GSPS, recognizes critical roles played by sustained economic
growth and fiscal soundness in reducing poverty and emphasizes the importance of targeted
social programs. An integral part of the strategy is to prioritize interventions with immediate
and direct impact on the most vulnerable groups. In this regard, the mission welcomed the
commitment of the authorities to undertake poverty assessment this year, which will help
design efficient and well-targeted social safety nets. It also noted that the ongoing reform of
the Dominica Social Security, which accounts for about half of total social spending, should
help provide secure resources for social spending over the long term.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The authorities’ reform efforts following the 2001/02 crisis have been bearing
fruit. Fiscal consolidation has helped re-establish macroeconomic stability and thereby
contributed to strong output growth. These efforts, together with debt restructuring, have
moved the debt trajectory towards a sustainable path. The continuation of sound fiscal policy
is critical to attaining debt sustainability and ensuring external stability. In addition, the
authorities have made substantial progress in structural reforms, in particular in indirect tax
and social security reforms.
34.
The economy is poised to maintain above-trend growth, sustained by sound
economic policy and continued structural reform. Despite a near-term softening arising
from the closure of a major factory, the economy’s underlying growth is expected to remain
6

The upcoming toothpaste factory closure represents the implementation by a multinational company of its
global business strategy, and may not reflect deterioration in Dominica’s external competitiveness. The net
effect of the closure is limited to an estimated 2.5 percent of total exports of goods and services in 2008, given a
very high import content of the toothpaste exports.

Jan-07

17
above the historical average in coming years, with successful implementation of the
authorities’ reform strategy. The steady growth with low inflation will help achieve the
authorities’ social objectives, namely poverty reduction and job creation.
35.
The authorities are to be commended for their commitment to address
remaining policy challenges. Their medium-term reform strategy appropriately envisages
the maintenance of a fiscal policy geared at achieving a primary surplus target of 3 percent of
GDP and thereby bringing about a gradual reduction in the debt ratio. It also lays out a
structural reform program focused on the need to foster private sector-led growth.
36.
The recent surge in budgetary aid is a welcome development but presents policy
challenges as well. The recent aid flows were extraordinarily large and unlikely to be
sustained in coming years. Given the uncertain aid prospects, large investment needs and
high debt, the authorities are right in smoothing spending over time and in using some of the
savings to substitute expensive borrowing and reduce debt. They have recognized the need to
improve budget management, in particular as regards capital expenditure, in order to use aid
efficiently, transparently and consistently with macroeconomic objectives. The Fund,
together with donors, will continue to provide technical assistance in this area through
CARTAC.
37.
Tax cuts, while justifiable, need to be modest and accompanied by revamping
the tax incentive system without undermining the integrity of the VAT. The successful
indirect tax reform provides modest scope for tax reductions, without jeopardizing the
primary surplus target. Some tax incentives are unavoidable to attract investment and create
jobs, especially given intense tax competition in the region. However, the current system,
centered on tax holidays and exemptions, needs to be replaced with more efficient schemes
such as accelerated depreciation and investment credit. Legitimate concerns about lowincome earners and small businesses would be better addressed by targeted measures such as
increases in allowances and VAT thresholds.
38.
Greater progress is needed in financial sector supervision. While recent
improvements in banking prudential indicators are welcome, the rapid credit expansion and
low provisioning, together with strong competition from loosely-regulated nonbank financial
institutions, warrant enhanced supervision over the entire financial sector. Given extensive
regional financial linkages and the lack of supervisory expertise, the authorities are right in
considering outsourcing part of supervisory functions to a regional pool as a short-term
solution. A long-term solution could be sought from the creation of a regional regulatory
body in the context of ongoing regional integration initiatives.
39.
Dominica’s external competitiveness remains broadly appropriate. The real
effective exchange rate is the lowest in nearly 20 years, supported by fiscal consolidation and
the EC dollar depreciation against the currencies of trading partners. This, together with
other indicators such as tourism cost indices and recent developments in the tourism sector,

18
suggests that the real exchange rate level is broadly competitive and the exchange regime, if
supported by sound fiscal policy, continues to serve Dominica well.
40.
Continued progress in structural reforms is critical for private-sector led
growth. While some structural factors such as high transportation costs and the lack of
economies of scale will continue to pose a challenge to the economy, the government could
play an important role through structural reforms, including reforms of public entities,
utilities, the judiciary and customs. This will help reduce costs of doing business and
facilitate diversification away from the waning banana sector. Improvement of the
management of public investment programs would also go a long way towards enhancing
productivity of the private sector.
41.
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate, weaknesses remain
in the coverage, timeliness and dissemination. Comprehensive, reliable, and timely data
are essential for policy analysis, effective policy-making and informed public debate.
Ongoing economic transformation from agriculture to services makes it all the more
important to improve the statistics. Priority would need to be given to compilation of national
account statistics, in particular tourism, agriculture and labor statistics, and dissemination of
intra-year fiscal statistics.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Dominica take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

19

Box 1. Dominica: Reform of Indirect Taxes
The move to the new indirect tax regime has been largely successful. Dominica
introduced a new VAT and excise duty regime in March 2006 to replace the sales,
consumption, hotel occupancy and entertainment tax. Excise taxes covered motor
vehicles, alcoholic beverages, petroleum and tobacco products. Preliminary evidence
suggests that the new regime boosted indirect revenues. VAT collection in the first half
of 2006/07 was much higher (10.4 percent of GDP) than budgeted (8.5 percent of
GDP) although the buoyancy is likely to decline somewhat in the future with the

Box 2. Dominica: Managing an Aid Surge
As noted in a recent Occasional Paper,8 a surge in aid flows, while positive in principle,
presents challenges as well. Scaled-up aid flows can cause upward pressure on the real
exchange rate of the recipient countries if not handled by proper macroeconomic policies.
Debt sustainability could be jeopardized if the aid is volatile and come in the form of debt.
Aid flows can also strain the administrative capacity of recipient governments, fragment and
impair budgetary procedures, and encourage rent-seeking behavior.
Dominica’s policy response to a recent aid surge helped boost private sector activity.
Budgetary aid inflows rose by about 4 percent of GDP over the 2002–05 period, but as the
authorities efforts led to an even larger improvement in the budget balance, the government
saved more than the aid surge, reflecting the authorities’ primary concern about restoring
fiscal and debt sustainability. In contrast, the external current account showed little
improvement during the same period as the private sector increased its absorption, almost
fully offsetting the rise in public savings without raising inflation or appreciating the
currency.

Box 3. External Competitiveness
Dominica’s export sector has been in transition since the early 1990s. The high-cost banana sector has been
shrinking amid global trends of trade liberalization. Diversification to nonbanana production will likely
continue as banana preferences are further eroded, although specialization in the Fair Trade niche could bring
some support to the sector. Tourism is likely to

Notwithstanding the sector’s diverging
performances, Dominica’s external competitiveness
remains broadly appropriate. The tourism sector has
so far been able to compensate for anemic growth in
the rest of the export sector. The tourism sector has
also performed well compared to other destinations in
the region: (i) stay-over arrivals increased at an average
annual rate of 3.7 percent during 2000–06, compared to
2.2 percent for the broader Caribbean region (World
Tourism Organization); and (ii) tourism
competitiveness indicators of World Travel and
Tourism Council rank Dominica well compared to
other Caribbean destinations. The EC dollar is broadly
competitive, as in real effective terms it is nearly at a
20-year low. Its real effective rate has declined by
some 14 percent since end-2000, reflecting relative
domestic price stability and its depreciation against the
currencies of appropriately weighted trading partners.1/
Although Dominica’s current account deficit remains
high, it improved substantially in 2006 and continues to
be financed mainly by capital grants and FDI.
Dominica’s fiscal consolidation has played a role in
maintaining external competitiveness. Dominica’s
real effective exchange rate has depreciated more than
those in most of the other ECCU countries, largely
reflecting fiscal consolidation in Dominica.

VI.

Exchange rate arrangement: Dominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union,
which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar.

VII.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB), of which Dominica is a participating government, is subject to a full
safeguards assessment. A safeguards assessment was completed in 2003, and concluded that the
ECCB had in place appropriate mechanisms to manage resources, including Fund disbursements
and that the vulnerabilities that remained do not present an undue risk. The safeguards
assessment proposed specific measures to address these vulnerabilities, which have been
substantially implemented by the ECCB. An update safeguards assessment is currently being
completed. The update assessment has not noted any new significant vulnerabilities

VIII.

Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive
Board on October 25, 2005; the relevant documents are IMF Country Report No. 05/384 and
IMF Country Report No. 05/383. Dominica is on a 24-month cycle.

IX.

Technical assistance: In January 2007 an FAD and Caribbean Regional Technical
Assistance Center (CARTAC) mission provided technical assistance on revenue
administration and tax policy. In 2006, an MCM mission provided technical assistance in
drafting an action plan for AID Bank. In 2005, an MCM mission provided technical assistance
in strengthening the supervisory framework for AML/CFT in the nonbank sector. FAD
missions have provided technical assistance on tax policy and administration, and social
security reform. The most recent missions include: pension reform options (2005); TA on fiscal
responsibility laws (2004); VAT implementation (1999); urban property taxation (1997); and
tax policy and administration, and expenditure control (1995). Technical assistance from MFD
and FAD has complemented the assistance that has been provided by the CARTAC in
Barbados. LEG has been providing assistance with the drafting and interpretation of the VAT
legislation.

X.

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCB, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20−31, 2003. The
principal objective of the missions was to assist the authorities in assessing the development
needs and opportunities for the financial sector and identifying potential vulnerabilities of
financial institutions and markets to macroeconomic shocks, as well as the risks to
macroeconomic stability from weaknesses and shortcomings in the financial sector. A detailed
assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of Dominica was conducted in September 2003 by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF). The Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on
the IMF’s external website, including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) on Banking Supervision.

4
Appendix II. Dominica: World Bank Relations2
(As of May 31, 2007)
The World Bank role in Dominica: The Bank will continue to collaborate with the Fund and
other donors in supporting the authorities’ efforts in stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and in
the implementation of the Government’s Growth and Social Protection Strategy. The Bank will
lead the policy dialogue on key structural reforms, including public sector reform, regulatory
framework for electricity, social protection, and on the environment for private sector
development.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas: The World Bank and the IMF will continue to
collaborate on the financial sector, on the medium-term structural reform agenda and in
providing technical assistance to Dominica on macroeconomic management issues jointly with
the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC).
Bank Group strategy: The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern
Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The
World Bank Group’s strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY2006–09) supports the
sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion
and strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ high debt ratios,
Bank activities will focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the
recommendations of the recently completed growth and competitiveness study for the OECS,
IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing technical and financial assistance for
interventions to support the two main pillars. An indicative Base Case lending scenario consists
of about US$51.3 million in IDA resources for the four OECS blend countries (Dominica,
Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). This envelope includes the estimated
IDA country allocations for each of the four countries during FY2006–09, and an IDA Regional
allocation of US$15.2 million for two regional projects: US$14 million for Catastrophe Risk
Insurance and US$3.2 million for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform. Planned lending to
Dominica amounts to US$10.2 million under the Base Case lending scenario.
Ongoing projects: There are currently three ongoing World Bank project in Dominica:
(i)

2

The OECS Telecommunications and ICT Development Project: The
Telecommunications and ICT Development Project (approved in September 2005)
aims at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT
services to achieve socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS). The project has the following four components:
Component (1) will strengthen the national and regional regulatory frameworks and

5
promote additional competition in the telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be
given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority
(ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs)
by providing them with assistances to revise the regional and national sector
legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime; Component (2) will review
current universal access policy, create related guidelines, and provide financial
support to establish a Universal Service Fund (USF); Component (3) will improve
growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of broadband
infrastructure; and Component (4) will ensure management and administration of the
overall project. The project will finance related technical assistance by providing
complementary resources. Dominica’s share of the US$2.7 million loan is
US$0.54 million.
(ii)

OECS Catastrophe Insurance Project: The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility (CCRIF) was approved in January, 2007. This is the world’s first ever multicountry catastrophe insurance pool. The bank has approved a US$4.5 million IDA
credit for Dominica to finance their contribution to the fund over three years. The
Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe insurance coverage against
adverse natural events, such as a major earthquake or hurricane. The CCRIF allows
participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified
portfolio, resulting in a substantial reduction in the premium cost of 45–50 percent.

(iii)

Growth and Social Protection Technical Assistance Project: The objectives of the
project are to enhance the capacity of the public sector to implement focused reforms
geared at improving the public sector delivery of services as well as creating the
institutional and policy framework to facilitate private sector-led growth. In addition,
the proposed financing will also support the strengthening of government’s capacity
to plan and administer its social protection programs to ensure that the benefits from
growth are equitably distributed for poverty reduction. The project has the following
five components: Component (1) will focus on making the public sector more
efficient and effective through support to implement the government’s public sector
modernization strategy; Component (2) will target improvement of the investment
climate through the strengthening of the institutional and regulatory framework for
attracting investment into Dominica; Component (3) will focus on reforming the
regulatory framework for the energy sector and support the creation of a framework
for the development of alternative sources of energy; Component (4) addresses the
improvement of the existing social safety net programs; Component (5) deals with the
management of the overall project. The total project cost is US$2.6 million, of which
the World Bank is providing US$1.45 million and the EU is providing
US$0.58 million of grant financing.

6
Economic and Sector Work: The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to:
public sector capacity in the OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity
Review, the OECS Procurement Assessment Review, the OECS Financial Accountability
Assessment and an Infrastructure Services Studies. In conjunction with the IMF, a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in early 2004. The Bank also recently
completed an OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness. Work is ongoing on a review of
large-scale energy options for the OECS, under the Energy Sector Management Assistance
Program. The Bank also recently completed a Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization report.
For Dominica specifically the Bank recently completed an Analysis of Fiscal Issues, which
examines the management and allocation of public expenditure.
Dominica will also benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities to
support the new CAS’ two main pillars including the following activities: A Caribbean Skills
and Curriculum Study, Caribbean Financial Sector and Regulation report, OECS Private Sector
Financing Study, Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Review, a regional study on Crime and
Violence.

Appendix IV. Dominica: Statistical Issues
While data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate, certain areas need to be improved.
There are weaknesses in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness that continue to hamper
effective economic analysis and policy formulation. Priority should need to be given to
compilation and dissemination of national accounts, in particular tourism, agriculture and labor
statistics. Despite progress significant weaknesses remain in the compilation of fiscal accounts,
and the balance of payments.
Dominica participates in the General Data Dissemination System. However the metadata for
national accounts, external sector and government finance statistics have not been updated since
December 2002.
Real sector
Annual nominal GDP data are compiled using the production and the expenditure approaches.
Estimates by economic activity are compiled using production approach at 1990 prices. GDP
estimates are available about four months after the end of the year. The data are revised
frequently and are usually finalized with a two-year lag following completion of the National
Accounts Survey. There is a program to improve national accounts data primarily through the
development of the supply and use table (SUT). A CARTAC mission is scheduled in July 2007
to examine GDP compilation. In late 2007 the authorities intend to undertake a comprehensive
assessment of the GDP methodology and data, with the assistance of the ECCB. CPI data are
compiled with a two-month lag. The weights are based on the 1997/1998 Household Expenditure
Survey. There is a program to develop export and import price indices (XMPIs), but a shortage
of staff working on price statistics limits developments in CPI methodology and the likelihood
that XMPIs will be developed in the near future. Data on employment are limited and there are
no official data on producer prices or wages in the private sector. Results of the 2001 population
census have not yet been published.
Government finance
Statistical capacity problems affect the timely production of quality government finance
statistics. In particular, the data are subject to frequent revisions stemming in part from
omissions and misclassifications. Data on central government operations are incomplete and
must be supplemented with additional information from external sources. For instance, some
operations are undertaken outside the consolidated fund. These include certain investment
spending, loan and grant receipts, and on-lending and transfers to public enterprises. As a result,
capital expenditure data, recorded by the Treasury, must be supplemented with additional donor
financing information, particularly because the public sector investment program (PSIP) data are
not timely. Delays in the reporting of the PSIP data reportedly stem from reporting delays from
the line ministries.
Several ongoing initiatives to strengthen expenditure management, should help minimize the
extent of this problem. There is an ongoing effort to automate the expenditure execution process.
A new automation technology was installed in all line ministries in 2005. With this technology

9
all local purchase orders (LPOs) are generated electronically and tracked. Commitments are
charged against a specific budget allocation once the LPOs are generated. All ministries and
suppliers of goods and services are compelled to use the new system.
Only limited financing data are available. Although progress has been made in improving the
measurement of the government's debt, there are concerns that there is still some under-recording
of government commitments.
The authorities do not provide consolidated nonfinancial public sector data. Data for the rest of
the public sector—Dominica Social Security and the public enterprises—must be obtained
directly from each entity during Fund Article IV consultation missions.
No government finance data are reported to STA for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook.
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis
based on a standardized report form since July 2006. The institutional coverage of monetary
statistics needs to be improved by including the accounts of mortgage companies, building
societies, credit unions, and insurance companies. In this respect, close coordination between the
ECCB and the single regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those
licensed under the Banking Act) is crucial.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis but are not reported in
the format recommended in the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data
reported to STA are becoming more timely, but still suffer from relatively numerous and volatile
errors and omissions.
External debt
The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed external loans
that provides detailed and reasonably current information on disbursements, debt service, and
debt stocks. The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two
databases are not consolidated, requiring further adjustments to measure total debt stock. In
addition, information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) should be available to the
compilation agencies at least on a monthly basis, in order to produce timely debt stock data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
DOMINICA
Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with World Bank Staff
July 2, 2007
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses the sustainability of Dominica’s public and
external debt. The analysis shows that Dominica has improved its debt sustainability outlook
since the last Article IV consultation, primarily due to stronger than expected fiscal
performance and output growth, the initiation of a reform to the pension system, and the
recent participation in the Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance Facility—a regional insurance
pool organized by the World Bank. The outlook still presents, nevertheless, large risks, as
Dominica’s debt remains high and the country is exposed to potentially large shocks
(including volatility of aid flows, natural disasters, among others).
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After a restructuring of its public sector debt, a strong fiscal turnaround, and a
rebound of economic activity, Dominica has been able to improve its debt sustainability
outlook. The debt restructuring that started in 2004, jointly with donors help, allowed a
reduction in debt’s face value and improved the terms of a large portion of the existing debt.
The central government primary balance, which had been in deficit since 1997, has exhibited
sound surpluses in the last three years in the context of a PRGF program (concluded in
December 2006). Growth rebounded under program and the government has started the
implementation of the Growth and Social Protection Strategy (GSPS), which constitutes a
comprehensive strategy to foster private sector-led growth and reduce poverty while
maintaining prudent fiscal policy.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Staff has prepared a baseline scenario whose main parameters are consistent with the
authorities projections under the GSPS, and with staff projections and assumptions in the
2005 Article IV consultation DSA.

2

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2007–27)
• Real GDP growth is projected at 3 percent (as in GSPS and 2005 Article IV DSA). While this
assumption implies a rate of growth higher than the average observed in the 1990s (2 percent), it
seems consistent with the stronger growth observed in the period 2004–06, with the reforms
envisaged, and with the projected international environment (see Box 2). Inflation is projected to
remain low (1.5 percent per year), consistent with historical averages.
• Primary balance of the central government remains at 3 percent of GDP over the projection period (as
in GSPS and 2005 Article IV DSA), while public enterprises run an overall deficit of 0.5 percent of
GDP. The assumption about the government primary balance is consistent with the strong fiscal
turnaround Dominica has had in recent years. The assumption on public enterprises follows the
average observed during the period 1999–2006. External grants are assumed to remain at 8.3 percent
of GDP broadly in line with the GSPS. This number is high by historical standards although it is
lower than the grants actually received and not out of bound given the authorities’ attempt to improve
the management of aid and aid-related expenditures. Given the uncertain grants outlook, we undertake
a stress test below.
• Annual disbursements of external concessional debt reach 1.5 percent of GDP (as in 2005 Article IV
DSA), consistent with the country’s public sector investment program (PSIP). The financing terms are
similar to those of existing external debt. New domestic financing is projected to be available at an
interest rate of 7 percent (as in 2005 Article IV DSA).
• The current account deficit is assumed to remain high in a transition period (2007–12), while
gradually falling to a level fully financed by the projected external grants and FDI. This assumes that:
(i) banks continue to use their external assets to extend domestic credit and that the government draws
down its deposits to finance its investment program (government deposits in domestic banks have
increased substantially given the recent increase in grants received. Banks have allocated a large
fraction of those deposits to external assets); and (ii) the loss of export revenue associated with the
closure of a large factory is partially and temporarily compensated by a decline in private agent’s
foreign assets.
• FDI is assumed to remain at the 2006 level (8 percent of GDP). While this number is higher than its
historical average (so helping finance the current account), its actual net impact is not large since it is
linked in the projections to foreign firms’ retained earnings (which increase the current account
deficit).

III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Dominica’s public debt as of end-2006
3.
As of end-2006 Dominica’s public sector debt stood at 102 percent of GDP, of which
71 percent of GDP represented external debt and the remaining 31 percent represented
domestic debt. Regarding the external debt, the largest share is owed to multilateral creditors
(around 43 percent of GDP, with the Caribbean Development Bank holding around two
thirds of that), followed by the debt with bilateral and commercial creditors (around 16 and

3
12 percent of GDP, respectively). In the domestic front, the largest creditor is Dominica’s
own Social Security System (around 13 percent of GDP) followed by a commercial bank
with a significant government stake. In NPV terms, public sector debt stood at around
88 percent of GDP, due to the concessionality attached to most of the external debt (whose
NPV was around 56 percent of GDP).1
The baseline scenario
4.
Under the baseline scenario (Table 1a.), all the indicators show a progressive
improvement in terms of debt sustainability. The only indicator that does not decline
continuously is the debt service to revenue ratio, which temporarily shows an upward trend
and then a decline in 2011.2 Even though the increase in the indicator is temporary, it is
important, however, to take into account that it remains high for several years, which calls for
maintaining fiscal discipline in order to avoid liquidity constraints. Under this scenario,
Dominica would reach a public debt to GDP ratio of 60 percent—the guidance of the
ECCB—by 2017.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
Changes in growth and primary balance
5.
Economic growth and the primary balance are the two key drivers of Dominica’s debt
path and both are subject to large exogenous shocks, such as volatility of grants (see below)
and of foreign growth (see Box 2).
6.
The sensitivity analysis illustrates two important points (Table 1b.). First, if
Dominica’s primary balance and economic growth return to their averages of the last ten
years (a primary deficit of 0.1 percent and annual growth of 0.9 percent), then public debt
starts rising again (Scenario A.1), although the path of the debt increase is not steep. Second,
if Dominica can maintain the fiscal effort projected for 2007 (a primary balance of
4.8 percent) public debt stays on a declining path (Scenario A.2).
7.
In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows the importance of sustaining growth. In the
alternative Scenario A.3, in which growth falls to 2.3 percent per year, debt initially declines
but later returns to an ascending path. This is because as output growth slows, fiscal revenues
1

The figures could change somewhat depending on the final agreement with hold-out creditors (since different
options have different hair-cuts). These final agreements, however, should not have a material impact on the
debt sustainability paths given that all restructuring options available for restructuring have the same NPV. The
simulations in this appendix assume that hold-out creditors take the intermediate bond, which carries a hair-cut
of 20 percent. The discount rate for the NPV calculations is 5 percent.

2

The initial upward trend is mainly caused by the early repayment clause that was included in Dominica’s debt
restructuring agreement. Under that clause, there is an increase in amortization starting in 2009 and a bunching
of payments up to 2011.

4
are projected to decline relative to the baseline scenario while expenditures are assumed to
remain constant relative to the baseline scenario (which produces a deterioration of the
primary balance). Figure 2 shows the individual contributions of growth and primary balance
to the debt path. The importance of growth in debt sustainability is clear from the second
panel, but it is also clear that public debt remains on a declining path if Dominica is able to
maintain a primary balance of 3 percent of GDP even if growth were to decline to an annual
rate of 1 percent.
Box. 2. Dominica: External Shocks and Growth
Since independence in 1978, Dominica has gone through periodic difficulties. The island was ravaged
by hurricanes; experienced with banana-driven booms and busts; and more recently suffered from a debt
and economic crisis. The lack of economies of scale and accessibility increases business costs. Also, as a
small state, it faces more volatile growth and terms of trade, more prone to natural disasters, and more
vulnerable to external shocks.
External shocks are a key challenge to sustaining growth in Dominica. In a standard vector autoregression analysis,3 staff found that a 1 percentage point shock to the U.S. output affects Dominica output
roughly by the same magnitude, doubles the effect on some larger countries in the region, such as Mexico
and Canada. Similarly, staff found that Dominica is particularly vulnerable to other external shocks: more
than half of its growth volatility can be explained by growth volatility of its main trading partners; and
typical shocks to annual banana prices (about 14 percentage points) and aid inflows (about 2¾ percent of
GDP) affect Dominica GDP by ¾–1 percentage point over a year or two.

Decline in external grants
8.
External grants to the central government are expected to reach around 8 percent of
GDP in the fiscal year 2006–074, around 3 percentage points above its historical average.
Figure 2 (lower panel) illustrates the impact of a 3 percent of GDP decline in external aid
from 2009 on. The results present two alternative scenarios: (i) the partial adjustment
scenario, which assumes that government cuts investment spending by around 1.5 percent of
GDP and finances the rest of the aid decline with larger borrowing (the increase in borrowing
is assumed to increase interest rates by 1 percentage point). The other scenario assumes no
cuts in public investment. The aid decline is financed entirely via higher borrowing, which
increase interest rates by 2 percentage points. In both scenarios, the new borrowing is
assumed to be domestic.
9.
As the figure illustrates, under the no adjustments scenario, public debt quickly starts
rising again due to the cascading effects of rising debt and higher refinancing rates. The debt
to GDP ratio stabilizes at around 62 under the partial adjustment scenario.
Other shocks
10.
We also assessed shocks to interest rates, the impact of natural disasters, and the
balance sheet implications of a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major
international currencies.
• Natural disasters produce an initial increase in debt but the latter returns to a
declining trajectory after growth is restored and fiscal costs of reconstruction have
ended.5
• Interest rates shocks have little impact on Dominica’s public debt path of most of
its debt, including domestic debt, has fixed interest rates.
• A depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a
modest balance sheet effect on Dominica’s public debt: around 70 percent of the
external debt is denominated in the U.S. dollar, 19 percent in SDR (where the U.S.
dollar weigh is about 50 percent), and around 4 percent is denominated in the Euro.

Measured as grants spent, in line with IMF Country Report No. 05/384.

It is assumed that the shock costs the government 9 percent of GDP over a three-year period (thus exhausting
the primary surpluses assumed under the baseline scenario) and causes real growth to decline to zero over the
same period. This shock is costlier than the standard shock reported in IMF Country Report No. 04/335, in
particular. In addition, the actual impact of this shock could be lower given the recent participation of Dominica
into the Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance Facility—a regional insurance pool organized by the World Bank—
has lowered the costs of catastrophe insurance and is expected to mitigate fiscal costs in the event of extreme
hurricanes.

6
The rest is denominated in the EC dollar, and other currencies that are pegged to
the U.S. dollar.
IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
Dominica’s external debt is mostly owed by the public sector, since private sector
borrowing takes place with domestic commercial banks. Due to this feature, the external
DSA has to a large extent the same properties as the public sector DSA.
12.
External debt remains on a declining path in the baseline scenario (Table 2a.).
Similarly to the public debt DSA, the only indicators of debt sustainability that do not decline
continuously are those related to the share of external debt service as a percent of exports and
public sector revenues. Both indicators increase up to 2010 as a consequence of the features
of the debt restructuring and then start declining. The closure of operations of a large foreign
manufacturing company also contributes to the increase of the debt service as a share of
exports. The large residuals observed in the first five years of the projections period reflect
our assumptions regarding the temporary financing of part of the current account deficit by a
reduction in bank’s and private agents’ net foreign assets.
13.
Sensitivity tests show a picture similar to the public debt DSA (Table 2b.). If key
variables were to return to their historical averages (Scenario A.1) external debt would return
to an ascending path, as lower grants, lower FDI, and lower growth would push external debt
up. Higher interest rates (Scenario A.2) do not significantly impact the external debt paths as
in the baseline scenario Dominica faces low financing needs (see previous section).
V. CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISON WITH THE 2005 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DSA
14.
Dominica has improved its debt sustainability outlook since the previous Article IV
consultation (2005), mostly due to stronger than projected fiscal performance and economic
growth. Public debt for end-2007 is currently projected at 96 percent of GDP, which is
3.5 percentage points lower than the projections made in the last Article IV consultation. At
the same time, Dominica has introduced a reform to its pension system, which targets one of
the main vulnerabilities to debt sustainability identified in the 2005 Article IV consultation.
Dominica has also made progress in reducing debt-related vulnerabilities, particularly by
joining the Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance Facility.
15.
In spite of the progress achieved, important debt-related vulnerabilities remain, as:
(i) public debt is high (over 100 percent of GDP), which gives the government little room to
maneuver in case of unforeseen events; (ii) there is a bunching of payments between 2009
and 2011; (iii) the arrival of new grants is uncertain; and (iv) the country is exposed to
external shocks and natural disasters.
16.
The government’s medium-term reform strategy, which appropriately envisages the
maintenance of a fiscal policy geared at achieving a primary surplus target of 3 percent of

7
GDP and thereby bringing about a gradual reduction in the debt ratio, constitutes, therefore, a
step in the right direction. The structural reforms proposed in the government strategy will—
via its positive impact on economic growth—also help to attain the objective of reducing
debt related vulnerabilities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 16, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Dominica
On July 16, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2007 Article IV consultation with Dominica.1
Background
Dominica has fully recovered from the 2001–02 economic and financial crisis. Output growth
has rebounded, reaching 4 percent in 2006—the highest in two decades—and it is expected to
remain above trend in 2007. The rebound is driven by a pickup in tourism, recovery in banana
production, and buoyant construction and offshore school activity. Inflation has remained
subdued, reflecting stabilizing oil prices, and is projected to remain low. The external current
account deficit narrowed sharply in 2006 and is likely to remain large at around 20 percent of
GDP this year, financed mainly by foreign direct investment and large capital grants. External
competitiveness remains broadly adequate due to fiscal adjustment and to a lesser extent the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.
Fiscal balances have improved significantly. The central government primary surplus, before
grants, is projected to reach 5.9 percent of GDP in 2006/07, a significant turnaround from the
primary deficit in 2001/02. Tax buoyancy (partly due to the newly-introduced VAT and excise
taxes), sustained expenditure restraint and continued output growth have contributed to the

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country’s authorities.

strong fiscal performance. Grants received have more than doubled the average pre-crisis level,
reaching almost 13 percent of GDP for the first nine months of 2006/07.
Monetary aggregates have continued to increase rapidly, underpinned by expansion in deposits
and private credit. Continued fiscal consolidation in recent years has helped expand private
credit by 11 percent in 2006. Banking prudential indicators have improved, reflecting in part
stricter enforcement of prudential guidelines by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and strong
macroeconomic performance. Nevertheless, nonperforming loans remain high and loan loss
provisioning is low by international standards.
Further progress has been made in structural reforms. The contribution rate for the Dominica
Social Security was raised by 1 percentage point in March 2007 as part of an ongoing
comprehensive reform strategy. The authorities have recently started to merge the port and
airport authorities and to breakup the National Development Corporation into a tourism board
and an investment promotion agency to raise efficiency. A draft law on the Financial Sector Unit
has recently been submitted to parliament, albeit after much delay. The authorities have
maintained good-faith efforts in pursuing debt restructuring agreements with the remaining
creditors.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for continuing to implement sound economic
policies, which have been pivotal in Dominica’s remarkable recovery from the economic crisis in
2001−02. They noted that, under the authorities’ comprehensive program, supported by the
Fund, Dominica had successfully restored macroeconomic stability and reversed the debt buildup, while sustaining above-trend growth. They agreed that, with the implementation of the
authorities’ reform strategy reflected in the Growth and Social Protection Strategy, real GDP
growth could remain above the historical average in coming years.
Directors commended the authorities for their strong commitment and efforts to address longstanding policy challenges. They agreed that the government’s medium-term primary surplus
target of 3 percent of GDP was consistent with the government’s strategy of reducing
vulnerabilities. Directors applauded the authorities for the progress made in reforming
Dominica’s Social Security System, which had been identified as a major risk to the public
finances in the last Article IV consultation. Directors noted the authorities’ good-faith efforts in
pursuing debt restructuring agreements with non-participating creditors.
Directors welcomed the recent surge in budgetary aid to Dominica, but highlighted the
associated policy challenges. Given the still high public debt ratio and the volatility of aid,
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to continue with the strategy of
smoothing the spending of the scaled-up aid over time and to use some of these resources to
substitute expensive borrowing and reduce debt. A few Directors also called on donors to
establish streamlined and more predictable procedures for the disbursement of aid. Directors
also welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve budget management, in particular regarding

3
capital expenditure, in order to use aid in an efficient and transparent manner and consistent
with macroeconomic objectives.
Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that modifications of the indirect taxes lead to an
improvement in the efficiency of the tax system and be consistent with sustaining fiscal
consolidation. While recognizing the regional dimension of tax competition, they noted that tax
cuts need to be modest and accompanied by the revamping of the tax incentive system to try to
make it more efficient, while safeguarding the integrity of the recently introduced value-added
tax. They reaffirmed the willingness of the Fund to continue to provide technical assistance as
needed, specifically to reform tax incentives.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to achieving greater progress in financial sector
supervision. The recent improvements in banking prudential indicators are a welcome
development, but the rapid credit expansion, low provisioning, and strong competition from
loosely-regulated nonbank financial institutions warrant enhanced supervision over the financial
sector. Given extensive regional financial linkages and the lack of supervisory expertise,
Directors agreed that the authorities consider delegating part of supervisory functions over the
nonbanks, including to other regulatory bodies in the region.
Directors agreed that the overall level of Dominica’s external competitiveness is adequate. They
viewed that the real exchange rate level is broadly competitive, in part reflecting fiscal
consolidation and the EC dollar depreciation against the currencies of trading partners. They
also observed that the exchange regime, if supported by sound fiscal policy, continues to serve
Dominica well.
Directors called for further progress in the implementation of structural reforms as envisaged in
Dominica’s Growth and Social Protection Strategy. They observed that priority be given to
efforts to reduce the cost of doing business in Dominica and to foster private sector-led growth,
including by streamlining public sector entities, improving contract enforcement and foreclosure
arrangements and reforming the utilities and customs administration. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to undertake a poverty assessment this year, which will help design
efficient and well-targeted social safety nets.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the quality of economic and social
statistics that are key for effective surveillance.
