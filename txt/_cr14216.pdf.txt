STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 26, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context:
 Germany fundamentals are sound: balance sheets are generally healthy,
unemployment is at a historic low, and the fiscal position is strong.
 While a recovery is underway, medium-term growth prospects are subdued and the
current account surplus remains high. The economy also faces a still weak
international environment, lingering uncertainty (including about future energy
costs), and fast approaching adverse demographic changes.
 Germany could do more to increase its growth, thus strengthening its role as an
engine of euro area recovery.
Policy recommendations:
 Germany has the fiscal space to finance an increase in needed public investment,
particularly in the transport infrastructure. Unlike public consumption, this would
durably raise German output and have measurable growth spillovers on the rest of
the euro area.
 Further reforms in services sector regulation would boost competition and
productivity.
 Greater clarity about the future energy sector regulatory framework would
encourage private investment in the energy infrastructure and beyond and
strengthen the outlook.
 Decisions on the future level of the minimum wage should take into account the
employment effects in certain regions.
 Banks should keep strengthening their capital position ahead of the completion of
the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment.
 The macroprudential framework needs to be ready as monetary conditions are set to
remain accommodative for a prolonged period.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recovery in the Euro Area: Germany Ahead of the Pack
1.
A recovery is under way, led by domestic demand. Real GDP has been rising since the
second quarter of 2013, and for the year as a whole growth was 0.5 percent (Figure 1), versus a
0.8 percent contraction in the rest of the euro area. Growth in the first quarter of 2014 was
particularly strong (0.8 percent q-o-q), but this partly reflected the mild weather. The recovery has
been mainly led by domestic demand, except in Q4-2013, when private consumption unexpectedly
contracted.
2.
Despite a strong labor market, wage pressures are modest. The labor force continued to
expand on the back of strong immigration flows and increasing participation rates (Figure 2).
Employment grew by 1 percent in 2013, as an additional 400,000 jobs were created mostly in the
services sector. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has stabilized at 5.1 percent, a postreunification low, after having continuously declined since 2005. The newly created jobs, however,
are mainly part-time, leading to a further decline in the average number of hours worked per
employee. This suggests that there may be further slack in the labor market, as also reflected in the
moderate wage pressures in 2013, with nominal hourly wages up 2.5 percent compared with
3.5 percent in 2012.

3.
Headline inflation is falling, while core inflation is stable but low. Headline inflation has
been on a downtrend throughout 2013, falling from a peak of 1.9 percent in July to 0.6 percent in
May 2014. The fall reflects a marked decline in food and energy prices, but also the effects of the
strong euro on other import prices. Core inflation has been low, hovering around an average of
1.1 percent. Over the last year, German inflation has exceeded that in the rest of the euro area by
0.5 percentage points. Surveys indicate that German inflation expectations appear well anchored.

4.
The fiscal stance was contractionary in 2013, but is envisaged to become expansionary
in 2014. The general government registered a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013, once again
stronger than planned (this time by 0.5 percent of GDP), resulting in a contractionary stance
(0.7 percent of GDP)—an unwelcome development given the slack in the economy (Figure 3). The
new coalition government’s fiscal plans envisage a mild expansionary stance in 2014 and 2015 (see
paragraph 13 below). The debt-to-GDP ratio is on a firmly declining path (see Annex III, Debt
Sustainability Analysis), and structural deficit targets for the federal government (expressed in the
national debt brake rule) and the general government (Medium-Term Objective of the Fiscal
Compact) have been achieved. All in all, following four years of robust fiscal performance, fiscal
consolidation is on track.
5.
In 2013, the current account surplus reached a new high. The surplus for 2013 was of
$274 billion (7½ percent of GDP)––virtually all in goods trade––and benefited from improved terms
of trade (+1.3 percent) (Figure 4). The services balance and current transfers were both negative,
while net investment income was positive and increased significantly over the last decade, reflecting
the growing net investment position (see Chapter I, Selected Issues). Rising corporate savings
contributed strongly to the increase in the surplus before the crisis, while low investment and fiscal
consolidation were more important in recent years (Figure 5). The regional composition of the
surplus has changed, with lower surpluses vis-à-vis the euro area periphery offset by larger ones visà-vis economies outside of Europe (most notably China). The German surplus vis-à-vis non-euro
area countries accounts for two thirds of the euro area current account surplus of $303 billion.
6.
The German banking system is gradually gaining strength. Profitability is subdued
because of structurally low net interest margins and pressure from protracted low interest rates, but
it was supported last year by a favorable domestic and regional macro-financial environment
(Figures 6 and 7). Improvements in capital adequacy continued and, pending the results of the ECB
Comprehensive Assessment, banks should be ready to meet upcoming stricter regulatory
requirements in a timely manner, though a few remain highly leveraged. Large banks keep
restructuring their balance sheets—helped by the current market appetite for parts of their legacy
portfolios—and are strengthening their capital position, though sizable litigation costs have been an
impediment in some cases. Smaller banks, with a very traditional business model, kept growing at a
slow pace while benefiting from a very low level of credit risk provisioning. While credit conditions
remain favorable, credit growth has been lackluster, reflecting low demand in the context of large
corporate profits and retained earnings. Further progress in implementing the 2011 FSAP Update
recommendations has been achieved (see Annex II).

The energy reorientation policy is facing challenges, though it has boosted the
production of renewable energy (Box 1). Production of renewable energy (RE) has surged and
accounts for 24 percent of total electricity production, in line with targets. However, the rapid
expansion of RE generation has sharply raised surcharges (used to finance RE), making the electricity
price one of the highest in
Europe. Large, energy-intensive
firms facing international
competition receive subsidies in
the form of reduced surcharges,
but this results in a higher burden
for other users and has raised
concerns with the EU competition
authority. At the same time, the
profitability of conventional
electricity producers is suffering
while sizable conventional
capacity needs to be preserved to
complement RE generation. As
nuclear energy is being phased
out at an accelerated rate after
the Fukushima accident, conventional generation is increasingly relying on the cheapest source,
brown coal (lignite), which is causing a surge in CO2 emissions. Finally, as the switch to RE continues
and nuclear capacity is phased out, industrial users in the South of the country may have trouble
accessing RE capacity in the North as grid expansion plans face strong opposition by affected
parties and are behind schedule.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 1. Energiewende
The Energiewende (Energy turnaround) seeks to balance energy supply security, affordability,
and environmental soundness. The strategy was first set out by the government in 2010 and then
modified after the 2011 Fukushima disaster to allow for the full phase-out of nuclear power by 2022. It
lays out ambitious national targets for 2020, going beyond EU requirements, including: reducing
carbon emissions by 40 percent relative to their 1990 level, reducing primary energy consumption by
20 percent relative to 2008, and increasing the share of renewable energy (RE) in electricity
consumption by 35 percent. Targets for 2050 are equally ambitious.
The transformation of Germany’s energy system is making headway. In 2013, 24 percent of
electricity came from RE, making it the second largest source of electricity after brown coal (lignite).
Greenhouse emissions have been lowered by 25 percent in 2012 relative to 1990 levels. Adjusted for
inventory and temperature effects, primary energy consumption also decreased by one percent
compared to the previous year.
The Energiewende continues to face challenges:



Controlling costs. The rapid growth in RE has been mainly promoted through the provision of
feed-in tariffs (FITs), which guarantee a sale price for RE (usually for 20 years). FITs, which were
introduced already in 2000, are funded by a surcharge passed onto consumers. Despite past
measures to contain costs, the RE surcharge has increased dramatically from 1.1 cents/kWh in
2008 to 6.24 cents/kWh in 2014, with German electricity prices amongst the highest in Europe.
Energy-intensive internationally active firms in certain sectors are eligible for surcharge
reductions (i.e., exemptions). The cost of the exemption is born by other users, i.e., households
and SMEs.



Facilitating grid expansion. The rising importance of RE supply requires substantial
investment in the electrical grid to deliver electricity from suppliers to consumers, which are
typically not close. This significant increase of RE generation capacity in the North has
outpaced grid expansion, and the planned reduction in nuclear capacity in the more industrial
South, along with a slow pace of network expansion (in part related to public opposition to
such projects) have raised concerns about potential bottlenecks.



Preserving conventional capacity. RE is by its nature intermittent, and sizable conventional
capacity needs to be preserved to complement it. However, since RE has preferential access to
the grid, conventional producers are finding it hard to remain profitable.



Reducing CO2 emissions. Despite the successful effort to promote RE, CO2 emissions from
Germany rose last year as conventional producers are increasingly relying on cheaper brown
coal rather than nuclear power or natural gas.

B. Outlook and Risks: Will Domestic Demand Continue to Support Growth?
8.
A moderate pace of growth is expected to continue. Given favorable domestic financial
conditions, healthy corporate balance sheets, capacity utilization back to normal, lower uncertainty,
and an anemic growth in the recent past, investment should be poised for a more enduring
recovery. In particular, construction investment, buoyed by rising housing prices, is expected to keep

output should increase by 1.9 percent this
year and 1.7 percent in the next, resulting in a slightly positive output gap. After a subdued pace this
year, inflation is expected to pick up to 1.4 percent in 2015 as the commodity price downdraft fades
and the output gap closes. Throughout the projection horizon, it is envisaged that the average rate
of German inflation will exceed that in the rest of the euro area.
9.
The extent of the recovery in investment is an important risk factor for the baseline
projection. As discussed in last year’s staff report, investment is highly sensitive to policy
uncertainty, notably, over euro area–wide policies. Indexes of policy uncertainty have declined
noticeably in the last year, and this should underpin a rebound in investment. In addition, capacity
utilization in manufacturing and (especially) in construction is now above its historic average, also
boding well for investment. Nonetheless, renewed policy uncertainty could weaken business
investment and hurt growth. Conversely, stronger-than-envisioned investment growth could give
rise to a stronger cyclical upturn.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

GERMANY

10.
The outlook is subject to a number of additional interrelated and potentially mutually
reinforcing risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix):


Given its trade openness (exports-to-GDP ratio over 50 percent; value-added goods exportsto-GDP over 30 percent), Germany is highly susceptible to global recovery prospects, which
have recently been marked down. A deeper-than-expected slowdown in major trading
partners—including large emerging markets—would dampen growth. For example, modelbased simulations suggest that each 1 percentage point temporary decline in domestic
demand in Emerging Asia would drag down German growth by about 0.1 percentage point;
a more protracted slowdown could have more severe implications, in part owing to weaker
confidence.



A prolonged period of slower growth in the euro area, other advanced economies, or
emerging markets presents a risk that is more medium-term in nature. If the output gap
widened again, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully. In case of a
significant slowdown and rapidly rising unemployment, proactive fiscal policies would be
needed. Persistent stagnation in the euro area, especially if combined with low inflation,
represents a risk to Germany because it may, inter alia, call into question debt sustainability
in the periphery, undermining confidence, and triggering a re-emergence of regional
financial stress.



An escalation of geopolitical tensions over Ukraine-Russia would hit Germany. While direct
trade ties and financial exposures are modest, risks could nonetheless be indirectly
transmitted to Germany through disruptions affecting its Central European supply chain
partners. In addition, Germany could experience safe haven inflows if tensions escalate. In a
tail risk scenario in which tensions lead to disruptions in energy supply, Germany would be
strongly affected because of its heavy dependence on Russian oil and, especially, gas
(40 percent of total consumption).

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities agreed with staff that the moderate expansion of the German
economy should continue. They expressed confidence in a domestic demand-led upswing driven
by private consumption and investment, amid tight labor market conditions and a virtually closed
output gap underpinning solid wage growth. In particular, the authorities were more upbeat than
staff about the strength of domestic demand, especially private investment in 2015. They noted that
the structural decline in the unemployment rate had run its course and therefore expected wage
growth to strengthen in 2014-15 and support consumption. At the same time, while the authorities
concurred with staff that inflationary pressures would be muted this year, they underscored that
prices were likely to accelerate owing to the expected positive output gap and the introduction of
the minimum wage, with inflation reaching around 1.9 percent in 2016. They agreed that the current
account surplus would decline gradually.
12.
The authorities saw the risks to the outlook as generally balanced. On the upside, they
noted that the strength of the expansion may be underestimated, given the building momentum of
domestic demand growth. On the downside, the authorities indicated that a worsening of the
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

geopolitical situation in Ukraine represents a serious tail risk. They acknowledged that while difficult
to assess precisely, a materialization of such a risk would adversely affect Germany primarily through
confidence effects, rather than via trade and financial channels. However, the authorities noted that
the resilience of the German labor market and its safe haven status could help cushion blows to the
economy. They saw a re-emergence of a euro area crisis less likely in the current conjuncture, but
acknowledged that risks pertaining to key emerging markets were harder to appraise. They
concurred that persistently low growth in advanced economies is a risk over the medium term which
could seriously undermine confidence.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policies should focus on increasing growth in Germany in ways that also support the
recovery in the euro area. Higher public and private investment and services sector
reform in Germany would raise medium-term output, help reduce the large and
persistent current account surplus, and generate appreciable positive demand spillovers
to the rest of the euro area, thus helping rebalancing within the monetary union.1

A. New Government, New Economic Policies
13.
The new government’s economic policy package includes increases in pension benefits
and other spending priorities and a new national minimum wage. The coalition treaty envisages
a balanced federal budget in 2015 and no new general taxes. However, planned declines in social
security contribution rates will be
foregone and long-term care
contribution rates will be raised
slightly. New spending will consist
of new pension benefits and some
additional spending by the federal
government. The latter, totaling
0.2 percent of GDP per year (€23
billion over 2014–17), will go to
infrastructure, education,
childcare, and other priorities, and
will be financed by eliminating the
federal government surpluses that
would have been achieved without
the new measures. This additional
spending will still leave the federal
government with a margin of about 0.5 percent of GDP per year within the debt brake rule (which
requires the federal structural deficit not to exceed 0.35 of GDP beginning in 2016), while the debt
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

GERMANY

stock will remain on a declining path. In addition, there is a package of measures on pensions (0.3
percent of GDP per year), including higher benefits for mothers of children born before 1992 and
more generous early retirement benefits for workers with long contribution periods. This package
will be financed by additional subsidies from the federal government as well as by foregoing the
reduction in social security contributions, which would have been required in light of the surpluses
accumulated in previous years. Finally, a new national minimum-wage of €8.50 per hour will be
introduced starting in 2015 and will complement the current system of negotiated sector minima.
14.
While additional spending on child care facilities and education is welcome, the
measures on pensions are a partial roll-back of previous reforms. The higher pension benefits

for mothers with children born before 1992 is particularly costly and does not specifically target
lower-income pensioners. Measures to facilitate early retirement for workers of certain cohorts with
long contribution periods will likely reduce older workers’ labor market participation and may add to
skills shortages in some sectors. As
the social security funds need to be
financially balanced, the additional
spending down the road will likely
require an increase in the already
high social contribution rates,
reduced benefits for other
pensioners, or subsidies from
general tax resources, some of
which have already materialized.
Given the high uncertainty in
estimates on the take-up of the new
benefit, periodic reviews of fiscal
costs and adverse impact on labor
participation rates are highly
recommended.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

15.
The new nationwide minimum wage will help reduce growing wage inequality, but it
risks exacerbating unemployment in some regions. The coalition government is introducing a
new national minimum wage as a reaction to growing wage and income inequality and the
expanding ranks of the “working poor.” A draft law now in Parliament sets the minimum wage at
€8.50 per hour, effective in 2015 with certain exemptions and transitional arrangements. The
proposed minimum wage is likely to be binding for some 10 percent of workers in the country, but
for 15-20 percent of workers in some federal states mostly in the East where unemployment rates
are already relatively high. While the employment effects of changes in minimum wage regulation
are notoriously difficult to predict, sizable adverse effects in such federal states and among the low
skilled could materialize (see Chapter II, Selected Issues).
16.
Decisions on the future level of the minimum wage should take the employment
effects into account. The current draft law envisages that future adjustments of minimum wage will
be decided by the government following the recommendation of a commission comprising of
representatives from the employers’ organizations and trade unions (in equal numbers), a chair
nominated jointly by both organizations, and two non-voting academic advisors. Staff expressed
concern that in its planned configuration the commission may not sufficiently represent the interest
of the unemployed or sectors with low trade union representation, such as many low-wage sectors
that will be most affected by the minimum wage. In addition, staff pointed out that the effects of the
minimum wage on income redistribution toward the working poor may be limited, as the population
of minimum wage earners and that of the working poor overlap only partially. Finally, relevant
household surveys might need to be strengthened to ensure that the effects of the policy can be
properly assessed over time.
Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff that the new pension measures represented a
deviation from the spirit of earlier pension reforms. Past reforms aimed at reducing reliance on
first pillar pensions while encouraging private retirement schemes. The authorities also pointed out
that the early retirement measures would affect potentially 25 percent of workers entering
retirement, but that not all those eligible would choose to retire early. They noted that the expected
cost of the new measures was expected to be small relative to total pension outlays, and that there
would be periodic reviews of the new policies starting in 2018.
18.
The authorities were confident that future revisions to the minimum wage would
reflect the public interest. Recognizing data limitations and difficulties of estimation, the
authorities were of the view that overall macroeconomic effects of the minimum wage would likely
be benign. They also pointed out that the law instructed the new commission to take into account
all economic effects (including on employment) of future minimum wage increases, and that the
decision ultimately rested with the government and thus would reflect broad public interests. The
authorities also noted that there is no plan to review in-work benefits as an alternative redistribution
tool, and there will be a review of the minimum wage policy in 2020.

B. The Current Account, Investment, and Regional Spillovers
19.
The external position is substantially stronger than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desired global policy settings:


The current account (CA) surplus was 7½ percent of GDP in 2013, corresponding to an
estimated cyclically adjusted surplus of around 8¼ percent of GDP, reflecting Germany’s
more advanced cyclical position relative to the rest of the world. A model-based analysis
indicates a norm of 2½ percent of GDP for the cyclically adjusted CA balance. The empirical
model explains Germany’s CA fairly well until 2000. But it only explains less than a sixth of
the subsequent rise in the CA. Also, there are not obvious policy gaps that explain the
regression residual. Indeed, part of the residual also likely reflects structural determinants
not fully captured by the EBA model, such as limited nominal exchange rate flexibility after
the euro area was created and non-linear effects of very rapid population aging. Reflecting
these factors, staff assesses the norm at 2¼–5¼ percent of GDP. Thus, the cyclically adjusted
CA is 3–6 percent of GDP stronger than that implied by fundamentals and desirable policies.



Turning to the real effective exchange rate (REER), model-based estimates have an unusually
poor fit for Germany, pointing to a highly implausible 11 percent overvaluation in 2013.
Deviations from historical averages using alternative price/cost metrics (CPI, GDP deflator,
total sales deflator, or ULC) or sample periods suggest a REER undervaluation of 0 to
10 percent. However, based on an estimate of Germany’s trade elasticity, the CA gap implies
a more sizable misalignment of 9–18 percent. All in all, staff’s assessment is of a REER
undervaluation of 5–15 percent.

20.
The current account gap is expected to narrow gradually, but additional policies to
foster more rapid rebalancing in the euro area are needed. In the current baseline forecast, the
current account surplus is expected to decline gradually to some 5¾ percent of GDP in 2019
reflecting gradual rebalancing of relative labor costs within the euro area, a recovery of investment
in Germany, and a partial return of corporate savings to more normal levels. Thus, about half of the
gap (some ½–3½ percentage points of GDP) is expected to persist in the medium term. With
negative output gaps, no fiscal space, and liquidity traps in many of its main trading partners, as the
largest European economy, Germany could play a stronger role to help regional rebalancing. This
can be achieved through policies that durably increase Germany’s output while also generating
positive outward demand spillovers to the region and reducing the current account surplus.

may be discouraging private investment. While the government’s decision to boost spending in this
area is welcome, the amount envisaged (€5 billion over four years, or about 0.2 percent of 2013
GDP) is small relative to estimated needs. Independent studies place the investment needs in
transport alone at 0.2–0.4 percent of GDP per year, particularly owing to aging bridges and
roadways. Schools and kindergartens, particularly at the municipal level, represent other examples of
infrastructure backlogs. Therefore, to take advantage of currently low interest rates and foster
private investment, public investment spending should be stepped up more significantly.
22.
Germany has the fiscal space to finance an increase in public investment of some
0.5 percent of GDP per year over four years, which would be associated with appreciable
positive regional spillovers.
With the fiscal accounts
projected to register a structural
surplus of 0.2–0.5 percent of GDP
at the general government level
and of 0.1 percent at the federal
government level over 2015–18,
the proposed additional
investment spending could be
phased out so as to comply with
the Medium-Term Objective of
the Fiscal Compact (0.5 structural
deficit for the general
government) and the domestic
debt brake rule (0.35 structural
deficit for the federal
government beginning in 2016).
Such an investment program would yield a persistent increase in GDP of ¾ percent and temporarily
reduce the current account surplus by 0.4 percentage points of GDP (see Chapter III, Selected
Issues). The policy would also stimulate growth in the region, with peak effects on GDP in Greece,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

GERMANY

Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (the GIIPS) and other euro area (OEA) countries of 0.3 and
0.4 percent respectively, in the likely case that monetary policy remained accommodative. Within
this group of countries, the size of the effect varies depending on the strength of the trade linkages
with Germany, implying larger spillovers to Italy for example. The increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio
in Germany would be minimal given the growth offset.
23.
Such a substantial increase in public investment would be challenging but feasible. It
would be challenging because of its sheer size (½ percent of GDP is large compared with current
total public investment of 1.6 percent of GDP) and because of the inevitable politics of ensuring that
only the most economically sensible projects are implemented. But it would still be feasible as many
of the needs have already been identified by expert studies. More importantly, a significant portion
of the program would involve maintenance and refurbishing of existing infrastructure, which implies
less complex project selection and execution than new projects. Involving the private sector through
public-private partnerships may be appropriate in some circumstances. As public infrastructure
investment is partly the responsibility of municipalities, some of which have tight budget constraints,
avenues to channel resources to sub-national entities would need to be pursued.
24.
Reforms in services sector regulation could boost productivity and growth and lead to
a reduction in the current account surplus and modest spillovers. Notwithstanding continuous
improvement in economy-wide product market regulation over the past fifteen years, there is still
scope for reducing barriers to competition in several areas of the services sector (Chapter IV,
Selected Issues). Professional services remain overregulated, and greater openness could be instilled
in the areas of exclusive rights, compulsory chamber membership, and regulation on prices and fees.
While barriers to competition are generally low in network industries, efficiency gains in rail
transportation and postal services could be achieved by reinforcing the regulator’s powers to stop
discrimination against the incumbent operators’ competitors, as documented in recent reports by
the Monopolies Commission. In the retail sector, the involvement of professional bodies in certain
licensing decisions may restrict
competition, as may regulation
restricting large outlets. In all
these sectors, more competition
may reduce price mark-ups
and/or increase productivity. As
an illustrative example, reforms
that reduced price mark-ups in
nontradable private sector
services by a cumulative
2 percentage points over 4 years
would raise average growth over
a four-year period by 0.1 percent,
and reduce the current account
surplus by 0.2 percentage point of
GDP. Similar results would be

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

obtained if instead of a reduction in mark-ups, more competition boosted nontradable-sector
productivity by 0.1 percent per year.
25.
A reduction in uncertainty about energy costs would also stimulate private
investment, help external rebalancing, and generate positive spillovers. Surveys indicate that
uncertainty about energy costs and
the overall energy policy framework
is discouraging investment. In
addition, while investment needed to
upgrade the energy production,
storage, and transmission
infrastructure is estimated at 1-1½
percent of GDP per year until 2020,
several factors have slowed the pace
of transmission infrastructure
expansion and the implementation of
related projects. An earlier resolution
of uncertainty associated with energy
policy could boost private sector
investment within and outside the
energy sector, thereby stimulating
economic activity domestically and abroad. An illustrative simulation indicates that additional private
investment of 0.5 percent of GDP over four years could raise GDP by 0.5 percentage point, lower the
current account balance by 0.3 percent of GDP, and yield positive regional spillovers.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities acknowledged that the current account surplus was high. However, they
emphasized that it did not reflect policy distortions and that rebalancing within the euro area was
under way and expected to continue. In the context of the external sector assessment, they
welcomed the approach of indicating ranges rather than point estimates for the gaps to signal a
degree of uncertainty in the evaluation. The authorities agreed that the full implications of certain
factors such as rapid population aging were difficult to capture in conventional empirical models.
They also noted that the cyclically adjusted current account may be biased upward because some of
Germany’s trading partners may have suffered more permanent output losses than those built in the
staff’s analysis. The authorities concurred that the REER was undervalued, but viewed the degree of
misalignment as closer to the lower half of the range presented by staff.
27.
The authorities agreed that higher public and private investment would be welcome
and lower the current account surplus. While noting that higher investment would be desirable as
it would durably raise output in Germany over the medium term, they expressed some skepticism
over the need for demand stimulus in the rest of the euro area, and saw structural reforms as the
main priority. They also emphasized that any additional public investment should not lead to a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GERMANY

higher public deficit, as buffers are needed to be preserved under the fiscal rule. They pointed to
public-private partnerships as possible avenues to boost infrastructure spending.
28.
The authorities were open to further reforms in parts of the services sector but did
not fully share staff’s diagnostic and emphasized the progress already achieved. They saw no
need for reform in postal services and had no plans to sell the government’s remaining participation
in the historically dominant operator. While recognizing that the market share of entrants in railways
services was low, they noted that Germany was doing better than most European peers in that
respect and that long-distance bus transportation services had been liberalized last year. They saw
scope to strengthen the role of the federal regulator, but acknowledged that no new law to that
effect was being prepared. In the area of retail, they argued that constraints on the development of
large outlets reflected urban planning and environmental considerations. They agreed that certain
dimensions of the regulation of professional services such as pricing could be revisited but
expressed a preference for doing so in a broader European context. The authorities also saw the
macroeconomic effects, particularly those on the current account, of further reforms in the services
sector as likely to be smaller than suggested by staff.
29.
The authorities stated that the transformation of Germany’s energy system was
making headway and reforms were on the way. They noted the progress made thus far, including
the rising share of renewables in electricity consumption and lower carbon emissions relative to
1990 levels, and stressed that the strategy led to the development of a renewable energy sector and
job creation. They explained that a recent reform proposal approved by the cabinet would maintain
existing targets but help contain costs for users by (i) moderating growth in new RE generation
capacity thereby improving cost-efficiency by avoiding over-subsidization, and (ii) gradually
transitioning to more market-oriented RE financial support mechanisms. They also noted that, while
some modifications are likely, the revised European Commission state aid guidelines would allow for
continued surcharge reductions (exemptions) for large energy users competing internationally at
least until 2020, thus helping to diminish an element of uncertainty regarding the energy sector
regulatory framework. The authorities did acknowledge that there may be residual uncertainty about
the exemption regime in the long run, and that it was not yet clear how the lack of profitability of
conventional power producers would be addressed, or how grid expansion could be expedited amid
strong opposition of affected parties, especially in some regions.

C. ECB Policy and the Low Interest Rates Environment
30.
Interest rates in the euro area are expected to remain low for a long time. With euro
area inflation projected to remain persistently subdued, the ECB is expected to keep its main policy
rate at or near zero for a long period of time. In addition, the ECB is putting in place further
unconventional easing measures in the form of targeted long-term refinancing operations maturing
in September 2018. With monetary conditions already accommodative from a cyclical perspective, in
the medium term, German inflation might rise above the ECB’s price stability objective as part of the
needed rebalancing process within the euro area, though this is not envisaged under the baseline
July 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

31.
Low interest rates are contributing to an upturn in the housing cycle, but related
macroeconomic effects are expected to be modest. After a prolonged period of weakness,
housing prices have increased by 18 percent over the past five years (5 percent in 2013), but remain
below their peak reached in the mid-1990’s in real terms. Relatively stronger price dynamics is
observed in some segments (i.e., apartments in selected large cities), which are overvalued by up to
25 percent according to the Bundesbank (see Chapter V, Selected Issues). Recent housing market
strength appears to reflect the lack of attractive alternative domestic investment options, stronger
immigration flows, demand from foreign investors, and lags in the supply response. Because of the
features of German housing finance (traditionally conservative loan-to-value ratios, absence of
equity release products), the effects on consumption are likely to be close to nil or even slightly
negative so that the main transmission channel to the economy is through residential investment,
which has been robust.
32.
While there is no need to take action at the moment, the authorities should ready their
macroprudential toolkit. Looking ahead, the monetary policy stance in the euro area may become
too expansionary for Germany, given its relative position in the cycle. Hence, active use of
macroprudential policies to contain related financial stability risks may become necessary down the
road. Concerning current conditions in the housing market, with aggregate mortgage loan growth
barely positive in real terms and lending standards unchanged, stepped-up monitoring is the right
approach. Nevertheless, the currently available macroprudential policy toolkit is limited and should
be enriched by adding at least loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income instruments (see
Chapter VI, Selected Issues). Furthermore, the macroprudential framework could be made more
operational in line with recent Financial Stability Board (FSB) peer review recommendations by
clarifying the Financial Stability Committee’s scope of action and developing a comprehensive
communication strategy.
33.
While low interest rates are helping the fiscal accounts, they are negatively affecting
the household sector, given generally conservative investment portfolios. Households’ financial
assets almost doubled since 1995 with an increasing share concentrated in age-related saving
products (such as life insurance and pension plans) or held as currency and deposits—all of which

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

GERMANY

are earning low yields in the current enviroment. Households are not well positioned to gain from
higher asset prices due to the low share of equities in their portfolios, low home ownership rate, and
low indebtedness.
34.
A low interest rate environment is also a challenge for the banking sector. The pressure
on interest margins exacerbates banks’ structurally weak profitability. A Bundesbank survey of banks’
internal forecasts suggests that the sector would be able to withstand persistently low interest rates,
but would make relatively weaker institutions more vulnerable. Banks’ response to profit erosion, for
example through possible shifts to riskier portfolios (including cross-border) should be carefully
monitored to safeguard financial stability.
35.
While stable, the life insurance sector requires policy action. In Germany as elsewhere,
life insurance companies typically have very strong liquidity positions but are exposed to long-term
solvency risk. The German sector is vulnerable to a persistent low interest rate environment because
of historically high guaranteed interest rates coupled with a high duration gap between assets and
liabilities (see Chapter VII, Selected Issues). While insurers themselves are adjusting their strategy,
regulatory measures taken so far to force life insurers to build further reserves may prove
insufficient, and further policy action is being considered. One avenue to protect the interest of
policyholders would be to amend a policy that compels insurers to share part of their valuation
reserves—including fixed-income securities—with holders of matured or cancelled policies. The
insolvency of several mid-sized life insurance companies would be unlikely to have large systemic
effects but it might have spillover effects on banking sector financing as bank-insurance linkages
remain significant.
Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities noted that the case for further unconventional monetary policy
measures in the euro area was not strong as of the time of the mission. Counterparts saw the
ECB forecast as still showing euro area inflation rising to a level consistent with the price stability
objective at the end of the forecast horizon; at the same time, inflation expectations in the euro area
were seen as still well anchored. In their view, very low inflation in the euro area periphery was the
natural, temporary consequence of a necessary structural adjustment, and thus saw the effectiveness
of additional monetary stimulus at this point as low. Furthermore, they argued that the European
monetary union legal framework might not be consistent with the implementation of certain types
of asset purchase programs, including in light of the recent German Supreme Court ruling on the
ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions.
37.
They agreed that a persistently low interest rate environment could present financial
stability challenges. Even though they did not perceive any significant deviation of economy-wide
housing prices from fundamentals, they had decided to step up their monitoring of the housing
market and had conducted a detailed survey of banks’ mortgage lending practices, which was still
under analysis. They saw the FSB’s and staff’s recommendations on the macroprudential framework
as in line with their current work program, and explained that the first Financial Stability Committee
report to parliament this summer would contain several elements aimed at clarifying its mode of

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

operation. On risks in the life insurance sector, they were confident that the government’s planned
policy measures would help improve insurers’ capital positions. They remained wary of the possible
spread of search-for-yield behaviors to German financial institutions, though noted that close
supervisory scrutiny through the ECB Comprehensive Assessment allayed concerns in the short term.

D. Adapting to the New Financial Regulatory and Supervisory Framework
38.
Major transitions in bank regulation, supervision, and resolution frameworks are
entering a critical phase. Beyond changes driven by membership in the European Union (capital,
leverage; and liquidity requirements, recovery, and resolution—including a bail-in framework,
structural measures, deposit insurance) and the euro area (Single Supervisory Mechanism – SSM,
Single Resolution Mechanism), or by foreign regulators (U.S. rules on Foreign Banking
Organizations), German banks are also subject since the beginning of this year to the Act on Ringfencing and on Recovery and Resolution Planning (see Chapter VIII, Selected Issues). In line with the
requirement of this Act, all domestically systemic banks have submitted a first draft of their recovery
plan, which are now being fine-tuned through discussions with supervisors. With respect to the bailin tool, the authorities conducted last year a survey of 13 large banks to assess their respective
amount of available bail-inable liabilities. The issue of creditor burden sharing is of particular
relevance to the insurance sector since 30 percent of German insurers’ assets are banking sector
liabilities (mostly vis-à-vis German banks).
39.
Robust domestic supervision remains a priority in the new European framework. Both
domestic supervisory agencies (BaFin and the Bundesbank) will continue to play a key role in the
transition to the SSM, as well as in the new steady state. They will be part of joint supervisory teams
for banks under direct ECB supervision, and robust collaboration within these teams will obviously
be of the essence. All other banks—including all cooperative banks and most savings banks—will
remain under the domestic supervisors’ purview. In that regard, staff echoed several
recommendations made in the recent FSB peer review, in particular those pertaining to the further
enhancement of the frameworks for prompt and comprehensive risk identification as well as timely
and effective intervention.
40.
Banks’ capital building efforts should continue while the ECB’s Comprehensive
Assessment is in progress. The Assessment is an important milestone for the German banking
system. Twenty percent of the banks included in the exercise are German. About 1600 auditors are
reviewing portfolios representing over 50 percent of these banks’ risk-weighted assets, including
legacy exposures to foreign commercial real estate, the euro area periphery, shipping, and
securitizations. These exposures can be hard to value and reach multiples of Common Equity Tier 1
capital in a few banks already under restructuring. In general, however, asset quality is better than
European peers’ (for additional details see Chapter IX, Selected Issues). Assessed banks and
supervisors are in discussions about their capital plans, and two of the largest privately owned banks
have recently been or are in the process of raising fresh equity to bring their capital buffers closer to
those of peers.

Authorities’ Views

41.
The authorities were focused on the implementation of recently agreed financial
sector reforms. When transposing the European directive on bank recovery and resolution later this
year, they intended to make the bail-in tool immediately available (i.e., not wait until January 1, 2016
as allowed under the directive). They did not expect bail-in to be a possible source of contagion to
the German insurance sector as insurers’ exposures to banks are well diversified and 70 percent of
these exposures are collateralized. While recognizing that further progress toward addressing the
too-big-to-fail problem would be desirable, they planned to advance at the same pace as regional
and global initiatives. They supported the European approach according to which the leverage ratio
would be introduced as a complement to risk-based capital ratios in line with international
agreements. They thought that reporting obligations for institutions would allow appropriate review
and calibration with a view to migrating to a binding measure in 2018, and that the final decision
should take into account the impact of the leverage ratio on different types of business models.
42.
Eventually, they believed the banking union would need to be put on a stronger legal
footing. Their view was that current EU treaties were not drafted with the objective of a banking
union in mind and therefore did not provide a sufficient legal basis for a genuine European
supervisory or resolution authority. In particular, they argued that there was insufficient separation
between monetary policy and banking supervision under the current framework.
43.
While work on the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment was still ongoing, the authorities
were confident German banks were generally well positioned for the exercise. They noted the
continuous and significant improvement in banks’ capital ratios over the past several years, but
agreed that shipping loans could be a source of further impairments. Should a capital shortfall be
identified in a bank and should the public sector be the only available source of fresh capital, they
would support recapitalization only for banks with a viable business model and only after burdensharing with junior bondholders as required by the EU state aid law. They conceived of ESM
involvement in the form of a loan to a member state for recapitalization purposes.

E. Some Questions and Answers on Staff Analysis
The question and answer format of this section is intended to probe further into the reasoning behind
staff recommendations.
44.
Question: Past staff analysis has shown that fiscal stimulus in Germany would have a
relatively small impact on the rest of the euro area—has staff changed its view?
Answer: Previous analyses focused on higher German public consumption and found limited
spillovers to the stressed economies in the euro area (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain).
Specifically, the effect would be less than 0.1 percent higher GDP in response to a 1 percent
stimulus. In contrast, this report analyzes the beneficial growth spillovers from higher public
investment and finds that such spillovers can be sizeable because more public capital increases the
productivity of private capital, inducing higher private investment. These growth spillovers are
further amplified in the likely case
that monetary policy in the
region remains accommodative.
In particular, in the case of a
4-year, ½ percent of GDP
increase in German public
investment the peak effect is
higher GDP of 0.3 for the stressed
economies. In contrast, the
corresponding spillovers
associated with a similar increase
in German public consumption
are small. Within the stressed
economies in the euro area, some
(e.g., Italy) would benefit from
these spillovers to a greater
extent given their closer trade
ties with Germany.
45.
Question: If higher public investment in Germany is so beneficial, why not recommend
a larger increase?
Answer: Higher public investment is one of the policies—along with those promoting higher private
investment and service sector reforms—to support growth as well as rebalancing efforts in the rest
of the region. Staff is arguing for higher public investment of ½ percent of GDP increase per year for
4 years—corresponding to over €50 billion in additional extra spending in addition to the €5 billion
set aside for transportation infrastructure in the government’s economic program over 2014–17. It is
important that publicly financed projects have true economic value and address identified
bottlenecks and deficiencies, otherwise the positive effect on private investment will not materialize.
An even larger increase in public investment than what is recommended by staff would likely not be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

GERMANY

feasible from an administrative point of view and may not meet true economic needs. Finally, a
larger increase may violate Germany’s fiscal rules and undermine their credibility. Confidence in
Germany’s fiscal soundness is a key anchor for the euro area.
46.
Question: Given increases in wage and income inequality in Germany, why is staff not
more supportive of the new national minimum wage? Won’t it also help rebalancing?
Answer: Staff expresses two main concerns about the new minimum wage. First, its level is high
relatively to current wages in parts of Germany and for some groups, suggesting that it may lead to
a sizable increase in unemployment concentrated in those regions and groups. Specifically,
according to statistics from the socio-economic panel survey as of 2011, low wage earners are
disproportionately concentrated in the East, among part-time workers, mini-job holders, and
women. Second, many recipients of the minimum wage are not necessarily the working poor: while
an estimated 4-6 million workers earn less than the proposed minimum wage, only some 1.3 million
workers qualify for social assistance in the form of in-work benefits. In addition, for the latter,

competitiveness.
47.
Question: German banks have improved their capital adequacy ratios significantly
over the past several years. Why is staff calling for even stronger capital positions?
Answer: It is true that the German banking system’s capital ratios have increased significantly above
the regulatory minima under the Basel II capital rules that were applicable until the end of last year
(see Table 5). However, under the new, stricter Basel III capital requirements that are in place since
the beginning of this year and are being phased in until January 1st 2019, the capital buffers (on a
fully phased-in basis) are significantly thinner. Some large banks also fall short of the three percent
minimum leverage ratio that will become applicable in 2018. Large banks’ profitability has been
mediocre in recent years and will remain under pressure because of the low interest rate

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

environment as well as the need to dispose of or further provision for legacy assets. Thus their
internal capital generation capacity is likely to remain depressed for some time. The ECB’s ongoing
asset quality review might uncover the need for adjustments in the treatment of hard-to-value
exposures while the adverse scenario of the stress tests that will follow soon after might also prove
challenging for some banks. Against this background staff believes that the current benign market
environment should be exploited to the fullest to build thicker capital buffers.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
The recovery is expected to gain further momentum, but medium-term growth
prospects are subdued. Private consumption should benefit from solid wage and employment
growth while business investment should continue to strengthen. However, a still weak and
precarious international environment, lingering uncertainty, fast approaching adverse demographic
developments, and uncertain future energy costs will constrain medium-term growth.
49.
Policies should focus on increasing growth in Germany while at the same time
supporting the recovery in the euro area. Higher public and private investment and services
sector reform in Germany would raise medium-term output, reduce the current account surplus—
which continues to exceed the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desired global
policy settings—and generate appreciable positive demand spillovers to the rest of the euro area,
thus helping rebalancing within the monetary union.
50.
Stronger public investment, particularly in the transport infrastructure, is needed and
feasible. The government’s decision to boost spending in this area is welcome, but the amount is
small relative to estimated needs. Additional investment up to 0.5 percent of GDP per year over four
years could be financed without violating fiscal rules and would have only a minor impact on the
debt-to-GDP ratio given the growth offset. Such a program would yield a persistent increase in GDP
by crowding in private investment and would also stimulate growth in the rest of the euro area.
Measures to ensure that the financed projects have true economic value need to be put in place. It
would also be important to explore the role that the private sector could play in these initiatives
through public-private partnerships.
51.
Unlike spending on investment, pension expenditures do not increase potential
output, and have negligible outward spillover effects. Planned increases in benefits to certain
categories of pensioners are particularly costly. Measures to facilitate early retirement for workers
with long contribution periods will likely reduce older workers’ labor market participation and add to
skills shortages in some sectors, while further increasing already high social security contributions
down the road.
52.
Greater clarity about the future energy sector regulatory framework would encourage
private investment. The announced reform of the renewable energy law has usefully clarified
important elements of the strategy, including—for the short term—the contentious regime of
exemptions for energy-intensive, internationally active firms. However, the private sector still

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

GERMANY

perceives the exemption regime in the medium term as uncertain. At the same time, hostility by
some affected parties continues to delay the needed grid extension. Additional policies to address
these problems would help mobilize the investment potential in the energy sector and in the rest of
the economy and thus help strengthen the outlook.
53.
Further reforms in services sector regulation could boost competition and
productivity. There is scope for deepening competition in several areas of the services sector. In
professional services (accountants, architects, engineers, lawyers, tax consultants, etc.), greater
flexibility could be introduced in the areas of exclusive rights, compulsory chamber membership,
and regulation on prices and fees. While barriers to competition are generally low in network
industries, in rail transportation and postal services we would welcome the reinforcement of the
regulator’s powers to stop discrimination against the incumbent operators’ competitors.
54.
The new nationwide minimum wage will help reduce growing wage inequality, but it
risks exacerbating unemployment in some regions. Expert estimates suggest that the proposed
minimum wage will be binding for about 20 percent of workers in some federal states where
unemployment is already relatively high. While the employment effects of changes in minimum
wage regulation are notoriously difficult to predict, sizable adverse effects in these areas could
materialize. Decisions by the to-be-created commission on the future level of the minimum wage
should take these employment effects into account and give adequate consideration to the interests
of those not well represented by employers’ and employees’ associations. In addition, alternative
ways to achieve income redistribution could usefully be explored.
55.
Banks should keep strengthening their capital position ahead of the completion of the
ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment. The banking sector keeps downsizing through the disposal of
legacy assets, thus building up capital buffers, and supervisors are in active dialogue with assessed
banks about their capital plans. While asset quality is generally better than European peers’, the
Assessment will help bring clarity about the health of banks still holding sizable portfolios of hardto-value legacy assets. In addition, supervisors should continue pressing to ensure that all large
banks comfortably meet forthcoming minimum standards on leverage ratios. Close cooperation and
coordination within SSM joint supervisory teams will be important in this context.
56.
While concerns about a housing bubble are premature, preparations against it are not.
Low interest rates are contributing to an upturn in the housing cycle and have rekindled residential
investment without threatening financial stability to date. Nevertheless, the macroprudential toolkit
should be readied. We welcome the authorities’ progress in making the new Financial Stability
Committee fully operational and in expanding their statistical coverage of the mortgage market. We
encourage them to consider expanding the set of macroprudential tools to include loan-to-value
and debt-service-to-income instruments.
57.
While stable, the life insurance sector requires policy action. High average guaranteed
interest rates and a high duration gap between assets and liabilities make it vulnerable in the
medium term to a persistent low interest rate environment. Measures taken so far to force life
insurers to build up reserves might prove insufficient, and further policy action is rightly being

32

considered. One avenue to protect the interest of the majority of policyholders would be to amend
a regulation that compels insurers to share part of their hidden valuation reserves—including on
fixed-income assets—with holders of matured or cancelled policies.

Germany: Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risks
Risks to the economic outlook
I. Weaker investment recovery. German
investment growth has been shown to be
sensitive to policy uncertainty. A resurgence of
policy uncertainty could weaken business
investment and adversely affect growth.
II. Protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies (including
because of lower-than-anticipated growth and
persistently low inflation in advanced
economies, the maturing of the cycle in
emerging markets, and/or a growth slowdown
in China). Given its high degree of trade
openness, Germany is highly susceptible to
fluctuations in global demand.
III. Geopolitical tensions surrounding RussiaUkraine (which could lead to disruptions in
global financial, trade, and commodity markets).
In particular, Germany is exposed to an
escalation of trade sanctions with Russia given
its heavy dependence on Russian gas
(40 percent of total consumption).
Risks to the financial sector
IV. Global and regional financial instability:
 Surges in global financial market volatility,
triggered by geopolitical tensions or
revised expectations on UMP exit/emerging
market fundamentals.



In the euro area, re-emergence of
sovereign stress due to incomplete reforms,
unanticipated outcomes from the asset
quality review and stress tests in the
absence of a fiscal backstop.

Medium-term risk
V. Distortions from a protracted period of
low interest rates continue to build. The
recent strength in pockets of the German
housing market could spread nationwide and
real estate assets could become overvalued and
associated with excess leverage. Banks’ net
interest margin could shrink further and banks
may be tempted to adopt (risky) search-foryield strategies. Some life insurers may become
distressed.

Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relatively likelihoods of risks listed is the staff’ subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent
of more). The RAM reflects staff views on the sources of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. Germany: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy
Recommendations
IMF 2013 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response
Fiscal Policy



If fiscal overperformance appears
definitive, planned expenditures should
be accelerated, especially in areas that
enhance growth potential (e.g., public
investment).

After an overperformance of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2012, the
general government registered a zero balance in 2013, 0.5
percent of GDP stronger than planned. In 2013, it was decided
to increase federal spending (including on infrastructure) by €23
billion over 2014-2017 financed by eliminating the small fiscal
surplus that would have been achieved without these measures.



Reform the tax and social security system
to further increase labor force
participation of the low-skilled and
secondary earners

The contribution rate for statutory pension insurance was
reduced (reflecting the adjustment rules of the pension
insurance scheme) and the personal basic tax-free allowance for
income tax and the monthly pay threshold for mini-jobs were
increased in 2013.

Financial Sector Policy
Sustain the financial reform momentum both
domestically and at the regional level:



At the domestic level, consolidate
financial strength by pushing banks
to further augment capital buffers,
improve profitability and efficiency,
and adjust business models.

Further progress on the implementation of FSAP
recommendations has been made, but more progress is needed
in some areas (see Annex II for details).
Banks’ capital ratios keep improving, and some large banks have
raised fresh equity. Profitability is under pressure from the low
interest environment. Progress has been made on the
restructuring of large banks but further efforts are needed.



Firmly anchor the surveillance of large
cross-border banks by strong
domestic supervision and close
coordination with key financial
centers' supervisory authorities.

Joint supervisory teams with the ECB are being established for
large cross-border banks ahead of the transition to the SSM.
Supervision at the European level is expected to help strengthen
the supervision of cross-border activities.



Keep developing a clear, harmonized,
and coherent roadmap towards
achieving domestic and European
initiatives, including steps towards
reversing the fragmentation of
banking systems across Europe and
creating an integrated pan-European
banking system.

Two key pillars of the European Banking Union (SSM, SRM)
legislation have been put in place. Progress on establishing
recovery and resolution plans has been made but there is little
momentum in reforming the fragmented deposit insurance
regime. German initiatives on bank structures will have to be
meshed with European proposals. Further advances on solving
the too-big-to-fail problem will take place at the same pace as
regional and global initiatives.

Structural Reforms
Continue to take measures to raise potential
growth and diversify its sources, in particular,
by addressing the decline in working-age
population and by raising productivity outside
of the manufacturing sector.

To increase female labor force participation new spending has
been allocated to all-day schools and childcare. However, a
pension reform to facilitate early retirement for workers with
long contributions period will likely reduce participation by older
workers. Steps to strengthen competition in network industries,
financing research and development and providing risk capital
were taken, but further efforts are needed.

Recommendations
Recommendation
Continue to improve stress testing in the
banking and insurance sectors. Rigorously
ensure that any institution that displays
weaknesses on a forward looking basis
strengthens its balance sheet and takes
managerial action.

Grant supervisors power to vet in advance
bank acquisitions of subsidiaries.

Define the role of the Bundesbank as
macroprudential supervisor, and institute
free exchange of information between macro
and microprudential supervisors.

Continue to strengthen on-site supervision.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Status
Stress tests (including thorough asset quality reviews)
for the large SSM banks (24 institutions) are part of the
Comprehensive Assessment which is being carried out
by the ECB (in close cooperation with the national
competent authorities and the EBA). In this exercise all
relevant risk factors of the large German banks are
stressed. For the smaller banks the Bundesbank has
developed a macroeconomic stress test which covers
both expected losses in the credit portfolio and losses
resulting from declining profits in an adverse
macroeconomic scenario.
Legislative initiatives on this matter are not expected
in the near term. As mentioned in the April 2014 FSB
Peer Review, the German authorities believe that they
would overstep their role as supervisors if they formally
vet and give prior approval for major acquisitions
proposed by banks; therefore, no changes to the
German Banking Act have been made to address this
issue. In light of CRD IV, the authorities do expect to
continue to review compliance with legal thresholds for
qualifying holdings and acquisitions made by banks
Since 2013, very significant progress has been made in
developing and implementing the macroprudential
framework. The Financial Stability Committee (FSC)
held regular quarterly meetings. During these
meetings, the Committee discussed all relevant threats
to financial stability. In addition, developments at the
European level (e.g. ESRB) were discussed. The FSC will
file an annual report to the German Parliament
beginning in mid-2014. This will provide more insights
into the current activities of the FSC and will inform
about the FSC's macroprudential strategy.
BaFin and the Bundesbank have continued to expand
their staff capacity and improve expertise among staff.
The intensity of on-site supervisions of banks has been
enhanced by increasing the number of inspections. In
terms of scope, the number of inspections of noncapital related areas, such as remuneration, liquidity
risk management, assessment of complex products,
commodities business, IT risks etc., particularly of larger
banks, has been further increased. Special inspections
with focus on credit risk models and credit risk
management have been conducted. Additionally, the

timely and systemic information is available
on emerging risk factors.

adequate prefunding.

scope of audits has been broadened by preparing
inspections in the area of compliance. Assessing asset
quality and credit provisioning processes will play a
more important role with the introduction of the SSM
in general, especially during the asset quality review of
the ECB. Amendments of the Minimum Requirements
for Risk Management (MaRisk), a BaFin circular
specifying the requirements of the German Banking
Act, will be prepared during 2014 in order to specify
supervisory expectations, e.g. in the area of
outsourcing, and to introduce tougher and more wideranging supervisory requirements stemming from
international regulations and recent supervisory
discussion, which will be subject to future on-site
inspections. The new reporting requirements on
internal capital adequacy shall provide information to
strengthen the supervision of Pillar II requirements and
hence also deliver new starting points for intense onsite inspections.
The implementation of the EBA guidelines on the
"Implementing Technical Standards” is to take place in
2014 with a first reference date for COREP reporting as
of end of March and for FINREP as of end September
accordingly. Beside harmonized reporting
requirements also national requirements have been
implemented in 2014 with a new "Financial Information
Regulation (FinaV)" which provides risk based
information on financial measures with the first
reference date as of end March 2014 at solo level and
of end September 2014 at consolidated level. From
2015 on, additional reporting requirements will provide
supervisors with more regular, more structured and
more detailed information on the internal capital
adequacy of banks. The new reporting requirements
have already been implemented into the German
Banking Act.
The approval of the amended EU Directive on Deposit
Guarantee Schemes is expected for mid- 2014.
National implementation has to be finalized one year
after approval. In Germany, the Deposit Insurance and
Investor Compensation Act (EAEG) will have to be
amended accordingly by mid 2015. The harmonized
and legally binding deposit guarantee of €100,000 is
unchanged by the Directive. Terms of prefunding are
part of the harmonization efforts and will have to be
implemented accordingly at national level. In this
respect, the Directive asks for prefunding and defines a
concrete "target level" up to the conditions specified in
the Directive.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Restructuring Fund is fully operational and enjoys
access to contingency funding from the federal
government. In the context of the establishment of the
European banking union, the role of national
restructuring funds in relation to the Single Bank
Resolution Fund at European level will have to be reassessed, ending, possibly, in the merger of the
German fund into the European fund over a
transitional period. The BRRD provides that resolution
funds may only be used if no other private sector
measures, including measures by institutional
protection schemes (if institutional protection
arrangements are concerned), would prevent the
failure of the institution.
There are no SoFFin guarantees outstanding and
capital injections have been reduced further between
31.12.2012 (€18.8 billion) and 31.12.2013 (€17.1 billion).
The two winding up institutions are gradually
deleveraging. However, the failure to privatize DEPFA
bank in May 2014 will result in the transfer of its
remaining assets (€49bn at end-2013) to one of the
bad banks (FMS-WM).
The reform of the Landesbanken is still under way, with
headcount, aggregate balance sheets and RWAs still
adapting to challenging circumstances. Overall, for the
Landesbanken sector, capital has improved, and
business models are being reviewed and streamlined
to adapt to the new operating and regulatory
environments. Sustaining restructuring efforts is key to
ensuring the viability of business models.
There are no plans to loosen regional constraints on
local banks, open up the public banks to private
participation, and reduce non-commercial influences.

GERMANY

Annex III. Germany—Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt is expected to remain sustainable reflecting ongoing primary surpluses and favorable
interest rate-growth differential. Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to
decline steadily to close to 60 percent in the medium term from the current level of 78.4 percent
with gross financing needs also reducing gradually to about 13 percent of GDP in 2019. A
negative growth shock represents the largest risk to the debt outlook. Realization of contingent
liabilities coming from future bank recapitalization needs or worse than expected performance of
winding-up institutions may also push the debt trajectory up by about 3 percent of GDP before
the debt-to-GDP declines gradually in the medium-term. Interest rate risk is important but
remains limited, reflecting the safe haven status of Germany and moderate financing needs.
Background. The new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is
used to assess Germany’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt
structure. The new framework uses a risk-based approach and expands upon the basic DSA to
include: (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions and the projected fiscal
adjustment; (ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt profile; (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a
stochastic debt projection taking into account past macro-fiscal volatility; and (v) a standardized
summary of risks in a heat map.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is projected to reach 1.9 percent in 2014 on the back of a
rebound in domestic and foreign demand. Inflation is expected to stay well below 2 percent over the
forecast horizon, reflecting the drop in global energy prices while the core inflation remains robust
around 1.2 percent on the back of robust wage growth. Growth will average 1.3 percent in the
medium term, close to potential. The output gap is closed over 2017-2019.
Germany’s high level of government debt calls for using the higher scrutiny framework.
Government’s gross debt increased significantly over 2009-2010, reflecting sizable fiscal stimulus,
large financial sector support and euro zone crisis-related lending. Public debt reached a peak of
82.5 percent of GDP in 2010 from 65.2 percent in 2007. Since the peak, it has declined gradually on
the back of fiscal consolidation and favorable interest rate-growth differential. Gross financing needs
are estimated at 16 percent of GDP in 2014 and are expected to remain around 13-16 percent in the
medium term.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The forecasts of variables affecting debt reduction have been on
the conservative side. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2005−2013 is
0.63 percent, suggesting that there is slight downward bias in the staff projections, but the forecast
bias is in line with other surveillance countries. Similarly, the median forecast error for inflation (GDP
deflator) is 0.14 percent, suggesting that the staff underestimated inflation, but to a lesser degree in
recent years. The median forecast error for primary balance also suggests that staff projections have
been conservative (a forecast bias of 1.55 percent of GDP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

GERMANY

Cross-country experience suggests the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The maximum
3 year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projection period
(2 percent of GDP) is not ambitious in cross-country comparison and Germany was able to deliver
larger fiscal consolidation in the past.
The DSA framework suggests that under different macroeconomic and fiscal shocks
Germany’s government debt-to-GDP ratio remains below 80 percent and its gross financing
needs remain below 20 percent of GDP. Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
decrease to close to 60 percent by 2019. Under most macro-fiscal stress tests, the debt-to-GDP ratio
continues to decline, but if there is a one standard deviation shock to real GDP growth, debt-to-GDP
ratio initially increases to 78 percent in 2016 and declines thereafter. Gross financing needs under all
scenarios remain at or below 20 percent, and decline by a few percentage points by the end of the
projection horizon.
List of shocks and stress tests



Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard deviation
over 2015-2016, i.e. 2.7 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The assumed decline
in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in
GDP growth) and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points for every 1 percent of
GDP worsening of primary balance.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a dual shock of lower
revenues and rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 1.6% deterioration in primary balance
over 2015-2016 (one standard deviation shock to primary balance)



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes an increase of 300 basis points increase in cost of
debt throughout the forecast horizon, mimicking the historical maximum cost of debt
experienced.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 13 percent devaluation in real exchange rate
in 2015 and examines the impact on debt through the inflation channel.



Additional stress test: Combined macro-fiscal shock. This shock combines shocks to real GDP
growth, the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance taking care not to doublecount the effects of individual shocks.



Additional stress test: Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes a cumulative 3 percent
of GDP (about €80 billion) additional support for the financial sector over 2015-2016 comprising
of additional re-capitalization needs in the banking system (€50 billion), a call on half of capital
shield guarantees (€20 billion), and worse than expected performance of portfolios of windingdown institutions (€10 billion). While a highly relevant shock, the assumed magnitudes and
timing are likely to be on the onerous side.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted for
security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with the
procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or international
security.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
The Fund assessed Germany against the AML/CFT in 2009. The detailed assessment report was
adopted by the FATF in 2010. The assessors found that, while generally comprehensive,
Germany’s AML/CFT framework was not fully in line with the standard. Shortcomings were
identified with respect to, inter alia, the money laundering and terrorist financing offenses, and
AML/CFT preventive measures (including the reporting of suspicious transaction requirements,
and customer due diligence requirements). In 2012 and 2013, the authorities indicated in their
follow-up reports to the FATF having taken a number of legislative and structural measures to
address several of the deficiencies identified. They mentioned in particular having broadened the
scope of the money laundering offense (by including additional predicate offenses),
strengthened the reporting of suspicious transaction requirements, enhanced the identification
of beneficial owner requirements, and strengthened sanctions for noncompliance with AML/CFT
preventive measures. The authorities also informed the 2014 Article IV mission of ongoing
initiatives to immobilize bearer shares and limit their use, increase the transparency of the
beneficial ownership of legal persons, and strengthen the AML/CFT framework applicable to
some designated nonfinancial businesses and professions. Remaining deficiencies to be
addressed include the criminalization of self-laundering and shortcomings in the terrorist
financing offense and freezing of terrorist assets. The authorities are encouraged to pursue their
efforts to fully implement the revised AML/CFT standard.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National accounts
Germany plans to adopt the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in September 2014. Transition
from the ESA 1995 (ESA95) will require a major revision of national accounts data. New data sources will also
be incorporated in the new estimates. The Federal Statistical Office plans to recalculate all national accounts
aggregates in full detail back to 1991. The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic
statistics generally follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions,
scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the sources for estimating value
added for a few categories of service industries could be improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in
inventories, which is an important indicator of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. There is no
systematic, proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local units and
products between rebases of the producer price index.
Government Accounts
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government finance.
Documentation exists to explain the differences between the general government data in the ESA95
classification and the general cash data on an administrative basis; Germany publishes—through Eurostat—
general government revenue, expenditure, and balances on an accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and
submits annual data for publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format.

External Sector Statistics
The Bundesbank compiles balance of payments statistics in close cooperation with the Federal Statistical
Office. Starting with data for 2014, external sector statistics are compiled based on the Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) and in accordance with legal requirements
of the ECB and Eurostat. Germany also participates in the IMF Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS),
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and the BIS Securities Statistics database. In addition, the
Bundesbank reports quarterly gross external debt position data to the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt
Statistics (QEDS) database, and compiles and disseminates monthly reserve template and monthly official
reserve data.
Financial Soundness Indicators
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness indicators (FSIs). In
2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a comprehensive set of FSI data and
metadata. Of the 40 FSIs, Germany reports all except net foreign exchange exposure to equity (I31), which is
encouraged FSI for the nonfinancial sector (this indicator will not be included in the revised list of FSIs). Even
though Germany reports all of the 12 core FSIs, six FSIs are being reported on an annual basis:

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

(i) nonperforming loans (NPL) net of provisions to capital, (ii) NPL to total gross loans, (iii) return on assets,
(iv) return on equity, (v) interest margin to gross income, and (vi) non-interest expense to gross income. In
principle, the banking supervision in Germany intends to shorten the periodicity of FSI data that are currently
reported on an annual basis to quarterly reporting in 2015. Plans are currently underway to change the legal
basis for reporting requirements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Germany
On July 14, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Germany.
A recovery is under way, led by domestic demand and underpinned by healthy corporate and
household balance sheets, a strong labor market, a much improved fiscal position, and
accommodative financial conditions. As growth returned in mid-2013, the unemployment
rate reached a post-unification low, while the labor force continues to expand on the back of
strong immigration and increasing participation. Headline inflation has been on a downward
trend reflecting falling import prices and contained wage pressures, but core inflation has
been stable around 1.2 percent. The fiscal stance in 2013 was contractionary and fiscal
consolidation has put the debt-to-GDP ratio firmly on a downward path. The current account
surplus reached a new high in 2013, as lower surpluses vis-à-vis the euro area periphery were
offset by larger ones vis-à-vis economies outside of Europe. While credit conditions remain
favorable, credit growth has been lackluster, reflecting low demand despite the upturn in the
housing market.
The German banking system is downsizing and gradually strengthening. While profitability
remains subdued and under pressure from persistently low interest rates, improvements in
capital adequacy continued, as banks prepared to meet upcoming stricter regulatory
requirements and the ECB Comprehensive Assessment got under way.
The short-term outlook is for GDP growth to gain momentum. As domestic demand growth
becomes more broad-based, output should increase by 1.9 percent this year and 1.7 percent
the next, and the current account surplus should begin to decline gradually. Inflation should
pick up and remain above that in the rest of the euro area as the residual slack in the economy
is eliminated. Growth in the medium term, however, is expected to remain constrained by the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

still weak and precarious international environment, lingering uncertainty (including about
future energy costs), and fast approaching adverse demographic developments.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors broadly commended the German authorities for their continued prudence
in macroeconomic policies and commitment to a strengthened European integration.
Directors concurred that Germany has strong fundamentals, notably the generally healthy
balance sheets, strong fiscal position, and historically low unemployment. These, together
with accommodative financial conditions and a robust labor market, have underpinned the
economic recovery. Directors observed, nevertheless, that medium-term growth prospects
remain subdued against a still weak international environment, lingering uncertainty about
future energy costs, and looming demographic changes. Accordingly, they emphasized the
importance of growth-enhancing policies, which would also generate positive spillovers to
the rest of the euro area, preserving the role of the German economy as an anchor of regional
stability.
Directors considered that policies that focus on strengthening domestic sources of growth,
promoting private investment, and reducing the current account surplus would be beneficial
for both Germany and the euro area as a whole, while also facilitating external rebalancing.
To this end, most Directors recommended that the authorities use available space to boost
public investment in projects with true economic value, especially in transport infrastructure
and education, while adhering to the European and national fiscal rules. Noting that the
economy is operating at close to its potential in the presence of downside risks and
uncertainty, a few Directors stressed the need to maintain a safety margin and confidence in
public finances.
Directors welcomed ongoing reform initiatives to increase competition in product markets
and address remaining challenges in the energy sector. They noted that greater clarity about
energy prices and the regulatory framework would encourage private investment in
renewable energy production and infrastructure more broadly, positively contributing to
growth and regional spillovers. Directors also encouraged further efforts to improve
productivity and reduce barriers to competition in the services sector, especially professional
services.
Directors acknowledged the remarkable success in achieving low unemployment and
continued efforts to promote social equality and fairness. They urged the authorities to
implement a new national minimum wage with care, mindful of its potential adverse effects
on employment across regions and economic sectors. At the same time, they encouraged
exploring well-targeted measures to achieve income redistribution while raising labor market
participation and minimizing fiscal costs. Directors advised that these considerations be taken
into account in future decisions on the minimum wage and reviews of the new pension law.

Directors noted the overall strength of German banks and encouraged proactive efforts to
further build up capital buffers ahead of the Comprehensive Assessment by the European
Central Bank. They also emphasized the importance of robust domestic supervision in the
transition to the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and close coordination among all
supervisory bodies. Directors looked forward to continued progress in implementing the
FSAP recommendations and to Germany’s leadership in advancing a banking union.
Directors highlighted the need to remain vigilant to developments in the housing market and
insurance sector as monetary conditions are likely to remain accommodative for a prolonged
period. In this regard, they welcomed steps to make the new Financial Stability Committee
fully operational, and supported enhancing the macroprudential toolkit. Directors were also
reassured by the authorities’ intention to take appropriate policy action to address
vulnerabilities in the insurance sector.

Statement by Hubert Temmeyer, Executive Director for Germany
July 14, 2014
I would like to convey my authorities’ gratitude for productive and insightful discussions
during this year’s Article IV consultation. As in previous years, staff reached out to a broad
range of stakeholders such as think tanks, economic associations, and the financial sector,
which has resulted in a comprehensive and at the same time candid and balanced assessment
of the German economy. My authorities also welcome the section “Questions and Answers
on Staff Analysis” and the excellent in-depth analysis in the “Germany - Selected Issues”,
which is highly appreciated. My authorities agree to the main thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic Development and Ooutlook
I broadly share the staff’s assessment of the current economic situation in Germany and the
outlook for 2014. The German economy is indeed in a remarkably good shape: rising
employment and low unemployment, elevated consumer sentiment, low corporate leverage
and very favorable financing conditions. Gross fixed capital formation is expected to grow
robustly in the coming years, for 2015 my authorities assume an even stronger dynamic than
staff. Consequently, domestic demand is expected to make a significant contribution to
growth of 1.8% in 2014 and 2.0% in 2015, while the external sector is expected to have
virtually no contribution in both years.
Given its high degree of openness and its integration in global supply chains, Germany is
depending on global economic developments. Insofar, a slowdown in major trading partners
would dampen growth in Germany. But openness also offers growth opportunities for
Germany in case of stronger growth in the global economy. For 2014 and 2015 I expect GDP
growth to outpace potential output growth. Against the backdrop of generally favorable
economic conditions and particularly high migration surpluses, potential growth might be at
around 1½ % p.a. in 2014 and 2015.
External Stability and the Euro Area
Staff’s analysis of Germany’s current account in the staff report and the 2014 Pilot External
Sector Report is welcome. Regarding the external surplus, I would like to highlight that
Germany has already contributed significantly to regional rebalancing. Driven by sound
macroeconomic developments and government policies domestic demand in terms of both
investment (private and public) and consumption is on an expansionary path. In addition,

2
Germany is providing bilateral financial and technical assistance to countries hit hardest by
the crisis in parts of the euro area in order to relax constraints on the financing situation of
SMEs. The bilateral current account surplus with the rest of the euro area has already
declined substantially since 2007 and will – considering the ongoing adjustments to regain
competitiveness in many countries – most likely continue to do so. There is consensus with
the staff regarding the prediction that the current account surplus may shrink in the coming
years as some factors contributing to the surplus are likely to diminish. I emphasize,
however, that the amount and the dynamics of Germany’s current account is determined not
only by the balance of trade, but also by the income and services accounts. In this context it
should be noted that earnings on foreign assets and a structural improvement in the services
balance have gained substantially in significance in recent years.
As in earlier Article IV discussions, I would like to highlight that the German current account
surplus reflects the outcome of market processes and high (especially non-price)
competitiveness of German enterprises. It is not the result of targeted policy measures.
However, while the current account surplus is not an indication for market distortions and
disincentives, I agree that structural policy initiatives should set the course towards new
growth opportunities and encourage greater investment in Germany. For instance, some
professional services could be further deregulated and competition in the railway sector could
be further enhanced. Such structural policies could indirectly narrow the current account
surplus. However, since services are more and more tradable it is not obvious that service
sector reforms would automatically reduce the current account surplus.
In a European perspective, I agree with staff that the German economy plays an important
role as an anchor of stability. This puts a premium on prudent policies to safeguard
Germany’s sound balance sheets and ensure sustainable debt to GDP ratios in the household,
corporate and government sectors. As already discussed in the German-Central European
Supply Chain-Cluster, we consider healthy balance sheets to serve as an important buffer
against shocks and to generate positive spillovers that extend well beyond Germany. My
authorities are therefore committed to ensuring that the enhanced European procedures for
economic and budgetary monitoring are implemented rigorously. There must be no
relaxation in the efforts to reform – this also applies to Germany. Moreover, my authorities
are fully committed to an integrated and well-functioning EU and euro area that serves the
interest of all member states. A strengthened European integration is crucial to the long-run
prosperity of Germany with its very open economy. Against this background, Germany fully
subscribes that changes to the EMU architecture are necessary to create a stronger and more

3
sustainable and resilient monetary union. I would like to emphasize that substantial progress
has already been achieved in this regard but remaining issues need to be addressed.
Fiscal Policy
In 2013, the general government balance was slightly stronger than planned. However, this
was not the result of discretionary decisions by the government but reflected a better than
envisaged economic development with higher tax revenues, moderate growth in social
payments and falling interest expenditures. This outcome contributed to the reduction of
public debt. The fiscal balance is projected to stay close-to-balance or in surplus also in the
coming years.
With regard to the sharp increase in public investment of some 0.5 percent of GDP per year
(for four years) that staff is arguing for, it is important to note that the described efficiency
and spillover effects are highly uncertain. Results strongly depend on model specifications;
alternative specifications show only negligible regional spillovers. However, keeping a safety
margin from national debt brake limits and the medium-term objective (structural deficit of
max. 0.5 percent of GDP for general government) is essential for strengthening the
confidence in and the credibility of public finance, thus fulfilling our role as regional stability
anchor. Moreover, one should also have in mind that each fiscal stimulus would be procyclical for Germany. In an environment of already strong investment in housing and
construction and – as the staff mentioned in the report – capacity utilization in the
construction sector above long term average, fiscal stimulus might accelerate price increases.
A risk of overheating in the construction sector might emerge. Finally, in last year´s Article
IV report, staff found that “Fiscal stimulus is likely to have a relatively small impact on the
rest of the euro area…” and highlighted Germany´s role as an anchor of stability in the
region. While we recognize that staff distinguishes between government consumption and
investment in its analysis, the significantly modified staff analysis on fiscal spillovers from
Germany to other euro area countries is noteworthy.
More generally, I would like to emphasize that the debt-to-GDP ratio in Germany is still high
and demographic pressures are looming. Therefore, it is important that fiscal policy further
focuses on medium term consolidation. It is my authorities` objective to reduce the debt ratio
by maintaining the current targets for the structural fiscal balance in compliance with the
“debt brake” enshrined in the constitution and the commitments at the EU and euro area
level. The debt-to-GDP ratio – which rose markedly in particular due to the stabilization

4
measures taken in response to the crisis – is forecasted to decline to below 70 percent of GDP
by 2016.
Structural Reforms
Structural reforms are indispensable to address the demographic challenges Germany is
facing and to increase potential growth. Against this background, my authorities are
committed to further increasing the overall efficiency of public expenditure and to further
reforms on the labor market, improving infrastructure, a comprehensive energy strategy,
higher and more effective R&D spending, improving the general framework for competition,
and facilitating access to financing for SMEs.
Labor Market
The positive developments on the labor market in recent years resulted not only from the
good economic situation, but in large part from labor market reforms, reliable labor relations,
and prudent wage agreements. It is now important to build on this success and further
improve the functioning of the labor market. My authorities’ comprehensive Skilled Workers
Strategy is geared towards averting shortages of skilled labor and mobilizing individuals
through new opportunities. Improving parents’ ability to combine career and family
commitments through promoting a family-friendly working environment and an expansion of
childcare facilities is a central part of this strategy. Furthermore, education and training are
strengthened and the EU Directive on Highly Qualified Employment was implemented to
attract skilled workers from abroad.
Minimum Wage
I appreciate the comprehensive analysis concerning the introduction of a statutory minimum
wage in Germany. The introduction of a minimum wage was motivated by considerations of
social equality and fairness without unduly undermining potential growth and the long term
sustainability of Germany’s social security system. The introduction of the statutory
minimum wage in Germany is a historical step that, from 1 January 2015 onwards, will
benefit some 3.7 million workers according to projections by the Federal Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs. In order to contain adverse employment effects and negative impacts on
affected sectors, specific groups are exempted.
Pension
My authorities are aware of concerns that the recent measures on pensions could have a
negative impact on labour market participation and ceteris paribus increases contribution

5
rates. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that the new law leaves no room for earlier
retirement than has been possible under the old scheme. The earliest age for receiving oldage pension without penalties continues to be 63. To prevent early retirement via planned
unemployment, periods of short-time unemployment at the age of 61 and 62 will not count
toward the 45 years of contributions under the new pension law. Furthermore, the effects of
the new pension law will taper off over the long term. The minimum retirement age will
increase gradually up to the age of 65 in 2029 in line with the specified increase in the legal
retirement age from age 65 to age 67 in the same period. At that time, the situation is the
same as before the recent changes to the system; workers are able to retire at the age of 65
without any deductions when they fulfil the requirement of 45 contribution years (including
periods of short-time unemployment).
Staff addresses the foregoing reduction of contribution rates as well as an increase of social
contribution rates because of the new pension benefits in the longer-term. Because of the
high uncertainty in estimates on the take-up of the new benefits staff recommends periodic
reviews of fiscal costs. The law on the new benefits already includes an agreement on
periodic reviews. The first periodic review will be executed in 2018.
Energy
My authorities agree to the findings of the staff that substantial investment is needed in the
energy sector, with the focus on private investment in the fields of grid expansion and
renewable energy production. In order to provide clarity about the energy sector regulatory
framework, the German government is fully committed to its energy reforms and is pushing
firmly ahead with the restructuring of the energy system. As Germany implements the energy
reforms, it is important that the German government give equal priority to the objectives of
security of supply, economic viability (i.e. cost-efficiency, affordability) and environmental
compatibility/climate aspects. Electricity prices are crucial for the competitiveness of
companies in Germany and in Europe and for the budgets of private households. Because it is
clear that the energy reforms will not come free of charge, cost efficiency is a central
criterion in their implementation. My authorities have therefore reformed the Renewable
Energy Sources Act (to pass through parliament before the summer recess and to enter into
force on 1 August 2014). With this reform Germany puts the necessary policies in place for a
predictable and cost-efficient route towards a nuclear-free energy supply with a rising share
of renewables. In order to accelerate the expansion of the grid, key policies have already
been rolled out (e.g. Federal Requirements Plan Act, Grid Expansion Acceleration Act, rules
on offshore liability) and the relevant players have been brought around one table on the Grid
Platform.

6
Infrastructure Investments
I fully agree that good quality infrastructure is very important for the economy. Infrastructure
investment is one of the priority measures in the coalition agreement. In recent years, the
Federal Government has invested more than 10 billion euro per year in the transport sector.
For further upgrading and maintenance, an additional 5 billion euro will be provided between
2014 and 2017 for investment in the transport infrastructure. In this respect, I agree that also
private investments play an important role and the government will further improve
conditions in order to facilitate and foster private investments.
However, I am not convinced by a transport infrastructure investment need of 0.2 – 0.4
percent of GDP per year as mentioned by staff. The German Council of Economic Experts
considers an overall infrastructure investment need of 3.8 billion euro or about 0.1 percent of
GDP per year as justified. Besides stepping up investment the federal government aims at
increasing efficiency, e.g. the potential of public private partnerships will be further explored.
Furthermore, in view of the highly developed infrastructure already in place, priority will be
given to maintenance of existing infrastructure. Investment spending should not simply be
expanded across the board just to increase its share of GDP. Case-by-case decision is
required to determine whether there is a need for replacement or whether a bottleneck needs
to be eliminated. Shrinking demand for certain infrastructure and in some regions due to
demographic developments must also be taken into account.
R&D
Federal Government spending on R&D is rising continuously. The High-Tech Strategy
foresees R&D activities in five main areas: climate/energy, health/nutrition, communications,
mobility, and security. Also in the context of the High-Tech Strategy, an innovation policy
concept has been drafted with a view to taking further measures to strengthen Germany’s
already high innovative capacities.
Financial Sector
I share staff’s views on the changes in the banking sector. Progress with regard to the various
transitions – e.g. new capital and liquidity regulation, recovery and resolution frameworks,
and the Single Supervisory Mechanism - is on track.
On the macro-prudential framework, the German Financial Stability Committee (FSC) has
been founded with appropriate analytical capacities and tools to limit systemic risk if
necessary. As envisaged, the FSC has presented its first report to the Parliament and the
report is publicly available. Work currently focuses on further developing the

7
macroprudential strategy and instruments. We are monitoring closely the experiences of
other countries regarding the application of macroprudential instruments. These experiences
indicate that tools provided by CRD IV/CRR may not be sufficient to address certain types of
systemic risks and that additional tools may be needed. An expanded set of macro-prudential
instruments could possibly include LTV- and DTI-requirements to tackle possibly emerging
risks in the German housing markets.
