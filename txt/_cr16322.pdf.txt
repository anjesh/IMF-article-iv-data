IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia
On September 26, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Ethiopia.
Ethiopia’s macroeconomic outturn during the past year 2015/16 has been adversely affected by a
severe drought and the weak global environment. As a result, output growth is estimated to have
slowed down in 2015/16 to 6.5 percent. The slowdown was mitigated by effective and timely
policy responses to the drought, and buoyant industrial and services sectors. Stability-oriented
macroeconomic policies, including drought-related food imports, curbed inflationary pressures,
with overall inflation receding to 6 percent in July 2016. A supplementary budget helped address
the social costs of the drought, while keeping the general government deficit at 3 percent of
GDP. However, the external current account deficit, estimated at 10.7 percent of GDP, remained
wide. Export revenue stagnated due to weak international commodity prices, despite increases in
export volumes and diversification to new export markets. Savings on fuel imports were more
than offset by increased drought-related food imports and other imports. Remittances and FDI
posted strong growth, helping to limit the deterioration of the external position. The foreign
reserve buffer is less than 2 months of import coverage. The 2015/16 foreign borrowing
requirement of the non-financial public sector is estimated at 5 percent of GDP, a significant
reduction compared to the recent past. Public and publicly-guaranteed debt is estimated to have
been 54.2 percent of GDP in June 2016, of which 30.2 percent of GDP corresponds to external
debt.
Over the medium-term, growth is projected to recover to within the 7.3-7.5 percent range,
reflecting the growth-oriented reforms envisaged in the recently adopted second Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP II). Public investment is projected to moderate, while private
investment is projected to increase gradually, aided by better access to credit and anticipated
improvements in competitiveness. Inflation is projected to remain at around 8 percent, consistent
with the authorities’ price stability objective, supported by supply expansion and the monetary

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

policy stance. The general government deficit is envisaged to hover at around 3 percent of GDP,
with expenditure policies focused on capital and poverty-reducing programs. Export revenue is
forecast to expand throughout the medium-term, underpinned by more stable commodity prices,
competitiveness gains on account of key ongoing projects in logistic infrastructure, and
greenfield FDI. Import growth is projected to remain robust and the current account deficit is
projected to remain high, declining gradually over time.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted Ethiopia’s track record of sustained rapid growth and poverty
reduction. Directors commended the authorities for effective policy responses to the recent
severe drought, aimed at mitigating social costs and limiting spillover effects. They concurred
that, while the medium-term outlook is generally positive, downside risks remain arising from a
large external imbalance and public sector savings-investment gap, and inadequate reserve
buffers. Accordingly, they encouraged a macroeconomic policy mix to reduce the existing
imbalances and their attendant risks. Directors welcomed the authorities’ priorities for structural
reforms as outlined in the second Growth and Transformation Plan, with a focus on economic
and social development, as well as on private sector development.
Directors noted that, while external debt sustainability risks remain moderate, external
vulnerabilities had worsened, as the external deficit and the recent pace of increase in external
indebtedness were not sustainable over the medium term. They called for stepped-up efforts to
reduce the external imbalance, and considered that the authorities’ objective of increasing and
diversifying exports is an appropriate response that would yield the highest growth dividend over
the medium term. However, while export-oriented policies bear fruit, there is a need to contain
imports and prioritize import-intensive investment projects to substantially reduce the current
account deficit in the short term. Directors stressed that a tighter fiscal stance, while protecting
the vulnerable, and a more flexible exchange rate would facilitate reducing external
vulnerabilities and the necessary buildup of foreign reserves. They also welcomed the
authorities’ intention to refrain from new non-concessional borrowing.
Directors supported the authorities' goal to strengthen mobilization of domestic revenues to
finance the development strategy and reduce the savings-investment imbalance. Fiscal revenues
could be increased by introducing property taxes, reducing exemptions, and administration
reforms to enhance taxpayer coverage and compliance. Directors also welcomed the remit of the
new Ministry for Public Enterprises to strengthen the commercial profitability and governance of
the key state-owned enterprises, while advancing in the privatization of those with a less
strategic role. Fostering public sector oversight and transparency would enhance macroeconomic
management and reduce fiscal risks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors supported the authorities' efforts toward financial development and inclusion as
essential to bolster domestic savings. They stressed the importance of adequate supervisory
vigilance and strict provisioning of NPLs given the ongoing significant growth in financial
intermediation. Directors welcomed plans to develop a broader range of indirect monetary policy
instruments and an active inter-bank market. They encouraged the authorities to replace the
current funding mechanism of the national development bank with a less distortive system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ structural reform agenda. They underscored the importance
of strengthening competitiveness, creating an enabling environment for private sector
development and foreign direct investment, and enhancing public sector governance.
Directors emphasized the importance of accurate, timely, and comprehensive data for the
assessment of macroeconomic developments and effective policy responses. They urged the
authorities to strengthen efforts to address data weaknesses, gaps, and delays, particularly on
national accounts and public sector financial reporting, as well as to increase financial sector
information.

REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 30, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The newly issued five-year second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II) envisages
continued high growth and public infrastructure investment, while placing a greater emphasis on
private sector development and foreign direct investment (FDI), competitiveness, and exportoriented industrialization. A major drought and deterioration of the external environment resulted
in a 2015/16 growth slowdown to an estimated 6.5 percent. Stability-oriented macroeconomic
policies and effective policy responses, including food imports, to mitigate the drought’s social
costs kept inflation low and the budget deficit on target. The current account, however, posted for
a second year a deficit above 10 percent of GDP.
Outlook and Risks. The medium-term baseline envisages growth rebounding to potential and
exports recovering momentum as commodity prices stabilize, logistics infrastructure comes online,
and GTP II structural reforms take hold. The main risks stem from external imbalances. The risk of
external debt distress, currently assessed as moderate, is vulnerable to a worse-than-expected
export performance.
Key Policy Issues. Macroeconomic policies should be geared towards reducing the current
account deficit and mobilizing internal resources. Raising exports—the authorities’ preference—is
the first best option. But also, imports and public projects with substantial borrowing requirements
will have to be paced according to export performance. After appropriately supporting activity
during the drought, the fiscal stance will need to turn restrictive—aiming at over-performance in
the 2016/17 budget execution. Achieving the ambitious GTP II objectives will require fostering
market competition in key economic areas, including financial, and credit markets; expanding the
share of credit and foreign exchange available to the private sector; and improving domestic
revenue mobilization, public sector efficiency, and transparency.
Policy Recommendations. Staff broadly supported the authorities reform plans to promote
private sector development and competitiveness, and to improve governance, savings, and
efficiency within the public sector. Particularly, staff emphasized (i) revenue-enhancing tax policy
and administration reforms, and public investment prioritization; (ii) market-based indirect
monetary policy instruments and continued supervisory attention to credit quality; (iii) a more
flexible exchange rate system to foster competitiveness; (iv) improvements in the business climate;
and (v) reform of public enterprises’ governance and financial transparency.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
In October 2015, Ethiopia's authorities launched the second five-year Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP II), setting medium-term economic and social policy priorities
(Annex IV). Ethiopia has had an impressive track record of
growth and poverty reduction in recent years, with GDP

2019/20 (Table 1). While the public sector will continue
playing an important role, the GTP II places a key emphasis
on private sector development and FDI, particularly in building an export-oriented manufacturing
sector. As in past national plans, growth targets are underpinned by envisaged rapid structural
transformation and investments in energy generation, transportation, and infrastructure to boost
productivity and competitiveness.
2.
The Ethiopian economy coped well with
a difficult 2015/16 year, when the country faced
two adverse exogenous shocks. Overall economic
growth is estimated at 6.5 percent, placing Ethiopia
once again among the world’s fast-growing
economies. This strong growth performance
represents, however, a slowdown relative to last
year due to the impact of the “El Niño”-related
drought and a drastically weaker global
environment, epitomized by the near 12 percent fall
in the U.S. dollar value of world merchandise trade
in 2015.

Targeted policies, buoyant industrial and service sectors, and increased agriculture
resilience, helped to maintain growth momentum (Figure 1). Official data including the Central
Statistical Agency (CSA) crop production survey estimate an increase in grain production by
2.9 percent in 2015/16 (versus 7.5 percent in 2014/15), while other sources had pointed to a less
favorable outcome.5 While the drought spared most export crops and mainly affected
low-productivity regions, the social costs were large. Timely government interventions and food aid,
coupled with improved agricultural practices, technology, and rural infrastructure, appear to have
limited the economic impact of the drought relative to earlier drought episodes, including by
helping to increase production in less-affected areas. Indirect indicators point to strong growth in
industry (particularly construction and manufacturing) and services (notably trade, freight and
passenger transportation, telecoms, tourism and hospitality, and financial intermediation).

posted strong growth (28 percent), as did FDI (44½ percent). The foreign reserve cushion, at
1.9 months of imports at end-June 2016 (unchanged from previous year), remains thin.
5.
Inflationary pressure was contained by imports and cross-regional redistribution of
domestic market purchases of foodstuffs—supported by a restrictive monetary policy stance
(Figure 3). From an 11.9 percent peak in September 2015, headline inflation receded to 7.5 percent
by June 2016, and 6 percent in July—in line with the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) inflation
objective, driven by food price moderation. Base money grew broadly in line with the NBE target of
16 percent, despite a recent increase in net credit to the government, and the growth of credit to
the non-government sectors moderated since December 2015. The NBE acquired a US$1 billion
external liability by end-2015, which eased foreign exchange availability, financed increasing food
and other imports, and temporarily boosted reserves. Financial intermediation has continued to

“Ethiopia: Grain and Feed Annual” of March 2016 estimated overall losses in major grain crops at 20 percent. As

affect the overall estimation of national accounts.

The fiscal stance was appropriately supportive, aiming at minimizing the economic
and social impact of the drought. Tax revenue collection of the federal government is expected to
be broadly in line with the annual budget plan, benefiting from good execution of direct and import
taxes, while falling short in domestic VAT collection. On the spending side, the supplementary
budget approved in December 2015 contained appropriations for food security, agriculture, and
investments—funded by Oil Stabilization Fund surpluses (reflecting a limited pass-through of lower
fuel import costs into domestic prices). The general government deficit is estimated at 3 percent of
GDP. The total borrowing requirement of the non-financial public sector represented about
5 percent of GDP, a significant decline relative to recent years (Figure 4).
7.
Policy implementation was consistent with outstanding Fund advice in some areas, but
less so in others. Notably, the GTP II incorporates a focus on competitiveness, private sector
development and FDI. The new Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) legal and regulatory framework
reform and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) financing schemes will support private sector
participation. The newly established Ministry of Public Enterprises’ mandate for improved
governance, and tax system reforms will strengthen public sector efficiency. Fiscal and monetary
policies remained consistent with macroeconomic stability. However, Fund recommendations on
interest rates, exchange rate, and financial sector policies are yet to gain momentum, including:
(i) allowing for flexible determination of the interest rates, (ii) improving market functioning and
price setting mechanism for the exchange rate and increase exchange rate flexibility, and
(iii) phasing out the requirement that private banks invest in NBE bonds a 27 percent of their credit
(to finance the Development Bank, DBE). Follow up on technical assistance (TA) recommendations to
improve data quality and coverage has been mixed.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Growth is expected to rebound to 7.5 percent in 2016/17, as the weather-dependent
agriculture normalizes, and remain at this level over the medium term, supported by strong
GTP II growth-oriented reforms. Inflation is projected to hover around 8 percent through the
medium term, buttressed by more stable commodity prices and an appropriate monetary policy
stance. Exports of goods and services should pick up substantially in the medium term from the
current low base, reflecting the coming online of key infrastructure projects close to completion
(in electricity generation and export logistics) and pay-offs from domestic investment and greenfield
FDI. Import growth will remain moderate in 2016/17 as emergency food imports are phased out, but
is likely to be strong thereafter, as waning public import-intensive investment is replaced by private
sector imports. Thus, the current account deficit is projected to remain high and decline only
gradually in the medium term.
9.
Against a generally positive outlook, the high current account deficit and a potential
export underperformance (should adverse global conditions prove protracted) are the key
downside risks (Box 1). Additional external demand weakness and upturns in global risk aversion
could hinder the current account improvement and financing, and hence output and debt
sustainability. However, the risk of disorderly external stress episodes is mitigated by the high
proportion of official bilateral and multilateral external debt (much of it concessional), a closed
financial account, and the use of the borrowed funds for export-enhancing investment projects with
expected high returns—increasing repayment capacity. On this basis, and assuming no further
borrowing beyond existing plans, the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) currently assesses the risk of
debt distress at moderate, but the extended large breach of the debt to export ratio is of increasing
concern. Over the medium-term, financing constraints on private sector development, weak export
growth, slow implementation of revenue mobilization reforms, potential deterioration of bank assets
quality in the wake of rapid credit growth and higher pace in acquisition of external liabilities are the
main risks. Ethiopia remains vulnerable to climate change and droughts.
Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities estimated growth in 2015/16 and medium-term output and export
growth potential higher than staff. The authorities emphasized rising export volumes, completion
of key infrastructure projects, notably in energy generation and transportation, and measures to
elicit export-oriented FDI, including commitments by international businesses to locate in the new
industrial zones. In their view, these factors argued for two-digit medium-term growth potential,
supported by export revenue growth of 32 percent in 2016/17 and about 17 percent subsequently,
and continued strong remittances and FDI. Nonetheless, while seeing less downside risks than staff,
the authorities concurred on the need to reduce the external deficit; take measures to ensure debt
sustainability, consistent with the DSA moderate rating; and, should external revenue disappoint,
adopt import-dampening policies.

POLICIES FOR RESILIENT GROWTH
11.
Despite sustained growth, the bottleneck of the Ethiopian economy remains its large
savings-investment gap and associated external borrowing requirement. The current account
deficit of the last two years, at about 7½ billion dollars and over 10 percent of GDP, is not
sustainable. In the short term, macroeconomic policies should be geared towards reducing the
external current account deficit and its attendant risks. To this end, the authorities’ objective of
rapidly rising exports is the first best option. However, at the same time, imports and large-scale
public investment projects with substantial external borrowing requirements need to be paced
according to the actual export performance. Specifically, public sector imports need to be curbed in
the short term aiming at reducing demand for external credit. This would allow building up the
foreign reserve buffer and avoid volatility in foreign exchange availability. Reaching the authorities’
ambitious five-year GTP II growth objectives and sustained investment rates of almost 40 percent of
GDP without aggravating external imbalances will require mobilizing domestic resources and raising
domestic savings, particularly in the public sector—the main user of external borrowing.
12.
In the medium- and long-term horizon, mobilizing and attracting domestic and
foreign private sector resources, as envisaged in the GTP II, will require challenging reforms.
After strong public sector-led growth under the GTP I, the authorities’ objectives for the current
phase of Ethiopia’s economic development call for manufacturing expansion accompanied by rapid
improvements in competitiveness, economic diversification, and the investment and business
climate. This, in turn, requires fostering market competition within an increasing number of
economic areas, including financial, credit, and investment markets; and expanding the allocation of
resources to the private sector, such as credit and foreign exchange. It also requires increasing the
efficiency and transparency of the public sector, including the tax system, public financial
management processes, and public enterprise governance and financial management. Important
steps in this direction, guided by the GTP II, are already in train—but will need to be scaled up and
sustained.

The model simulates the public investment under the GTP II and ascertain the approximate size and
time profile of their effects on growth, current account, private investment and debt. An alternative
and more cautious investment path could result in more sustainable outcomes—less crowding out of
private investment and consumption and lower current account deficit and public debt—with longterm gains in growth and consumption preserved. Decelerating public investment could help
Ethiopia to cope with the short-term challenges associated to external imbalances and GTP II
financing requirements. The model also highlights the importance of efficiency in public investment
implementation and the risks of surges in the cost of external financing.

Box 1. Ethiopia: Investing for Development (concluded)

A. Fiscal Policy
13.
The budgetary policy stance has been broadly appropriate, in response to the droughtrelated needs; however, curbing the external deficit will require tighter policies going forward.
The relatively expansionary fiscal policy stance in recent months was appropriate to mitigate the
transitory agricultural supply shock, associated adverse hysteresis effects, and spillovers to the rest of the
economy; and to minimize social costs. However, fiscal expenditure restraint in the implementation of
the 2016/17 budget, including under-execution of nonessential lines, and subsequent years should take
priority as supply improves, aiming at curbing the public borrowing requirement. The de facto fiscal
anchor is the budget deficit, which the authorities target at about 3 percent of GDP over the medium
term. However, reducing external imbalances and shifting savings and financing resources to private
sector development would be aided by a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit from its current level by
about ½ percentage point of GDP per year over the medium term, underpinned by revenue expansion.
14.
Decisive tax reforms are needed to support the ambitious GTP II targets for revenue
mobilization. The recently passed income tax law simplifies procedures, updates tax brackets, and
improves the tax appeals process. Also, the newly introduced invoice-based taxation of imports is an
important step in modernizing customs procedures and trade facilitation. However, achieving the GTP II
objective of over 17 percent tax-to-GDP ratio by 2019/20 necessitates additional tax policy reforms,
including the introduction of a property tax and review of existing tax expenditures and incentives.
Property taxes have low distortive effects and, if allocated to sub-national levels of government, would
reduce intergovernmental transfers. Annual review of tax expenditures would allow phasing out those

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

that are no longer cost-effective, while reducing tax complexity and the accumulation of tax loopholes.
Regarding tax administration, measures need to focus on improving taxpayer coverage and
enforcement, including by updating and maintaining the taxpayer register; using risk-based compliance
monitoring; and improving IT systems, data quality, and their use.
15.
Prioritizing public investment, while protecting pro-poor outlays, would enhance fiscal
sustainability and efficiency. Given limited resources, public expenditure policy should focus on critical
infrastructure and priority areas. Ongoing reforms of the PPPs legal framework provide an opportunity
to improve public sector efficiency and private sector development, while attracting foreign resources.
The envisaged new PPP framework, however, should be based on cost-benefit analysis and minimize
fiscal risk.
16.
Comprehensive and upgraded fiscal reporting would support macroeconomic
management and accountability. Upgrading government accounting to 2001 Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) standards is an urgent task. Policymaking as well as public understanding of
policies would benefit from more comprehensive fiscal reporting covering budgetary institutions jointly
with extra-budgetary accounts (such as the Oil Stabilization Fund, Privatization Fund, Industrial
Development Fund, Road Fund, and use of Eurobond proceeds).
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to accelerate revenue mobilization.
They stressed that the adopted tax and administration reforms were an important step in this direction.
Introduction of property taxes in the immediate future is not envisaged. They also agreed on reforms to
enhance the PPP legal framework, which are under preparation including the creation of a unit to
monitor potential fiscal risks. On expenditure policy, the authorities view it as correctly focusing on
priority areas, with 2/3 of spending continuing to have a strong pro-poor focus.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
18.
A more flexible monetary policy framework would facilitate policy implementation. The
NBE uses reserve money, foreign exchange sales, and other direct monetary policy instruments with a
view to keeping inflation near 8 percent. The NBE is considering revamping the primary market and
introducing a secondary market for government securities—and eventually, possibly for other
instruments—to develop interbank market operations. These initiatives and an increased role of indirect
monetary policy instruments could substantially benefit policy implementation and liquidity
management. They could encourage commercial banks to manage more actively their liquidity positions
(through market transactions, rather than via direct access to the NBE’s liquidity facilities), and enhance
price discovery mechanisms and risk allocation.
19.
The authorities are making commendable progress in mobilizing domestic savings
through rapid expansion of financial access and inclusion (Table 2). Deposit mobilization and bank
branch expansion are deepening financial intermediation and funding growth-promoting credit. The
authorities’ private sector development objectives would be aided by rebalancing the public sector
credit demand towards the private sector to avoid its crowding out. Also, development of market-based
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

incentives for mobilization and allocation of savings will require positive real interest rates—facilitated
by the NBE’s progress in achieving lower inflation. Efficiency and growth gains will eventually exceed the
increased public sector borrowing costs. In the short term, however, higher interest rates will need to be
accompanied by fiscal and public sector measures to accommodate the associated higher financing
costs. The current means of financing the Development Bank (DBE)—now through banks mandatory
purchases of NBE bonds—should be replaced by less distortive mechanisms, including through the
budget.

20.
A sound financial sector is critical for the mobilization and efficient allocation of savings.
Aggregate capital and profitability ratios of commercial banks do not indicate emerging vulnerabilities;
and the system-wide NPL ratio remains low, below the statutory benchmark of 5 percent—although the
lack of underlying detailed bank data preclude the assessment of individual bank vulnerabilities. There
have occurred sporadic liquidity shortages, and the aggregate liquidity ratio is now close to the statutory
minimum of 15 percent. While the rapid pace of financial deepening is welcome, strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory environment is necessary to ensure that lending standards do not
deteriorate. Risks related to credit exposures and their concentration should be assessed through
regular stress-testing of commercial banks’ balance sheets. Although not a deposit-taking institution,
the ongoing supervisory attention to high NPL ratios in the DBE is warranted—since it could affect
confidence or become a fiscal liability. Strengthening the AML/CFT framework, in line with the Financial
Action Task Force standard, will also contribute to the soundness of the financial sector.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities concurred in many areas, explaining that they plan to start secondary
market operations in the near future. Selected NBE and government bonds are to become tradeable
during FY2016–17 in a secondary market—which will facilitate liquidity
management—while real interest rates are likely to increase moderately. The authorities are considering
alternative modalities for financing the DBE while strengthening its private sector financing role. While
the NBE is carefully monitoring DBE’s NPL ratios, the authorities pointed out that NBE’s regulation
requires the DBE to maintain provisions of 100 percent for NPLs.

C. Fostering Competitiveness through Structural Transformation
22.
Export diversification and upward shifts in the value-added chain are key items in the
authorities’ reform agenda. Nascent export lines (leather, apparel, textile, flowers, electricity) and
expansion to new markets point to good prospects,

of positive spillovers into the wider economy. Also,
progress in reducing trade barriers and enhancing the customs’ trade facilitation role beyond industrial
parks would increase competitiveness. The authorities are also launching other regulatory and
administrative reforms aiming at improving the investment environment (Figure 5).

23.
An overvalued real effective exchange rate poses headwinds for exporters and understates
the true economic cost of imports. Staff assess the birr to be overvalued by
20 to 40 percent (Annex III). Allowing for a more flexible exchange rate determination, aiming to
gradually eliminate misalignments, would bring the real effective exchange rate in consonance with
fundamentals and reduce foreign exchange market shortages.
24.
Also, a more flexible exchange rate policy could be instrumental in developing new export
lines and entering new markets (Box 2, Figure 6). Staff research on Ethiopia’s export dynamics, based
on product-by-product disaggregated data, indicates that the (country-by-country) real exchange rate
plays a crucial role in entering new markets—although significantly less so in increasing revenue from
already established markets, which are mainly traditional commodities. As a consequence, the real
appreciation of the Birr can pose an impediment to the emergence of a competitive manufacturing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

exporting sector—and more generally to the export of non-commodity products with high domestic
value-added facing price competition. Thus, exchange rate policies aiming to eliminate currency
misalignments could play an instrumental role in achieving the authorities’ export diversification
objectives. Higher import costs for the public (and private) sector would partly have a desirable
dampening effect on imports’ demand—in line with a policy to reduce external imbalances—and partly
would need to be absorbed through savings in other items; and in the longer term would be
compensated by growth effects.
25.
Higher foreign reserves would enhance the resilience of the economy (Annex II). Ethiopia
remains vulnerable to commodity price and weather shocks. Reducing the current account deficit and
expanding foreign reserve cover – aiming to eventually reach the standard of 5–7 months of imports would forestall potentially disorderly import compression in the event of future shocks.
26.
The new policy agenda for public enterprises aims at streamlining the sector, improving its
governance and efficiency, and raising its profitability. The centralization of public enterprise
management under a newly created ministry with this mandate is a valuable first step in this direction.
The authorities are encouraged to implement expeditiously their plans to focus on 10–15 key public
enterprises while privatizing the rest, strengthen their financial disclosure and transparency, and manage
them on a commercial basis.
Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities agreed with staff’s emphasis on competiveness-enhancing reforms. They
had launched initiatives to improve the business climate and facilitate exports—including logistics
infrastructure provision. The authorities expressed concerns regarding the potential adverse impact on
inflation and public sector costs from a more flexible exchange rate system. The authorities view the
potential overvaluation of the birr substantially lower than staff’s estimates. Over the next few years, the
NBE plans to increase its reserve import cover target to three months (national definition, about 2½
months in standard definition).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Box 2. Ethiopia: Export Dynamics and Diversification
Over the past 15 years Ethiopia’s merchandise export revenue grew at 13.3 percent on average.
This strong performance stems from volume expansion (15.1 percent annually), as prices decreased by
2.3 percent annually. However, export growth—both price and volume—remains highly volatile, due to
concentration on agricultural commodities exposed to price and weather shocks.
To reduce export volatility and increase revenue, policies aim at diversification across products and
destination countries. Also, diversification has development spillovers, as less innovative firms follow in
the wake of pioneer entrants. As a result, one third of 2015 export revenue comes from markets where
Ethiopia was not present 15 years ago. FDI has flowed to horticulture and light manufacturing, and nontraditional exports account for more than 10 percent of total exports. For example, flower exports
expanded from US$440,000 and 5 destinations in 2004 to US$225 million and 59 destinations now.
Staff analyses, based on disaggregated trade data (UN Comtrade), throw some light on the relative
impact on export sales of two competitiveness factors: structural competitiveness, as measured by
five indices from the Doing Business indicator, and the real exchange rate (RER). These factors are
measured by market-specific trade-weighted indices of Ethiopia’s strength versus competitors.1

The results (see table) indicate that the relative quality of logistics is key in improving export
performance; and that the RER significantly facilitates entry in new markets—such as the abovementioned case of flower exports. In markets where the “time it takes to export” index moved against
Ethiopia (relative to competitors), exports fell significantly (first column). Similarly, the quality of Ethiopia
vs. competitors’ trade logistics influences the probability of Ethiopia’s entry into new markets (third
column). The RER seemingly matters little when it comes to expanding exports in existing markets (mostly
commodities), but it is significant for entry into new markets (third column). Therefore, ongoing
improvements in infrastructure, such as the new railway link to Djibouti harbor, are likely to boost exports.
But also, Ethiopia could gain a foothold in new products and markets by reducing the substantial real
exchange rate misalignment.

D. Alternative Scenario
28.
Implementation of staff’s recommended policies could reduce Ethiopia's external
vulnerabilities and ease financing constraints, while at the same time support achievement of
sustainable long-term growth (Table 7). The implications of these policies would be: (i) a lower
current account deficit and a stronger exports performance, owing to timely implemented structural
reforms and measures aimed at fostering external competitiveness, including exchange rate
flexibility; (ii) a more sustainable debt trajectory, as a result of spreading out low-return large-scale
investments over time and reducing State Owned Enterprises’ (SOEs) borrowing requirements;
(iii) higher foreign exchange reserves, thus reducing volatility in foreign exchange availability;
(iv) higher tax revenue, with a view to closing the fiscal gap in the medium term; and (v) stronger
domestic savings with a view to narrowing the savings-investment gap, and larger accumulation of
financing for investment in the long term—facilitated by higher real interest rates. The growth
trajectory will be lower initially (reflecting slower imports of capital goods), but higher in the medium
run, as macroeconomic stability will be enhanced, and mobilization of domestic resources improved.
It would also minimize the risk of externally-induced economic stress episodes. This is consistent
with staff research (Box 1) indicating the need to elicit private investment and the positive role that a
moderation in the pace of public investment could play in this regard.
The authorities envisage a substantially faster export and output expansion. Correspondingly,
their assessment of future imbalances and associated risks to the baseline is more subdued that
staff’s. They agreed on the need to reduce the current account deficit in the short term—mainly
through the expected export expansion—as well as on policies to mobilize domestic resources and
foster competitiveness and private investment. They also concurred, however, that in a hypothetical
scenario of protracted progress in export gains, policies to re-profile import demand would be
considered.

OTHER ISSUES
29.
While data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, there continue to be issues
with the quality and timeliness of some key data. Publication of an extensive set of
macroeconomic statistics by the NBE on a timelier basis has been an important positive
development. However, national accounts statistics (especially from the expenditure side) remain
work in progress, and economic growth, saving, and investment estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty—partly due to unreliable input data and survey methodologies. The
authorities are receiving TA from AFRITAC East to build economic monitoring capacity and compile
quarterly national accounts. On the financial sector, staff encouraged the authorities to provide more
detailed information including commercial banks’ income, non-performing loans sectoral
distribution, and loan-loss provisions. The government is working with the largest SOEs to produce
audited financial reports.

30.
The NBE was subject to an update safeguards assessment in 2009.6 The updated
assessment found improved financial reporting and internal audit practices. Notwithstanding these
developments, the assessment noted significant weakness. Recommendations focused on
strengthening oversight of risks and controls, improving accounting records and the external audit
process, and legal amendments to address safeguards weakness in the Central Bank Law. Since then,
some progress has been reported on the outstanding safeguards recommendations, particularly the
establishment of an audit committee, and capacity building for the internal audit function. Staff has
recently received audited financial statements for the previous years together with the management
letters issued by the NBE’s external auditor. A full set of audited financial statements should also be
published on the NBE’s website (Informational Annex).
31.
Ethiopia is encouraged to address the exchange restrictions maintained on current
international transactions at the earliest possible. These relate to: (i) the tax certification
requirement for repatriation of dividends and other investment income; (ii) restrictions on the
repayment of external loans and supplies and foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import
permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the requirement to provide an NBE clearance certificate to
obtain import permits.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The GTP II development priorities provide an appropriate agenda for medium-term
macroeconomic policies with a focus on increased private sector participation. Ethiopia has
achieved rapid and inclusive growth over the last decade, led by agricultural transformation and
public investments in infrastructure. Further progress requires structural reforms to foster marketbased incentives for private investment and human capital accumulation. Thus decisive
implementation of planned reforms to improve competitiveness and attract FDI, increase the
availability of credit and foreign exchange to the private sector, and enhance the efficiency and
transparency of the public sector are key.
33.
In the short term, policies should focus on reducing the external imbalance and its
attendant risks. Export growth is the first best policy to that end. However, in the immediate future,
public projects that require considerable imports and external financing will need to be aligned with
the actual export performance. A restrictive fiscal stance, aiming at under-execution of expenditure
in the 2015/16 budget, would buttress efforts to reduce the current account deficit. A more flexible
exchange rate regime aiming to narrow the substantial real effective exchange rate misalignment
could promote export expansion and diversification, while helping to contain import demand. These
measures would also help to build up the foreign reserve buffer and minimize the risk of potential
disruptive episodes of sharp import compression.

6 The assessment, completed on December 2009, followed up on an initial safeguards assessment from
September 2001.

34.
Mobilization of domestic resources will help narrow the savings-investment gap and
fund growth-enhancing policies. Fiscal revenues could be increased by introducing a property tax
and by reviewing regularly tax incentives and repealing those that are no longer cost-effective.
Ambitious collection targets call for tax administration reforms focusing on expanding taxpayer
coverage and registration, improving the use of data and IT systems, and intensifying risk-based
compliance monitoring. On the broader public sector, ongoing governance reforms of public
companies could increase their profitability and growth contribution. Inclusive financial development
remains essential to mobilize untapped domestic resources and fund investment and growth. Plans
to accelerate development of inter-bank markets, indirect monetary policy instruments, and pricebased allocation of liquidity are welcome—but they will require higher real interest rates. However,
supervisory vigilance and strict provisioning of NPLs will be needed so that that rapid credit growth
does not undermine financial soundness.
35.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but efforts should be strengthened to
address gaps and delays. Ongoing data weaknesses should be addressed, including by
implementing recent Fund technical assistance recommendations on national accounts and balance
of payments. Greater transparency on granular financial stability indicators and on fiscal and public
companies reporting would enhance policymaking as well as surveillance.
36.
The authorities are encouraged to consider accepting the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement in due course. The authorities did not
request and staff does not recommend approval of the exchange restrictions maintained
inconsistent with Article VIII obligations.
37.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

1The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of Fund staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Annex II. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
1.
Ethiopia is a low-income country that is highly dependent on exports of agricultural
commodities and transport services, as well as imports of fuel, capital goods, and currently,
foodstuffs due to the drought. As a result, the economy is sensitive to terms-of-trade and weatherrelated shocks. Although terms-of-trade have recently moved in its favor, Ethiopia's capacity to absorb
adverse trade shocks is highly constrained by the low level of its foreign reserves buffer.
2.
Foreign reserves increased slightly in 2015/16. In November 2015, the NBE acquired a
US$1 billion deposit (from an official bilateral lender), which temporarily boosted reserves and
subsequently partly financed drought-related imports of food as well as other imports. By
end-June 2016, reserves stood at US$3.4 billion covering 1.9 months of prospective
imports—moderately above the previous year level. This increase reflects a change in the NBE’s policy
target to reach a coverage of 3 months of imports (as per national definition1) in the medium term.
The ratio of foreign reserves to broad money has been volatile, and is estimated at about 15 percent
by end-June, 2016.
3.
Ethiopia’s foreign reserves are below model-based optimal benchmarks. A formal reserve
adequacy assessment based on a cost-benefit analysis shows that for a country with a heavily
managed floating exchange rate (classified as a de facto crawl-like arrangement), the optimal reserve
coverage is between 5 and 6.8 months of imports.2 The model evaluates shocks in external demand,
terms of trade, FDI, and aid flows for different cost levels of holding reserves (using the cost of
borrowing as a proxy), and the methodology uses up-to-date data in the panel regression.
Maintaining an insufficient foreign reserve buffer poses concerns that, in case of terms-of-trade,
weather-related, or other shocks, this could force severe import compression, with adverse effects on
economic growth.
4.
In the current policy setting, staff expects that reserve import coverage will remain
below adequate levels (baseline scenario), unless policies are changed to address external
vulnerabilities (alternative scenario). Growth in cargo and passenger transport services as well as
electricity exports, together with a gradual increase in merchandise export volumes, offer some
potential to bolster foreign reserves. However, as demand for capital imports—partly driven by
investment plans—is expected to remain strong, the reserve import coverage is forecasted to remain
below three months in the medium term. The associated risks are mitigated by a tightly controlled
external financial and current account, low external liabilities to private creditors (mainly trade-related
or the outstanding Eurobond), and absence of portfolio investment—which suggest a low risk of
sudden capital outflows. Staff recommends policies aimed at reducing the external current account
deficit and strengthening the foreign reserves buffer.

1 Ethiopian authorities calculate the reserve coverage by deducting food aid and franco-valuta imports from the total.
This methodology results in a reserve coverage of 2.4 months of adjusted imports (i.e., under national definition) at the
end of June 2016. The new reserve target of 3 months of import coverage under the national definition translates into
an import coverage of about 2.5 months under the standard definition.

Annex III. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
The pace of real appreciation of the birr has slowed down significantly in 2015/16. The
NBE continues to adhere to its policy of a gradual depreciation of the birr against the US dollar at a
constant rate. At the same time, however, the US dollar appreciated on average, so that the nominal
effective exchange rate remained stable in 2015–16. Together with a persistent inflation differential
with the Euro zone and other trading partners, this led to a slight appreciation in real effective terms
(see Figure 2).
2.
The Fund’s EBA-lite methodology points to a significant overvaluation of the birr.
Since the start of the GTP I in 2010/11, the current account deficit has widened sharply, whereas the
evolution of fundamentals would have suggested a closing of the gap in recent years (see Figure).
Accordingly, the external balance approach yields an estimated exchange rate overvaluation of
33.2 percent—slightly higher than last year’s 32.5 percent.1
3.
Benchmarking the real effective exchange rate directly against fundamentals supports
the assessment of a considerable overvaluation. Given Ethiopia’s history of overvaluation, the
Fund’s Index Real Exchange Rate methodology, which benchmarks the CPI-based real exchange rate
against a country’s historical average, is of limited use. PPP-based real exchange rates, by contrast,
allow for a cross-country comparison. Figure 2 illustrates the strong log-linear relationship between
the PPP-based real exchange rate and the level of development across countries. Following
Rodrik (2008)2, a linear regression model is used to estimate this equilibrium relationship between
GDP per capita (as a share of US GDP per capita) and the real exchange rate (which reflects the
Balassa-Samuelson effect): based on an annual (1995–2015) sample of all countries, excluding
commodity exporters and small states, a 10 percent increase in GDP per capita typically leads to an
appreciation of 2.9 percent. Therefore, a real exchange rate appreciation of 1 percent annually would
have been in line with Ethiopia’s growth since 2010, whereas the actual appreciation was about
2.5 percent annually. Based on this methodology, the degree of overvaluation is estimated at
36 percent in 2015. Including non-fuel commodity exporters in the sample would yield an
overvaluation of 22 percent.3

1 The assumed elasticity of the current account with respect to the real exchange rate is 7 percent. To account for the
special role of public sector-driven investment, the current account norm is adjusted by 2.9 percent of GDP, the
estimated amount of imports from the public sector (excluding humanitarian goods).
2 “The real exchange rate and economic growth." Brookings papers on economic activity, 2008
3 The preferred specification excludes small states and commodity exporters to avoid an upward bias of equilibrium
exchange rates driven by cases of Dutch disease.

Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the Catastrophe
Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de-facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The authorities
describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange
rate. The pace of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, however, has been stable. The NBE
continues to supply foreign exchange to the interbank market based on plans prepared at the beginning
of each fiscal year, which take into account estimates of supply and demand. The transaction-weighted
average interbank market exchange rate as of August 5, 2016, is Br 21.8943 = US$1.
Ethiopia maintains four restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions,
which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and other investment
income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and suppliers of foreign partners credits;
(iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the requirement to provide a
clearance certificate from the NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions are inconsistent with
Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain unapproved. In addition, In
February 2016, the authorities introduced a regulation providing for the prioritization of foreign
exchange for certain import items and payments. Staff is in the process of assessing this and other
measures introduced by the authorities with respect to their implications to Ethiopia’s obligations under
Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3.
Safeguards Assessment
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was subject to an update safeguards assessment in 2009 (previous
assessment was completed in 2001). The update assessment found improved financial reporting and
internal audit practices. However, weaknesses were noted and recommendations primarily focused on
strengthening oversight of risks and controls, improving accounting records and external audit process,
and legal amendments to address safeguards shortcomings in the Law. Since 2009, the NBE has further
4

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

strengthened its internal audit function through capacity building, and has implemented the
outstanding actions of the 2007 external quality assessment. Some progress has been reported on the
outstanding safeguards recommendations related to legal amendments needed to strengthen NBE's
autonomy. While there have been improvements in financial statement disclosures, they still do not fully
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment also noted that a full set of the
audited financial statements is usually available to the public in hard copy, but the NBE does not publish
the financial statements on its website.
Article IV Consultation
Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No, 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The last consultation was
concluded on September 21, 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 31, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in 2015/16 some data reported
to the Fund were subject to considerable delays and revisions. The existing data weaknesses reflect
capacity constraints and the authorities are seeking to address them through technical assistance (TA).
National Accounts: Deficiencies in the source data and compilation practices affect the accuracy and
reliability of the GDP statistics. Weaknesses are particularly evident in respect to the estimation of
private consumption, saving, investment, and fixed capital formation. The statistical discrepancies
between the expenditure categories and output remain significant. Information provided to the Fund is
subject to discrepancies. Policymaking and surveillance would benefit from improving national
accounts statistics. The authorities have been receiving TA in this area from AFRITAC East.
Government finance statistics: Despite some improvements, the government fiscal statistics continue
to be affected by shortcomings in terms of coverage and outdated reporting standards. Data for the
general government are based on Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 1986. Establishing a
framework for compiling and disseminating Government Finance Statistics (GFS) and public sector debt
statistics that meet GFSM 2001 is an urgent task (in October, the authorities will receive TA in this area
from AFRITAC East). Lack of consolidation of extra-budgetary funds into comprehensive fiscal reporting
hinder proper assessment of the Government’s fiscal stance, savings, and borrowing requirement.
Current financial statements of public enterprises and other information on their operations is not
available.
Monetary statistics: Monetary survey data for commercial banks are subject to revisions and frequent
delays in the reporting to the Fund.
Financial statistics: Aggregate set of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) neglect many core
indicators. In addition, information gaps, e.g.: commercial banks’ income statements, information on
distribution of non-performing loans (NPLs) by sector, NPL provisions, maturity of credit, net open
position, have implications for conducting an assessment of financial sector risks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data require improvements in coverage, valuation, timing,
and classification of current account transactions. Financial and capital account transactions are also
incompletely covered. Data on FDI is based on an estimation method developed by the NBE. An
exploratory survey needs to be conducted to verify the actual investment made in Ethiopia and to
establish the universe of the enterprises with private cross border capital. A survey on cross-border
financial flows and stocks for the private sector should also be undertaken. Full implementation of
BPM6 methodology is recommended.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
Ethiopia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were partially
updated in early 2008. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes has been completed.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego (AFR),
Bob M. Traa (SPR) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the

and the International Development
Association (IDA)

Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate, although external vulnerabilities have
increased. Exports underperformed relative to projections, owing to a weak external environment;
and the supply shock from the drought required scaled-up food imports. Despite strong
remittances and curtailed public sector imports of investment goods, the current account deficit
remains high. Reflecting higher indebtedness and low exports, indicators based on
debt-to-exports ratios have deteriorated and (as in the 2015 DSA) breach one standard threshold
in the baseline. Key considerations in maintaining the moderate rating are: (i) the envisaged
investment-based expansion in re-payment capacity financed by the external borrowing; and
(ii) special factors that mitigate the risk of debt/currency distress episodes including capital
controls, the large share of debt with official creditors with a significant concessional component,
virtual absence of tradeable debt instruments, and limited integration in global markets. The
main risks are a potential continuation of export underperformance and failure to rein in
project-related imports and refrain from associated new non-concessional borrowing. Should
these risks materialize, debt sustainability prospects would deteriorate materially. The projected
baseline path of total public sector debt-to-GDP (external plus domestic debt) does not result in
additional risks beyond those discussed for the external debt above.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Ethiopia's large-scale public investments in infrastructure over recent years have been
largely financed by borrowing, raising public debt. Ethiopia reached the completion point under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 2004 and benefited from debt relief under
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.1 Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt2 fell in the years that followed, reaching a low of 18 percent of GDP in mid-2012. By
end-2015/163 it is estimated at 30.2 percent of GDP and total (including domestic) public debt is
estimated at 54.2 percent of GDP.
2.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared in 2015 raised Ethiopia's risk of
external debt distress from "low" to "moderate". In the baseline scenario, only the present value
of debt-to-exports (PVDE) temporarily breached the 150 percent threshold.4 Ethiopia was
considered a special case of “moderate” risk, for which the use of judgment was warranted. The
growth-enhancing nature of the borrowing plans, was deemed crucial in making sustainable the
relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio of Ethiopia. The probability approach and the inclusion of
remittances confirmed these findings.
3.
In 2015/16, growth slowed down and the current account deficit remained high. Growth
in 2015/16 is estimated at 6.5 percent, a slowdown relative to previous years, owing to a major
drought and a sharply weaker external environment. Export revenue stagnated as pronounced falls
in merchandise export prices (by 11 percent) were only partially offset by an expansion in volumes,
despite significant redirection of exports towards alternative destination markets and development
of new export lines. Savings from lower fuel import prices were more than compensated by large
drought-related food imports and other imports. On the other hand, remittances surged to
US$6¼ billion (9 percent of GDP), exceeding exports of goods and services. Overall, the current
account deficit is estimated to have experienced a small improvement in relation to GDP—from

1
While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with a
few bilateral creditors (Bulgaria, Libya, and FR Yugoslavia) and commercial creditors from Italy, the former
Czechoslovakia, India, and FR Yugoslavia. These outstanding loans (US$382.9 million) accounted for 2 percent of the
debt stock in 2014/15. HIPC terms are assumed for these loans. While negotiations with Russia on outstanding loans
(US$161.6 million) have not been completed, the debt service on these loans is assumed to be given HIPC
comparable treatment.
2
PPG debt includes the foreign debt of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), the debt of the federal government,
regional governments, major state-owned enterprises except Ethiopian Airlines (EAL). EAL meets the criteria for
exclusion set out in the 2013 Staff Guidance Note on the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income
countries (LICS) (Annex 3) because it is run on commercial terms, has a sizeable profit margin (as reflected in audited
accounts published annually), enjoys managerial independence, and borrows without government guarantee.
3

The DSA is based on the Ethiopian fiscal year, which runs from July–June.

4

Based on its 2015 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score (3.4), Ethiopia is classified as a medium
performer. The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40, and 250 percent for the PV of
debt to exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively; a 10 percent band is applied to the thresholds to determine if the
country is a borderline case; and debt service thresholds are 20 and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively.
In the scenarios that include workers’ remittances, the corresponding threshold for the PV of debt to exports and
remittances is 120 percent, and is 16 percent for debt service to exports and remittances; the PV of debt to GDP and
remittances is 36 percent.

12 percent in 2014/15 to 10.7 percent in 2015/16—while remaining, essentially, unchanged in
U.S. dollars.
4.
External financing was provided mainly by foreign direct investments (FDI),
project-related lending, and the central bank. FDI inflows continued strong gains, reaching over
US$3 billion (4.6 percent of GDP). In addition to previously envisaged project financing
disbursements, the NBE received from an official bilateral creditor a US$1 billion deposit, which had
not been anticipated in the 2015 DSA.5 Its proceeds were used to finance drought relief and other
imports and to reinforce foreign exchange reserves.
5.
Ethiopia’s non-concessional commitment ceiling under IDA’s non-concessional
borrowing policy, set at US$0.75 billion for 2015/16, was substantively met. In June 2016, IDA
reviewed Ethiopia's non-concessional borrowing performance for 2015/16. The review concluded
that the limit of US$0.75 billion, which was defined in the previous year, had been substantively met
with new Non-concessional borrowing (NCB) contracting amounting to US$0.775 billion in 2015/16.

OUTLOOK AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
6.
Macroeconomic assumptions reflect the 2015/16 adverse supply shock and the lower
starting base in exports (Box 1). After the 2015/16 slowdown, real GDP growth is projected to
recover to 7.5 percent by 2016/17 and the medium term, converging subsequently towards
6 percent in the longer term. Compared to the 2015 DSA, the time profile of the level of exports has
shifted downwards, reflecting the lower 2015/16 estimate. The medium-term outlook for export
performance will face downside risks if structural reforms lag and competitiveness gains disappoint.
7.
During the 2016 Article IV Consultation discussions, the authorities expressed their
commitment to refrain from new NCB for the time being inasmuch as this borrowing might
deteriorate debt sustainability—the DSA borrowing assumptions reflect this policy. The DSA
includes NCB disbursements of about US$1.5 billion in 2016/17 from existing commitments, but no
additional NCB commitments. WB staff is seeking to set a NCB ceiling consistent with these
projections—unless exports were to perform better than currently envisaged. Also, IDA decided to
continue to provide assistance to Ethiopia on credit terms only in 2016/17, a measure implemented
in 2013/14 as a response to Ethiopia's breaches of the NCB ceiling at that time. The continuation of
this measure is meant to maintain an incentive to restrain non-concessional borrowing
commitments during 2016/17.

5

The US$1 billion deposit has an annual interest rate of 3 percent, a two-year grace period and long-term maturity
(equal annual installments after the grace period). This central bank liability has been included in the stock of public
sector debt considered in this DSA, as required by current guidelines (“Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the
Joint Bank-Fund DSF for LICs,” SM/13/292, section K). It does not fall, however, under the IDA NCB ceiling since IDA
considers that as a central bank-to-central bank transaction it does not carry the risk of IDA cross-subsidizing NCB
from other donors, a main rationale behind the NCB ceiling.

Projections on new indebtedness are also based on the following assumptions:



Non-concessional loan (NCL) disbursements will average about US$1.1 billion per year in the
next five years, and around US$830 million per year over the entire projection period
(FY2016/17−FY2035/36).



The maturity on all new external loans will average 29 years, and 13–16 years for new nonconcessional loans.



The interest rate on all new external loans will average 1.9 percent, and 3–5 percent on new
non-concessional loans.
Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2015/16, 7.5 percent in 2016/17, and at 6 percent over the
longer term. CPI Inflation is projected at 8 percent in the long run. The government primary deficit is
projected to remain at about 2¼ percent of GDP, with gradual progress in tax collection offsetting increased
investment and social spending.
The external current account deficit (before official transfers) is estimated at 12.7 percent of GDP in 2015/16.
Improved export performance, a slowdown in capital goods imports, and steady remittances (although
slowly declining as a ratio to GDP) will lead to a gradual improvement of the deficit over the longer term.
Economic transformation is expected to ameliorate external imbalances, with more dynamic and diversified
exports and a phase down in the imports of capital goods.
Exports of goods and services are expected to decline by 1.7 percent in 2015/16, with gains in export
volumes not enough to compensate lower commodity prices. In future years, a recovery in traditional
exports and development of new exports could raise average growth to 13.2 percent over the next three
years, and sustain growth in the long run. Investments in hydro-power, industrial parks, export processing
zones, and public policies targeting emerging manufactures, food processing, and FDI technology transfers
are expected to support export growth and diversification. Imports of goods and services are estimated to
have increased by 5.7 percent in 2015/16, and are projected to increase by 5.1 percent in 2016/17 from a
high level, due in part to emergency food imports. A slowdown is expected in the longer term but demand
for imported capital goods will remain strong during the remaining four years of the GTP II implementation
period. In the long run, imports are expected to grow in line with domestic output.
Remittances have recently performed strongly, at an estimated 9 percent of GDP in 2015/16, up 28 percent
in dollar terms from the previous year. Projections assume remittances will represent about 3.8 percent of
GDP by 2035/36.
FDI is projected to increase from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2015/16 to 6 percent in the medium term, reflecting
improved competitiveness and policies to attract foreign investment.
The exchange rate is expected to remain determined by the NBE’s crawl-like arrangement, with the real
effective exchange rate remaining constant over time.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A.

Baseline scenario

9.
The 2016 DSA projects external debt to peak as a share of GDP in 2016/17 (Figure 1).
The present value (PV) of PPG external debt increases to 21.9 percent of GDP in 2015/16, and will
marginally increase in 2016/17, to start declining gradually to single digits in the long-run. These
ratios are within the thresholds.
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

10. Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of the PVDE breaches the indicative threshold
(Table 3 and Figure 1). The PVDE ratio is estimated at 255.7 percent in 2015/16. The ratio is
projected to remain above the threshold until 2023/24, when export growth and the declining
borrowing ratio bring the indicator to the 150 percent threshold. No other indicator breaches its
threshold under the baseline scenario, as in the 2015 DSA (Table 1).

B.

Alternative scenarios

11. Under the alternative scenarios with extreme shocks the ratios based on exports
(PV debt-to exports, and debt service-to-exports) exceed the thresholds under an export
shock. In the presence of this shock, the breach of the indicative threshold for the PV
debt-to-exports ratio would last three more years than in the baseline. Under the same
shock to exports, the debt service-to-exports ratio would breach the threshold in two different
periods: in the short term, as exports are still low and Ethiopia has to repay the term-deposit taken
by the NBE, and in 2025, when the outstanding US$1 billion Eurobond matures.
12. Results from the probability approach indicate a similar, although milder, risk than the
standard approach.6 As in the standard approach, the PV debt-to-exports ratio indicator breaches
the threshold in the baseline and in the extreme shock alternative scenario—although for a shorter
period (three years). The debt service-to-exports indicator does not breach the threshold under the
baseline or the most extreme shock scenarios—unlike under the standard approach, where it is
breached under the most extreme shock scenario (Figure 2).
13. The inclusion of remittances also reduces somewhat the severity of threshold breaches.7 In
Ethiopia, rising remittances already play an important role in bolstering external stability. In 2015/16 they
are estimated at 9 percent of GDP, representing 105 percent of exports (goods and services). When
remittances are included in the DSA, the breach of the augmented indicator (namely the ratio of the PV of
debt to exports of goods and services plus remittances) breaches the threshold for 6 years in the baseline
and for 10 years in the extreme shock scenario (Figure 3). The debt service-to-exports (plus remittances)
ratio reaches the threshold in 2025, following a terms-of-trade shock (the most extreme one), again
prompted by the Eurobond redemption.

6
The probability approach is being reported for additional background information. It is not required from a strictly
technical standpoint. The breach of threshold for PV debt-to-exports ratio exceeds the margins established by the
guidelines for a borderline case (±5 percent of threshold).
7

The effect of the inclusion of remittances is reported for additional background information. Its reporting is not
required from a strictly technical standpoint since the average remittances of the last three years do not exceed
10 percent of GDP as indicated in the guidelines (although in 2015/16, at 9 percent of GDP, they come very close to
the threshold). Remittances exceed the threshold indicated in the guidelines of 20 percent of exports.

Assessment

14. The external debt sustainability tests confirm that exports are key to ensure external
sustainability. The dollar value of exports (goods and services) has almost tripled in the last decade.
But despite this rapid growth, export revenue remains low relative to the indebtedness necessary to
finance the level of imports required by the authorities’ far-reaching investment plans.
Correspondingly, expanding presence in existing export markets and rapid diversification into new
products and markets constitutes the linchpin in the authorities’ development strategy.
15. Several factors mitigate external debt sustainability risks, and argue for retaining the
current “moderate” rating. The DSA methodology calls for the use of judgment in interpreting the

6

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

mechanical test results. The following considerations mitigate the breach of the export-related
thresholds:


The high level of debt relative to exports is directly associated to sizable initial investments
aimed at boosting export competitiveness and domestic supply, which are expected to
generate high returns. The main sectors benefiting from the debt-financed investment include
energy supply, merchandise transportation, and other priority infrastructure with large
expected impact on output. These investments have large up-front costs, but produce sizable
and lasting improvements in export competitiveness and hence in Ethiopia’s capacity to repay
its debt. In the short term (when the PV of debt-to-exports ratio indicator breaches the
threshold because of the lagged export response) projected debt service is deemed
manageable.



Includes US$1 billion deposit in the NBE.

The probability of debt distress or “sudden stop” episodes is moderated by specific factors:
About 70 percent of Ethiopia’s external debt is with official creditors, with a significant
concessional component (Table 2). The rest is largely trade and other credit linked to external
commercial operations of internationally active public corporations (e.g., Ethiopian Airlines,
Ethio Telecom). Strict capital controls and administrative controls on current account operations
are in place; the Birr is not traded internationally; and there is virtually no portfolio investment or
market-tradeable debt—the only exception being the 2015 US$1 billion Eurobond, which has
9 years remaining maturity and thus does not pose a refinancing risk at this time. While staff
advises a phased liberalization of external operations, this would in any case be implemented
gradually, posing little immediate risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

16. The outlook, however, presents potentially severe risks if exports disappoint relative to
projections, and if non-concessional borrowing were to exceed DSA assumptions—which would
materially worsen debt sustainability prospects. While the test breached in this DSA was already
breached in the 2015 DSA, the extent of the breached has increased. This is mainly the result of a
weakening of the external environment (which is expected to stabilize in 2016/17) and of high imports
largely due to drought-related external food purchases. This kept the current account deficit wide and
raised debt. The assessment above is posited on significant export growth as identified projects with high
export potential come on line (electrical railway link to Djibouti, electricity generation capacity, and Hawassa
and other industrial parks, among other); prioritization of investment projects with high import content;
and strict adherence to the authorities’ borrowing plans described above. Should these projections fail to
materialize, debt sustainability prospects and DSA indicators could significantly worsen.
17. The authorities argued for the maintenance of a moderate rating and expressed their
intention to refrain from any additional borrowing that could deteriorate debt sustainability. From
their standpoint, Ethiopia’s debt sustainability was firmly supported by the use of the borrowed funds
exclusively for investment projects with expected high growth returns—rather than for current
spending—and by their careful monitoring of public sector indebtedness, among other things to forestall
any other uses. The authorities stated their commitment to refrain from pursuing any additional loans that
could deteriorate the sustainability of external debt, including some new commercial (non-concessional)
loans that had previously been under consideration. Also, the authorities argued that the US$1 billion
deposit in the NBE should not be considered debt for the purposes of the DSA—as it was unrelated to
fiscal operations—and that the debt of Ethio Telecom should likewise be excluded from the DSA. Staff
explained that under current joint IMF/WB guidelines, central bank external liabilities must be included in
the DSA public debt,8 as they represent a claim on the country’s external resources not substantially
different from government debt for DSA purposes. Regarding the debt of Ethio Telecom, staff stands ready
to consider its exclusion if conditions stated in the DSA guidelines are met. However, an essential
component for this consideration would be the availability of current financial accounts (only accounts
through 2012 are available at this time), audited by commercial financial auditors—since the state audit’s
focus is mainly on compliance with the law and not on the company’s underlying financial situation. The
availability of such current audited financial accounts would also be a necessary condition for
Ethio Telecom to be able to borrow commercially on the strength of its own balance sheet and profitability,
and not on explicit or implicit government guarantees.

D.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis

18. In the baseline, the projected path of total public sector debt-to-GDP does not result in
additional risks beyond those discussed in the external debt sustainability section (Table 5,
Figure 4). As in the 2015 DSA, total public debt remains within the standard thresholds, while
declining gradually in the medium and long term. This is the result of output growth and the
eventual tapering of large public investment projects after the five-year GTP II. In addition to

“Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income
Countries,” SM/13/292, section K.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

external debt, discussed above, domestic public debt reached 24 percent of GDP in 2015/16 (from
22.4 percent in 2014/15). About 45 percent of it corresponds to the central government, mostly to
the NBE reflecting direct advances to finance the budget (60.5 percent of central government debt),
and treasury bills (33.6 percent). State-own enterprises (SOEs) hold 55 percent of total domestic
debt which is all issued in the form of bonds and loans provided by the state-owned Commercial
Bank of Ethiopia. Financial soundness and stability indicators do not point to domestic debt
servicing difficulties by SOEs.
19. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio remains below the threshold in the baseline. However, as in
the 2015 DSA, there is a three-year threshold breach under the extreme shock (a one-time
depreciation) scenario. This is due to the relatively high initial external debt, as discussed above.
Nevertheless, the assumed shock of a large sudden depreciation (a “currency crisis”) is unlikely, as
discussed above. Also, the historical scenario shows that an indefinite continuation of the past and
present public investment drive—which is not currently envisaged by staff or the authorities—would
be unsustainable.
20. Over the medium and long term, however, gradual reversal of the favorable interest
rate-growth differential would require public sector measures to accommodate higher
financial costs. As in most developing countries, the interest rate-growth differential in Ethiopia is
negative, reflecting high growth but also distorted interest rates (particularly on domestic liabilities
and external concessional borrowing). In Ethiopia, tightly controlled financial markets contribute to
these distortions. Financial development and increasing private sector participation will likely result
in an upward drift in real interest rates over time. While this process would enhance growth and
opportunities to mobilize additional resources, it would also require deliberate public finance
policies to create the necessary space for higher financial costs to the budget and broader public
sector.

E.

Conclusion

21. Despite some deterioration in external debt sustainability indicators, Ethiopia’s risk of
external debt distress remains "moderate." The current pace in acquisition of external liabilities
and export levels, if maintained over time, would result in an unsustainable external position. This
risk, however, is mitigated by its temporary nature and by the envisaged expansion in productive
and exporting capacity as a result of ongoing infrastructure investment with high expected
returns—partly financed by the increased indebtedness. The structure of external debt (mainly
official credit, often concessional), existing administrative controls on imports and capital controls
additionally reduce the risk of severe external stress episodes. The main risks are a potential
continuation of export underperformance and failure to rein in project-related imports and refrain
from associated new non-concessional borrowing. Should these risks materialize, debt sustainability
prospects would deteriorate materially. In the event of tighter external financing conditions, the
authorities would need to resort to further import compression—which although less disruptive
than an episode of external debt distress, could entail severe negative growth effects.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ms. Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for The Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Ms. Gloria Gasasira-Manzi, Advisor to the
Executive Director
September 26, 2016

1.
The Ethiopian authorities value the engagement with the Fund and thank staff for the
constructive dialogue, during the 2016 Article IV mission, which continues to inform
implementation of the country’s macroeconomic policy and development agenda. The
authorities broadly agree with staff’s balanced assessment of the economic challenges and
priorities for Ethiopia in the short and medium term.
2.
The Ethiopian economy which is one of the fastest growing economies in Sub Saharan
Africa has achieved tremendous social and economic gains with increasingly inclusive and
employment-generating growth realized in recent years. The second Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP II), which was launched in October 2015 builds on this progress to
guide the national development policy priorities for the next five years, 2015/16–2019/20. The
key objective of the GTP II is to maintain rapid, sustainable and broad-based growth in a stable
macroeconomic environment conducive for investment and international competitiveness. The
plan envisions transforming the Ethiopian economy into lower middle income status by 2025.
Recent Economic Developments
3.
In FY 2015/16, the economy continued to exhibit strong growth supported by prudent
macroeconomic management and productivity-enhancing reforms. In this context, economic
activity is estimated to have expanded by 6.5 percent mainly underpinned by growth in
manufacturing, construction and service sectors. Economic momentum was, however,
dampened by the negative impact of a weaker global environment and severe weather
conditions which affected agriculture in some parts of the country.
4.
This notwithstanding, the investments made to build resilience in agriculture over time,
coupled with pragmatic and timely interventions by the authorities, minimized the impact of the
El- Niño induced drought. The authorities have over the past two decades invested in improving
agricultural practices, including through commercial farming, training, technology, irrigation
schemes for smallholder farmers and infrastructure development. This has resulted in more
resilient and interconnected communities and complemented government’s actions to mitigate
the impact of the drought through provision of substantial resources and food aid with the help
of the international community and regional states. These interventions were in addition to the
ongoing Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) successfully implemented in close
collaboration with development partners.

2

5.
Fiscal policy implementation has remained prudent, with expenditure and tax revenues
broadly in line with the annual budget plan. The general government deficit estimated at
3 percent of GDP, is consistent with targeted levels for the fiscal year. Drought related
expenditures were largely met by tapping into reserves accumulated in the oil stabilization fund.
This ensured that there was no need to shift resources within the budget and pro-poor
development activities were protected.
6.
The authorities maintained a tight monetary policy stance in order to keep inflation
within the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE)’s target of single digit inflation. After peaking at
11.9 percent in September 2015, headline inflation receded to 5.9 percent in August 2016.
Financial intermediation continues to advance, with a 25.2 percent increase in bank branch
openings and a 19.3 percent annual growth of bank deposits as at the end of the fiscal year.
7.
The current account deficit for 2015/16 was US$ 7.06 billion representing a decline
from 12 percent of GDP in the preceding year to 10 percent. Notwithstanding the decline in
commodity export earnings and increased imports of food, capital and intermediate goods, the
increase in export volumes and the strong remittances had a moderating effect on the current
account. In addition, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows, in response to the ongoing
investment promotion initiatives, provided strong impetus to the financial account of the
balance of payments.
Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
Fiscal Policy
8.
The authorities remain committed to prudent fiscal policy and maintaining the deficit at
less than 3 percent of GDP. The 2016/17 budget, in line with the GTP II priorities, continues to
focus on attaining the key objectives under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which
is one of the major ambitions of the authorities’ five-year plan. Expenditure to growthenhancing infrastructure and social developments largely remain a priority, with about twothirds of spending having a strong pro-poor focus.
9.
Efforts in domestic resource mobilization are being enhanced to support development
spending and maintain fiscal sustainability. Although tax revenues have steadily grown over
time, the authorities are determined to achieve their medium term target of tax-to-GDP of over
17 percent. Efforts to strengthen tax administration and streamline tax policies to simplify
procedures, update tax brackets as well as other measures to improve capacity, technology and
tax compliance are being stepped up. The authorities are mindful of the financial implication of
tax incentives and for this reason, they are mainly used to support export promotion, and are
time-bound and performance-based to ensure their effectiveness.
10.
Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate and my authorities are
committed to maintaining debt at sustainable levels. In this regard, the authorities intend to

3

refrain from any new non-concessional debt for the time being to the extent that it threatens debt
sustainability. Moreover, a significant scale up of financing in the near term is not anticipated
as most of the investments commenced in previous years and are expected to materialize in the
near and medium term. The debt contracted by the Ethiopian authorities is directly associated
with significant growth-enhancing public investments aimed at boosting export competitiveness
and expected to generate high returns. The authorities are confident that critical infrastructure,
like the energy projects, transportation and industrial parks some of which have already started
operations will strengthen the country’s export and tax revenues. In addition, state owned
enterprises are being managed in a manner that ensures they are self-sufficient. In this regard, a
new ministry has been created with the mandate to streamline public enterprises and improve
their governance and efficiency. Further to their efforts to boost domestic resource mobilization,
the authorities are working on a regulatory framework for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).
11.
The authorities maintain a well-coordinated and centralized management of public funds
including extra budgetary funds, which are all monitored and audited. In addition, reforms
pertaining to the roll out of program budgeting and IFMIS as well as cash management in
preparation for the development of a Single Treasury Account are progressing well. Capacity
building and civil service reforms envisaged in the GTP II are expected to enhance institutional
and human development at all administrative levels.
Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
12.
Monetary policy is aimed at maintaining price and exchange rate stability so as to create
a macroeconomic environment that is conducive for strong and sustained economic growth.
Inflation is expected to remain in single digits in the medium term as reserve money stays in
line with nominal GDP and government borrowing remains consistent with monetary policy
objectives. The NBE is working on establishing a secondary market for government securities
to effectively pursue indirect policy instruments in its monetary policy operations. To further
strengthen its monetary policy framework, a forecasting team has been set up under the
Economic Modeling and Statistical Analysis Directorate to improve liquidity monitoring and
forecasting.
13.
The exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015/16 and the NBE assesses that any
potential overvaluation of the birr against the US dollar in 2015/16 would be less than 10
percent. Against this background and recognizing the benefits of a flexible exchange rate, the
NBE continues to pursue a gradual depreciation of the birr given the weak export
responsiveness to real effective exchange rate movements but yet pronounced pass through into
inflation. In addition, the authorities are working towards strengthening the foreign reserves
buffer, with the NBE targeting 3 months of prospective imports.
14.
The financial sector remains healthy characterized by an increase in banking, insurance
and microfinance branches; expansion in savings as a result of the creation of new instruments;
and an expansion of credit to the private sector. The NBE continues to promote greater access to

4

finance and financial inclusion initiatives. New products such as electronic, mobile and agent
banking services are being introduced and regulated by the NBE. With this rapid pace of
expansion, the NBE will continue to strengthen its surveillance and monitoring tools to ensure
that the sector remains sound and stable. In addition, the NBE will also closely monitor the
Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) of the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), notwithstanding
their provisioning requirement in the NBE’s Asset Classification and Provisioning for
Development Finance Institutions Directives to maintain 100 percent provisioning of NPLs.
Structural Reforms
15.
Structural reforms continue with a focus on diversification of the economy, agricultural
transformation and industrialization. In this regard, an export-led industrial development
strategy has been developed to support a shift from reliance on traditional commodity to high
value and diversified goods and services. In addition, government has developed a 10-year
National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan with the objective of enhancing the contribution of
tourism to economic development.
16.
The authorities recognize the importance of private sector participation in the
development process and are promoting an environment conducive for investment and private
sector development. The government has developed industrial parks and clusters to boost FDI
and private investment in key sectors. To this end, the Industrial Park Development Corporation
(IPDC) has been set up with the responsibility of facilitating and removing bureaucratic
bottlenecks that hinder production and capacity of both export and import substitution
industries. In addition, efforts to increase access to credit through the DBE and improve the
ease of doing business have been intensified. Moreover, increasing investments in various
infrastructure development projects in power generation, telecom, transportation especially the
Ethio-Djibouti railways and other logistical services are expected to reduce production costs and
enhance overall productivity and competitiveness.
Statistics
17.
With support from development partners including the Fund, the authorities have made
progress in data compilation and dissemination. The quality of the national accounts and overall
statistics continues to improve. Going forward, the authorities have a comprehensive plan to
further strengthen the national statistics agency to improve its economic monitoring capacity.
With respect to agricultural statistics, an assessment of the Agricultural Statistics System in
Africa by the African Development Bank in 2014 concluded that Ethiopia emerges as the
country best equipped to run an effective and efficient agricultural statistics system to produce
timely, reliable and sustainable statistics.

5

Conclusion
18.
The authorities remain committed to sustain efforts aimed at structurally transforming
the economy to address emerging vulnerabilities and build resilience to exogenous shocks in
pursuit of strong and inclusive growth. As part of the agricultural development strategy and the
Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy, measures to strengthen resilience of the
agricultural sector to weather shocks are being scaled up. In addition, the increased focus on
exports is in line with efforts to address some of the emerging macroeconomic imbalances and
attendant risks as the authorities pursue their ambitious growth strategy. The authorities
appreciate the Fund’s policy advice and technical assistance which remain vital as they proceed
with implementation of their development agenda under the GTPII.
