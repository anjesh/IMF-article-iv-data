VIETNAM
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Vietnam
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Anthony R. Boote
August 28, 2007

•

This report is based on discussions held in Hanoi during June18–27. The staff team
comprised Mr. Molho (Head), Ms. Tumbarello (both APD), Mr. Ahmed (PDR), and Mr. Sacasa
(MCM). The team was assisted by Mr. Lee (senior resident representative). Messrs. Warjiyo
and Raman (OED) participated in the discussions.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on October 25, 2006. (A summary of the
Executive Board discussion can be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2006/pn06129.htm). This year, the staff and the
authorities largely agreed that the main priorities for Vietnam’s policies should be to contain
inflation, protect financial stability, advance banking system reforms, and ensure medium-term
debt sustainability. Differences of view principally related to the pace of implementation of
adjustment measures and reforms in some of the above areas.

•

Economic statistics: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, but
shortcomings in key areas, especially in the financial sector, hamper the staff’s analysis.

•

Exchange rate regime: Vietnam has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and
4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions maintained for security reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Vietnam’s exchange rate regime is currently
classified as a conventional peg under the IMF’s classification system.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The economic landscape since the last consultation has been dominated by WTO
accession and a dramatic boom in the stock market. Vietnam has now emerged on
to the world stage as one of the most attractive investment destinations. However,
growing exposure to global markets has complicated macroeconomic management
and heightened the urgency of reform in state-controlled industries.

•

Overall macroeconomic performance remains strong. Real GDP is projected to
grow by more than 8 percent in 2007. Surging FDI and portfolio capital inflows have
led to a sharp increase in reserves, fueling rapid growth in bank liquidity.

•

Inflation has picked up to 8.4 percent (y/y) as of July 2007. While rising world
commodity prices are a factor, tightening capacity constraints are also in evidence.

•

The fiscal deficit was contained to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2006, but it seems set to
widen to 6½–7 percent of GDP in 2007–08.

•

Credit growth picked up to 35 percent (y/y) as of May 2007. To contain inflation
and forestall a possible stock price bubble, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has
raised bank reserve requirements and tightened controls on share-related lending.

•

The authorities plan to step up equitization of state-owned commercial banks
(SOCBs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, new SOE-dominated
financial-industrial groups could pose challenges for bank regulation and supervision.

Key issues and staff recommendations
•

The short-term outlook is positive, but demand pressures need to be contained to
promote sustainable growth. To rein in credit growth, the recent increase in reserve
requirements needs to be supported by strong efforts to absorb excess bank liquidity.

•

The level of the dong seems broadly in line with the maintenance of external
stability. However, a more flexible exchange rate could improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy, and buffer the economy from the effects of volatile capital flows.

•

Fiscal consolidation is essential to promote disinflation and medium-term debt
sustainability, and create space for countercyclical fiscal policies in the future.

•

Reforms to improve the governance of SOEs need to be accelerated to improve
the quality of investment and growth and facilitate fiscal consolidation.

•

To protect financial stability, bank supervision and transparency requirements
in the stock market need to be further strengthened.

WTO accession has further
improved Vietnam’s economic prospects,
but has also given rise to new challenges.
Growing access to foreign markets and a
continuing opening up of the economy can be
expected to yield significant benefits
(Box 1).1 Capital inflows have contributed to
a decline in domestic-currency bond yields
and a boom in the stock market, boding well
for the financing of Vietnam’s investment
needs. However, portfolio capital flows are
posing complex challenges for macroeconomic
management. Increasing global competition
will also call for faster market-oriented reforms
in the state-dominated sectors of the economy.

GDP rose by 8.2 percent in 2006, led by continued rapid growth in exports
(Figure 1). Despite lackluster performance by the state sector, industrial activity,
retail sales, and trade data point to a sustained strong expansion so far in 2007.

•

However, inflation has crept up to 8.4 percent (y/y) in July. This pick-up is due
partly to rising food and world commodity prices, and overdue adjustments in
administered prices.2 However, Vietnam’s core inflation has remained stubbornly
high, compared with other countries in the region (Figure 2). Shortages of skilled
labor, increases in the minimum wage, and strong demand for housing and
construction materials also appear to be pushing up prices.

•

The balance of payments remains sound. Import growth picked up to 30 percent (y/y)
during the first seven months of 2007, but high oil prices and booming non-oil exports
helped to restrain the current account deficit. With buoyant FDI and portfolio inflows,
official reserves rose from $11.5 billion at end-2006 to $19 billion (3½ months of next
year’s imports of goods and services) in May 2007 (Figures 3 and 4).

•

Vietnam’s stock market experienced an unprecedented boom in late 2006 and
early 2007. The Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) Stock Market Price Index rose by
144.5 percent in 2006, and by another 51 percent in early 2007, before receding by
about 20 percent during March–July. Improved market confidence following WTO
accession, a rapid expansion of the number of listed companies, and foreign

Electricity tariffs were raised by 8 percent in January 2007, and gasoline prices were liberalized in May.
However, the government has recently decided to postpone adjustments in coal and fertilizer prices previously
planned for the second half of the year, reduced tariffs on some imported food products and intermediate inputs
effective August 8, 2007, and advanced the introduction of WTO-mandated tariff reductions on imported cars.

Despite increased sterilization, the growth of credit to the economy picked up
from 25 percent in 2006 to 35 percent (y/y) as of end-May 2007, with joint-stock
banks recording the fastest credit growth. Reserve requirements on bank deposits
were virtually doubled from June 2007 (to a range of 4 to 10 percent). However, with
bank liquidity remaining ample, interbank rates rose only for a brief period in June,
and subsequently reverted to the low levels recorded in previous months (Figure 5).

•

The overall fiscal deficit was lower than budgeted in 2006, but the fiscal stance
appears set to be eased in 2007. A better-than-expected revenue outturn, together
with slow implementation of off-budget investment plans, helped to compress the
overall deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, if the government fully implements
its plans for 2007, the fiscal deficit could widen to well over 7 percent of GDP in
2007, with the non-oil deficit rising by at least 1–1½ percentage points of GDP.

•

Vietnam officially maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime, but the
dong has been pegged de facto to the U.S. dollar over the last few years. The
dong/U.S. dollar rate depreciated by 1.3 percent in 2006, and by another 0.3 percent
during the first seven months of 2007. In January 2007, in the face of large capital
inflows, the trading band of the dong was widened from ±0.25 percent to ±0.5 percent
around the SBV’s daily reference rate, and the dong was allowed to appreciate
modestly. However, this appreciation has been more than reversed since March.

•

The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) of the dong has depreciated by
about 8 percent since end-2005, but the real effective exchange rate (REER) has
been broadly stable, and remains close to its long-run average.

C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
4.
The near-term outlook remains favorable. GDP is projected to expand by about
8¼ percent in 2007–08, underpinned by strong growth in exports, investment, and private
consumption. The average rate of inflation would rise to 7½–8 percent, as higher food prices
and nonfuel commodity prices compound the impact of tightening capacity constraints. The
current account deficit would widen to 3¼ percent of GDP, but it would be more than
financed by ODA and private capital inflows.

Vietnam has good prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction over
the medium term, provided that the
Vietnam: HP Estimate of Deviation from GDP Trend
government can rein in demand
pressures. As illustrated in the staff’s
medium-term scenario, a soft landing
should be feasible if the SBV can slow
credit growth in line with the stated
official objectives; the real effective
exchange rate of the dong is placed on a
path of slow appreciation; the overall
fiscal deficit declines slowly from
7 percent of GDP, in line with official
projections; and the non-oil deficit peaks at 14¾ percent of GDP in 2007–08, and falls to
10¾ percent of GDP by 2012.

6.
Under these assumptions, GDP growth would edge down to slightly below
8 percent in 2011–12, thus moving closer in line with the economy’s potential. Inflation
could be placed on a declining trend from 2008 onwards as WTO-mandated tariff reductions
help contain pressures on the prices of tradables and divert demand to imports. The current
account deficit would edge up to around 3½ percent of GDP over the medium term, but it
would continue to be more than financed by FDI and other private inflows.

13
7.
The staff’s updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), as elaborated in
Supplement 2, suggests that Vietnam’s external debt situation would remain benign
under the baseline, provided that external borrowing policies remain prudent. The ratio
of external debt to GDP would fall below 30 percent over the medium term, while the debt
service-to-exports ratio would remain below 5 percent. The stock of total public debt would
remain on an upward trend, rising from 43½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 48½ percent of GDP
in 2012. However, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would be contained to 14–15 percent.
8.

This favorable outlook is subject to risks.

•

Large capital inflows in the context of the de facto peg of the dong could prevent
an effective tightening of monetary policy. Inflation could remain on an upward
trend, possibly rising to double-digits by 2009–10. More rapid appreciation of the real
exchange rate could then lead to losses in competitiveness, and a more significant
widening of the current account deficit, which could, in time, threaten external
sustainability and undermine investor confidence. Eventually, belated introduction of
needed adjustment measures could lead to sharp falls in investment and growth.

•

Unchecked credit growth, together with a weak regulatory environment, could
also threaten financial system stability. Despite the recent correction, there are still
risks associated with possible volatility in stock prices, and a reversal of portfolio
inflows. To the extent that bank borrowers have taken on large stock market-related
risks, and unhedged foreign-currency loans on the expectation of continued exchange
rate stability, there could be fall-out on the soundness of some banks.

•

On the fiscal front, key risks would stem from large increases in public wages
and pensions, heavy on-lending to SOEs, and/or falling oil-related revenues.
Lack of fiscal adjustment could, in turn, compound pressures on inflation and the
external current account, and lead to rapid accumulation of public debt. Some of these
risks are highlighted in the DSA, under alternative scenario A2, which illustrates that,
if the primary balance were to remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio, the debt-torevenue ratio, and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would all rise sharply. To protect
debt sustainability, the government could eventually have to curtail investment or
social outlays, thus undermining growth and poverty reduction.

•

Insufficient improvement in banking sector and SOE governance, and continued
state-sector dominance of key industries, could pose additional risks. Sub-optimal
lending and investment by these sectors would weaken the efficiency of investment
and possibly place additional future burdens on the budget.
II. KEY CHALLENGES AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS

9.
Against this background, the main policy challenges that Vietnam needs to
address are:

14
•

Adapting monetary and exchange rate policies to contain inflation and protect
external stability;

•

Strengthening the regulatory framework in the financial system to take full advantage
of the developing capital market, while reducing associated risks and vulnerabilities;

•

Moving ahead with banking system reforms to foster competition and efficiency,
while reinforcing prudential supervision to ensure bank soundness;

•

Pursuing fiscal consolidation to counter potential adverse effects of capital inflows,
contain the current account deficit, and promote medium-term debt sustainability;

•

Placing SOE reforms on a faster track to enable SOEs to meet the challenges of
global competition, and decrease their reliance on the budget.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

10.
The authorities are wary of rising inflation, and they have taken welcome steps
to tighten monetary conditions. With liquidity continuing to be fueled by rising reserves,
the SBV took the bold step of doubling reserve requirements on bank deposits from June
2007, while also increasing its sales of SBV bills. However, the extent of sterilization has
been insufficient to slow credit growth. Although interbank rates rose initially in response to
the increase in reserve requirements, they have since fallen back to the low levels reached in
April-May. The authorities recognize that further action will likely be required in the period
ahead to slow the growth of money and credit, and they are ready to step up the issuance of
SBV bills. Sterilization is not considered to be costly at this point, as open market operations
(OMO) rates have so far remained lower than rates of return on official reserves.
11.
In the staff’s view, Vietnam’s balance of payments is basically sound, and the
level of the exchange rate is broadly consistent with the maintenance of external
stability (Box 2). However, the maintenance of a broadly stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar has resulted in a significant depreciation of the NEER as the dollar weakened visà-vis other major currencies over the last year, and the SBV’s intervention policies have
complicated monetary management.
12.
In this context, the staff argued that this is a propitious time for a move toward a
more flexible exchange rate regime. In the face of continuing large inflows, greater
flexibility of the exchange rate would serve to stem inflationary pressures while decreasing
the need for intervention and sterilization. Increasing two-way flexibility would also help
foster the development of markets for derivatives, encourage better hedging of exchange rate
risks, and allow the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber in the event of future reversal of
capital inflows. A more flexible exchange rate would also be an essential element of the
authorities’ planned move toward the adoption of an inflation-targeting (IT) regime.

15
13.
The authorities noted that the government’s roadmap for exchange system
liberalization envisaged progressive increases in exchange rate flexibility. They agreed
that, as the economy becomes more open to capital flows, allowing two-way flexibility in the
exchange rate would introduce a higher degree of risk in foreign exchange operations, which
could help to discourage one-way bets on the exchange rate. However, they were also
mindful of the need to protect competitiveness, encourage exports, and contain the trade
deficit. Given the economy’s increasing exposure to the risk of reversal of capital inflows,
and the SBV’s moderate level of reserves, they considered it prudent to continue to build
their reserve cushion, and were inclined to maintain a cautious pace of change in their current
exchange rate and intervention policies.
B. Financial Sector Issues
Reducing vulnerabilities associated with the stock market
14.
The authorities have relied on prudential measures to cool down the market,
and have so far ruled out recourse to capital controls. In January, banks were required to
phase out their lending to their securities company affiliates within one year, and the risk
weight of securities-related loans was raised from 100 percent to 150 percent. In June, banks
were required to contain their securities-related credit to less than 3 percent of total loans
outstanding, with banks above this limit required to comply by end-2007. Banks were also
required to report monthly to the SBV their exposures to such credit, with those exceeding
the cap subject to closer monitoring. The team supported these initiatives. It also advised the
authorities to thoroughly assess potential weaknesses in highly-exposed banks to determine
any possible needs for supervisory action, and to apply adequate standards and procedures to
better manage foreign exchange, interest rate, and liquidity risks. Securities market exposures
are so far concentrated in smaller joint-stock banks. Given that all SOCBs (which account for
nearly 70 percent of bank assets) are reported as below the 3 percent cap, further measures
may be needed to ensure that they do not unduly increase securities-related lending.
15.
The authorities are keen to improve securities market regulation. A new
Securities Law came into force in 2007, and the State Securities Commission (SSC) has
strengthened enforcement of disclosure and transparency requirements on listed companies.
However, the SSC is facing serious capacity constraints, and its salary structure makes it
difficult for it to attract and retain a sufficient number of adequately-qualified staff. In
addition, the existing legislation includes weak penalties against insider trading, and there are
concerns that the stock market can be easily used for money laundering.
Banking sector reform and supervision
16.
Important steps are under way to open up the banking system in line with WTO
commitments. A decree issued in April clarified conditions for foreign participation in
domestic banks, and raised the maximum share of individual strategic investors in each bank
from 10 percent to 15 percent (or 20 percent with the Prime Minister’s permission). In

16
addition, since mid-June 2007, foreign banks can apply for the establishment of wholly
owned subsidiaries, and a number of such applications have been submitted to the SBV.
17.
The stock market listing and partial privatization (equitization) of SOCBs has
recently been placed on a faster track. The government is injecting VND 11 trillion
(US$0.7 billion or about 1 percent of GDP) to the SOCBs set for stock market listing to
enable them to meet the SBV’s capital adequacy requirements. Three of the banks have hired
major international banks to assist them in appraising assets, planning IPOs, and selecting
strategic investors, and the IPOs are now slated for late 2007 or early 2008. The mission
welcomed these steps, and stressed the need to offer adequate scope and incentives for
participation by foreign strategic investors to ensure that equitization will bring about needed
improvement in SOCBs’ corporate governance. The team questioned whether the recent
capital infusions would suffice to restore the SOCBs’ capital adequacy under realistic
provisioning. The authorities noted that, while the current provisioning was based on
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the use of IFRS would have an ambiguous effect on the
capital adequacy of SOCBs, as it would require a marking to market of real estate and equity
holdings now accounted for at acquisition cost. Pending the equitizations, the mission urged
the authorities to allow SOCB managers to make lending decisions based on purely
commercial criteria.
18.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan to convert the SBV into a modern,
more independent central bank. Following equitization, the responsibility for exercising
the government’s ownership rights on SOCBs will be transferred from the SBV to the State
Investment Capital Corporation (SCIC), thereby removing the conflict of interest that has
hitherto constrained SBV’s bank supervision. New draft laws on the SBV, Credit Institutions,
Deposit Insurance, and Bank Supervision are to be submitted for consideration by the
National Assembly beginning in 2008. In the meantime, the SBV will strive to improve
coordination among its various departments in the conduct of bank supervision. In addition,
the SBV, the SSC, and the Ministry of Finance need to improve the tracking of transactions
among banks, their securities company affiliates, and the buyers or issuers of securities. The
team expressed concern about the risks posed by related-party transactions within SOE
groups involved in a mix of industrial operations and financial services. The authorities
explained that, under existing regulations, each nonfinancial company can hold no more than
a 20 percent stake in at most one bank, and banks are not allowed to make any loans to their
principal shareholders. The authorities considered these provisions adequate to prevent
inappropriate related-party transactions.
C.

Ensuring Fiscal Consolidation and Debt Sustainability

19.
The authorities and the staff agreed that the risk of inflation calls for a more
cautious fiscal stance. The team recommended that any unanticipated additional revenue
resulting from rising income, improved tax administration and higher oil prices should be
saved in 2007, and the funding of SOE projects through the issuance of sovereign bonds

17
postponed. The authorities have decided to postpone wage increases previously planned for
October. However, the government attaches great importance to removing Vietnam’s
infrastructure bottlenecks, as this is essential to encourage FDI and promote growth.4 In this
context, the authorities intend to use any revenue windfalls for the implementation of
additional investment projects. Even so, they expect that under-execution of approved
projects would likely keep the fiscal deficit to a level below the staff’s projection.
20.
The need to protect medium-term debt sustainability will require a concerted
effort to bolster revenues and curb expenditure growth. The authorities recognize that the
import tariff reductions following WTO accession, together with pressures to align corporate
income tax rates with those of regional competitors, call for stepped up efforts to protect nonoil revenues. The team recommended that existing tax reform plans be revisited, and tax
administration strengthened, including by expediting the establishment of a Large Taxpayer
Unit. Moreover, to contain the government’s wage bill and pension liabilities, the indexation
of public wages and pensions to the common minimum wage should be discontinued, and a
more differentiated and merit-based salary structure adopted instead. While slowing public
investment growth is likely to be a challenge, projects funded through investment bond issues
or on-lending should be screened more rigorously, and the loan appraisal and risk
management capacities of the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) strengthened.
III. SOE REFORM, DATA ISSUES, AND OTHER MATTERS
21.
The government’s reform strategy in the SOE sector continues to be centered on
broadening the process of partial privatization through equitization. The recent boom in
the stock market had created a propitious environment for a stepped up pace of equitization,
and the government has decided to expand the range of SOEs to be equitized, including in
strategic industrial sectors and public services. A major insurance company (Bao Viet)
recently carried out an IPO, and a number of other large SOEs are slated to be equitized in
the second half of 2007 or early 2008, depending on conditions in the equity market.
However, the role of foreign strategic investors is to be determined on a case-by-case basis,
and it remains to be seen whether they will be given enough scope to bring about needed
improvements in the corporate governance of SOEs.
22.
The authorities recognize the need to improve macroeconomic and financial
statistics. They are keen to improve the compilation, monitoring and analysis of Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs), showed interest in Fund technical assistance in this area, and
are prepared to cooperate on improving the staff’s access to data needed for improved
financial sector surveillance. In the fiscal area, the authorities intend to adopt more
transparent accounting of extra-budgetary operations. In addition, they agreed that there is a
4

Chapter 3 of the selected issues paper includes a more systematic effort to assess the extent to which public
investment may crowd in or crowd out private investment in Vietnam.

18
need for improved coverage of data on external debt, portfolio capital flows, and government
and SOE bond issues. To facilitate effective monitoring of developments in the above areas,
the team stressed the importance of better coordination and information-sharing among the
SBV, the SSC and the MOF.
23.
The team encouraged the authorities to move ahead with the issuance of
implementing regulations for Vietnam’s Anti-Money Laundering Decree.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
24.
Vietnam’s economic performance has been impressive over the last decade. Real
GDP has increased on average by 7½ percent a year and poverty has fallen sharply.
Following its historic WTO accession, Vietnam has emerged on to the world stage as one of
the most attractive investment destinations.
25.
The near-term outlook remains favorable, but medium-term prospects are
clouded by gathering demand pressures. Growth is projected to remain above 8 percent in
2007–08, underpinned by rapid export growth, strong foreign and domestic investment, and
rising consumption. However, inflation has crept up again in recent months, and remains
stubbornly high relative to major trading partners. On the external front, demand pressures
have been reflected in a widening current account deficit. While the deficit is being more
than financed by ODA and private capital inflows, and the SBV’s cushion of reserves is
being built up, Vietnam’s ongoing financial integration in the context of its relatively rigid
exchange rate makes the external position vulnerable. Overheating in the stock market could
pose additional risks to financial stability.
26.
To promote sustainable growth and safeguard external stability, a more effective
mix of monetary and exchange rate policies, vigilant financial system supervision, and a
prudent fiscal stance will need to be adopted. In this regard, the staff supports the
authorities’ recent steps to tighten monetary conditions, and urge the authorities to issue
sufficient amounts of SBV bills, as needed, to absorb excess bank liquidity and slow credit
growth on a sustained basis.
27.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to introduce greater flexibility in the
exchange rate regime, but urges them to accelerate its implementation. While the de
facto peg of the dong to the U.S. dollar has played a useful role as a nominal anchor over the
last few years, and its level currently seems consistent with the maintenance of external
stability, continuation of this policy would not meet the current and future needs of the
Vietnamese economy. A more flexible exchange rate could facilitate the tightening of
monetary policy in the period ahead, while decreasing the need for intervention and
sterilization. Greater two-way flexibility would also help foster the development of hedging
instruments, encourage better hedging of exchange rate risks, and protect external financial
stability in the event of abrupt and disruptive reversals of capital inflows.

19
28.
The growing securities market offers promising opportunities for cost-effective
financing of Vietnam’s investment needs, but has also created new risks. The staff
supports the authorities’ measures to tighten prudential controls on banks’ exposures to
securities-related lending. Improved securities market regulation, including additional steps
to discourage inappropriate trading practices, insider trading, and money laundering, will also
be essential to protect the stability and integrity of the capital market.
29.
The new possibilities for financing through the capital market, JSBs, and
foreign-owned banks have increased the urgency of banking system reform. The staff
welcomes the government’s plans to accelerate the equitization of the main SOCBs, and
urges it to offer adequate scope and incentives for participation by foreign strategic investors.
Also welcome are the authorities’ medium-term plans to grant the SBV adequate authority
and independence to carry out an anti-inflationary monetary policy and more effective bank
supervision. In the meantime, the SBV, the SSC, and the Ministry of Finance are urged to
better coordinate their efforts to track vulnerabilities associated with transactions among
banks, their securities company affiliates, and the domestic and foreign buyers of securities.
30.
A more prudent fiscal policy is also appropriate. Given the limited room for
maneuver in monetary policy in the short run, and the need to create space for possible
recourse to a countercyclical fiscal policy in the future, the non-oil fiscal deficit needs to be
placed on a declining path as soon as possible. The staff welcomes the government’s decision
to reconsider earlier plans for further large increases in public wages. In addition, any
revenue windfalls should be saved, and the funding of SOE projects through the issuance of
sovereign bonds postponed.
31.
Over the medium term, a concerted effort to boost revenues and curb
expenditure growth will be required to protect debt sustainability. Efforts to bolster nonoil revenues will need to be intensified, including by carefully considering the revenue
impact of planned tax reforms and strengthening tax administration. The indexation of public
wages and pensions to the minimum wage will also need to be reviewed, and a more
differentiated, merit-based salary structure adopted, along with reforms to rationalize civil
service employment and restrain the future growth of the wage bill. In addition, increased
efforts could be made to improve the screening and quality of public projects, and allow FDI
participation in commercially-viable infrastructure projects.
32.
Faster progress toward improving the governance of SOEs will need to be a
central element of the government’s strategy to improve the quality of growth and
investment and facilitate fiscal consolidation. The government’s plans to expand and
expedite its equitization of SOEs are welcome. To ensure that equitization will result in
meaningful improvements in SOEs’ corporate governance, every effort should be made to
encourage broad-based participation by foreign strategic investors. In addition, the use of
public funds for the financing of SOE projects should be discontinued as soon as possible,

20
and extra care taken to prevent related-party lending within the new SOE groups or strategic
partnerships involved in a mix of industrial operations and financial services.
33.
The quality, timeliness, and dissemination of macroeconomic and financial
statistics need to be improved to support informed policy decisions and build investor
confidence. The staff strongly supports the authorities’ plans to develop FSIs and improve
the transparency of budgetary data, and stands ready to provide technical assistance in these
areas. The authorities are also urged to improve monitoring of data on external debt, portfolio
capital flows, and government and SOE bond issues.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

21
Box 1. Vietnam’s WTO Accession: Challenges and Opportunities
WTO accession is expected to facilitate further Vietnam’s global integration by improving Vietnamese
exporters’ access to foreign markets. This should be particularly beneficial for the key textile and footwear
export industries, where Vietnam can now compete on an equal footing with other WTO member
countries.
Import barriers in most other sectors will also decline, albeit in a more gradual fashion. Vietnam has
committed to bound tariff rates on most products ranging from zero to 35 percent, although tariffs on cars
and motorbikes are to remain somewhat higher. Reductions in most bound rates—from 17.2 percent on
average in 2007 to 13.4 percent by 2019—are to be phased-in over periods of up to 12 years (see Table).

WTO accession should have largely positive macroeconomic effects. While the reduction in import tariffs
can be expected to lower annual import duty receipts by as much as 0.5 percent of GDP over the medium
term, the negative impact on revenues should be tempered over time with import growth, and should be
more than offset by the welfare gains accruing to consumers. Increasing access to cheaper imports should
also help contain inflation. Staff estimates point to net welfare gains from trade liberalization on the order
of 1–1.2 percent of GDP a year over the medium term.
Vietnam is also likely to derive important gains in productivity from trade liberalization and the other
market-friendly reforms introduced in the context of WTO accession. Increased competition with foreign
banks can be expected to prod the government to speed up the restructuring of SOCBs. These reforms
should help increase the efficiency and profitability of investment. Indeed, the prospect of accession has
already bolstered the investment climate with FDI approvals reaching a record $10 billion last year.
However, WTO accession is no panacea. Heavily-protected and/or uncompetitive industries and SOE
sectors, including auto-assembly and motorbike plants, and the financial sector, need to undertake
significant reforms to remain viable. In this process, there may well be a compression of profit margins
and, possibly, labor-shedding or bankruptcies in loss-making SOEs and declining industries.

22
Box 2. Assessing the Level of the Exchange Rate
Based on available data as of mid-2007, the level of
Vietnam’s exchange rate seems broadly appropriate.
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER)
of the dong has remained around its long-term
average during the first half of 2007. While the REER
depreciated significantly during 2002–03, a period of
rapid opening up of Vietnam’s trade system, this
depreciation has since been largely reversed.

maintenance of external balance and debt

sustainability.1 As elaborated in the staff’s medium1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
term baseline scenario, on current trends, the
current account deficit would remain in a range of 3–3½ percent of GDP; the stock of external debt
would be contained to 30 percent of GDP; and official reserves would level off at about 3½ months of
imports.
Available indicators suggest that Vietnam’s external competitiveness is currently adequate, although
continued structural reforms and improved infrastructure will be required to preserve its competitive
edge. Non-oil exports, including exports of labor-intensive manufacturing products such as textiles
and footwear, have grown at a robust pace of over 20 percent a year during 2002–2006, and non-oil
export growth has picked up to 28 percent (y/y) during the first seven months of 2007. As a result, the
market share of Vietnamese exports has recorded a sustained increase in relation to both world exports
and exports from Asian countries. The adequacy of Vietnam’s external competitiveness is further
evidenced by the ongoing strong expansion of FDI and other private capital inflows. Firm-level data,
however, paint a more nuanced picture. Cross-country survey data compiled by the Japan External
Trade Organization indicate that, although Vietnam’s large pool of relatively low-cost labor makes it
an attractive destination for foreign investment, inadequate infrastructure (especially power, ports, and
roads), shortages of skilled managerial and professional staff, and a nontransparent legal and
regulatory system weaken its comparative advantage.

Preliminary staff estimates based on the macro-balance approach used by the Consultative Group on Exchange
Rate Issues (CGER) suggest that the level of the current account deficit consistent with external balance over the
medium term (the so-called current account norm) may be on the order of 2 percent to 3 percent of GDP. While
these estimates are subject to a large margin of error, the alternative CGER methodology of estimating a reducedform equilibrium real exchange rate equation is not feasible, given the ongoing rapid structural changes in the
Vietnamese economy and the lack of a long-run cointegrating relationship for the REER of the dong.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:

On February 25, 1999 the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) revised the operation of the
interbank foreign exchange market. Under this regime, the SBV allows interbank foreign exchange
market rates to fluctuate by a maximum of ±0.25 percent a day (effective July 2002) from the
previous day’s average interbank market rate. In January 2007, the trading band was widened from
±0.25 percent to ±0.5 percent.
While Vietnam officially maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime, the exchange
rate has de facto been pegged to the U.S. dollar since August 2004. The SBV governor made
announcements in August 2004 and January 2005 that annual exchange rate depreciation would be

3
limited to one percent, and the dong in fact depreciated by 1 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in 2004
and by 0.8 percent in 2005. Although the authorities have not made any announcement to date
regarding the expected movement of the exchange rate in 2006, the dong/U.S. dollar rate remained
virtually unchanged during January–April 2006. Given that the Fund’s exchange arrangement
classification is based on de facto and not de jure policies, Vietnam is now classified as maintaining
a conventional fixed peg.
Vietnam has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of
Agreement, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions maintained for
security reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51).
VIII. Article IV Consultations:
Vietnam is currently on a 12-month consultation cycle, subject to provisions of Board
Decision No. 12794-(02/76) of July 15, 2002. The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on
October 25, 2006.

ANNEX II
Vietnam—Relations with the Asian Development Bank
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) resumed its operations in Vietnam in October 1993.
The Country Strategy and Program (CSP) endorsed in January 2002, proposed a focus on
four pillars to align AsDB operations in Vietnam to the overarching objective of poverty
reduction: (i) sustainable growth through rural development and private sector development,
with a focus on small and medium enterprise development; (ii) inclusive social development,
by mainstreaming poverty, gender, and ethnic dimensions in AsDB operations, with an
emphasis on human capital development through secondary education and health; (iii) good
governance, with special emphasis on public administration and civil service reform; and
(iv) geographic focus on the impoverished central region. The AsDB is currently preparing
the new CSP for 2007–2010. The preparation of the new CSP is aligned with the preparation
schedule of the SEDP in order to synchronize, synergize and supplement the government’s
development goals and objectives as espoused in the SEDP, and to allow for harmonization
of development assistance in support of result-based SEDP implementation.
From October 1993 until the end-2005, the AsDB approved 55 public sector loans totaling
about US$ 3.5 billion. Since December 1998, Vietnam has been classified as a B-1 country
by the AsDB, which makes it eligible to supplement borrowing at ADF terms with limited
amounts of borrowing at nonconcessional OCR terms. The cumulative $3.5 billion loan
portfolio includes nearly $ 3.0 billion from the concessional Asian Development Fund
(ADF) and US$520 million from Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). Loans have been
provided for (i) rehabilitating physical infrastructure in the agricultural, energy, and transport
sectors; (ii) financial sector, public administration reform, and state-owned enterprise (SOE)
reforms and corporate governance; and (iii) social, environmental, and cross-cutting
concerns. The contract awards achievement in 2005 was $209.8 million as compared with
$116 million in 2004, rendering a contract award ratio of 13.6 percent compared with
9.7 percent in 2004. Disbursement in 2005 attained $223.7 million as compared with
$182.4 million in 2004. The disbursement ratio has increased from 15.7 percent in 2004 to
17.5 percent in 2005. The AsDB has also extended technical assistance amounting to
US$123.7 million for 185 projects. In addition to public sector operations, AsDB has
provided $168.5 million for 7 private sector loans. Vietnam also receives substantial support
under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiatives.
Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to
encourage the development of the private sector is a vital component of AsDB operations in
Vietnam. So far, the AsDB has approved eleven policy-based program loans in the
agricultural sector, the financial sector, SOE reform and corporate governance and public
administration reform, SME development and support to poverty reduction implementation.
In addition to program lending, policy dialogue is an important feature in all of the AsDB’s

7
loan projects in Vietnam. This includes support for increased efficiency of state-owned
utilities through reforming their rate structure and other measures to increase cost recovery
and to strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning. A high level capacity
building program is also in place under the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training (JFPPT)
funded by the Government of Japan.
The AsDB has been reorganized as of 1 May 2006, and Vietnam now belongs to the
Southeast Asia Regional Department, along with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,
Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia. The resident mission has been strengthened and has
been performing programming functions and administration of a portion of loan projects.
During the past years, the AsDB has helped the government carry out participatory poverty
reduction assessment and rolling down the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy. AsDB was also active in supporting the Socio-economic Development Plan
consultation process. AsDB and Fund staff work closely together to support the process of
economic reforms in Vietnam. AsDB staff participate in Fund missions, exchange
information, and consult on policy matters. The resident missions of the two institutions also
cooperate closely.

ANNEX III
Vietnam—Relations with the World Bank Group1
Partnership in Vietnam’s Development Strategy
A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was presented to the World Bank Board in
February 2007. The CPS is fully aligned to Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Plan
(SEDP) 2006–2010 and sets out the planned World Bank support between FY07 and FY11.
The objectives of the SEDP can be mapped onto four broad pillars, which in turn are the
organizing principles of the CPS: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) preserving
social inclusion; (iii) strengthening environmental and natural resource management; and
(iv) improving governance.
A common theme underlining the four pillars is the need to complete the remaining firstgeneration structural reforms, while moving forward on a set of ambitious second-generation
reforms. The former group is related to the transition to a market economy and the
restructuring of the state sector. The latter group focuses on the institutional underpinnings
for the operation of a more complex economy, as Vietnam becomes a middle-income
country. Through these reforms, the role of the Government will be transformed from direct
producer of goods and services to regulator and provider of the foundations for a wellfunctioning, equitable, modern market economy.
Improving the Business Environment. Support for this theme will witness a shift in emphasis
from design to implementation of the policy reform agenda. It focuses on banking reform
and overall financial sector development; improved competitiveness with fuller integration
with the world economy; a more level playing field for businesses regardless of ownership;
laying a better foundation for knowledge-based growth and enhancing agricultural
competitiveness; and building up more efficient and reliable infrastructure.
Preserving Social Inclusion. Priorities for World Bank Group support are: better
understanding of poverty and piloting of new instruments to reach the poor; mainstreaming
gender issues across the portfolio and including people with disabilities in the development
process; increasing access to quality, basic infrastructure services for the rural poor;
increasing the access to affordable and better quality education and health care services;
including and empowering ethnic minorities in the development processes; improving
policies and services to address the needs to urban poor and migrants and reducing
vulnerability to adverse shocks.
Strengthening Environmental and Natural Resource Management. Rapid economic growth is
putting the environment increasingly under stress. The livelihoods of poor people in Vietnam
1

10
still depend overwhelmingly on natural resources. World Bank’s activities will focus on
livelihood-supporting roles and public benefits of better managed environment and natural
resources. In practice, this will raise a range of challenges related to regional planning; land,
forestry, water resources and integrated river basin management; and the introduction of
modern tools for environmental protection.
Improving Governance: Progress across the structural, social and environmental areas will
require more modern institutions, emphasizing transparency and accountability. The thrust of
Bank support under this pillar will be: strengthening public financial management,
simplification of administrative procedures, assisting with the Government’s fight against
corruption, greater accountability of public service providers, modernizing the planning
process with a focus on development outcomes and more participatory approaches.
World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group employs a broad range of instruments to support the objectives laid
out by the Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006–2010 (SEDP 2006–2010) and other key
strategies of the Government. They include analytical and advisory activities; IDA
investment projects; Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs); IFC’s equity, loan and TA
participations; Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF) and Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) activities; and donor partnerships and ODA
coordination. IDA credits provide policy, institutional and physical investment support for
Vietnam’s development and structural reforms, with PRSCs used as vehicles for policy
dialogue.
The Scale of Bank Group Activities: The CPS operational program is calibrated based on
an assumption of annual IDA lending envelopes in the order of US$900 million. Actual
allocations will depend on Vietnam’s performance relative to other potential IDA recipients
and on the overall resource envelope. During the CPS period, Vietnam’s GNI per capita is
projected to move steadily towards the IDA graduation threshold, and the Vietnamese
government has expressed its desire to seek an opportunity for blending IDA and IBRD
resources. The World Bank has scheduled a creditworthiness review in FY08 to this effect.
The IFC and MIGA programs are also expected to grow in the coming years.
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs): A sixth PRSC operation for US$175 million
equivalent was approved by the Board in June 2007. This PRSC is the first in a series of five
proposed operations (PRSCs 6-10) to support the reforms envisaged chiefly in the SEDP
2006–2010, which also serves at the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for Vietnam. Prior to
this new series, five PRSC operations mainly supported the implementation of the
Government’s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. PRSC 1, a twotranche operation for US$250 million was approved by the Board in June 2001. Its focus was
mainly on structural reform issues in trade liberalization, financial sector and SOE reforms,
and private sector development. The following five operations PRSC 2-5 had a significantly
broader coverage and supported policy actions in areas such as health, social protection,

11
education, and environmental protection and natural resource management. They also
included actions to build modern governance systems in Vietnam, such as those aimed at
public financial management and public administration reform, modernizing planning, and
fighting corruption. Each of these four operations was for US$100 million. PRSC operations
have served as an effective donor coordination device, being co-financed by an increasingly
large number of donors. The number of co-financiers has increased from 4 at the time of
PRSC 1 to 11 for PRSC 6. The contribution of co-financiers exceeded US$150 million for
PRSC 5. Apart from providing resources, PRSCs serve as a single unified platform for policy
dialogue between about 16 donors and the Government on a broad range of issues.
Knowledge Products: In addition to its lending program, the World Bank has been working
on capacity-building and knowledge-sharing in key areas of emphasis. The annual Vietnam
Development Reports (VDR), written in coordination with a large number of donors and
submitted to the year-end Consultative Group meeting, summarizes the accumulated
knowledge in a specific policy area and fosters the policy and institutional reform agenda.
Recent VDRs have focused on thematic areas such as poverty, governance, and business
development. The VDR 2007 was cross sectoral, and based on the SEDP 2006–2010 laid out
a roadmap for tackling development challenges over the next five years. A forthcoming VDR
will focus on social protection. Upcoming reports over the CPS period will include Skills for
Growth and Tertiary Education, Investment Climate Assessment, Capital Market Monitoring
and Assistance, Country Social Analysis, Health Issues Paper, Country Environmental
Analysis, Land Policy Dialogues, Public Expenditure Review/Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment and Country Financial Assessment Update.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Collaboration between the World Bank and the IMF was essential to launch the PRSC-PRGF
program in 2001. The process leading to this program spanned four years, starting at the
onset of the East Asian crisis. The overall framework for this collaboration was laid out in
1998, in preparation for what was then expected to be the second Structural Adjustment
Credit for Vietnam. The lead agency in each policy area was identified in the Policy
Framework Paper and particularly in the Structural and Sectoral Policy Matrix for 1999–
2001. The direct involvement of the IMF in some of the structural areas such as financial
sector, SOE, and trade reform was justified because of their potential impact on
macroeconomic stability.

As a result of this overall framework, the World Bank supported policy reforms in
collaboration with the IMF in several areas, including external debt management, financial
sector reform, SOE reform, and public expenditure management. In some of these areas, the
World Bank and the IMF identified complementary sets of policy triggers for the PRSC and
the PRGF programs respectively. In others, cooperation between the two institutions took
place in the context of specific tasks, not directly related to lending.
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004 the two institutions have closely collaborated
in the discussion of PRSC prior actions and triggers in the policy areas that used to be
covered by the PRGF agreement. The IMF has provided Letters of Assessment in support of
the last three PRSC operations. In the area of public financial management, the World Bank
is currently following up on the technical assistance provided by the IMF in relation to tax
reform and revenue management. Joint work is also under way in support of the
establishment of a modern central bank, with the IMF providing technical assistance on
monetary policies and banking supervision, whereas the World Bank has set up an
investment credit to reorganize the State Bank of Vietnam and develop appropriate
information management systems.
From 2005 onwards, the World Bank and the IMF have jointly prepared an annual Debt
Sustainability Assessment. More recently, they joined efforts in commenting on the direction
and contents of the SEDP 2006–2010, including a Joint Staff Advisory Note submitted to the
World Bank Board in December 2006. The IMF and the World Bank also collaborate in the
development of reliable economic statistics. The IMF focuses on improving balance of
payments, national accounts, and price statistics, while the World Bank concentrates on
issues related to the production of high-quality household and enterprise surveys, and to help
develop broader access to data in Vietnam.

14
ANNEX IV
Vietnam—Statistical Issues
While data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance, the reliability and
coverage of macroeconomic statistics have significant deficiencies that hamper economic
analysis. Compilation and dissemination are in need of substantial improvement, so that data
properly reflect economic developments and assist policy formulation, implementation, and
monitoring. The authorities are cooperating with the Fund, but work is hampered in some areas
by the lack of authorization to release data. Vietnam has few official statistical publications that
provide coverage beyond the real sector. A Vietnam page was introduced in the GFS Yearbook
in 1999 (data were last reported for fiscal year 2004) and in the IFS in 2001. Vietnam has
participated in the GDDS since September 2003, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Fund technical assistance has contributed to improvements in a number of statistical areas. The
STA multisector statistics/General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) mission in July 2001
found a number of deficiencies and recommended an action plan. The follow-up STA mission in
December 2001 agreed on a program to improve national accounts and price statistics.
Subsequently, a STA peripatetic expert was assigned to assist the General Statistics Office
(GSO) under a five-year project that commenced in January 2002, and a series of four follow-up
missions was fielded. More recently, there have also been follow-up missions in balance of
payments statistics in September 2003 and 2006. A mission on core inflation measurement and
inflation forecasting took place in April 2007.
National accounts
Vietnam has benefited from extensive technical assistance in the area of national accounts and
price statistics. The GSO provides quarterly and annual data on gross domestic product (GDP)
by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure2 (both in current and constant
prices), and monthly and annual data on external trade, industrial output, retail sales, and prices.
The annual constant price GDP estimates have 1994 as the base year and are in need of updating.
While the national accounts methodologies is broadly consistent with the System of National
Accounts 1993, the compilation process suffers from poor data collection practices and a lack of
coordination and communication between data collection agencies. In 2001 the GSO introduced
new methodology for calculating GDP and, in 2003, published two revised handbooks on
sources and methods in Vietnamese.
Prices
The consumer price index (CPI) methodology is largely in line with international standards. The
GSO released a revised CPI in May 2006 based on data from the 2004 Vietnam Household

2

GDP by type of expenditure was calculated from 2002Q1 to 2003Q2 but discontinued due to lack of resources.

15
Living Standards Survey (VHLSS). The basket now includes about 500 items, compared with
about 400 for the previous index (based on the 1998 VHLSS), and the weight of food has
decreased from 47 percent to 42 percent. However, there is only a notional inclusion of owneroccupied and rental housing. Also, there is a need to adopt a geometric mean of price relatives at
the lower level of aggregation, instead of the upward biased arithmetic mean. The GSO planned
to introduce a producer price index in late 2001 but this has been delayed for technical reasons.
Trade price indices are also compiled, but not used in the national accounts by the GSO because
the sample size is deemed too small. The authorities are working on a core inflation index.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) State Budget Department produces provisional monthly,
quarterly, and annual data on government operations shortly after the end of the reference period
and final data for the fiscal (calendar) year are produced after a delay of about eighteen months.
These data reflect the consolidated operations of the state budget, which covers all four levels of
government: central, provincial, district, and commune. They exclude data on off-budget
investment expenditure, quasi-fiscal activities of SOEs and extrabudgetary funds, among which
are the Social Security Fund, Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund,
Export Support Fund, local development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for repayment of on-lent
funds), for which data are not compiled on a regular basis.
Compilation is on a cash basis for final annual data, but varies for provisional data depending on
their source. As a result, government financing data, in particular domestic bank financing,
cannot be reconciled as reported in the fiscal and monetary accounts. Like the national accounts,
provisional data are compiled before the end of the reference period and thus involve a projected
component. The quarterly data are only revised when data are compiled for the same quarter of
the following year. The MoF’s External Finance Department maintains a centralized record of all
general government external debt, excluding guarantees issued on behalf of state-owned
enterprises. The MoF, with support from the UNDP, has put in place an external debt
management system for the recording of disbursements and multiple currency loans, which as of
May 2006 was in the testing phase.
Despite these shortcomings, the authorities have made progress in a number of other areas
related to fiscal transparency, including implementation of an improved budget management law
and adoption of a 1986 GFS-consistent budget classification at all levels of government. The
authorities published for the first time in late 1998 the fiscal outturn for 1997 and the approved
budget for 1999, although both in highly aggregated form. Starting in late 2001, the MoF began
posting annual budget outturns and plans on its external website, including by major revenue and
expenditure items. However, considerable actions remain to be taken to improve the coverage of
fiscal data as recommended in the 1998 Bank-Fund report on fiscal transparency, the STA
multisector statistics mission of 2001, and the 2005 Public Expenditure Review.
In this context, the government continues to work toward gazetteing and publishing the annual
national budget, as well as preparing commune-level budgets, implementing the GFS-based
functional budget classification system, initiating work on revising government accounting

16
standards, preparing a medium-term expenditure framework, and introducing an integrated
financial management system (IFMS) for improving treasury management and fiscal reporting.
The 2001 STA mission found that the functional classification had not yet been fully aligned
with international classification standards, which might hamper formulation, execution, and
monitoring of fiscal policy. The IFMS should allow a detailed classification of provisional, as
well as final budget accounts. In addition, it will permit incorporation of data on extrabudgetary
funds into the Treasury database.
Annual GFS data through 2004, excluding extrabudgetary funds and social security funds, have
been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, using the 1986 GFS format. No sub-annual
fiscal data have been reported for publication in IFS since 2001.
Monetary and financial statistics
The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) reports monetary and financial data to the Fund, including:
(i) the monetary survey (on a monthly basis with a ten-week lag), (ii) the central bank balance
sheet (on a monthly basis and typically with a twelve-week lag) (iii) detailed consolidated
balance sheets (“derivation tables”) for six state-owned and 77 non-state deposit money banks
and individual balance sheets for the four large state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) (since
the beginning of 2001 on a monthly basis and typically with a twelve-week lag; (iv) deposit and
lending rates of the large SOCBs (on a monthly basis and for various maturities); (v) data on
reserve requirement on a monthly basis and with a twelve-week lag; and (vi), data on open
market operations on a daily basis with a twelve-week lag. Since December 2005 the
consolidated balance sheets of deposit money banks cover additionally five financial companies.
Recently, monetary data and data on foreign reserves (gross and net official international
reserves and net foreign assets of the banking system) have been submitted to the APD mission
team with a lag of 8–9 weeks.
In January 1999, the SBV and commercial banks began implementing new charts of accounts for
compiling money and banking data, developed with STA assistance. However, they do not
adequately sectorize credit for monetary programming purposes, in particular failing to
distinguish between bank credit to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to other nonstate sectors
of the economy. Therefore, in addition to its regular monthly reports, the SBV has designed a
new monthly report form for the four large SOCBs for submitting sectorized credit data to the
central bank. The July 2001 STA mission encouraged the SBV to develop a reporting scheme for
a comprehensive breakdown of banks’ credit to the economy by borrowing sectors, sub sectors,
and ownership of enterprises. The follow-up mission that took place during April 14-28, 2005
recommended changes to new bank report forms to allow greater sectorization of bank credit. In
addition, it recommended that a list of state-owned enterprises that have been privatized and
therefore should be classified as private enterprises be distributed to banks in order to guide their
data reporting on enterprises; that funds for on-lending be reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified
liabilities” to “other deposits”; and gave a presentation of how Fund accounts should be
compiled in monetary statistics. Further cooperation from the authorities is needed to resolve

17
data discrepancies involving credit data for a state-owned bank. These discrepancies may reflect
possible noncoverage and/or omission of certain loans and financial leases, offset by lower
deposits and other liabilities.
External sector statistics
The SBV compiles quarterly and annual balance of payments (BOP) statistics with a one- to twomonth lag, although the data reported to the Fund for publication are less timely—the data
published in the August 2007 issue of the IFS are for the second quarter of 2006. The SBV does
not compile international investment position statistics. Since 1995, monthly and annual trade
data have been compiled using customs reports, but the coverage and accuracy of these data need
to be improved. In particular, the commodity breakdown of a large share of reported exports and
imports (approximately 17 percent and 27 percent respectively in 2006) is unknown. Data on
invisibles continue to be based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage
and identification of the types of transactions. Improvements are particularly needed for data on
tourism revenue and workers’ remittances.
Improvements in BOP statistics, in particular foreign direct investment (FDI), also continue to be
hampered by interagency coordination problems. Data on FDI are now compiled by the SBV
based on quarterly and semi-annual survey reports received from foreign enterprises operating in
Vietnam and supplemented by reports from SBV branches. The Ministry of Planning and
Investment (MPI) also collects administrative data on FDI. However, at the September 2000
ASEAN Workshop on Improving the Quality of FDI Data, the authorities indicated that
problems persisted with the survey response rate, as not all FDI enterprises were providing the
requested information. Moreover, the 2001 STA GDDS mission noted that no effort had been
made to distinguish head office and other nonresident liabilities in the reported data. The 2003
and 2006 balance of payments statistics missions recommended that the MPI, GSO, and SBV
work jointly to improve FDI questionnaires and processes, including collecting data on both
stocks and flows.
The SBV maintains data on contracting of commercial debt (by SOEs and privately owned
firms). Some loans are reported only after an extended delay, and the reporting of disbursements
and repayments remains poor. Data on contracting, disbursement, and service of official debt are
maintained by the MoF. The MPI also reports the loan obligations of foreign investors. The STA
missions found that the overlapping responsibility for debt statistics has at times resulted in some
deficiencies in coverage, including the lack of monitoring certain leasing arrangements (e.g., for
aircraft). The 2006 mission also recommended creation of a line item for portfolio capital flows
to capture the 2005 sovereign bond issuance, as well as expected future portfolio inflows, and a
draft report form was left with the authorities for their review. Recent SBV data reflect the
recommended breakdown for portfolio inflows.

Vietnam remains at low risk of external debt distress over the medium term, provided that
external borrowing will continue to be guided by the prudence that has characterized
government policies over the last few years. However, the inclusion of domestic debt in the
analysis paints a somewhat more nuanced picture, as prolonged maintenance of an
expansionary fiscal policy or a permanently lower GDP growth rate could pose risks to longrun fiscal sustainability. These considerations reinforce the need for the adoption of a more
restrained fiscal stance over the medium term, along with accelerated reform and
equitization of SOEs.
A. Introduction
1.
This analysis updates the DSA presented in Country Report No. 06/421 (Annex VII,
pp. 48–59). The DSA was prepared jointly by the Bank and the Fund on the basis of the joint
framework approved by the Bank and Fund Boards in April 2005.
B. The Baseline Scenario
2.
The baseline scenario is broadly consistent with the policies and public investment
program contained in Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006–10,
which is also the government’s Poverty Reduction strategy (PRS).
3.

The key assumptions envisage:

•

GDP growth at 8 percent on average during 2007–12 and 7.1 percent thereafter,
slightly above the growth rates assumed in last year’s DSA;

2
•

Consumer price inflation picking up to 8 percent in 2007, somewhat above the rate
projected under last year’s DSA (6.5 percent), but progressively declining thereafter,
to 4½ percent by 2012, and 2.8 percent over the long run, in line with major trading
partners, broadly as envisaged in last year’s DSA;

•

Exchange rate of the dong continuing to depreciate by 1–1½ percent a year vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar over the medium term, and stabilizing over the long run, with the
implied cumulative appreciation of the real exchange rate remaining modest, so that
projected increases in labor productivity in the traded goods sector can help preserve
competitiveness;

•

Oil revenues declining at a somewhat faster pace than envisaged in last year’s DSA,
from a peak of 9¾ percent of GDP in 2006 to around 8 percent of GDP in 2007–08
and 5 percent of GDP from 2012 onward, in line with a projected leveling off of oil
export receipts;

•

Non-oil revenues increasing from around 17¼ percent of GDP in 2007 to
18¼ percent of GDP by 2012, as the government is expected to intensify its efforts to
broaden the tax base and strengthen tax administration, with a view to mitigating the
decline in total revenue;

•

Total primary (non-interest) expenditure declining in relation to GDP broadly in line
with the pace of adjustment envisaged in last year’s DSA, with non-interest current
expenditure declining from 18¾ percent of GDP in 2007 to about 17½ percent of
GDP by 2010 as oil subsidies are phased out, and falling further to about 15½ percent
of GDP over the long run as wage increases slow from 2010 onwards;

•

Total public investment, including on-lending for the financing of SOE projects,
would decline slightly faster than envisaged under last year’s DSA, from about
12½ percent of GDP in 2007 to 10½ percent of GDP by 2012, as SOE reform and
equitization help transfer more
responsibilities for the financing
General Government Fiscal Deficit
of large investment projects to the 18 (in percent of GDP)
private sector;
Overall fiscal balance

•

•

The composition of new
borrowing would shift towards
debt secured under less
concessional terms, with an
increase of the average interest
rate on external debt from an
historical average of 3 percent to
about 5½ percent during 2013-27;

No further liabilities incurred in connection with SOCB reform, and no contingent
liabilities arising from the SOE sector, as SOCB capital is being replenished through

3
an injection of public funds equivalent to around 1 percent of GDP, and the
government intends to meet any further needs for SOCB or SOE recapitalization
through recourse to the government’s equitization fund.
4.
Under the above assumptions, the non-oil fiscal deficit would fall from 14¾ percent
of GDP in 2007–08 to 10½ percent of GDP by 2012, and it would decline somewhat more
slowly thereafter, leveling off at about 9 percent of GDP over the long run. The overall fiscal
deficit would decline from about 7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 5½ percent of GDP by 2012,
and would also remain on a downward trend thereafter, leveling off at about 4 percent of
GDP in the long run. The primary deficit would decline from 5½ percent of GDP in 2007 to
3¾ percent of GDP in 2012, and it would fall further in subsequent years to 1 percent of GDP
by 2027.
C. Public Sector Debt Sustainability
5.
Under the baseline, the stock of total public debt, which is projected at 43½ percent of
GDP in 2007, broadly in line with the average debt level of the ASEAN-4 countries,1 would
remain on an upward trend over the medium term. It would breach the authorities’ notional
ceiling of 50 percent of GDP in 2014, and would peak at about 51 percent of GDP in 2016,
but would decline steadily thereafter, falling to 46½ percent of GDP by 2027.2 Although the
NPV of debt to GDP ratio would reach a high of 47½ percent, and the NPV of debt to
revenue ratio would exceed 200 percent in 2017, both ratios would be placed on rapidly
declining paths over the long run. The debt service to revenue ratio would remain
manageable throughout the projection period.
6.
The stress tests suggest that the path of total public debt is particularly sensitive to
changes in the assumptions about the extent of fiscal adjustment and the GDP growth rate.
The biggest risks would be posed by a failure to carry out the envisaged adjustment in the
primary balance. As is illustrated under alternative scenario A2, if the primary balance were
to remain unchanged at its level as of 2007 (-5.5 percent of GDP), the NPV of debt to GDP
ratio, the NPV of debt to revenue ratio, and the debt service to revenue ratio would all rise
sharply, and would reach levels of 81 percent, 351 percent and 30 percent, respectively, by
2027. A permanently lower GDP growth rate (alternative scenario A3) would also have
significant, but somewhat more modest, adverse effects on the debt dynamics, with the NPV
of debt to GDP ratio, the NPV of debt to revenue ratio, and the debt service to revenue ratio
reaching levels of 54 percent, 233 percent, and 16 percent, respectively, by 2027.

ASEAN 4 includes: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The authorities’ notional debt ceiling excludes VDB liabilities and municipal bonds, which are included in the
staff’s definition of public and publicly guaranteed debt.

4
D. External Debt Sustainability
7.
The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities continue their past policy of setting
an annual external borrowing limit for the public sector, while maintaining a prudent policy
in their issuance of sovereign bonds. In addition, the scenario does not incorporate any
foreign holdings of domestic-currency bonds, as such holdings have been limited in the past.
As a result, the baseline can be viewed as a relatively optimistic external debt scenario for a
country that is rapidly transitioning to emerging-market status, and some of the underlying
assumptions will need to be reconsidered in future DSA updates.
8.
More specifically, the baseline assumes (i) a gradual decline in financing on IDA
terms from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 1.8 percent of GDP in 2010, followed by a
slow move toward a blended mix of multilateral and bilateral finance; (ii) a gradual decline
in ODA-financed on-lending; (iii) a decline in SOE external debt with government guarantee,
as SOEs progressively gain direct access to foreign capital markets; (iv) continued robust
growth in FDI; (v) net annual issuance of commercial sovereign bonds rising to 1.3 percent
of GDP in 2008 (based on the assumption that the forthcoming US$1 billion bond issue will
occur in 2008) and leveling off at 1 percent of GDP over the long run; and (vi) an increase in
private debt from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2027.
9.
The baseline implies a fairly benign external debt situation. Total external debt is
projected to decline from an already manageable 31 percent of GDP in 2007 to 26½ percent
of GDP in 2012 and 22 percent by 2027. The NPV of the public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt to GDP ratio would level off at about 17 percent of GDP during 2010–2012,
declining to 11½ percent of GDP by 2027. The NPV of PPG debt to exports ratio would
record a more marked decline, falling from 24 percent in 2007 to 20 percent in 2012 and
14 percent by 2027. While the NPV of PPG debt to revenue ratio would edge up to
74 percent in 2012, it would fall markedly over the long run to 50 percent by 2027. The debt
service-to-export ratio would remain very low at about 4 percent throughout the projection
period. While the debt service-to-revenue ratio would rise steadily from 10 percent in 2007 to
15 percent by 2017, it would level off thereafter, and decline to 13 percent by 2027.
10.
The alternative scenarios on the external debt show that Vietnam’s external debt is
most sensitive to changes in the assumption on the terms of new debt. Under the assumption
that new public sector loans will have to be incurred at less favorable terms throughout the
projection period (alternative scenario A2), the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio could remain at
24 percent over the long run, while the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio would rise to 97 percent
by 2017. These scenarios underscore the need for Vietnam to continue to attract FDI, and
make maximal use of concessional sources of finance, to keep its external debt manageable.
11.
Additional risks that are not reflected in the baseline call for continuation of a prudent
external debt management policy. First, as in the case of the baseline for total public debt, the
path of external debt is predicated on a relatively rapid pace of medium term fiscal

5
adjustment. If the adjustment is postponed or does not materialize, external borrowing could
be more extensive, and the external public debt dynamics less favorable. Second, as foreign
investors’ appetite for Vietnamese paper continues to increase, the authorities could make
increasing recourse not only to sovereign bond issues for purposes of on-lending to SOEs (as
appears to be the case with the currently-planned US$1 billion bond issue) but also
placements of domestic-currency government and SOE bonds abroad. Such operations could
lead to a considerably faster than projected increase in the level of external debt.
E. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Scenario with Contingent Liabilities
12.
Following the approach used for last year’s DSA, this section attempts to incorporate
the possible increase in contingent government liabilities associated with the operations of
SOCBs and/or SOEs by developing two alternative scenarios.3
13.
Alternative Scenario 1 assumes that the balance sheets of the four large SOCBs have
improved markedly over the last two years, based on audited financial statements for 2005
and 2006, the quality of which has also been upgraded (some of these statements have been
prepared and audited in line with international practices). While the recent financial
statements continue to report capital levels (after accounting for accumulated losses) that are
below the SBV’s 8 percent requirement (significantly so in some cases), the estimates for
recapitalization costs that might have to be borne by the government are lower than those
based on financial statements from before 2005. This is not only because of stronger balance
sheets, but also because the likelihood of private sector equity injections is much greater now
than earlier anticipated. Taking these factors into account, and also the possibility that some
non-performing assets may have gone unreported or remain off-balance sheet, the
recapitalization costs to raise capital to 8 percent of assets are estimated at 4 percent of GDP.
The associated contingent liabilities are assumed to be absorbed by the government in four
equal installments over the period 2008–11 (one percent of GDP a year). Under this scenario,
the public debt dynamics does not change in any drastic way with respect to the baseline. As
is illustrated in Table 1, the NPV of public debt rises slightly faster than under the baseline
over the medium term, but it follows a declining trend over the long run, and remains below
the authorities’ notional debt ceiling of 50 percent of GDP throughout the projection period.
14.
Alternative Scenario 2 assumes that, aside from the need to recapitalize SOCBs, slow
progress in improving the governance of SOEs, and delays in their equitization, lead to a
slower than expected accumulation of resources in the equitization fund. As a result, the
government has to assume a larger share of the costs of recapitalizing SOCBs and SOEs. The
3

The DSA in Country Report No. 06/421 included two alternative scenarios with contingent liabilities ranging
from 8 percent of GDP to 20 percent of GDP. The assumed size of contingent liabilities has been scaled down
to 4 percent to 8 percent of GDP in this year’s DSA on the assumption that the government’s efforts to speed up
the equitization of SOCBs, together with slowing growth in SOCB lending, will help contain possible future
burdens on the budget associated with SOCB recapitalization.

6
scenario also assumes that SOEs increase their borrowing to finance their ambitious
investment projects, and that some of these obligations will eventually have to be assumed by
the government. As a result, over the medium term, the government incurs total contingent
liabilities equivalent to 8 percent of GDP, which are again evenly spread over a period of
four years (2008–11). Under these assumptions, the debt stock in NPV terms would breach
the authorities’ notional debt ceiling of 50 percent by 2012, peaking at around 51½ percent of
GDP in 2015, and declining steadily over the longer term to about 45 percent in 2027.
15.
The above scenarios illustrate the important ways in which contingent liabilities can
influence public debt dynamics. Going forward, even if SOCB bank equitizations are
implemented as planned in 2007–08, and the quality of new SOCB lending is improved
considerably, SOEs’ increasing borrowing from other sources, including the capital market
and/or new SOE-affiliated financial conglomerates, could give rise to contingent government
liabilities, which could be larger the longer needed SOE reforms are postponed. An increase
in the size of these liabilities could, in turn, pose a threat to medium-term debt sustainability,
if it is combined with a significant delay in the adjustment of the primary balance and/or a
sharp reduction in the oil price. This could eventually require a larger and more abrupt
adjustment to quickly place debt on a sustainable path, with the increasing debt servicing
requirements likely to crowd out higher-priority investment and social expenditures.
F. Staff Assessment
16.
Staffs consider Vietnam to be at low risk of external debt distress over the period
2007–12. Vietnam’s external debt ratios would remain below applicable policy-based debt
thresholds under the baseline, provided that external borrowing policies will continue to be
guided by the prudence that has characterized Vietnam’s policies over the last few years.4
Vietnam’s external debt dynamics are also robust to most standardized shocks. While the
external public debt seems most sensitive to an exchange rate shock, the level of the debt
would still remain well below the external debt applicable thresholds (Figure 2). A gradual
decline in the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would still occur under various shocks, as
in the baseline scenario (Table 3b).
17.
However, the inclusion of domestic debt paints a somewhat more nuanced picture.
Under the baseline, the NPV of domestic debt would rise from 19.4 percent of GDP in 2007
to 27 percent of GDP by 2012, while the NPV of debt to revenue ratio would rise above
200 percent by 2017. As is illustrated in the stress tests, an expansionary fiscal policy or a
permanently lower GDP growth rate could then pose risks to long-run fiscal sustainability. In
particular, if the substantial fiscal adjustment envisaged to take place over the long run under
4

Vietnam is considered a “medium” performer on the basis of the three-year moving average of its CPIA
rating, which is the same as its CPIA score for 2005. Its applicable external debt thresholds are the following:
(i) NPV of debt-to-exports = 150 percent; (ii) NPV of debt-to-GDP = 40 percent; and (iii) debt service-toexports = 20 percent.

7
the baseline fails to materialize, the NPV of total public debt would rise to about 350 percent
of revenue by 2027, while the debt service to revenue ratio would rise to 30 percent. These
considerations underscore the importance of continued close monitoring of Vietnam’s public
debt dynamics, and reinforce the need for the adoption of a more restrained fiscal stance over
the medium term, along with an acceleration of the pace of reform and equitization of SOEs.

Statement by IMF Staff Representative
October 26, 2007
The information provided below has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Most indicators suggest that economic activity has remained buoyant over the last
few months. Real GDP growth picked up to 8.2 percent (year-on-year (yoy)) during the first
nine months of 2007, supported by continued rapid growth of domestic demand and non-oil
exports. Retail sales growth has remained brisk and the boom in foreign direct investment
(FDI) has continued. If recent trends continue, the authorities’ revised target for GDP growth
of 8.5 percent over the full year will likely be achieved. Like other emerging markets in the
region, Vietnam has been relatively unscathed by the global market turmoil triggered by the
subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.
2.
Inflation has remained on an upward path, reaching a level of 9.3 percent (yoy) in
October. Continuing cost-push pressures on food and commodity prices, largely due to local
supply shocks and global market conditions, have been compounded by demand pressures.
To address the growing concerns about these developments, the Prime Minister issued a
directive in August (Directive 18/2007) instructing a number of ministries and the SBV to
adopt urgent measures to curb inflation.
3.
As a first step, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has temporarily reduced import tariffs
on a number of food and foodstuff products and construction materials, and has permanently
reduced tariffs on some other consumption goods by advancing the implementation of
commitments under the WTO. The government has also postponed previously-planned steps
to ease controls on key administered prices. Accordingly, oil trading enterprises were asked
in August to reduce their gasoline retail prices by VND 500 per liter (i.e., by about
4¼ percent), and an effective freeze was imposed on the prices of electricity, oil products,
coal sold to electricity, cement, fertilizer, and paper producers, clean water, postal services,
and bus tickets.
4.
Despite a doubling of reserve requirements from June 2007, the growth of total
liquidity (M2) and credit to the economy continued to accelerate through end-August 2007
(to 42 percent and 40 percent, respectively). In August, the SBV was instructed to adopt
measures to control the growth of monetary and credit aggregates, and its monetary program
targets for end-2007 were subsequently set at 25–28 percent for M2 growth and 26–28
percent for credit growth. To achieve these targets, the SBV is to continue to absorb excess
bank liquidity through open market operations. Preliminary data suggest that there has been
some tightening of money market conditions in recent weeks, although interbank deposit
rates have remained negative in real terms.

2
5.
Fiscal policy trends have remained broadly in line with the projections in the staff
report. Based on preliminary data for the first nine months of 2007, revenues have been
running slightly below the budget target, but disbursements of capital expenditure have also
fallen short of budget targets, helping to contain the overall deficit so far in 2007. However,
expenditures are likely to be boosted in the remainder of the year, as implementation of
planned capital projects is expected to be stepped up.
6.
On September 26, the Prime Minister approved the long-awaited equitisation plan for
Vietcombank (VCB). Under this plan, private sector participation in VCB is to be raised
gradually to a maximum of 49 percent, with up to 20 percent to be allocated initially to
foreign strategic investors and another 15 percent to be subsequently issued and listed
abroad. VCB is to select no more than two foreign strategic investors, and submit their names
to the Prime Minister for approval before the bank launches its initial public offering
(IPO). Following the IPO, VCB will be allowed to reserve a part of any accrued surplus
capital for investment in key public infrastructure projects subject to the Prime Minister’s
decision.
7.
Continuing progress has been made in the issuance of implementing regulations for
the Unified Enterprise Law, the Common Investment Law, and the new Commercial Law.
Decree 139 dated September 5 provides detailed guidelines relating to the establishment,
management structure, operation modalities, and restructuring and dissolution of enterprises.
Among other things, application of these guidelines is expected to facilitate the issuance of
business registration certificates.
8.
On September 18, the MOF published its first semi-annual external debt bulletin on
its website (http://www.mof.gov.vn/DefaultE.aspx?tabid=5591&ItemID=46332). The
Bulletin contains statistics on government and government-guaranteed external debt, together
with detailed information on the coverage, methodology, sources, and definition of data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 21, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Vietnam
On October 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Vietnam.1
Background
Vietnam has recorded continued strong economic performance since the conclusion of the last
Article IV consultation. GDP growth rose to 8.2 percent in 2006, with non-oil exports remaining
an important engine of growth. Private investment has also expanded briskly, led in large part
by accelerated foreign direct investment (FDI) disbursements in the wake of Vietnam’s historic
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Industrial activity, retail sales, and trade data point
to a continued strong expansion so far in 2007.
However, rising inflation points to tightening capacity constraints. Inflation picked up to
8.4 percent (y/y) as of July 2007, up from 6.6 percent in late 2006. While this pick-up was due
partly to food supply shocks, rising world commodity prices, and overdue adjustments in
administered prices, Vietnam’s core inflation has remained on an upward trend, and its inflation
seems higher and more entrenched than in other countries in the region.
The balance of payments has remained sound. Import growth picked up to 30 percent (y/y)
during the first seven months of 2007, but high oil prices, booming non-oil exports, and buoyant
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
remittances helped to restrain the current account deficit. With rapidly growing FDI and portfolio
inflows, gross official reserves rose from US$11½ billion at end-2006 to around US$19 billion
(3½ months of imports) as of end-May 2007.
The surge in reserves has contributed to an easing of monetary conditions. Despite increased
sterilization, the growth of overall credit to the economy picked up from 25 percent in 2006 to
35 percent (y/y) as of end-May 2007. Reserve requirements on bank deposits were virtually
doubled from June 2007 (to a range of 4 to 10 percent), and banks’ securities-related lending
made subject to a cap equivalent to 3 percent of total loans. Interbank rates and real time
deposit rates, however, have remained low.
The overall fiscal deficit was lower than budgeted in 2006, but the budget plan for 2007
suggests that the fiscal stance appears set to be eased. A better-than-expected revenue
outturn, together with slow implementation of off-budget investment plans, helped to compress
the overall deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP. However, if the government fully implements its plans
for 2007, the fiscal deficit could widen to well over 7 percent of GDP in 2007, with the non-oil
deficit rising by at least 1–1½ percentage points of GDP.
Vietnam’s exchange rate continues to be pegged de facto to the U.S. dollar, with the dong/U.S.
dollar rate depreciating by about 1 percent a year. In January 2007, in the face of large capital
inflows, the trading band of the dong versus the U.S. dollar was widened from +/-0.25 percent to
+/-0.5 percent around the daily reference rate set by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), and the
dong was temporarily allowed to appreciate modestly. However, this appreciation has been
more than reversed since March. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) of the dong has
depreciated by about 8 percent since end-2005, but the real effective exchange rate (REER)
has been broadly stable, and remains close to its long-run average.
The improved investment climate generated by WTO accession contributed to an
unprecedented boom in the stock market. The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Market Price Index rose
by 144.5 percent in 2006, and by another 51 percent in early 2007, before receding by about
20 percent during March–July. A rapid expansion of the number of listed companies spurred
rising foreign and domestic investment in shares, with the latter partly financed by local banks.
The stock market’s capitalization soared from US$0.5 billion at end-2005 to around
US$18 billion (25 percent of GDP) as of end-July 2007.
The near-term outlook remains broadly favorable, and Vietnam has good prospects for
sustained growth and poverty reduction over the medium term, provided that the government
can take timely action to rein in demand pressures. GDP is projected to expand by about
8–8¼ percent in 2007–08, underpinned by continued strong growth in exports, investment, and
private consumption. The increase in domestic demand would likely lead to a widening of the
current account deficit to 3–3½ percent of GDP, but that deficit would continue to be
comfortably financed with official development assistance, FDI, and other private capital inflows.
However, this favorable outlook is subject to risks. Large foreign exchange inflows could
prevent an effective tightening of monetary policy, and continued rapid credit growth, together

3
with a weak regulatory environment, could threaten domestic financial stability. On the fiscal
front, large increases in public wages and pensions, and heavy on-lending to state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), could compound inflationary pressures, and lead to a rapid accumulation of
public debt. Insufficient improvement in banking sector and SOE governance, and continued
state-sector dominance of key industries, could pose additional risks, as sub-optimal lending
and investment by these sectors would weaken the efficiency of investment and possibly place
additional future burdens on the budget.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Vietnam for its impressive record of economic growth and
poverty reduction over the last few years, and welcomed its historic accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO). The near-term outlook remains favorable, with exports expected to
continue to grow and domestic demand and investment remaining strong. At the same time,
inflation has crept up, and credit growth and equity prices have risen sharply and substantially.
The current account deficit continues to be more than financed by official development
assistance and private inflows, especially foreign investment, but significant inflows of portfolio
capital in the context of the present level of financial sector development and the pegged
exchange rate regime could expose Vietnam’s external position to risks.
Against this background, Directors welcomed recent measures toward greater monetary
restraint, which will help to lower inflation and safeguard external stability. They supported the
authorities’ plans to slow significantly the growth of monetary and credit aggregates. To ensure
that the official monetary and credit targets for end-2007 are achieved, Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue to sterilize foreign currency inflows, as needed. Directors supported
the authorities’ request for technical assistance in the eventual transition to an inflation-targeting
framework.
Directors agreed with the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate of the dong is aligned with
medium-term fundamentals. They welcomed the authorities’ plan to introduce greater exchange
rate flexibility as the institutional and operational infrastructure for it is set in place. Greater
flexibility could facilitate disinflation and de-dollarization over the medium term, while reducing
the need for intervention and sterilization. It would also create an incentive to manage exchange
rate risks effectively, and protect external stability in the event of an abrupt reversal of capital
inflows.
Directors called on the authorities to maintain a prudent and restrained fiscal policy. Given the
need to curb inflationary pressures in the short run, the non-oil fiscal deficit needs to be placed
on a declining path as soon as possible. Directors therefore welcomed the government’s
decision to postpone further large increases in public sector wages. Most Directors
recommended that any revenue windfalls be saved. Directors encouraged the authorities to
complete as soon as possible the pass-through of higher oil prices to domestic administered

4
prices, while ensuring that an adequate social safety net is in place to protect low-income
groups. Directors also encouraged the authorities to ensure that state-owned enterprise (SOE)
projects are not funded through the issuance of new sovereign bonds.
Directors stressed that over the medium term, a concerted effort to boost revenues and curb
expenditure growth will be required to protect debt sustainability. Planned tax reforms will need
to be carefully designed, and tax administration should continue to be strengthened. Civil
service administrative reforms, including the implementation of a more differentiated, meritbased wage structure and overall rationalization of employment, also need to be pursued.
Directors noted that efficiencies in building critical infrastructure could be secured by improving
the screening of public projects, and encouraging private investment in those that are
commercially viable.
Directors observed that the opening up of Vietnam’s financial system has heightened the
importance of banking system reform. They supported the government’s plans to equitize the
main state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). In this regard, Directors welcomed the recent
approval of the equalization plan for Vietcombank. They considered that allowing scope for
foreign strategic investors to participate in SOCB equitizations would help strengthen SOCB
governance. Directors encouraged the authorities to expedite plans to grant the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) adequate autonomy and authority to carry out monetary policy aimed at price
stability and effective bank supervision. They supported the authorities’ request for technical
assistance to build financial sector institutional capacity.
Directors shared the authorities’ concerns about the risks posed by possible overheating in the
stock market, and they supported the measures to tighten prudential controls on banks’
securities-related lending. Improved securities market regulation, including steps to discourage
insider trading and money laundering, will be essential to protect the stability and integrity of the
capital market.
Directors called for faster SOE reform in order to enhance competitiveness and efficiency. They
welcomed plans to expand the equitization of SOEs, and urged the authorities to be open to
participation in the equitizations by foreign strategic investors. They stressed that related-party
lending within new SOE groups involved in a mix of industrial and financial operations should be
prohibited. Directors supported steps to implement ahead of schedule WTO-mandated tariff
reductions, which will also enhance efficiency.
Directors welcomed the recent publication of the first external debt bulletin by the Ministry of
Finance. They encouraged the authorities to improve transparency further, including by
strengthening reporting on external debt of SOEs, portfolio capital flows, and government and
SOE bond issues.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for Vietnam
and Narayanan Raman, Advisor to Executive Director
October 26, 2007
1.
On behalf of the Vietnamese authorities, we would like to thank staff for constructive
and productive discussions and the excellent set of papers. As the report notes, there is
substantial concurrence between staff and authorities on the outlook, and many of the issues
flagged in it are also key policy concerns for the authorities. Our statement will mainly seek
to highlight recent developments in and the outlook for the Vietnamese economy; and outline
what the authorities see as the key challenges going forward. In this respect, we will
highlight key policy actions undertaken and the rationale for those actions.
Latest Economic Developments and Policy Stance
2.
The Vietnamese economy grew rapidly by 8.2 percent in the first nine months of
2007, with growth in the third quarter being the fastest in 10 years. With real GDP
traditionally growing more rapidly in the fourth quarter, the Vietnamese authorities expect to
achieve a growth rate of 8.4–8.5 percent for the year, exceeding the 8.2 percent growth
experienced in 2006 and consistent with their projections. Vietnam achieved this sustained
growth by pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy, centred on WTO ascension.
As a result of this outward orientation, both foreign direct investment and official
development assistance reached record highs in 2007. In this respect, the authorities’
commitment to reform has proven wholehearted and durable, and its success has made it
possible to build broad support for its key elements.
3.
The strong growth in 2007 continues to be supported by broad-based expansion in all
sectors of the economy, most notably industry and services. For the authorities, the recovery
in agriculture following the difficulties experienced due to disease in the early part of the
year is particularly gratifying. This is not only due to the success of their prompt and decisive
actions in dealing with difficulties, but also because agriculture remains a major sector in the
economy. Improvements in agricultural production are important in Vietnam’s overall
strategy to reduce poverty and ensure the fruits of liberalization and growth are spread as
widely as possible.
4.
The performance of the external sector is a key facet of recent growth and
development. Export turnover as of September 2007 increased of 19.4% compared to the
same period a year ago. Similarly, foreign capital inflows also set new records. Foreign direct
investment increased to US$9.6 billion, while the commitment for official development
assistance rose to US$4.5 billion. In addition, there were record inflows of other private
capital flows, including portfolio capital. Greater activity in Vietnam’s capital markets,
driven by the on-going process of listing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and other private
firms, attracted US$6.2 billion in investment funds in 2007.

2

5.
To be sure, macroeconomic management in an environment of sustained strong
growth and rapid structural change has been challenging. Strong domestic demand
conditions, coupled with higher prices for key commodities, most notably energy, had put
some upward pressure on prices in 2007. To this end, monetary policy has responded
flexibly, firmly and through market-based mechanisms, in line with the authorities’ guiding
principles. The evolution of the monetary policy stance in Vietnam reflects this. In the first
five months of the year, the central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), maintained its
reserve requirement ratio in order to stabilize the money market. However, as credit growth
accelerated in an environment of ample liquidity, the SBV moved decisively in June to
double the ratio. In addition, the SBV stepped up its efforts to sterilize large capital inflows,
particularly those related to short-term funds attracted by the strong performance of the
domestic equity market. The authorities are also keen to stress the close coordination
between monetary and fiscal policy as an important aspect in their macroeconomic
management.
6.
However, the authorities also note that constraints in supply have also been a source
of price pressures. To this end, the authorities have moved decisively to increase supply by
reducing import tariffs, and have taken action to reduce supply bottlenecks through
improvements in infrastructure. Given that inflation in Vietnam is driven by a variety of
factors, the authorities believe that targeted solutions would achieve better results than broad
actions, including monetary tightening. Monetary tightening and fiscal restraint do have
important roles to play, but in the case of a developing country like Vietnam, alleviating
supply-driven constraints must also be part of the policy mix. To the extent price increases
reflect supply-side constraints, tighter monetary and fiscal policies would certainly not
suffice. In the same vein, it is also clear that sequencing structural reforms will need to be
flexible in order to manage short-term challenges. Therefore, while the authorities remain
committed to progressively removing administrative controls on prices, timing is an issue in
an environment supply-driven price pressures.
7.
Monetary management in Vietnam, which has to cope with a dynamic and fastevolving financial system and strong credit growth, is challenging. Credit growth remains
strong as lending for activities, including for investment in the equity markets, has increased
significantly in the last two years. Some of the growth is also related to funds needed to
complete government projects, but this demand will subside as projects are completed. In
addition, it is equally clear that the growing sophistication of the financial sector and the
monetisation of the economy will continue to drive rapid structural change. On one hand,
these developments are welcome, as they would make monetary policy more effective.
However, in the short-term, the challenges of such rapid structural change means caution in
judgment is needed to achieve the goals of policy without unduly constraining growth.

3
8.
To this end, Vietnam continues to seek technical assistance from the Fund. In
particular, the authorities have proposed additional work on developing the tools for
successfully adopting and implementing an inflation-targeting framework. The authorities
wish to inform the Board that they see the Fund playing a key role in providing assessments
and feedback on the proposed core inflation measures the SBV has developed;
communicating these assessments to the Vietnamese and international public; and providing
guidance on communicating the SBV’s monetary stance effectively. The thoughtful and
comprehensive plan developed by the SBV, and the high degree of ownership exhibited by
the authorities demonstrates a strong commitment to upgrade the quality of macroeconomic
management, a commitment that the Fund is a unique position to foster.
9.
On fiscal policy, the authorities continue to feel that staff assessments are too
pessimistic, particularly the judgment that the fiscal stance in 2007 will be eased. On the
contrary, the performance in 2007 points to a fiscal deficit that remains contained below
budgeted levels. The budget does not envisage additional expenditure plans or extra-ordinary
revenue shortfalls. Therefore, the characterization that policy is “loose” is unwarranted.
Further, the commitment to ensuring economic stability has also ensured that steps have been
taken to safeguard this restraint. Staff has rightly pointed to wage restraint as a prime
example and the authorities will seek to build on these gains. Going forward, the authorities
remain committed to expanding revenue sources, which would entail pursuit of a prudent and
transparent fiscal stance and progress in broadening the tax base. In this regard, the Ministry
of Finance has announced and provided full disclosure of off-balance sheet fiscal items on its
website. Further reform on the horizon would be centred on implementing the Law on Tax
Administration. The Law, which came into effect on July 1, 2007, enhances transparency in
the regulations and increases the power of tax administration agencies to enforce the tax
rules. The implementing regulations for the Law on Tax are now being developed.
10.
The authorities concur with staff that Vietnam’s external position is sustainable and
consistent with underlying fundamentals. In particular, the authorities note a strengthening of
the reserves position due to sustained long-term private investment inflows, indicating the
attractiveness of the Vietnamese economy. The authorities also concur with staff that the
Vietnamese dong is appropriately valued and note the call to allow for more flexibility in the
exchange rate. In this regard, the SBV reiterates its commitment to greater flexibility, and has
taken steps towards this goal. The central bank is currently in the process of drafting the
implementing regulations under the new Foreign Exchange Ordinance, which envisions
greater exchange rate flexibility and a less-rigid exchange rate management regime.
However, the authorities caution that the speed, though not direction, of the shift will need to
take into account prevailing market conditions. In anticipation of this move towards greater
flexibility, the SBV is working on a plan to increase the convertibility of the dong and to
accelerate de-dollarization. In the meantime, the operational focus of the central bank is on
reducing risks in the short term while building capacity in the financial sector to manage the
greater flexibility over the medium term.

4

Outlook and Structural Policies
11.
The authorities agree with staff that strong growth will be sustained in 2008. Further,
they concur with staff’s view that the external sector would strengthen while inflationary
pressures would ease somewhat. To the extent that the growth picture for 2008 is similar as
the one seen in 2007, macroeconomic policy will respond in a similar manner, with an
appropriate monetary stance and prudent fiscal management.
12.
A key factor that would influence the short- and medium-term outlook would be
implementation of structural reforms. In this area, the authorities have announced an
ambitious programme, centred on adjusting to a more externally-oriented economy. Based on
the government’s Post-WTO Plan of Action, each ministry is now issuing its own Plan of
Action in order to implement WTO commitments. There is also progress in combating
corruption. Following the passage of the Anti-Corruption Law, the government has enacted
its Plan of Action on the matter. As a first step, Steering Committees on Anti-corruption at
the central and local levels have been set up and put into operation.
13.
The reform of SOEs is a key plank of structural reform efforts in Vietnam. Staff has
outlined in some detail the progress on this front in terms of regularising their status and
operations as commercial entities, efforts at addressing their financial reporting, valuation of
assets and, in many cases, partial privatization and listing, or equitization. As staff also point
out, not only has the progress on this front been impressive but it is being expedited further.
However, the authorities wish to highlight that staff’s assessment on the use of public funds
is not accurate. Vietnam does not have a policy of concessional public financing for SOEs.
To the extent that they are publicly-owned enterprises, funds for re-capitalization, where
needed, would naturally come from the government as the current owners of these entities.
However, public funds are no longer earmarked for SOE projects. For instance, the
authorities have abolished the export assistance fund, while the Development Assistance
Fund has been turned into Vietnam Development Bank, which will be run as a normal bank
going forward. Thus, SOEs that need to borrow to meet project financing requirements
would be expected to do so on commercial terms, similar to other enterprises.
14.
To complement the reform of the SOEs and to build an indigenous supply chain, the
Vietnamese authorities are also giving due attention to small- and medium-scale enterprise
(SME) development. To this end, the authorities are actively implementing the Master Plan
for SME Development, 2006-10. Some localities have already developed their own SME
development plans and have established implementing units.

5
Financial Sector: Developments in the Regulatory Framework and Structural Reforms
15.
The rapid growth of the financial system has been another positive feature of
Vietnam’s recent development experience. The growth of the sector mirrors the growth of the
economy in general, and is an important supportive factor behind rapid real GDP expansion.
Staff’s assessments quite rightly point out the peculiar challenges such rapid growth has
placed on all concerned, including economic planners and regulators. Nevertheless, the
authorities remain committed to fostering financial development and expanding financial
inclusion. The main task will be to balance the competing needs for rapid development
against ensuring the regulatory and risk management infrastructure is able to keep pace.
16.
Regulatory developments have been guided both by the short-term concerns raised by
rapid credit growth and the long-term aspiration to move to an updated and modern
regulatory model. In April of this year, the SBV issued revised regulations on loan
classification and provision towards better credit quality, and improved control of credit
risks. Following that, a directive to the control of the scope and quality of credit to securities
investment in order was issued in May in order to ensure orderly development of the
country’s nascent equity market and also as a measure to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Going forward, the authorities continue to put in place elements of a risk-based supervision
framework. To this end, work on developing risk warning and assessment instruments,
setting up risk-based supervisory procedures and formulating minimum requirements on risk
management for credit institutions are all in progress. Staff’s positive assessment of the
authorities’ request for technical assistance in this matter is welcome, showing again the
congruence between staff and the authorities on key policy challenges in the immediate term.
17.
In terms of structural reforms in the financial sector, the large state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs) are all at various stages of equitization. A number have already
completed the process and will be listed in due course, with the first initial public offering to
take place in the near term. This reform process will include room for substantial foreign
participation, as was seen in the similar process that was put in place for insurers in Vietnam.
As staff has pointed out, foreign financial institutions have the scope to take substantial
stakes in the reformed SOCBs of up to 15 percent, an increase from the previous limit of 10
percent. The authorities also would reaffirm that staff are correct in noting that flexibility to
raise the level of foreign ownership exists on a case-by-case basis. In addition, as the
excellent chapter on trade liberalisation in the special issues paper notes, the authorities are
moving forward on financial liberalization expeditiously.
Conclusion
18.
The Vietnamese economy stands on a momentous threshold. The country will
transition from low-income to middle-income status in the very near future, a success story
that testifies to the importance of maintaining an outward orientation in order to embrace the

6
benefits of international trade and investment. Balancing that, of course, would be structural
reforms and capacity building – including developing the legal and regulatory framework,
improving the depth of financial markets and improving human resources – in order to
mitigate risks arising from globalization. Vietnam’s authorities have rightly recognized both
the opportunities and risks and have endeavoured to strike the appropriate balance between
the two. Nevertheless, the authorities also reiterate their belief that in the longer term, there is
no trade-off between stability and growth; indeed, without the former, the latter could not be
sustained. This philosophy underscores their commitment to economic and financial stability,
even under challenging conditions. In this regard, the Fund has played a key role in assisting
the authorities, especially during this year’s Consultations, which rightly focused on these
institutional capacities in an environment of strong growth and relative stability. For these
efforts, and for the long-term engagement between the Fund and Vietnam, the authorities and
we would like to record our appreciation to staff and Management.
