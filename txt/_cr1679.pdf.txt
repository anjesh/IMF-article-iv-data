IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Montenegro
On February 19, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Montenegro. 1
Montenegro’s economy has rebounded in the past year, and strong growth looks set to
continue in 2016, at just over 4 percent. The medium-term outlook is boosted by the
construction of the Bar-Boljare highway. The government intends to pursue other fiscal
incentives and public infrastructure projects to promote economic development and
connectivity. However, although the government’s growth strategy can bring substantial
gains, it also carries sizable risks, notably to the public finances. Montenegro also remains
vulnerable to fluctuations in external demand and global financial conditions.
Recent fiscal measures that reduce revenues and ease restraints on current spending add to
budget pressures from the highway. Even with relatively high growth, staff projects deficits
of around 8 percent of GDP over the next three years, contributing to substantial financing
needs. During that time, gross public debt is expected to reach 80 percent of GDP, from
66 percent in 2015.
Increased growth should gradually boost bank profitability and allow lending conditions to
ease further. Yet low provisioning and weak asset quality remain concerns, and could hold
back credit growth if not properly dealt with.
With shrinking fiscal buffers, and because the economy lacks control over its own currency,
the ability to absorb shocks depends crucially on the flexibility and competitiveness of the
real economy. Low labor productivity and employment hold back potential growth. In this

context, the process of aligning labor laws with those of the EU provides an opportunity to
improve the flexibility of labor market outcomes, boost participation rates, and reduce
informality.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Montenegro’s strong growth performance and the favorable
outlook. However, they noted that the heavy reliance on large infrastructure projects to
support growth also poses risks to fiscal and external sustainability. Accordingly, Directors
emphasized the need for sound macroeconomic policies to address these risks. They also
encouraged the authorities to reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and to implement
structural reforms to boost potential growth and increase resilience.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to address vulnerabilities and looked
forward to the preparation of a credible fiscal consolidation plan. They underscored the need
for immediate and durable consolidation measures to maintain sustainability, contain risks,
and preserve market access. In this context, they observed that new pension provisions and
social allowances, planned public wage hikes, and strategic tax incentives would add to
budget pressures. They called for measures to contain the public sector wage bill, improve
the sustainability of the pension system, and strengthen revenue collection to reduce the
public debt to GDP ratio to 60 percent of GDP over the medium term. Directors suggested
that these policy measures be complemented with a stronger fiscal framework, including
detailed medium-term plans and public financial management reform.
Directors noted that the financial system is largely stable, and that bank capitalization and
liquidity appear adequate in general. However, the still high level of non-performing loans,
low provisioning and bank profitability, and weak asset quality are sources of vulnerability.
Directors recommended that policy recommendations from the Financial Sector Assessment
Program be implemented to address these vulnerabilities. In particular, Directors noted the
need for an independent asset quality review of banks and measures to enhance emergency
liquidity assistance. They also recommended that steps be taken to enhance the regulatory,
supervisory and resolution frameworks, and to develop the macro-prudential framework.
Directors emphasized that structural reforms should help boost potential growth and
competitiveness. Specifically, they noted the need to improve labor market flexibility and the
investment environment, and to reduce non-wage disincentives to employment.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 8, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Strong growth this year looks set to continue into the medium term. The authorities are
seeking to accelerate growth and development, mainly through new infrastructure
projects, but also with fiscal incentives. Although this growth strategy can bring
substantial gains, it also poses sizeable risks, notably to public finances, and also in terms
of the allocation of capital and financial stability.
Gross debt has increased substantially over the past year and looks likely to increase
significantly, to 80 percent of GDP. Staff recommends immediate and durable fiscal
consolidation measures to limit risks to the public finances and to ensure favorable
conditions for funding, particularly to the extent that further infrastructure projects
would require additional public debt. Fiscal consolidation is also important for improving
external balance, especially as the economy lacks independent monetary policy. A
credible strategy to safeguard the health of the public finances would address
longstanding problems with public expenditures, such as the very high level of spending
on pensions and public sector wages. Measures should be supported by strengthening
the fiscal framework and public financial management.
Montenegro is still dealing with the fallout of a boom-bust credit cycle, and bank
lending remains relatively weak. The acceleration in aggregate demand is likely to
improve profitability for most banks, facilitating gradually easier financial conditions. The
authorities are considering policies to boost lending, but some of these could have
unintended negative consequences. Restrictions on lending rates could reduce credit
supply to riskier borrowers, such as small businesses. Attempting to increase lending
competition by granting more bank licenses could worsen financial stability. Following
the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program for Montenegro, staff recommends an
independent asset quality review of all banks—beginning with the weakest—and other
steps to bolster the resilience of the financial system.
Improved labor productivity and economic flexibility are crucial to complement the
authorities’ investment-led growth strategy. Because the country’s capacity to absorb
shocks is limited by the currency regime and limited fiscal space, the authorities should
build on current reform initiatives, such as improving the flexibility of labor market
outcomes and continuing to improve the business climate.

CONTEXT
1.
Montenegro is a small economy facing a number of challenges to secure durable
and stable growth. Output is concentrated (mainly in tourism, energy, and hard commodities),
exposing it to fluctuations in external markets and terms of trade. The economy also depends
heavily on external financing. A rigid labor market restricts the capacity to absorb shocks, while
unfavorable demographics and low labor participation hamper growth and pension solvency.
Policies are constrained: fiscal space is limited, the Bar-Boljare highway project (Box 1) will
substantially increase public debt, and euroization implies no independent monetary policy.
Montenegro is seeking EU membership, and a general election will be held in 2016.
Box 1. Montenegro’s Highway Project
The Bar-Boljare highway will connect the main seaport of Bar to Serbia. The authorities see major benefits
from the project, including regional integration, strengthened trade, and road safety.
Only the first 40 km segment connecting the outskirts of Podgorica with the less-developed northern
municipality Kolašin has been costed and budgeted. Construction has been contracted to the China Road
and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), at a cost of EUR 809 million (23 percent of 2014 GDP). Payment to the CRBC
is to be made in U.S. dollars at the euro/US exchange rate at the time the contract was signed; this implies a
fixed cost of USD 1.1 billion, with the foreign exchange risk to be borne by Montenegro. (Euro depreciation
since the agreement was struck is estimated to have increased costs in euros by about 5 percent of GDP.)
The remaining 136 km of the highway has not yet been costed, but is expected to cost less per kilometer as
the first segment presents the most difficult engineering challenges.
China’s ExIm Bank will finance 85 percent of the first section (henceforth “the highway“) through a 20-year
loan, denominated in dollars, with a fixed 2 percent interest rate and a six-year grace period. The authorities
have indicated that the remaining 15 percent of the cost will be financed through a combination of cuts in
non-highway capital spending and/or additional borrowing, with toll revenues used to help fund
repayments once the highway is completed.
Construction officially started on May 11, 2015. The highway will be constructed over a 48-month period.
30 percent of the investment is to be subcontracted to domestic companies.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic activity has rebounded. The tourist season has been buoyant, and
construction has been strong after infrastructure investment delays the previous year. Staff
forecasts growth to be just over 4 percent in 2015, compared with 1¾ percent in 2014. Inflation
averaged 1½ percent last year, after deflation in 2014. But the labor market is not performing as
well: nominal wage growth has been flat since 2011, and unemployment and participation rates
are around 18 and 55 percent, respectively (Figure 1).

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

3.
Banks’ health has improved, but some deficiencies remain (Figure 2). Capital buffers
appear adequate on average, but with a high degree of heterogeneity across institutions.
Liquidity is ample; many banks now have loan-to-deposit ratios well below 100 percent. But
despite high net interest rate margins, profitability remains weak due to high operating costs.
Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have declined, but remain high at 14¾ percent of gross loans, or
about 40 percent inclusive of loans transferred to asset management companies.
4.
Financial conditions are slowly improving. Lending to the private sector increased by
2¼ percent on average in 2015, after a sustained contraction in credit since 2008.1 Nonetheless,
credit growth appears weak when compared with the rebound in growth and high liquidity.
Lending rates have fallen in recent months, but margins over funding costs remain elevated on
average. Banks remain risk averse, citing persistent problems securing and selling collateral,
limited lending opportunities, and weak accounting and reporting practices that make assessing
credit-worthiness difficult.
5.
External imbalances have narrowed. The current account deficit decreased by about
3 percentage points of GDP in the first three quarters 2015, due to an improved service balance
from robust tourism that more than offset a deterioration in the merchandise trade deficit
(associated with machinery imports for the highway construction and deteriorating terms of
trade). FDI flows have also been robust, at 19½ percent of GDP year to date—almost double that
2014. Official data on external stocks are not available for recent years; staff estimates that
external debt will have decreased modestly to 152 percent of GDP by the end of 2015.
6.
Revenue gains have slowed, and expenditures continue to stress the public finances
(Figure 3). Sizable revenue overperformance in 2014 was matched by equally sizable expenditure
overruns of 3 percent of GDP. Implementation of the 2015 budget has also slipped: non-highway
expenditure overruns are estimated at 1½ percent of GDP, compounded by modest revenue
underperformance.2 Unanticipated expenditures (e.g., from activated guarantees and arrears that
include unanticipated legal rulings against the government) are a persistent problem.3

1

Excluding receivables (which include deposits with other banks) average total loan growth is estimated at about
1 percent.
2

Notable contributions to the loosening of spending in 2015 came from unfreezing pensions, reducing the
emergency consolidation tax rate, and new subsidies for strategic sectors, all of which are set to continue in 2016.

3

Highway construction delays imply under-spending of planned highway expenditures of around 1 percent of
GDP in 2015; this will add to spending over in the following years.

transit more difficult than through other
Western Balkan countries.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The government has adopted a major growth initiative to boost economic
development and connectivity. This follows a consensus reached between Western Balkan and
European leaders in Berlin in 2014 and is viewed by the authorities as a vital complement to
Montenegro’s EU accession plans. The authorities want to exploit comparative advantages in
tourism, increase strategic transport linkages, and build capacity as a regional energy hub. The
highway is but the first of a series of large infrastructure projects to be completed over the next
15 years.
9.
Growth is expected to increase, but so too is public and external debt. Staff projects
growth of 4.1 percent in 2015, accelerating further in 2016 as highway expenditure increases.

In the baseline, credit conditions are
expected to gradually ease as these
projects boost aggregate demand in the
rest of the economy, improving bank
profitability and allowing more lending
to be extended as bank balance sheets
strengthen. Credit is therefore expected
to increase in line with aggregate
demand.



Low import prices due to recent falls in commodity prices and high unemployment will
likely restrain price pressures and help prevent external competitiveness from
deteriorating.



Gross general government debt is expected to increase substantially, from 66 percent of
GDP currently to a peak of 80 percent in 2018 (Annex I). As the baseline only includes
spending on the first stage of the Bar-Boljare highway and no other major infrastructure
projects, debt falls thereafter.4 Additional projects would affect growth and potentially
debt, depending on financing.5 Funding needs average 12 percent of GDP from 2016 to
2020.6

4

The first stage of the highway is the only infrastructure project that can be costed at the time of writing. Other
yet-to-be quantified projects (such as the mooted Trans-Adriatic highway and the second thermal plant at
Plevlja) are not included in the projections.
5

All references to public debt henceforth refer to gross general government debt.

This refers to total funding needs, not unidentified funding needs, and includes highway financing. Without the
highway loan, average needs are [9] percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MONTENEGRO



The current account deficit is expected to average 18 percent of GDP over that period,
because of the heavy import content of infrastructure projects and low private saving
rates. Hence, external debt is also expected to increase, from its estimated current level
of 152 percent of GDP to above 160 percent over the medium term (Annex II).

10.

Growth is subject to external and domestic risks (RAM p.32).



External risks are largely to the downside: large public financing needs and reliance on
foreign capital expose the country to changes in financial conditions, especially over the
next three years as debt escalates. Montenegro is also vulnerable to fluctuations in
external demand, especially to tourism, which is substantially dependent on incomes in
Russia, Serbia, and the euro area.



Domestic risks: The growth outlook is very sensitive to the implementation of large
investment projects. On the downside, delays in their implementation—as seen
recently—would undermine growth. However, more investment projects—such as new
public infrastructure projects—would boost growth. Such projects could add further
pressure on public finances. If sovereign risk premia were to increase; the credit recovery
and private investment could be crowded out. Failure to clean banks’ balance sheets
could also constrain a recovery in credit. Alternatively, a recovery in lending could be
associated with an increase in concentration risks, to the extent that banks extend credit
to a limited number of credit-worthy clients. Fiscal discipline could wane in the run-up to
elections, and public guarantees could severely stress public finances if called.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Policy discussions focused on risks. Montenegro has substantial infrastructure needs,
and public investment could substantially boost growth. However, the authorities’ growth
agenda comes with risks. Discussions focused on ways to: (i) contain fiscal sustainability risks,
(ii) sustainably revitalize credit conditions, (iii) safeguard financial sector stability, and (iv) boost
competitiveness and economic flexibility.

A. Fiscal Policies
12.
The authorities have taken some steps to contain underlying fiscal pressures. They
expressed their commitment to managing debt vulnerabilities in the period ahead. Some notable
initiatives include:


New fiscal rules have converged toward Maastricht criteria, and the authorities’ Economic
Reform Program (ERP) acknowledges the need to stem the acceleration in public debt.



Pension reforms adopted in 2011 have increased the average starting age for receiving
pensions and decreased the volume of disability pensions.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO



The government has fully divested from the aluminum plant KAP. Government
guarantees are currently mostly directed to infrastructure and SMEs, although the pace of
their recent increase (by two thirds, to 14 percent of GDP) raises concerns that they might
be misdirected.



The authorities intend to improve local government finances, citing room to reduce
overstaffing.

13.
The 2016 budget shows improving fiscal balances over the medium term. Revenues
are expected to increase, although more slowly than nominal GDP. Nominal expenditures will
increase substantially from 2016 onwards: new pension provisions and social allowances for
mothers with three or more children will add approximately 1¼ percent of GDP in spending; a
recently-adopted bill increases public wages by 5–15 percent in 2016; and legislation to tackle
the grey economy is still pending. Expenditure levels are assumed to be nearly constant from
2016 onwards across most items. Precise policies to restrain expenditures over the medium
term—including on public wages and pensions—are not identified.
14.
Taking into account likely budget pressures, staff projects a substantial
deterioration in the public finances.


Notwithstanding the steps taken to contain fiscal pressures (¶11), the budget will be
stressed by expenditure pressures (¶12), and the reduction in the crisis tax rate will
further erode the revenue base. Staff expects the general government deficit to increase
to 7½ percent of GDP in 2015 and to increase further in the medium term with increased
highway spending.



With substantial refinancing needs, staff projects public debt to reach 80 percent of GDP
within three years. Staff’s projected deficits and debt are larger than those of the
authorities, reflecting slightly weaker average growth and higher nominal deficits.

The depreciation of the euro since the signing of the contract has sharply increased the
cost of the project. Over the medium term, the euro is expected to appreciate slightly,
somewhat offsetting these cost increases, but interest expenditures are assumed to
revert to previous levels.

Infrastructure projects could substantially affect fiscal developments. Growth
projections are highly sensitive to the profile of highway spending, given the scale of the
expenditures.7 The authorities intend to raise the remaining 15 percent of the cost of the
highway from a combination of offsetting spending cuts, concessions, and tolls. The 2015
eurobond issue was substantially oversubscribed; nonetheless, if new debt financing is needed
for the rest of the highway or new projects, then pressure could be placed on sovereign interest
rates.8
16.
To limit risks and maintain favorable conditions for funding, staff recommends
additional consolidation. In addition to containing fiscal risks, fiscal consolidation is also
important for improving the country’s external debt position, especially as the economy lacks
independent monetary policy. To illustrate the scale of consolidation that would be needed, staff
calculates that new measures from 2016 delivering an extra 1½ percentage point of GDP (with
respect to staff’s baseline path) and a 1½ percentage point primary surplus sustained after the
7

Highway spending (adjusted for pre-payments) is projected to be EUR 40, 240, 240, 224, and 65 million from
2015 to 2019.
8

Operating risks could be mitigated by financing via Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), but only if contracts
ensure the private sector bears financing, construction and demand risks. Note that debt incurred from a PPP
would stay on the public balance sheet to the extent that the government gains the rewards from the asset (in
terms of GFSM 2014: if the contract is an “operating lease” instead of a “financial lease”).

Achieving such a consolidation would require addressing weaknesses in social
expenditures, public sector wages, and the tax system. With government spending
approaching 50 percent of GDP, durable expenditure control is essential, particularly over public
sector wages and pensions, which together account for more than half of total spending
(Figure 4). Revenue shares are already high, suggesting limits from increasing taxes, but options
exist to boost revenues without creating a drag on growth.

Pensions and Social Expenditures: The pension system is unsustainable on current
demographic and labor market trends. Reintroducing a pension freeze would help in the
short run, but achieving sustainability will require some combination of accelerating
increases in the average retirement age, reducing payments, or increasing contributions
(Box 2). New pension and social protection provisions have been passed into law, which
worsen the structural deficit; the laws should be revoked.

9

Montenegro has a fiscal rule that notionally adopts the Maastricht criteria of 3 percent deficit and 60 percent
gross general government debt. However, there are no automatic spending caps, and no deadlines for
implementing fiscal measures.

Box 2. Pension System Viability
The pension funding gap is large—around
4 percent of GDP—and dominates Montenegro’s
structural fiscal deficit. The pension system is
stretched by high levels of early retirement and low
labor participation rates and levels of formal

efficient policy response. Stabilizing pension spending will require some combination of increasing the
average retirement age; increasing payroll taxes; and/or decreasing benefits. The most growth-friendly option
would be to raise the average retirement age, which could be facilitated by accelerating the phase-in of higher
retirement ages or preventing early retirements. However, progress to raise the retirement age would be slow,
as many early retirees are already in the system. In the interim, a pension indexation freeze—to be lifted when a
broader pension reform strategy is implemented—should be introduced to contain fiscal pressures.

_____________

Currently, the de facto average retirement age is only 61 years for men and 59 years for women.

This is based on the authorities’ demographic projections and assumes employment grows at the average rate prevailing in
the post crisis period (2008:Q3–2015:Q2).

For example, the recent pension law grants early retirement to employees of bankrupted state-owned enterprises.



Public sector wage bill: The public wage bill is high even compared with regional peers.
Staff recommends freezing public wages in the short run, formalizing a 3–1 attrition rule
that has intermittently been in place, and reducing numbers of local government
employees.



Taxes: Regional competition to attract investment limits the scope to raise corporate
income taxes, while keeping personal rates low assists the authorities’ efforts to raise
participation from very low levels and combat informality. Nonetheless, there are
alternatives: small increases in tourist taxes and VAT could bring immediate revenue
gains, and tax exemptions for “strategic” sectors should be revoked.10 Recent decreases
in the crisis tax rate could be partially reversed without significant damage to the labor
market. The tax base could be broadened by addressing substantial deficiencies in tax
administration, such as taxpayer registration, filing and payment enforcement, tax debt
management, and taxpayer appeals.

18.
Consolidation objectives could be immediately met with a combination of
expenditure and revenue measures. Table 1 shows a number of feasible options to meet and
even exceed consolidation of 1½ percentage points of GDP. To achieve immediate savings, some
revenue measures would be needed, but targeting expenditures—particularly the public sector
wage bill and social security expenditures—would be crucial to ensure a durable consolidation.


Small value added, tourism, and property tax increases could yield immediate gains of
about ½ percent of GDP.11 Restoring the crisis tax rate from 11 percent to its original
level of 13 percent—still less than the recent rate of 15 percent—would yield gains of
about ⅓ of a percentage point.



Pension reform, although essential for long-run solvency, would likely have very modest
effects over the projection period. But repealing the new social provisions in the 2016
budget would bring substantial savings. Immediate gains could also be achieved through
freezes on public sector wages and pensions; these, with the addition of cuts to transfers
to public corporations, could deliver fiscal savings of about 1¼ percent of GDP over the
medium term.12

10

The authorities are supporting their growth strategy with a wide range of giveaways on taxes on and social
security contributions from “strategic” sectors. This raises concerns about fairness, in addition to those about the
direct fiscal costs and creeping subsidization of private business.
11

Raising VAT to a uniform rate of 19 percent could notionally yield gains of 1½ percent of GDP.

12

Subsidies are significant, but are mostly directed at ensuring EU compliance, so are not assumed to be cut.

New measures should be spelt out in detail in annual medium-term fiscal plans.



Such plans should reflect the most likely fiscal revenue and expenditure outcomes of
policy measures; anticipate their direct, indirect and hidden costs; and articulate
contingency plans to deal with unanticipated shocks. Furthermore, to bolster fiscal
credibility and maintain access to funding on the most favorable terms, they should
specify how public debt is to be restored below 60 percent, in line with the fiscal rule.



In support of these plans, fiscal transparency and oversight would be strengthened by
establishing an independent fiscal council, developing effective fiscal risk management,
introducing program/performance budgeting, and moving to accrual accounting and
associated reporting.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities acknowledged risks to the public finances and believe them to be
manageable.


The budget foresees expenditures remaining nearly constant in nominal terms after 2016;
discussions focused on the potential for more specific plans to support the budget. The
authorities clarified that they expect current expenditure to be kept below current
revenue, per the fiscal rules adopted in the budget Law.



Staff and authorities discussed key assumptions behind fiscal projections. In addition to
different views about prospects for expenditures, the authorities expect growth to

MONTENEGRO

average around 4 percent per annum over the medium-term, higher than in staff’s
projections, and bringing higher revenues than in previous years.
The authorities presented their views on debt management. Based on market demand
seen earlier in the year, they expect continued strong demand for Eurobond issuances,
albeit with higher yields over the medium term. However, they would not rely exclusively
on raising new debt; in particular, concessions and toll revenues could generate revenues
for infrastructure projects and debt repayments.



B. Credit Policies
21.
The collapse of the lending boom resulted in a long period of deleveraging (see
Analysis of Macrofinancial Linkages, Appendix II). Only now does the level of credit appear to be
in line with those seen in Western Balkan peers, and the level of private sector indebtedness
remains elevated, potentially inhibiting credit demand (Appendix II, section C). In more recent
years, banks have sought to restore profitability by raising spreads of lending rates over deposits;
hence, lending rates have remained elevated even as deposit rates have fallen. More recently,
interest rates have started to fall, but credit growth remains subdued.

Staff analysis shows that output and
credit growth are highly correlated, and the
effects of credit shocks on growth are higher
than for other Western Balkan and emerging
European peers (Appendix II, section D). That
said, output growth is largely driven by
fluctuations in tourism and foreign direct
investment that “bypass” domestic credit
conditions. Hence, tight credit has not
prevented the recent recovery, but growth
could have been stronger if credit conditions
were easier.

23.
The authorities regard easing credit conditions further as crucial for growth. They
are concerned with persistently high levels of NPLs and average lending rates, which they regard
as evidence of market failure. Evidence for excessive rates is mixed. Average lending rates and
margins are not out of line with the region. Across individual banks, the four largest banks
account for ¾ of the loan market, and some have higher margins than average, suggesting some
market power. But in terms of actual credit conditions, lending rates from larger banks tend to be
lower, reflecting relatively lower funding costs and scale efficiencies (Figure 5).
24.
Policies to boost credit may have unintended negative consequences. The
authorities have adopted a voluntary debt resolution framework and drafted a law that caps
interest rates on new loans at no more than 33 percent above the six-month weighted average
lending rate. They are of the view that encouraging new banks to enter the market would boost
competition.13


Many countries have employed interest rate caps, mostly against exploitative rates on
unsecured consumer loans. When used as a device to stimulate credit, the effect has
often been to reduce formal lending and drive riskier borrowers to unregulated lenders.14
Concerns over excessive or usurious interest rates call for consumer protection measures
rather than general lending rate restrictions.15



Increased bank competition could per se reduce lending margins, but might also induce
banks to lend imprudently to preserve or gain market share. With these financial stability
concerns in mind, the supervisor should continue to pay rigorous attention to banks’
business plans, capital levels, and lending concentration risks.



The voluntary restructuring law could usefully spur restructuring, but it only applies to a
small subset of debtors, which might slow reorganization plans that need to involve all
claims. Complementary measures—such as fast-track provisions—could boost the
effectiveness of the law.

13

There are currently 14 banks operating in Montenegro, up from 11 in 2013, for a population of 625,000. A
th
15 bank license application is under review. Some new banks are entering the market to provide local banking
services for firms from the parent’s economy making large direct investments; others see long-term returns as
the economy expands and are seeking to establish brand presence. The larger incumbent banks show little
appetite to take over smaller banks, indicating that any consolidation of the banking sector will be slow.
14

See “Interest Rate Caps Around the World”, World Bank Policy Research Paper 7070.

15

A centralized reporting system of bank-specific lending rates on the central bank’s website could increase
transparency and foster competition, as was successfully done in Ecuador.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

25.
New consumer bankruptcy legislation could impede credit supply and should be
amended or repealed. A new law has been passed to increase protection for borrowers.
However, the law is now delayed due to the lack of supporting institutional and regulatory
infrastructure. Staff is concerned that, if implemented in its current form, the law could
undermine the rights of secured creditors, including with regard to enforcement on a bankrupt
debtor’s house, creating moral hazard and significantly deterring new secured lending
(Appendix III).
26.
Sustainably reducing lending rates will require reducing lending risks. Staff
encourages further progress to reduce lending risk premia that arise from difficulties in assessing
the credit-worthiness of potential borrowers and recovering collateral. An encouraging example
is the introduction of Public Enforcement Officers (PEOs), who focus only on enforcing court
decisions; this has been associated with a significant reduction in enforcement times and is
widely regarded by lenders as a significant step to reducing lending risk premia.16 Lenders
indicate that reducing the frequency of changes to laws affecting lending and more consistent
and predictable enforcement of existing laws would reduce lending risk premia still further.
Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities recognized the potential risks from measures to boost credit
growth but indicated that all options to improve lending conditions should remain “on the
table”. Discussions covered factors affecting lending:


The authorities acknowledged that the voluntary restructuring law applies to a narrow
range of impaired loans, but believe the current laws provide room for restructuring of
packages of loans. They pointed to a steady reduction in the level of NPLs.



Staff expressed concerns that interest rate ceilings could further restrict bank lending to
small businesses. The authorities consider interest rate caps to have a potentially useful
role to play, citing increased lending and declining rates when caps were previously
imposed in 2012. Officials emphasized that the draft law is intended to address usurious
lending rates.



The supervisor clarified that the approval of bank licenses depends on meeting licensing
conditions. Nonetheless, the authorities recognized staff’s concerns about focusing
purely on compliance and the potential for new entrants to under-price risks, and judged
there to be scope to give greater weight to financial stability considerations when
considering applications for new licenses.

16

In the first nine months of public enforcement officer (PEO) operations, 20381 cases were closed out of
60561 total active cases; 15 percent of EUR 231 million total claims (6½ percent of 2014 GDP) were collected.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MONTENEGRO



The authorities agreed that legal ambiguities in the new consumer bankruptcy legislation
and a lack of enabling regulations are problematic and should be corrected.



The authorities also agreed that structural factors could affect lending premia. They cited
progress in reducing risks, such as procedures that cut down the time taken to enforce
court orders and secure collateral.

28.
Montenegro is taking steps to enhance its AML/CFT framework but deficiencies
exist. The revised AML/CFT law significantly strengthens customer due diligence obligations, and
practical steps have been taken to improve the reporting of suspicious transactions. However,
reporting requirements are narrowly focused on “transactions,” rather than “funds.” Adequate
and timely information on the beneficial ownership of legal persons is lacking. Due diligence
measures should be further enhanced to require reporting entities to establish sources of wealth
of beneficial owners on a risk basis. The lack of provisions prohibiting criminals or their associates
from holding a significant or controlling interest in certain non-bank financial sector institutions
and their functions is problematic.17

C. Financial Sector Stability
29.
Financial sector vulnerabilities appear low overall, but with exceptions. The mission
reviewed key findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) that was conducted
alongside the Article IV consultations. The FSAP assessed system-wide solvency and liquidity
indicators as broadly sound. Vulnerabilities relate mainly to high levels of NPLs and/or low
provisioning levels. Some banks—mainly domestic—are weakly capitalized and vulnerable to
shocks, such as an economic slowdown (see FSSA). Increased bank competition is compressing
profitability, with the risk that some banks could lend imprudently to gain market share.
Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) capacity is limited (Annex III).
30.
Low provisioning and weak banks are key concerns (Figure 6). Low IFRS-based
provisions by some banks suggest overly-positive collateral valuations, and some bank audits
have been qualified. Domestic supervisors lack a formal framework that would equip them with
the tools to challenge collateral valuations of banks. An Asset Quality Review (AQR) of all banks
by independent internationally recognized auditors is recommended to review loan classification
and provisioning practices. In the interim, time-bound supervisory action plans (including capital
injection by shareholders) should be developed for “at risk” banks. Work on resolution plans—
with the objectives of maintaining financial system stability, protecting insured depositors, and
minimizing cost to taxpayers—should continue.
31.
Although the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks for banking are robust
in many respects, there is scope to achieve more effective supervision. This includes
improving the identification, measurement, and management of nonperforming assets and
17

Investment management companies, pension fund management companies, or stock brokers.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

liquidity risk. Banks’ ability to reclassify problem assets on the basis of the type of collateral is
problematic and greater clarity and consistency in the prudential categorization of restructured
loans is needed. Priorities for strengthened supervision also include reducing operational,
funding, and credit risks,18 and strengthening banks’ governance frameworks for risk
management.
32.

Euroization presents challenges for safeguarding financial stability.



Montenegro has unilaterally adopted the euro as currency and unit of account. It is
outside of the euro system, and the central bank cannot independently create liquidity
on its own. This significantly constrains the ability to provide lender-of-last resort funding
in cases of emergency. As it stands, the banking system currently appears capable of
handling modest liquidity pressures. But liquidity conditions can deteriorate quickly, and
liquidity support from parent banks—another potential liquidity buffer—cannot be
counted on in times of crisis (Appendix V).



Options to bolster ELA capabilities include a dedicated sub-account set up by the finance
ministry for use by the central bank, together with objective and quantifiable criteria for
public funding in a crisis situation.19

33.
The EU accession process offers an opportunity to develop a macroprudential
policy framework. Macroprudential policies are important given the lack of other monetary
policy instruments; currently, reserve requirements are the only actively-used instrument and are
of limited effectiveness. Convergence to the EU and European Systemic Risk Board’s policies in
advance of EU accession is advisable. Staff recommends that the macro-prudential framework be
broadened and made fully operational. The potential toolkit should include powers over loan-tovalue, debt-service-to-income, and debt-to-income ratios; sectoral capital requirements; and
capital buffers. Lending concentration limits should be carefully monitored.
Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities broadly agreed with the main weaknesses identified by the FSAP
and endorsed many key recommendations. They clarified:


18

All banks are subject to annual on-site inspections; however, the authorities intend to
proceed with an independent AQR of banks and take appropriate actions as needed.
Supervisors closely monitor banks’ classifications of loans, with a particular emphasis on
the borrowers’ capacity to repay, and limit the extent to which collateral assessments can
be used to improve loan classifications.
Including sector concentration and concentration through collateral.

19

Alternatives such as bank fees and pooled liquidity would likely add to costs and be passed on to lending rates
(see FSSA and Appendix V). Further analysis is needed to determine the appropriate size of the sub account.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MONTENEGRO



The central bank agrees that a broader supervisory framework is needed to monitor and
address NPLs. It has drafted a law to extend its supervisory remit to factoring, leasing,
and credit and guarantee operations.



The authorities regard euroization as a vital anchor for price and economic stability. The
authorities intend to align the central bank law with EU regulations by end 2016 that,
because of EU state aid rules, would preclude boosting ELA reserves through an MOF sub
account and prevent direct liquidity assistance from the authorities to banks.



The authorities saw merit in clarifying and establishing new macroprudential tools in
advance of EU accession.

D. Structural Reforms
35.
Productivity, flexibility, and competitiveness are persistent concerns. Sustaining
Montenegro’s large public and external debt burdens requires durable growth and high
competitiveness; coping with external shocks, given lack of fiscal and monetary policy space,
requires the real economy to be flexible. However:
TFP growth has been weak and Montenegro has relied on labor intensity to achieve
growth. However, a declining population and low employment and labor participation
constrain potential output.

attractive alternative to private sector employment. The government funds hiring
schemes, but low retention of subsidized workers indicates skills mismatches.21


Labor costs are high relative to Western Balkan and particularly New Member State
peers. An estimated current account imbalance of 7–8 percentage points of GDP could
imply a real exchange rate imbalance of around 15–25 percent (Appendix VI).

36.

Progress on structural challenges has been mixed.



Labor markets: The authorities are in the process of aligning labor laws with those in the
EU, which should increase flexibility. The consolidation of the provision of social benefits
under the single “social card” could reduce fraud and informality, in addition to lowering
costs. Recent collective agreements have reduced severance costs, but non-wage costs—
including slow dismissal procedures—remain high; the recent hike in employer social
contributions exacerbates this problem.



Business environment: Steady gains have been made to bolster the investment climate
(Figure 7). Montenegro’s Doing Business rankings are comparable with regional peers,
but indicate particular shortcomings in tax compliance, starting businesses, registering
property, and resolving insolvency.



Competitiveness: Montenegro’s export share to the euro area has steadily declined
despite euroization. Non price factors, such as relatively high administrative costs and
inefficient transportation infrastructure, are likely key contributing factors (Figure 8 and
accompanying Selected Issues paper). The authorities are seeking to promote
competitiveness and diversification through sector specific incentive schemes (such as tax
exemptions), but these are difficult to dismantle and can result in a misallocation of
capital. Targeted policies can also have unintended consequences for competition, such
as recent labor legislation that substantially restricts the hiring of non-residents and
increases costs to the tourism sector.

37.

Reforms should continue on improving the underlying conditions for growth.



Despite recent euro depreciation, Montenegro appears relatively costly compared with its
peers. More flexibility in wage outcomes should allow real wages to adjust in line with
productivity. To the extent that private employers compete with the public sector,
maintaining discipline over the public sector wage bill is important for economy-wide
competitiveness. Disincentives for employment (such as onerous dismissal procedures)
should be addressed. Subsidies for hiring university graduates could be usefully

redirected toward retraining the long-term unemployed, increasing employment and
reducing pressures for early retirement.


Although steady progress has been made to improve the business and investment
environment, certain areas remain bottlenecks. Policies efforts should prioritize:
simplifying regulatory frameworks and reducing administrative costs; improving permit
and property registration processes; and increasing the efficiency of the judicial system.

Authorities’ views
38.
The structural reform agenda is evolving. With respect to specific reform initiatives,
the authorities explained:


The new labor law (¶32) is intended to improve labor market flexibility, including by
streamlining dismissal and redundancy procedures, but is not expected to be
implemented before the end of 2017.



Subsidized employment programs such as the university graduate internship scheme are
important for bridging skills gaps and are yielding results. Vocational training programs
for the secondary school graduates have also been launched.



The consolidation of social welfare benefits will help limit abuse.



Reforms endorsed in a 2013 action plan to improve and streamline the regulatory
environment have been implemented, but there is scope for further improvement.



The authorities reiterated their drive to boost growth and rural development. To
complement the plans for infrastructure spending, they plan to increase financial support
to SMEs and professional training, and streamline the business process.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Strong growth this year looks set to continue into the medium term. The economy
has rebounded strongly. Growth momentum is expected to continue, driven by large
capital-intensive projects, and the authorities are pursuing a major initiative to boost economic
development and connectivity that will see a substantial acceleration of infrastructure projects.
40.
The authorities’ growth strategy can bring substantial gains, but also poses sizeable
risks. Although infrastructure development is needed, the emphasis on large infrastructure
projects carries substantial risks, notably to the public finances. Using fiscal and financial policies
to boost growth incentives can also result in misallocated capital. And rapid investment-led
growth can contribute to an under-pricing of risk that can undermine financial and fiscal stability.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

41.
New measures are needed to reduce public debt. Some recent measures raise
questions about the ability to sustain fiscal discipline. Staff projects gross general government
debt to increase substantially, peaking at around 80 percent of GDP over the next three to four
years. Given Montenegro’s increasing debt levels—both public and external—and its vulnerability
to shocks, the relative inflexibility of the economy, and the lack of independent monetary policy,
staff recommends immediate and durable fiscal consolidation measures. To the extent that
further public infrastructure projects that are planned by the authorities are to be debt financed,
additional offsetting measures would be required to limit risks to the public finances and
maintain market access.
42.
New fiscal measures should be complemented by strengthening the fiscal
framework. Specific aspects would include medium-term fiscal plans, independent fiscal
councils, and public financial management reform. Tax administration reforms could broaden the
tax base and increase revenues.
43.
Financial conditions will improve gradually, but some policies could hold back
credit growth. After shrinking for a sustained period, credit to the private sector has increased,
although not as fast as might be expected given high liquidity and the rebound in growth,
reflecting persistent problems with nonperforming loans, weak accounting and reporting
practices, and slow collateral execution. Some policies intended to protect borrowers could have
unintended consequences: restrictions on lending rates in other countries have often been
associated with reduced credit supply, increasing numbers of banks without sufficient regard to
their health could threaten financial stability, and the new consumer bankruptcy legislation could
significantly deter new secured lending.
44.
The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program for Montenegro identifies a
number of steps to mitigate risks to the financial system. These include an independent asset
quality review of all banks, specific actions to deal with weaker banks, and enhancing bank
resolution planning. Staff also recommends exploring options to bolster lender of last resort
capability.
45.
Improved labor productivity and economic flexibility are crucial to complement the
authorities’ investment-led growth strategy. Given the country’s capacity to absorb shocks is
limited by the currency regime and limited fiscal space, the authorities should build on current
reform initiatives, such as improving the flexibility of labor market outcomes, reducing labor
market informality, and continuing to improve the business climate (e.g., contract enforcement).
Maintaining discipline over public sector wages is crucial to ensuring cost competitiveness.
46.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Montenegro will be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

Source of Risks

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Policy Response

1. Structurally
weak growth in
key advanced and
emerging
economies

High
The euro area could face an
extended period of low growth,
reflecting inadequate structural
reforms and weak domestic
demand due to high real
interest rates, impaired balance
sheets, high unemployment,
and weak inflation expectations.
This could be compounded by
limited prospects for emerging
market countries that have
struggled with inefficient
investments and incomplete
structural reform.
High
A surge in global financial
market volatility and
generalized increase in
financing costs could be
triggered as investors reassess
risks. Associated debt
sustainability concerns could
inhibit market access.
Medium
Geopolitical events could
disrupt global financial flows,
trade and commodity markets,
as well as lead to a sharp
increase in oil prices.

High
A protracted slowdown in the EU
and neighboring countries could
adversely impact the appetite for
external and public financing
(especially FDI flows and tourism
infrastructure developments).
Further “low-flation” could be
imported from the euro area
which, if protracted, would
adversely impact debt dynamics,
consumption, and bank
profitability.

 Let automatic fiscal
stabilizers work, within
limited fiscal space.
 Accelerate structural
reforms to increase
competitiveness and
reduce structural
bottlenecks that impede
credit to the private sector.

High
Montenegro is highly reliant on
external financing. Gross public
financing needs range from
10–20 percent of GDP during the
next five years.

 Let automatic fiscal
stabilizers work, within
limited fiscal space.
 Put in place a credible
medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan that
puts debt on a sustainable
trajectory.

2. Tighter and
more volatile
global financial
conditions

3. Heightened
geopolitical risks
associated with
Russia/Ukraine
tensions erodes
globalization and
fosters
inefficiency

Medium
Given important tourism and
real estate links, a prolonged
and intensified downturn in
Russia could undermine FDI
inflows and thus weaken growth
prospects, depress real estate
prices, and further limit
Montenegro’s capacity to
absorb shocks.

 Let automatic fiscal
stabilizers work, within
limited fiscal space.
 Speed up structural
reforms to improve the

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level
of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

1/ Balance of payments data were revised in late 2012 to correct for unrecorded tourism receipts, resulting in an average annual improvement
in the current account balance of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009-2011. This revision has not yet been incorporated in the national accounts data, which
results in the large discrepancy between the current account balance and the savings-investment balance calculated from the national accounts.

Sources: Central Bank of Montenegro; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Balance of payments data were revised in late 2012 to correct for unrecorded tourism receipts, resulting in an average annual
improvement in the current account balance of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009-2011. The revision also lowered the estimate of other
investment outflows, with a corresponding reduction in errors and omissions.
2/ Sovereign Eurobond issuance is classified under Other Investment rather than Portfolio Investment in this presentation.
3/ Financing for the highway is included under general government flows (including the ExIm loan as well as the remaining 15 percent);
unidentified financing is a residual, including all remaining financing needs for which specific sources have not been identified yet-however this does not constitute a financing gap.
4/ This includes only estimates of private external debt as private debt statistics are not officially published.

Annex I. Montenegro: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Despite a sizeable fiscal adjustment in 2014, public sector debt has increased and is projected to
rise further, to 80 percent of GDP by 2018, in the baseline. The projected debt trajectory is highly
sensitive to shocks, especially a negative real GDP growth shock. Gross financing needs are high.
Baseline and Realism of Projections


Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth momentum is projected to pick up to 4.1 percent in
2015 after a slowdown in 2014. Growth is expected to converge average 3¼ percent.
Highway expenditures are assumed to add EUR 243 million to the nominal non-highway GDP
path over the period 2015 to 2019 (being EUR 809 million less the assumed 70 percent
import content), with an additional contemporaneous multiplier on aggregate demand of
30 percent during the construction phase.



Fiscal adjustment. A sizeable fiscal adjustment was achieved in 2014 following a pension
freeze and PIT and VAT rate hikes (including a one-off VAT receipts). In the baseline
projections, the primary balance worsens significantly in 2015–17 because of increased
highway expenditures, unfreezing of pensions, and persistent arrears and guarantee
payments. Non-highway non-interest expenditures decrease modestly from their 2015
budget levels as a share of non-highway GDP in 2016–2020, implying cuts in mainly goods
and services spending.



Heat map and debt profile vulnerabilities. Risks from the debt level are deemed high as
gross debt passes the 70 percent of GDP benchmark in 2016 in the baseline and increases
substantially under several shock scenarios. Gross financing needs go above the 15 percent
benchmark. Public debt held by non-residents also constitutes a vulnerability. Growth shocks
have a very large impact on the debt profile.



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and
inflation (actual minus projection) in 2005–2014 suggest on average an upward bias in staff’s
past projections. The median forecast error for the primary balance suggests that staff
projections have been too pessimistic on average. With a large projected CAPB adjustment,
the key risks are high dependence on external financing and vulnerability to macro shocks.

Shocks and Stress Tests


42

Stress tests indicate that growth shocks would have a substantial effect on the debt
path. Fiscal shocks, cost overruns, and delays related to the highway project would also have
a major impact on fiscal sustainability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

Montenegro-specific stress tests


Highway shock. In this scenario, the construction of the highway is assumed to cost 20
percent more (in 2018). Debt increases to 84 percent of GDP, while financing requirements
far exceed those under the baseline in 2018.

Standard stress tests


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates fall during 2016 and 2017 by
one standard deviation (4.9 ppt), also affecting inflation and interest rates. The public debt
ratio increases to 99 percent by 2018, while the gross financing needs ratio in 2017 increases
7½ percentage points relative to the baseline. The variance in GDP growth has been
increased by the financial crisis—arguably a rare event—but even with a half-standard
deviation shock, the debt ratio escalates to 89 percent of GDP.



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications of an increase in interest rates
on new debt by 200 basis points (relative to the baseline) in 2016–20. Debt increases by
2½ percentage points in 2020 by this scenario, while financing needs are affected only
marginally.



Combined macro shock. This scenario comprises a recession in 2016 and 2017, a 200 basis
point increase in interest rates, and a sharp rise in expenditures. It pushes the debt to GDP
ratio up to 95 percent of GDP in 2018, and also substantially affects gross financing needs.



Financial contingent liability shock. The shock is equivalent to 10 percent of the size of the
banking sector and is combined with a shock to GDP and interest rates. The shock results in a
sharp increase in the debt ratio to peak at 97 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, gross financing
needs would rise to over 27 percent of GDP in 2016, and stay above the baseline over the
medium term.



Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes a revenue shock and a rise in interest rates
leading to a two percentage point deterioration in the primary balance in 2016 and 2017. The
combined shocks lead to deterioration in the debt ratio by about 5 percent of GDP, while the
impact on gross financing needs, is somewhat more than the interest rate shock scenario on
average.



Real exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes a 13 percent devaluation in the real
exchange rate in 2016. The ExIm loan is issued piecemeal over the course of highway
spending. The impact is below 1 percent of GDP, though the impact depends critically on the
extent of exchange rate pass-through to inflation.

3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex II. Montenegro: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
External debt has increased by 17 percentage points of GDP since 2008, to an estimated
155 percent of GDP in 2014. This was driven partly by the sharp increase in public debt, which
more than doubled over this period and comprises about 39 percent of total external debt. Under
the baseline, external debt is projected to peak at 164 percent of GDP driven by a rapid increase in
public debt. The projected debt trajectory is highly sensitive to various shocks, particularly a
depreciation of the euro.
Shocks and Stress Tests
1.
Standardized stress tests indicate that external debt is particularly sensitive to
currency depreciation. Current account shocks—possibly related to highway project cost
overruns—and a combined deterioration in the macroeconomic environment would also affect
external sustainability, with significant implications for gross financing needs.
Standard stress tests


Growth shock. Under this scenario, the baseline real GDP growth profile is permanently
reduced by a one-half standard deviation calculated over the recent 10-year period
(3.4 percent). This corresponds to an average contraction during 2016–20 of -0.3 percent of
GDP, compared with baseline average growth of 3.1 percent. Under this scenario, the
external debt ratio increases to 181 percent of GDP in 2020.



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications of an increase in nominal
external interest rates on new debt (relative to the baseline) by a one-half standard deviation
during 2016–20. Stable average external interest rates historically imply only a modest
average increase in interest rates of 13 basis points in this scenario and, consequently, a
relatively small increase in the external debt profile to 160 percent of GDP by 2020.



Non-Interest Current Account shock. This scenario permanently increases the non-interest
current account by one-half standard deviation in 2016–20. Given historically-high current
account deficits, this amounts to an increase of 6¼ percentage points. In the absence of
offsetting debt creating flows, external debt increases to 189 percent of GDP by 2020.



Combined macro shock. This scenario comprises a permanent ¼ standard deviation shock
applied to the real interest rate, the growth rate, and the current account deficit during
2016–20. The combined shock pushes the external debt ratio to 185 percent of GDP and
increases gross financing needs by 28 percent of GDP cumulatively over the shock period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

MONTENEGRO



50

Real exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes a one-time 30 percent devaluation in the
real exchange rate in 2015 applied to the stock of external debt. Second round impacts (in
terms of potential increases in competitiveness and improved trade balances) are not taken
into account. Given the large stock of external debt, the shock increases the external debt-toGDP ratio by 70 percent of GDP in 2016. Gross financing needs are correspondingly higher,
by about 18 percent of GDP on average over 2016–20 relative to the baseline.

Annex III. Financial Stability Indicators
The financial sector appears stable and a risk of an imminent deterioration is limited. Although
macro-financial indicators have not improved significantly since the financial crisis, developments
are not out of line with global trends. Domestic asset prices do not signal imbalances; property
prices have been declining, but gradually. Overall financial sector vulnerability is assessed as modest.
Risks relate mainly to high NPLs and limited capacity by the central bank for lender-of-last-resort
assistance.

Appendix I. Spillovers from the Highway Project
The highway can be expected to generate temporary demand spillovers to the rest of the economy
during the construction phase and permanent supply effects when completed. The size of these
effects is uncertain, particularly for large-scale infrastructure projects. Based on the structural
characteristics of Montenegro’s economy, projections assume a demand multiplier of 0.3. Empirical
studies suggest that effects of public infrastructure works on supply can be sizeable. In
Montenegro’s case, these gains are only likely to be realized when the Bar-Boljare highway is
completed; gains from completion of the currently-planned first phase will likely be more modest.

A. Demand Spillovers during Construction of the Highway
1.
The construction of the highway can be expected to generate demand spillovers, to
the extent that the increased expenditure generates demand for local goods and services, with
conventional “multiplier” effect through the economy. Multipliers are usually thought to be
between 0 and 1 for advanced economies, but can exceed 1 in abnormal circumstances, such as
when an economy is in a severe downturn or if the monetary transmission mechanism is
impaired.1 Multipliers are typically smaller for emerging and low-income countries, and even
negative when public debt is high.2 Studies suggest that output effects of an exogenous fiscal
shock dissipate within 5-years and impacts from a temporary fiscal policy measure do not
generally last beyond the duration of the measure itself.
2.
Precise estimates of fiscal multipliers for Montenegro are not readily available but
can be indirectly estimated. For such countries, Batini, Eyraud, and Weber (2014) propose
assigning multiplier ranges to countries based on their structural characteristics. According to
Batini et al., structural characteristics found to increase the size of fiscal multipliers include:


Low trade openness: Countries with higher propensities to import (such as Montenegro)
tend to have higher lower multipliers because demand “leaks” out through imports
(Barrell and others, 2012; Ilzetzki and others, 2013).



High labor market rigidity: Countries with more rigid labor markets (i.e., with relatively
strong unions and/or with labor market regulation) have larger fiscal multipliers if such
rigidity implies reduced wage flexibility. Rigid wages tend to amplify the response of
output to demand shocks (Cole and Ohanian, 2004; Gorodnichenko and others, 2012).

1

The literature also finds that spending multipliers tend to be larger than revenue multipliers. Based on a survey
of 41 studies, Mineshima et al. (2014) show that first-year multipliers in advanced economies average around 0.75
for spending and 0.25 for revenues.

See Estevão and Samake (2013), Ilzetzki and others (2013), Ilzetzki (2011), and Kraay (2012).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

MONTENEGRO



Small automatic stabilizers:3 Larger automatic stabilizers reduce fiscal multipliers, since
mechanically the automatic response of transfers and taxes offsets part of the initial fiscal
shock, thus lowering its effect on GDP (Dolls and others, 2012).



Fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes: Countries with flexible exchange rate regimes
tend to have smaller multipliers, because exchange rate movements can offset the impact
of discretionary fiscal policy (Born and others, 2013; Ilzetzki and others, 2013).



Low/safe public debt levels: High-debt countries generally have lower multipliers, as fiscal
stimulus is likely to have negative effects on private demand and increase interest rate
premia (Ilzetzki and others, 2013, Kirchner and others, 2010).



Effective public expenditure management and revenue administration: Multipliers are
expected to be smaller when difficulties to collect taxes (such as from informality) and
expenditure inefficiencies limit the impact of fiscal policy on output.

The authors’ proposed “bucket” approach differentiates countries based on the number of
structural characteristics according to the table below. More structural characteristics imply a
high multiplier range.

0.1–0.3
0 to 3
Medium multiplier
High multiplier

0.4–0.6
0.7–1.0

4 to 6

3.
This approach implies a relatively low multiplier for Montenegro. Only two structural
factors that would imply a higher multiplier clearly apply: labor market rigidity and a quasi “fixed”
exchange rate. Since the default is zero, this puts Montenegro in the low multiplier range. Nor is
Montenegro currently operating below capacity, which can be an argument for increasing the
size of the multiplier. On this basis, the projections assume a demand multiplier during the
construction phase of 0.3.

B. Productive Impact of the Highway Project
4.
The completed highway can be expected to generate positive supply effects, to the
extent that it adds to the economy’s productive potential by creating better opportunities for
private business growth. IMF research on the macroeconomic effects of public infrastructure
investment for advanced and developing countries (2014 October World Economic Outlook)
3

Automatic stabilizers are considered small if the ratio of public spending to nominal GDP is below 40 percent,
which is not the case in Montenegro.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

shows that public investment shocks have statistically significant and long-lasting effects on
output. Specifically, the average effect of a 1 percent unanticipated shock to public infrastructure
spending is a 0.4 percent increase in the level of output after the first year, increasing to
1.5 percent after 5 years. (NB: the literature does not argue for an increase in the potential
growth rate.)
5.
A conservative supply effect is assumed for the first stage of the Bar-Boljare stage
of the highway. As with the demand multipliers, the effects differ depending on economic
circumstances. The impact can be expected to be weaker i) during periods of high growth or
when the economy is running at or close to capacity; ii) in countries that exhibit a low degree of
public investment efficiency; and iii) when public investment is budget neutral (rather than debt
financed).4 The first two characteristics apply to Montenegro. In addition, the full effects on
supply will likely only be realized when the entire highway from the coastal port of Bar to the
Serbian border is completed, along with connections within Serbia itself. In view of these
considerations, staff assumes the productive boost upon completion of the first segment of the
highway is only likely to be 20 percent of the level effects found in the WEO.

C.

Incorporating the Highway into the Projections

6.
Because the highway spending is so large (in terms of the size of the Montenegrin
economy), it is treated specifically when making projections. The first step is to evaluate
actual spending on the highway (as compared to drawdown in debt) for each year. The highway
contract stipulates that 30 percent of the project be sourced locally, with the rest spent on
imported goods and services, The total value added of the highway during the construction
phase is estimated at around 1½ percent of non-highway GDP on average during 2015–2019.
Demand spillovers apply to the net value added of total expenditure. Supply effects, however,
apply to the entire value of the installed capital stock, regardless of whether that is from local or
imported inputs.

4

Empirical evidence for emerging markets suggests that debt-financed public spending is associated with higher
and more volatile sovereign risk spreads than tax-financed spending (Akitoby and Stratmann, 2008). For further
discussion of the links between public debt, public investment, and growth, see Ostry, Ghosh, and Espinoza, 2014.

Appendix II. Analysis of Macrofinancial Linkages
Financial development in Montenegro ranks relatively well within the Western Balkan region, but
lags that of more advanced emerging European economies, suggesting growth benefits from
further financial sector deepening. Similarly, financial inclusion is in line with incomes, but there is
room for improvement, particularly in reducing disparities related to gender, the level of education,
and region. The process of balance sheet repair is ongoing—the private sector remains highly
indebted, with the degree of leverage for corporates being especially high. This constrains the
prospects of a sustained strong credit-led recovery and also leaves the country vulnerable to shocks.
A simple VAR model for Montenegro suggests that credit has a strong effect on output, compared
with some regional and European peers.
1.
Montenegro’s experience of boom and bust draws attention to macrofinancial
linkages. This appendix looks at the role of the financial system in promoting growth and
welfare and, in particular, the effects of credit. It looks first at the link between Montenegro’s
level of financial development and growth, and then turns to the related issue of financial
inclusion and welfare. Both of these issues are secular; the analysis then turns to the questions of
the cyclical effects of recent deleveraging pressures and, with a view to future prospects for
growth, the role of credit in the business cycle.

A. Financial Development
2.
Theory and evidence suggests a trade-off between financial development and
growth. In theory, more efficient and extensive financial systems should boost economic growth.
At very high levels of credit and with large financial sectors, the frequency of booms and busts
could increase, and human capital could be diverted away from potentially more productive
sectors toward the financial sector. Indeed, empirical analysis by the IMF indicates that there is a
significant bell-shaped, relationship between financial development and growth.1

Increased financial development would
likely be associated with higher growth. The
estimated degree of financial development among
Western Balkan States is well below the optimal level
for growth, and below that of New Member States.
The level of financial development in Montenegro,
calculated using a proxy, appears to be similar to the
rest of the Western Balkans. Hence, notwithstanding
the severity of the boom-bust cycle that Montenegro
experienced, more financial development would be
consistent with higher growth.

B. Financial Inclusion
4.
The level of financial inclusion in Montenegro is consistent with its level of
development. Financial inclusion is an important means to reduce poverty and increase personal
opportunities. Access to financial services in Montenegro has improved in recent years. Adults
that report having an account at a formal financial institution (a bank, credit union, cooperative,
post office, or microfinance institution) have increased by nearly 10 percent over the past three
years to 60 percent—close to the average prevailing in the Western Balkan region. While this lags
progress achieved in new EU member states (NMS) 2—where on average about 80 percent of
adults maintain a bank account—the degree of financial penetration in Montenegro is in line
with what might be expected given the size of the economy.

5.
However, there are many differences in financial inclusion across different groups
in Montenegro. Although financial deepening advanced rapidly in Montenegro during 2006–08,
the poor were not primary beneficiaries, with only half of the population among the bottom
40 percent of incomes having access to some kind of financial institution. This compares to two
thirds of the top 60 percent of the population, comparable to the average for the Western Balkan
region.

6.
There are also disparities by gender, level of education, and region. Women have
less access to finance than men, to much the same extent as the rest of the Western Balkans. The
difference in inclusion between those living in rural and urban areas, while expected, is one of the
highest in the WBS region. Adults with a secondary or higher education are, on average, more
than twice as likely to have an account as those with a primary education or less.

As nominal GDP increases, the level of financial inclusion overall can also be
expected to increase. However, the heterogeneity of financial inclusion across segments of
Montenegrin society suggests an important role for policies that address informality and
education to improve financial literacy.

C. Private Sector Indebtedness and the Credit Environment
9.
Credit conditions in Montenegro have been persistently tight in the post crisis
period. The banking sector experienced a surge in bad loans, triggering a prolonged period of
balance sheet downsizing. Corporate lending now stands at 55 percent of its pre-crisis level;
household lending has held up better at 85 percent.

Corporate balance sheets remain impaired despite banks’ attempts to tackle NPLs.
The decrease in corporate liabilities to domestic banks has been largely offset by rising
indebtedness to nonresidents, partially reflecting the transfer of EUR 720 million worth (21
percent of GDP) of NPLs from bank balance sheets to asset management companies belonging
to parent banks. However, the lack of a vibrant secondary market for distressed assets and slow
judicial proceedings has disrupted companies’ resolution. Indeed, the ratio of NPLs remains high,
at 14¾ percent—about 40 percent when adjusted for impaired loans held by AMCs. All in all,
total indebtedness of the corporate sector has only declined by about 1½ percent in nominal
terms relative to the pre-crisis peak.

Progress in cleaning household
balance sheets has also been limited.
Household domestic liabilities have only declined
by about 15 percent relative to the pre-crisis
peak, about one-third the percentage point
adjustment observed in the corporate sector.
Anecdotal accounts indicate banks and AMCs
have been reluctant to aggressively pursue
collateral claims against individuals given social
sensitivities and perceptions of judicial bias in
favor of borrowers.
12.
Real private sector indebtedness is
estimated to have increased since the crisis.
Data on private sector assets are unavailable in
Montenegro, but real estate prices can be used
as a proxy given the importance of property as
collateral. When deflated using a housing price

and calls attention to the need to clean up banks’ balance sheets (see measures recommended

property market segmentation. An internal Podgorica-specific property price index that captures re-sale
properties prepared by the CBM estimates a 50 percent post-crisis real estate price correction implying an even
larger degree of real indebtedness.

However, such high correlations do not provide conclusive evidence of the causal
effects of credit shocks on economic growth—they could be driven by strong demand effects
from nominal activity to credit, rather than the other around. To deal with this simultaneity
problem, a VAR of nominal GDP growth, private sector credit growth, and CPI inflation is
estimated using quarterly data from 2005:Q2 to 2014:Q4. A single lag was found to provide the
best fit. Estimated coefficients are significant at conventional levels for GDP and credit growth,
and carry the expected signs. The model captures about half of the variation in the data, but
alterative specifications that included FDI and tourism indicators did not improve fit.

Orthogonalized impulse responses suggest that a 1 percent shock to nominal
private sector credit growth causes a 0.2 percent increase in GDP growth, increasing to
0.3 percent, before declining gradually. Over five years, the accumulated impact of the
1 percent growth rate shock is a 3 percent boost to the level of nominal GDP (Figure 1).
16.
This effect is relatively large, in comparison to regional peers. To answer this
question, the same VAR specification was estimated for Croatia, Serbia, and Poland. A
comparison of impulse responses shows that the immediate impact of a credit shock is indeed
larger in Montenegro (Figure 2). This finding is consistent with the greater severity of
Montenegro’s boom-bust cycle, and, at least in the cases of Croatia and Poland, with the relative
levels of financial development.

Appendix III. Recent Legal Reforms to the Debt Restructuring
Framework1
The authorities have undertaken a number of measures to strengthen the supervisory and debt
enforcement framework. The most recent include changes to the enforcement regime and adoption
of a personal insolvency law. The former have been generally well received, although their
effectiveness remains to be tested. The new personal insolvency law, however, raises a number of
concerns.

A. Consumer Insolvency Law
1.
The new consumer insolvency law is problematic. In August 2015, Montenegro
introduced an insolvency regime for natural persons that, despite some good features, has
critical deficiencies. Positive features include provision for a mandatory forum of pre-insolvency
debt mediation and court-supervised debt discharge (i.e., "fresh start") for debtors after a set
repayment period. However, the law suffers from a number of critical deficiencies that undermine
its ability to achieve the objectives of an effective personal insolvency regime. Among other
concerns, the law is ambiguously drafted, which has caused stakeholders to reach inconstant and
often contradictory interpretations.
2.
The law undermines secured creditors' rights. Some stakeholders raised concerns that
a broad reading of the law would suggest that mortgage lenders would permanently lose the
ability to foreclose on the debtor’s primary residence. A more restrictive reading would appear to
exclude mortgages from the law, but even that reading presents circumstances under which the
mortgage creditor could lose its secured rights and thereby become unsecured.
3.
There is also no consensus as to whether the law should be applied to existing debt,
or only to debt contracted after its effective date. The constitutional principle of nonretroactivity of laws, as applied in Montenegro, could prevent the applicability of the new law
with respect to debt contracted prior to the law's entry into force. Should this principle be
applied to the law, however, the law could never achieve its proclaimed objective of providing
current consumers debt relief from distress they are now experiencing due to the bursting of the
housing bubble.
4.
Aside from existing ambiguities, the law cannot be implemented in the near future
because of the need for enabling regulations. In addition to requiring the creation of a
supporting infrastructure (e.g. a mediation service, special insolvency fund), the law requires the
government to prepare regulations to align the law with the existing institutional framework. The
law, however, contains no deadlines for the drafting of these measures. In addition to these
preconditions for implementation, some stakeholders, including the Ministry of Justice, are
currently considering constitutional challenges to the law that might result in its full or partial
1

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

repeal or in significant changes. If these challenges are unsuccessful, and in the absence of
changes to design and clarification of ambiguities, the law could have adverse effects on general
credit discipline, create moral hazard, and potentially raise the cost of credit.
5.
To provide proper incentives and a better balance between debtor/creditor rights,
the law would require significant changes in addition to supporting institutional
infrastructure. As a first step, the authorities could conduct a comprehensive assessment of
credit market and institutional infrastructure necessary for building a well-functioning personal
insolvency regime in Montenegro. In this regard, ensuring the reliability financial information
about debtors is of critical importance.

B. The Enforcement Framework
6.
Montenegro passed a number of changes to its debt restructuring and enforcement
framework in 2014. Most notably, the reforms allow an expedited procedure for debt collection
through public enforcement officers.
7.
Although the public enforcement officer reform shows promise, some
strengthened supervision and oversight may be necessary. Banks were broadly satisfied with
the reform. Other parties, however, expressed concerns that public enforcement officers have
been overzealous in their efforts to collect debts, given that their compensation is linked to the
amount collected. Certain weaknesses in the system allow instances of unintentional multiple
collections of the same debt, creating additional complications and appeals. More experience
with the system may be necessary before a full evaluation can be made. Further measures such
as tightening licensing and educational requirements and strengthening oversight and
supervision could be warranted.
8.
Overall, weak institutions and inconsistent application of laws appear to be the
main obstacles to effective debt resolution and enforcement in Montenegro. Lending
institutions report that delays in collection activity are often due to the courts' and public
agencies' lack of competence, which provides many opportunities for appeal and delay. These
institutional weaknesses, combined with low demand in the real estate market, continue to cause
low recovery rates in debt restructuring and realization of collateral.

Appendix IV. Main Findings and Recommendations from the
FSAP
An FSAP mission took place during September 1–15. Mission findings were generally consistent
with issues raised in previous Article IV reports. Montenegro still suffers from the collapse of the
lending boom in 2008. Stress tests indicate that domestically-owned banks are particularly
vulnerable to shocks. Action to deal with weak banks is needed to maintain financial stability.
Weak profitability and the large NPL overhang constrain prospects of a credit-led recovery. Given
policy constraints due to euroization, there is a need to strengthen the financial safety net,
particularly with a streamlined emergency liquidity assistance framework and tested contingency
planning.
1.
There is scope to strengthen legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks for the
banking sector, which dominates the financial system. The main areas for improvement in
banking supervision include: (i) identifying, measuring, and managing nonperforming assets and
liquidity risk; (ii) reducing concentration in credit, operational, and funding risks;
(iii) strengthening banks’ governance framework for risk management; and (iv) introducing
effective consolidated supervision.
2.
System-wide solvency and liquidity indicators appear broadly sound, but significant
pockets of vulnerabilities among domestically-owned banks exist. Some banks are deemed
below the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) after provisioning rates are adjusted
to reflect credit risks. Undercapitalized and weak banks should be put under intensive Central
Bank of Montenegro (CBM) supervision. The CBM should also develop and adopt time-bound
supervisory action plans and bank-specific resolution plans. An independent bank system asset
quality review (AQR) is needed to accurately gauge bank health and the adequacy of
provisioning.
3.
Intensified bank competition and a slow economic recovery are weighing on
banking sector profitability. Intense competition in the banking sector has compressed interest
rate spreads to levels threatening banks with higher funding/operating costs and weaker client
bases. Analysis of lending spreads indicates they are driven by costs (overheads and provisions)
rather than a lack of competition. The authorities should therefore refrain from introducing caps
to lending rates that, in the current context, is likely to restrict credit and lead to an undesirable
mispricing of risks. The approval of new bank licenses could be harmful in this context and
require a rigorous evaluation of both the business plan and potential spillovers to the sector
from increased competition.
4.
Reducing the large stock of NPLs is necessary to strengthen bank balance sheets
although is not sufficient to reinvigorate credit growth. There are shortcomings in the NPL
resolution framework related to under-provisioning and regulatory forbearance. Banks may need
to raise additional capital in order to absorb the losses inherent in NPLs. The recently enacted
Law on Voluntary Restructuring of Debts could be broadened to include a wider set of loan

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

categories. At the same time, the recent Law on Consumer Bankruptcy needs to be amended as it
could negatively affect the collection of existing NPLs, as well as the issuance of new loans
secured with mortgages. In order to analyze, regulate, and monitor the NPL problem in its
entirety, nonbank credit institutions and asset management vehicles need to be brought under
CBM oversight.
5.
The macroprudential policy framework needs to be developed. However, neither the
CBM nor the Financial Stability Council (FSC) has been vested with the authority to mitigate
systemic imbalances. In preparation for Basel III, sound liquidity risk management standards as
the first line of defense against liquidity pressures should be prioritized. A macroprudential
framework should be established and made fully operational, underpinned by broader and more
focused cooperation among the relevant agencies.
6.
The financial safety net and crisis management framework should be strengthened.
A comprehensive bank resolution framework is lacking. ELA funding is constrained due to
euroization. The funding of resolution measures are not clear with respect to the Ministry of
Finance and prohibited for the Deposit Protection Fund. And while there are contingency plans in
place, the FSC and the financial agencies are not giving continued attention to updating and
testing these plans.

Appendix V. Reserve Adequacy
Although there are sufficient buffers to absorb modest liquidity pressures, Montenegro’s emergency
liquidity assistance (ELA) capacity is low and constrained by euroization. Because liquidity
conditions can change rapidly and support from parent banks is not assured during a liquidity
crunch, the authorities should explore options to boost ELA capacity, preferably through a dedicated
ELA sub-account set up by the Ministry of Finance for use by the central bank.
1.
ELA options are constrained. Montenegro is one of 13 IMF members that have adopted
a foreign currency as legal tender. The main benefit of using another country’s currency is a
strong monetary anchor, but the arrangement imposes operational challenges for the central
bank (CBCG), as ELA is constrained. In the event of a liquidity shortfall, the CBCG’s current
options to provide liquidity assistance would include: borrowing from liquid banks in the system;
borrowing from abroad; allowing illiquid banks to draw down the required reserves (RR) for a
short period; and drawing down designated ELA reserves (i.e., CBCG capital). However, only the
latter two options are directly within the CBCG’s control and they do not constitute traditional
ELA tools. CBCG capital, were it to be drawn down, would need to be replenished after a crisis
with an infusion of public resources.
Emergency Liquidity Buffers

2.
The banking system is currently
liquid—excess reserves cover about
[50] percent of short-term liabilities for the
banking system as a whole. CBCG capital
provides a small additional buffer of
around 5 percent of short-term bank
liabilities. Including required reserves, the
combined liquidity buffer (own assets,
CBCG capital, and RR) increases to nearly
75 percent.

3.
Access to parent bank liquidity
provides an additional potential buffer. Two-thirds of bank system deposits are held by
subsidiaries of banking groups located in the euro area (whose parent banks can access ECB
facilities), which provides a potential additional liquidity buffer. In the event that subsidiaries
receive liquidity support from parents, the effective liquidity coverage for domestic banks
increases substantially. CBCG capital is estimated to account for about 31 percent of short term
deposits of domestic banks and coverage, which increases to 93 percent when banks’ own
liquidity buffers are included (108 percent including required reserves).
4.
On this basis, ELA reserves currently appear adequate, but this situation could
change quickly. Foreign liquidity support for subsidiaries cannot be relied upon, especially if the
shock triggering deposit outflow emanates from abroad. And the CBCG’s capital endowment is
fixed, implying that ELA coverage will decline as bank liabilities grow over time.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

5.
The authorities should therefore take advantage of this relative period of calm to
establish mechanisms to bolster ELA capacity. Options include:


A bank fee or premium. Capital surcharges based on systemic importance are increasingly
being used in other jurisdictions However, larger banks in Montenegro are already
bearing significant costs (in the form of regulatory provisioning standards), mainly to
offset potential concerns about weak banks. Banks already pay premiums to support the
deposit insurance fund; increased fees would likely be passed on in lending rates, to the
detriment of investment.



A pooled liquidity arrangement for ELA, funded by banks. This option was evaluated by
the FSAP team and found to be problematic because of the high share of foreign-owned
banks in Montenegro: parents of foreign-owned banks would be unlikely to be willing to
provide liquidity to less liquid, mostly domestically-owned banks.1



Establishing contingent credit lines with foreign banks. This is a conventional option, and
does not impose fiscal costs. But it would carry greater-than-average coordination costs,
given the range of central banks that supervise parent banks of Montenegrin subsidiaries.



Letters of comfort should be obtained from foreign-owned banks’ parents, committing
them to provide liquidity in times of stress.



A dedicated ELA sub-account at the central bank established by the Ministry of Finance
and under the central bank’s control. The size of an ELA account and mechanisms by
which it is to be funded would require further consideration within the context of broader
fiscal policy objectives.

6.
Of these options, establishing a dedicated account is preferred. While the size of
such an account and its funding requires further analysis and needs to be accommodated within
the broader fiscal policy framework, preparatory steps can be taken. Specifically:


Rules for the use of public funding in crisis situations should be clearly defined, including
through the adoption of explicit policies that set strict, objective, quantifiable, and
measurable criteria for determining whether a bank is systemically important.



The use of public funds should be explicitly recognized as a last resort. Provisions for
liquidity and capital support should clarify that: i) shareholders and hybrid capital and
subordinated debt holders fully absorb losses; and ii) shareholders be fully written off
prior to any government capital support.

1

Moreover, this additional financial burden for banks comes on top of a future bank resolution fund in line with the Bank
Recovery and Resolution Directive and a potential increase in deposit insurance contributions, which could undermine
easing of credit conditions.

Appendix VI. External Competitiveness
Montenegro’s external balances are characterized by persistent current account deficits funded
mainly by FDI inflows. In the absence of an independent currency, the burden of adjustment will fall
substantially on cost competitiveness. Costs have stabilized in recent years, and Montenegro fares
well in rankings on tourism, a substantial part of its exports. But costs overall are nonetheless
higher than regional peers, and falling shares of world and euro area trade are concerning.
1.
Montenegro has run persistent current account deficits that suggest
competitiveness problems. Staff analysis using the Macroeconomic Balance and External
Sustainability approaches suggests current account deficits are about 6 percentage points larger
than would be implied by the norm. Data uncertainties (related to errors and omissions in the
balance of payments, which average about 7½ percent of GDP), the short length of the time
series, and the volatility associated with small countries make point estimates from a CGER-type
analysis highly imprecise.1 Nonetheless, the analysis raises the question of weakness in cost
competitiveness.

Cost measures support concerns over competiveness.



The CPI-based REER has depreciated against other Western Balkan currencies, due to
nominal euro depreciation, and nominal wage growth pressures have been subdued.
Nonetheless, further real depreciation could be needed: an estimated current account
imbalance of 7–8 percentage points of GDP could imply a RER imbalance of
15–25 percent.

1

A significant share of the current account balance is related to imports funded by FDI, reflecting large
investment needs, especially for large-scale infrastructure projects; conversely, in a small economy such as
Montenegro, a surge in investment-related imports can result in large swings to the current account balance.

3.
Costs remain important for tourism. Montenegro’s service exports have been robust,
driven almost entirely by the tourism sector. Montenegro’s tourism competitiveness ranks well, in
particular the travel environment and infrastructure areas, compared with other countries in the
region. Staff analysis indicates that services demand has a high income elasticity, but price
competitiveness is important too. As conventional tourism tends to have low productivity
growth, maintaining an advantage in tourism will depend on a combination of maintaining costs
and providing higher value-added services.

Reducing non-price costs will also
be important. Montenegro’s share in world
goods trade fell further in 2014 to its lowest
since independence. Staff analysis suggests
that part of this can be attributed to
reduction in aluminum exports with the
partial shutdown of the KAP smelter.
Nonetheless, the analysis also suggests that
non-price factors are important obstacles to
improved trade performance (see Selected
Issues Paper).

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS
1.
Montenegro joined the World Bank Group (WBG) as an independent country in
January 2007. The Bank had implemented a program of lending and analytical work for
Montenegro for most of the period since the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro joined the WBG
in 2001. Six projects are currently active, 5 IBRD and one EU Trust Fund. with the Montenegro’s
second Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the fiscal years 2011–15 ended in June 2015. The
Board approved the CPS Progress Report in May 2014 extending the CPS by one year through FY15
as both CPS pillars—(i) strengthening institutions and aligning them with European Union (EU)
requirements in areas critical for longer-term competitiveness in global markets; and (ii) improving
environmental management—remained highly relevant, and the additional year facilitated the
delivery of the planned lending program. Also, with uncertainties in the fiscal framework and public
investment program, an additional year was deemed helpful in gaining greater clarity on the likely
medium-term macro-fiscal framework that would underpin a new Country Partnership Framework
(CPF) currently under preparation. The CPS Completion and Learning Review (under management
review) assessed the CPS Development Outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. The overall IBRD
delivered program amounted to US$262 million, while IFC committed two long-term finance
projects totaling US$26.5 million in the infrastructure sector.

2.
Within the CPS FY11–FY15, the IBRD Board approved five IBRD loans to provide
selective support to two key CPS priorities. The CPS originally envisaged a series of two financial
sector development policy operations (DPOs). In light of post-crisis needs, the second DPO was
converted into a larger financial sector policy-based guarantee (PBG) that supported a
comprehensive program of measures designed to strengthen the banking sector, address its
vulnerabilities, and bolster its resilience to possible future shocks. This support also led to advisory
work on nonperforming loans (NPL) resolution. Additional countercyclical stimulus was considered
through a Public Expenditure DPO, but did not materialize in FY13–14 given the remaining
weaknesses in the medium-term fiscal framework. New investment lending was approved for a
Higher Education/R&D project (US$16 million), Energy Efficiency Additional Financing
(US$6.8 million) and an Industrial Waste Management and Clean-Up Project (US$69 million). The

committed portfolio has doubled since to US$137 million in 2015. About 63 percent of these
commitments remain to be disbursed. The Systematic Country Diagnostic from September 2015
identified the following priority objectives as fundamental for the achievement of the twin goals in
Montenegro, around which the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) will be designed:
(i)

Strengthening resilience to shocks and volatility;

(ii)

Reducing unemployment and inactivity, in particular amongst the young; and

(iii)

Facilitating private sector development.

3.
Pipeline projects in the new CPF for FY16–20, which is under preparation, include (i) a
Revenue Administration Reform Project building on the recent tax administration assessment that
aims to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of tax administration as well as reduce the cost of
compliance for the taxpayer; (ii) a second Health Improvement project that aims to provide a
support for financing reforms and governance for quality in the health sector, and (iii) additional
financing for the ongoing Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening project
4.
Cooperation with the IMF has been good, particularly in the areas of macroeconomic
and financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams coordinated closely during the preparation of
the Financial Sector DPL and Policy-Based Guarantee in 2011 and 2012 and the TA on NPL
resolution, as well as on the FSAP update in 2015. The World Bank Group, through its ongoing and
planned operations, as well its complementary economic and sector work, will continue to provide
input to the IMF on issues such as (i) public expenditure, including pension and health reforms;
(ii) business climate and competitiveness, including labor market reform and the resolution of
nonperforming loans; (iii) public sector institutions and fiduciary reviews, (iv) agricultural
assessments; and (v) statistical capacity building and poverty monitoring. The Fund and Bank staff
have sought each other’s input in internal review processes.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
MONTENEGRO—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of December 16, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most affected
areas are labor market indicators, and government finance statistics.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) suffers from resource constraints and
limited capacity.
National Accounts: MONSTAT compiles annual production and expenditure accounts in current and previous
year’s prices. The production GDP estimates are reconciled with the expenditure GDP estimates through the
supply and use framework (i.e. reconciling supply and use). The quality of the annual GDP is good.
Montenegro started disseminating quarterly GDP by production using an indirect method in 2012, but the
methodology has room for improvement. The estimates are compiled at an aggregated level (mostly NACE
section level). The accuracy of the short term statistics needs to be improved, mostly for agriculture, and
construction. Recent national accounts TA missions have focused on developing robust quarterly GDP
estimates by expenditure approach. Quarterly GDP estimates have been compiled for 2010-2014; the official
dissemination took place in March 2015.
Price Statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates a monthly consumer price index that broadly follows
international standards. Little progress has been made improving the producer price index (PPI). Improvements
needed include developing a total output PPI; expanding index coverage to include services and construction;
and updating index calculation methods. There is need to improve the industrial production index.
Labor market statistics: MONSTAT reports labor and wage statistics based on data from the labor force
survey (LFS) and administrative sources. The unemployment rate from the LFS is computed according to the
ILO definition. The quality of wage indicators is relatively good, but information on foreign employment
remains limited. The presence of a large informal sector impedes the accurate assessment of the
unemployment rate. Frequent methodological revisions also impair time series analyses.
Government Finance Statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on a new
GFS institutional classification, and, since 2006, includes data on local governments and social security funds.
The latter was merged with the treasury account in 2010. The chart of accounts introduced in 2001 has been
implemented at the local level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications. The
MOF has established a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises, but a satisfactory
compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further effort. Data on enterprises owned by
municipalities are rarely available. Data on the stock of local government arrears need to be significantly
strengthened and disseminated. Data on stocks of financial assets and liabilities are incomplete.
Montenegro does not report GFSM 2001 based data to the IMF. The March 2013 GFS TA mission
recommended updating the table on the institutional structure of the public sector to facilitate consistency
among producers of official statistics. It was also recommended to establish a migration plan to phase in the
GFSM 2001 framework and to start publishing quarterly budgetary central government data in the IFS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Central Bank of Montenegro (CBM) reports monthly monetary
statistics covering the CBM balance sheet and the balance sheet of commercial banks only. However, the
monetary data are not reported in accordance with STA’s Standardized Report Forms and, thus, follow the
older format.
Montenegro does not report Financial Soundness Indicators to the IMF.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBM and follow international
reporting standards. External sector statistics have benefited from improvements undertaken by MONSTAT to
improve coverage, valuation, and classification of merchandise trade statistics. Data on imports and exports in
the BOP are compiled according to the special trade system. The CBM adjusts export and import data from
MONSTAT from CIF to FOB basis. The biggest challenge to the BoP statistics is the coverage of transactions
through the informal economy. .Although current account statistics have been revised recently, errors and
omissions are still large and with a persistent positive sign, largely due to an underestimation of the export of
tourism services. The CBM has made progress in improving the recording of transactions via the ITRS by
refining the transactions coding system and increasing interaction with commercial banks. However, the ITRS
remains inadequate for recording a broad range of balance of payments transactions such as reinvested
earnings and trade credits. Further, the ITRS records transactions on a cash basis, whereas balance of payments
transactions should be recorded on an accruals basis. The CBM still needs to undertake a small number of
direct surveys of enterprises to supplement the data received through the ITRS, and prepare comprehensive
documentation on compilation methods and data sources. The CBM is reporting BoP statistics under the
presentation of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics
Manual (BPM6).
The CBM has received TA on International Investment Position (IIP) statistics, but does not yet disseminate
these data.
The January 2013 TA mission on External Sector Statistics identified the following action items: (i) the
compilation and regular dissemination of the IIP and external debt statistics; (ii) the revision of the compilation
of the flows in currency and deposits assets by other sectors; and (iii) the improvement of the currently
estimation procedure for the item Compensation of Employees (credit).

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Montenegro
and Zorica Kalezic, Advisor to Executive Director
February 19, 2016

The authorities broadly concur with staff’s appraisal and agree with the thrust of the
recommendations outlined in the Article IV report and FSSA. On behalf of the Montenegrin
authorities, we thank the Article IV staff and the FSAP team for the constructive and fruitful
discussions during the missions’ visit. They resulted in the comprehensive documents, which
provide the authorities with useful recommendations and guidance for their future policy
decisions. The authorities pursue an investment-led growth strategy, which brings benefits,
but also challenges. Growth rebounded strong, with robust rates to maintain over the medium
term, while the fiscal position deteriorated. Given the context of a small and open economy,
vulnerable to external shocks and heavily reliant on external financing, the authorities share
staff’s concern on the public debt’s risk profile. The authorities are committed to introduce
further, sizable fiscal consolidation adjustments. In addition, the authorities are strongly
focused on raising productivity. However, the authorities are aware that the upcoming
elections, planned later this year, may affect the momentum of reforms’ implementation. The
financial sector is liquid and solvent, but prone to distress. The credit contraction finally
slowed down and the reduction in non-performing loans (NPLs) shows that the quality of
financial assets significantly improved.

Economic Outlook and Risks
Growth remains resilient over the medium term. GDP growth reached 4.1 percent in
2015, due to strong growth in fixed capital investment and service export. The authorities
expect this growth pattern to continue over the medium term, averaging at 3.7 percent for
2016-2018. The authorities expect a stronger fiscal impulse from the in 2015 postponed
construction work on the highway for the years 2017 and 2018, which will push growth
somewhat above staff’s forecast of 2.5 percent in both years. Growth remains primarily
driven by large investment projects in infrastructure, connectivity, and tourism. Recent data
on tourism in 2015 give confidence that the robust tourism inflows will remain in the coming
years. The excellent results of the 2015 tourist season were also the main factor behind the
narrowing of the current account deficit. However, this is expected to widen again because of
upcoming construction-related imports. Inflation is expected to remain stable against the
backdrop of suppressed oil prices and moderate private consumption recovery. Wages were
flat for 2011-2015 in nominal terms, but are expected to grow moderately in 2016.

2
The Montenegrin authorities are attentive to the risks and potential negative spillovers
that could come from a weakening in demand from the EU and regional geopolitical
tensions. The biggest concern is that these risks may affect tourism and the cost of financing.
The authorities are working progressively on market diversification, especially in tourism
(which accounts for 20 percent of GDP), resulting in Montenegro being assessed (in the
WTTC Report) as the third fastest growing destination in the world. Moreover, the
authorities are pressing ahead with a five-year consolidation plan that should rebuild fiscal
space and put debt on more comfortable footing. At the same time, the authorities will
restrain from any new large capital spending based on full project financing or sovereign
guarantee issuance. It is worth noting that the Eurobond issuance in 2015 was
oversubscribed, maintaining an upward sloping yield to the maturity curve. In addition,
sovereign rating agencies have already absorbed information in their estimations about the
substantial financing needs Montenegro will encounter during the highway construction.
Fiscal policy
The authorities are taking steps to address underlying fiscal vulnerabilities and
recognize the need for urgent and sustained consolidation to absorb the substantial
financing needs. The authorities are aware that fiscal space is scarce and will remain
constrained during the highway construction, however, they feel this project will have a
sizable and permanent positive effect on potential output. The consolidation measures
introduced narrowed the overall deficit from -5.9 in 2012 to -3.1 percent of GDP in 2014.
Although the fiscal deficit is expected to rise sharply in the short term, the authorities agree
with the staff that a close to balanced budget can be expected by 2020.
Given that the level of public debt in 2015 exceeded the “Maastricht” limit, the
authorities will soon propose to the Parliament a medium term fiscal consolidation plan
with contingency scenarios. This plan should ensure reduction of the public debt over a
five-year horizon, contributing to convergence to the “Maastricht” ceiling by 2025. In this
regard, the authorities requested TA from the IMF to receive input and build up the necessary
capacity to be able to enforce the Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility and the fiscal
rules provisions.
On the revenue side, Montenegro started the growth-supportive tax system; shifting
from a policy of taxation predominantly on income and profit to a consumption
taxation. Measures for 2016 include an increase of the health insurance contribution rate, the
introduction of tax on gains from gambling and coffee and an increase in excise duties on
cigarettes and mineral oils. Adding to staff’s table (page 14-Article IV) on the scope of
additional fiscal consolidation, authorities would like to outline two recent measures. First, a
recently introduced regulation allowing tax collection on illiquid but solvent tax debtors,
which will increase fiscal revenues (on top of staff’s projections) by at least 0.5 p.p./p.a. of
GDP over the medium term. Second, in order to strengthen the financial position of the

3
municipalities, the authorities adopted amendments to the Law on Tax on Immovable
Property, which enables the municipalities to generate more tax revenues.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are taking actions in addressing social
expenditures, public sector wages, and pension system sustainability. The recently
introduced social protection laws (especially the Law on Social and Child Protection) are
under careful review because of the adverse fiscal effect and the already low labor
participation. The authorities will ask for its revocation. While emphasizing that the nominal
public wages (and related pension bill) remained virtually flat in the period 2011-2015, the
authorities stay open to staff’s idea of reinstating a productivity based anchor for the public
wage bill. Moreover, the number of public sector employees will be reviewed. As an interim
measure, pensions will be adjusted to the average wage and current inflation.
Given the limited fiscal space, the authorities streamline and prioritize recurrent capital
spending. The main focus is on projects filling obvious infrastructure gaps with the highest
value for money, playing a catalytic role in growth enhancing and job creation.
With regards to PFM capacity strengthening and the public finance transparency, the
authorities adopted the ESA 2010 Implementing Strategy as well as the Strategy for
Transition of Public Sector to Accrual Accounting in 2015. Given the capacity constraints,
the authorities will rely on TA for the Strategies’ efficient implementation.
Public Debt Sustainability
The authorities share the underlying assumptions of staff’s DSA, although with a
somewhat lower baseline peak. In light of medium term capital spending, the authorities
forecast public debt to peak to 77.9 percent of GDP in 2018, while expecting somewhat
lower financial needs compared to staff. The authorities’ foresee stronger growth
assumptions for 2017-2018, because of the highway construction, and a higher level of fiscal
discipline, especially because of the assumed improvement in tax collection. The authorities
are mindful of risks that could deteriorate the debt profile, especially risks related to an
adverse growth scenario, further balance deterioration, interest rates on newly issued debt,
and highway-related cost overruns. The authorities remain attentive to the high public debt
elasticity on growth changes. In order to prevent primary balance shock, as previously
highlighted, the authorities are working on a medium term fiscal consolidation plan, with
contingency scenarios that would protect the primary balance from the current balance
“slippages” in the medium term. The authorities believe that a reliable medium term fiscal
consolidation plan, coupled with leveraging new debt financing on international markets with
alternative sources such as policy based financing, could ease the impact of a potential
interest rate hike. Finally, the risk of delay in the project implementation of the Bar-Boljare
highway or the related cost overruns remain in the domain of possible, however, the pristine
track record of the constructor in almost eighty countries and ample penalty triggers, that

4
could be activated in that case, are reassuring.
Structural policies and business environment
The authorities’ primary goal is to improve labor market flexibility and overcome
rigidities. In order to leverage knowledge of best global practices, the new WBG CPF
(Country Partnership Framework) for Montenegro envisages projects which will address the
lack of flexibility in the labor market and high labor market costs, mismatches between
education, skills and labor market needs, and the weak labor participation. A new drafted
Labor Law aims to significantly lower the employer’s cost of firing while streamlining
dismissal and redundancy procedures. The new CPF builds upon ‘Montenegro Development
Directions 2015-2018’ which outlines structural policy guidelines to achieve smart, inclusive
and sustainable growth.
Montenegro is making steady progress in improving the business environment. In the
2016 Doing Business indicators, Montenegro made particular progress in the area of
construction permits (advanced by 51 positions over the course of two years) and paying
taxes. In order to accelerate further reforms related to the business environment, the
authorities will amend and improve the monitoring of the Action plan - “Regulatory
guillotine" that should accelerate reforms in areas that are lagging behind such as access to
energy, starting a business, protection of minority investors, and resolving insolvency.
The authorities agree with staff that non-tariff barriers hamper trade flows. The non
tariff barriers issue is work in progress and correlates to the EU Acquis alignment. For
example, in 2015 the COFACE started issuing the SME excellence certificate in Montenegro,
enabling local businesses and their potential partners, to verify company’s business profile
and creditworthiness. This initiative promotes successful integration of Montenegrin SMEs
in regional and EU markets by enhancing market transparency.

Financial sector policies and addressing financial stability risks
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the resilience of the financial system
and its vulnerabilities. The banking system, with ample liquidity and comfortable
capitalization levels, is still under stress because of weakened assets quality due to the crisis,
which put a drag on credit growth and profitability. Staff’s recommendations have been duly
noted and the authorities are working on the action plan based on the FSSA’s conclusions.
This action plan will build upon the already developed strategy for alignment of the domestic
regulatory framework with the financial sector Acquis from the EU.
The high levels of NPLs are reduced, while the lending channel was moderately
unlocked. The leading financial stability risk, the high NPL, is reduced to 12.47 percent in

5
December 2015, almost half compared to the post real-estate boom level of 25.3 percent in
2011. The authorities attribute the strong NPL reduction in 2015 to four reasons: 1. the
recently introduced structural regulatory measures, 2. the uplifted growth prospects, 3.
continued deleveraging of the banks and 4. the increased banking competition. The
authorities are committed to continue to treat NPLs in a holistic manner while considering
the FSAP team’s recommendations. The CBM created a draft Law on Financial Factoring,
Lease, and Credit and Guarantee operations which should put the remaining non-banking
stocks of NPLs under strict supervision of the CBM. The authorities will analyze modalities
for independent asset quality reviews.
Notwithstanding staff’s view that increased bank competition could lead to
vulnerabilities, the authorities believe that the competition had a positive impact on
interest rate spreads, market depth, consumer inertia, and access to finance. With 14
banks Montenegro is below the average of its smaller European/regional MIC peers. The
authorities follow the legislation governing bank licensing and market access, which is fully
aligned with the EU practice (Directive 2006/48/EC). If a strong institutional framework is in
place, financial stability and banking competition can coexist. Therefore, in order to
compensate for still strengthening the supervision, the CBM vigilantly monitors banks that
might be under cost funding distress, or practice ominous risk taking behavior in light of the
increased competition and curbing interest spreads.
At this moment, the authorities are not considering reintroduction interest rate caps.
They highlight that interest rate caps are not considered as a credit growth policy measure,
but rather as an instrument to restrain further protraction of NPLs, restricting market access
to clients with enormous risk premiums and high probability of default. The authorities note
that the recently adopted Personal Bankruptcy Law is currently under review. With regards to
the financial safety net, the authorities’ welcome the guidance on establishing of the
Resolution Unit within the CBM.
The authorities support the staff’s suggestion that the macroprudential framework and
systemic liquidity should be enhanced. The authorities will analyze which of the suggested
macroprudential measures are effectively calibrated to circumstances and country-specific
characteristics of the Montenegrin financial system. As staff rightly noted, systemic liquidity
management is bounded by euroization, while the existing liquidity crisis management
framework has only recently come to fore. The current large liquidity buffers offer the
authorities a period for adjustment to the new liquidity risk management standards, in line
with Basel III requirements.
The authorities welcome the staff’s assessment that banking and insurance oversight
frameworks are significantly progressed in alignment with the Basel core principles and
the EU Acquis, and agree that further improvements are warranted. As already noted,
the authorities developed a time bound strategy committed to full alignment of the regulatory

6
framework with the EU Acquis and the Basel principles, including provisions referring to
recommended enhanced credit risk assessment and development of prudential limits on large
exposures. The authorities will consider recommendations on transitional strategy referring
to gradual introduction of Solvency II regulation in the insurance oversight framework.
Staff notes that Montenegro is taking active steps to enhance its AML/CFT, but
significant room for improvement remains. The authorities acknowledge remaining gaps
and highlight that according to the MONEYVAL cycle assessments, Montenegro has been
making constant progress, especially in the area of money laundering offences. The
authorities underscore that banks, insurance companies, MFIs and their supervisory
authorities are fully provisioned to prevent criminals or their associates from holding or
being the beneficial owners of a significant or controlling interest. The remaining legislation
gap refers solely to recently introduced Voluntary Pension Funds (constituting tail end part of
Montenegrin financial market).
