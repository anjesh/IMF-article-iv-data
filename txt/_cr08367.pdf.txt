Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Poul Thomsen and Martin Fetherston
August 20, 2008
Executive Summary
Background: The long expansion is coming to an end, exposing the economy’s overstretched
private sector balance sheets, large macroeconomic imbalances, and high dependence on
foreign financing. With external liquidity constraints binding, economic activity is expected
to slow significantly from unsustainably high levels, inflation to remain well above target, and
the current account to narrow. Uncertainty surrounding the outlook is unusually large,
dominated by significant downside risks—both external and domestic. In the event of a
prolonged external liquidity crunch, the economy could face severe financial strain, especially
if domestic risks materialize simultaneously.
Staff views: The main challenge is to facilitate an orderly rebalancing process, while
mitigating risks. A key concern is external liquidity risks, which could also trigger an
unwinding of domestic vulnerabilities. Monetary policy should continue to be tight, to return
inflation to target and shore up confidence in the króna, given prevailing inflationary
pressures and external vulnerabilities. The highly expansionary fiscal policy should be
restrained to help support the central bank’s efforts to combat inflation and maintain
confidence. Further actions to mitigate financial sector vulnerabilities should be pursued with
vigor, as concerns about banks’ funding are at the core of the external liquidity risks.
Contingency planning needs to continue in full force.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agree with the staff’s diagnosis and
recommendations. However, while external risks are recognized to be substantial, the policy
focus has shifted to addressing concerns about a deep domestic recession. Accordingly, the
authorities see limited room to tighten monetary and fiscal policies. At the same time, they
welcomed staff’s recommendations to mitigate financial sector vulnerabilities and strengthen
contingency planning.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Iceland is at a difficult and uncertain turning point. The economy is prosperous
and flexible, and its long-term prospects are promising, given sound institutions and
bountiful renewable natural resources (Figure 1). But a long home-grown, foreign-funded
boom led to large macroeconomic imbalances, overstretched private sector balance sheets,
and high dependence on foreign financing (Box 1). The current account deficit exceeded
15 percent of GDP in each of the past three years; inflation moved away from target; the
króna became overvalued; domestic credit growth reached new peaks; and house prices shot
up to record levels. The financial sector expanded to over 1,000 percent of GDP, while gross
external indebtedness reached 550 percent of GDP at end-2007, largely on account of the
banking sector. The indebtedness of households and corporations also swelled. The boom is
now coming to an end, exposing these vulnerabilities to an uncertain external environment.

Box 1. Background: Origins of the Long Boom
A dramatic acceleration of domestic demand was at the core of Iceland’s boom. Real output rose by
over 25 percent during 2003–07, jump-started with a large aluminum-sector investment project in 2003 and
sustained by an unprecedented rise in private consumption, which pushed the savings rate into negative
territory. The spending boom reflected higher disposable income, easy credit, higher housing and equity
wealth, an appreciated currency which led to cheaper imports, and lower unemployment (Figure 2).

Ample global liquidity and low risk premiums fuelled the boom. Buoyed by benign global financing
conditions and the excellent sovereign credit rating, the recently fully-privatized banks took advantage of
carry trade investment opportunities to secured cheap foreign financing to expand across all business lines.
Banks’ consolidated assets increased from 100 to almost 900 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2007, due
to a rapid expansion abroad through acquisitions abroad, which relied heavily on investment-banking and
capital-market activities and foreign wholesale funding. The bank expansion contributed to a domestic credit
expansion to corporations and households, thereby supporting the housing and consumption booms. With
relaxed liquidity constraints, firms could borrow directly from abroad.

Policies were tightened during most of the expansion, but could not prevent an overheating. The
central bank raised its key policy rate, but its efforts were undermined by the unexpected strength of the
expansion, króna appreciation, rapid financial innovation, and increased competition in credit markets.
Buoyed by strong revenue growth on the back of rising asset prices, fiscal policy was countercyclical during
most of the expansion, but turned firmly expansionary in 2007.

As global external conditions deteriorated, Iceland faced severe financial
turbulence in early 2008. In March, the CDS spreads of the three main commercial banks
rose to over 1,000 basis points—partly due to investor concerns about their large funding
needs and high dependence on wholesale funding. Despite minimal public sector debt, the
sovereign was faced with a significantly increased risk premium, likely reflecting concerns
about its potential liabilities in the event of banking problems. At the same time, the sudden
jump in risk premiums prompted a large króna depreciation (of about 30 percent in
December 2007-March 2008), with negative repercussions for already-high inflation.

In response to intensifying external pressures, the authorities took steps to shore
up confidence. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) tightened the policy rate and enhanced
liquidity provision to reduce pressures in foreign exchange and domestic markets. In midMay, it entered into currency swap arrangements with the central banks of Denmark, Norway,
and Sweden, providing access to 1.5 billion euros, if needed. The government expressed its
willingness to boost CBI’s international reserves and pledged to pursue fiscal prudence and
reforms of the fiscal framework and the Housing Financing Fund (HFF).

In late June, the Article IV discussions took place amidst renewed worsening of
market and economic conditions. Bank and sovereign CDS spreads were approaching their
March peaks. The foreign exchange swap market remained frozen and the króna volatile.
With liquidity constraints becoming more binding, the overheated economy was quickly
cooling—as indicated by the sharp growth slowdown in the first quarter of 2008—while
inflation increased to the highest level among industrial countries.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
5.
Against this backdrop, discussions focused on the policies needed to facilitate an
orderly rebalancing process, while mitigating mounting risks by shoring up confidence.
Topics of discussions included the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, and
actions to address vulnerabilities stemming from the banking sector. With external financing
conditions quickly deteriorating, staff inquired about the authorities’ plans to follow up on
the confidence-building measures and pledges announced earlier this year.

8
6.

Several questions guided the discussions:

•

What is the outlook for restoring macroeconomic balance under current policies, and
what are the main risks associated with it?

•

Which monetary policy stance would be best suited to re-establish price stability and
mitigate prevailing risks?

•

How should the fiscal policy stance be adjusted and fiscal framework reformed to
support monetary policy efforts and contribute to confidence building?

•

What are key financial sector vulnerabilities, and what steps can be taken to promote
financial stability and strengthen contingency planning?
A. Outlook and Risks

7.
Despite differences in precise timing, staff and the authorities agreed that a
recession was imminent, led by a contraction in domestic demand. While staff saw output
come to a standstill in 2008 and contract in 2009–10, the authorities projected somewhat
higher growth this year, followed by a recession. All growth projections were driven by a
sharp retrenchment in private consumption, owing to tighter lending conditions, significantly
lower real estate prices, weaker private sector balance sheets, and declining purchasing
power. While staff and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) projected a decline in overall
investment in 2009–10, the CBI expected high public sector and aluminum-related
investment to quickly offset a sharp fall in other investment beyond 2008. Net exports were
expected to support growth over the next few years, on the back of strong aluminum exports
and a contraction in imports. Assuming that the nominal exchange rate would remain broadly
constant, both the authorities and staff projected the current account deficit to narrow
significantly over the medium term.

Both sides expected the fiscal position to deteriorate to a varying degree—due to
a weaker economy and stimulative policy measures—and spending pressures to rise.
The MoF projected the general government balance to turn into a deficit of 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2010, a 7 percentage point deterioration since 2007. Cyclical factors explain about
half of the deterioration, while the rest reflects structural measures, including a sharp increase
in public investment in 2008, the implementation of announced tax cuts, and higher spending
in 2009–10. Given these policies, but more pessimistic macroeconomic assumptions (and
their impact on tax revenues), staff forecast a fiscal deficit peaking at around 5 percent of
GDP in 2010, and net debt growing to above 20 percent of GDP by 2013. The authorities
acknowledged that pressures to increase spending are mounting, given possible: (i) further
demands to boost infrastructure investment; (ii) pressure on social spending as
unemployment rises; and (iii) a difficult round of public wage renegotiations in 2009.

Inflation is expected to remain persistently above target, with significant risks on
the upside. Inflation, above the 2.5 percent target since 2004, is now at its highest in 18 years
(reaching 13.6 percent in July) and shows no signs of abating (Figure 3). Inflation
expectations are unhinged (in both survey and market data). Money growth is robust, and real
interest rates are falling. Although wage growth has been benign so far, pressures could
emerge as wage agreement contracts come up for renegotiation in early 2009. Accordingly,
and despite a sharp projected slowdown in real activity, staff expects inflation to peak at
close to 14 percent in Q3 2008, and return to target only in the second half of 2012.
Moreover, risks to this outlook are firmly on the upside, stemming mainly from a further
króna depreciation. Based on the same policy rate assumption and inflation outturns up to
June, the CBI forecast inflation to fall sharply in early 2009, and return to the target in the
second half of 2010. 1 However, the July Monetary Bulletin acknowledges that the uncertainty
surrounding the CBI’s inflation forecast is very high, with the risk profile tilted to the upside.

1

Over the three-year forecast horizon, staff assumes an unchanged nominal exchange rate, while the CBI
projects a slight appreciation in the short term, followed by a roughly similar depreciation. The exchange rate
pass-though to consumer prices is estimated to be about 40 percent.

With unusually large uncertainty surrounding the outlook, concerns about
downside risks dominated—staff saw external risks as prevailing, while the authorities
emphasized domestic ones.
•

In staff’s view, external liquidity risks remained a key concern, given the high
foreign debt of the private sector, chiefly related to the large funding needs of the
banking sector. Even though the króna has already depreciated by over 30 percent
since end-2007, under the currently deteriorating external market conditions and
heightened króna volatility (see text charts), a further reduction in net capital inflows
could lead to further króna depreciation fueling inflation and exacerbating the alreadytight domestic credit conditions. This could trigger a chain reaction of additional
adjustment in domestic asset prices and balance sheets, with correspondingly large
effects on consumption and investment (Box 2).

likelihood of sharp consumption cutbacks and household default (see OECD, 2006).

•

The condition of non-financial corporate balance sheets is uncertain and possibly highly sensitive
to market conditions. Leverage rose substantially, especially for unlisted companies—ranging
between 300 to 400 percent, according to available data. While recent data on the quality of
corporate assets are unavailable, existing indicators imply a large amount of goodwill, which is highly
dependent on market sentiment. Hence, binding liquidity constraints could not only dampen
investment, which depends on credit availability and asset price increases, but also increase the
likelihood of substantial investment cutbacks and corporate default.

•

The above vulnerabilities may, in turn, negatively affect banks’ balance sheets, triggering a
confidence shock that could prompt a new round of króna depreciation. This could lead to further
deleterious (and potentially non-linear) effects on domestic asset prices and private sector balance
sheets, with correspondingly large impact on consumption and investment. Corporate vulnerabilities
could be especially important given the complex links between Iceland’s non-financial corporations
and banks.

12
•

While recognizing that external risks were substantial, but beyond their control, the
authorities put greater emphasis on the significant domestic risks stemming from the
real estate market and the corporate sector. Specifically, a larger-than-expected
downturn in the housing market would lower private consumption even further, while
tighter credit conditions and depressed economic activity would hurt corporate
profitability. Staff agreed these risks are also important, but thought that they were
more likely to be ultimately triggered by external factors. Moreover, staff argued that
some adjustment in asset prices and balance sheets is inevitable (and part of a
necessary rebalancing), given their rapid expansion in the past years.

•

It was broadly agreed that the increased vulnerability of private sector balance sheets
raised the uncertainty about the overall effects of both external and domestic shocks.
It was also acknowledged that a prolonged external liquidity crunch entailed the risk
of financial stress, especially if domestic risks materialized simultaneously.
B. External Stability

11.
The current account deficit is expected to move closer to equilibrium over the
medium term, and the real exchange rate is in a range broadly consistent with longterm fundamentals (Box 3). Both staff and the CBI see the current account deficit moving
closer toward its equilibrium level of around 4–5 percent of GDP over the medium term. The
trade balance is projected to improve gradually. Given the large level of external
indebtedness, the income balance is expected to decline more sluggishly over time. After its
recent adjustment (of about 20 percent in real effective terms since end-2007), the evidence
suggests that that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals; its current level
is deemed by both staff and the authorities to be somewhat below its equilibrium level.

12.
However, there are growing concerns about the presence of external instability
resulting from the highly vulnerable capital and financial accounts. The external balance
sheet structure remains overstretched and fragile. Private sector external debt is high—mostly
due to the large foreign liabilities of the banking sector—and the share of short-term debt has

13
risen, also on account of the banks. The reserve coverage of short-term debt is low.
Moreover, potential difficulties to finance the current account could arise if net capital
inflows decrease substantially—for example, significant amounts of Glacier bonds 2 are
maturing in the coming quarters, and rollover could be limited—triggering a further króna
depreciation, and risking debt-servicing difficulties (Annex I). With banks’ funding risks at
the core, these vulnerabilities are large and could unwind quickly in the currently turbulent
global financial climate. Consequently, staff is concerned about the presence of capitalaccount based instability; this, however, is not a result of exchange rate policy, as the króna is
freely floating and the authorities do not intervene in the foreign exchange market. The
authorities generally agreed that there are significant capital account-based vulnerabilities,
but pointed to a number of mitigating factors, such as Iceland’s increased debt-servicing
capacity (due to the expansion in the aluminum and energy sectors) residents’ large foreign
assets, as well as a very low level of government debt and a funded pension system.
Box 3. External Stability from an Exchange Rate Perspective
Results from a CGER-type analysis applied to Iceland suggest that the current level of the real exchange rate
(REER) is broadly in line with long-term fundamentals, given the recent króna depreciation:
•
According to the macroeconomic balance approach, the REER may be under/overvalued by some 5 to 9 percentage
points, based on a gap of -1 to -2 percent of GDP between the underlying and the norm current account.
•

According to the real exchange rate approach, the current and medium-term levels of the REER appear
undervalued by 11 and 1 percent, respectively.

•

According to the external sustainability approach, the REER appears to be undervalued by 9 percent, based on a
gap between the underlying and the NFA-stabilizing CA of about -2 percent of GDP.

This analysis builds on and updates the work in Tchaidze’s paper “Estimating Iceland’s Real Equilibrium Exchange
Rate (2007). His results suggested that the REER was overvalued by about 15-25 percent at end 2007. Since then,
however, the REER depreciated by more than 20 percent as of end-June 2008, the reference date for this analysis.
Hence, results in this analysis are broadly consistent with those of Tchaidze, given the margins of error of this exercise.

C. Monetary Policy
13.
Given prevailing external risks and strong inflationary pressures, staff favored a
somewhat tighter policy stance than the authorities.
•

CBI officials viewed the current policy stance as appropriately tight to help bring
inflation down in the context of weakening economic activity. While acknowledging
the difficult inflation environment, they saw limited room for further rate hikes at this
juncture, arguing that the rapid economic slowdown and binding foreign liquidity
constraints were already slowing credit growth and making domestic interest rates
increasingly important for private sector borrowers. Accordingly, the CBI kept its key
policy rate unchanged at 15½ percent at its July 3 meeting—amidst enormous
pressures for rate cuts from the business community, unions, and academics, among
others.

•

The mission agreed with maintaining a tight stance and emphasized that pressures to
ease should be resisted until there are clear signs that inflation is on a firm downward
path. In addition, staff noted that a further (small) increase in the policy rate could be
useful to signal the CBI’s commitment to achieving the target and shoring up
confidence in the krόna. 3 Mindful of domestic risks, staff nevertheless argued that
failure to contain inflation could erode confidence in the krόna, which could feed
back into inflation and adversely affect balance sheets, ultimately requiring even
higher policy rates. 4 Moreover, the direct impact of modestly higher interest rates on
banks would appear limited (according to the authorities’ stress tests), although there
could be (hard-to-quantify) indirect effects stemming from the deterioration of
corporate balance sheets—these, however, are also vulnerable to depreciation
(Box 2).

14.
It was recognized that the central bank’s liquidity provision posed new
challenges. The authorities explained that the recent issuance of short-term government debt
and CBI paper was done to help restore normal functioning of the foreign exchange swap
market, 5 while the alignment of the CBI’s definition of repo-eligible collateral with that of
the ECB was implemented to alleviate domestic liquidity pressures. Staff welcomed these
measures, but cautioned that the CBI’s level of liquidity provision may not be consistent with

3

See Box I-1 of the CBI’s April Monetary Bulletin for a detailed discussion on the importance of anchoring
expectations in Iceland, including on the rationale for a different monetary policy response than in the United
States.
4

Moreover, given the price indexation of most household debt, high inflation would hurt households
disproportionately by reducing purchasing power and increasing debt burdens.

5

Iceland’s foreign exchange swap market.

15
its tight monetary policy stance. 6 In this regard, plans to further increase the supply of shortterm government debt would be helpful not only to support the foreign exchange swap
market, but also as an additional liquidity-management tool.
15.
No significant progress has been achieved in reforming the HFF. The HFF is the
largest provider of mortgage loans in the market, offering interest rates that do not respond
quickly to policy rates, hindering the effectiveness of monetary policy. The authorities and
staff agreed that, to remove this structural impediment, the HFF’s role in the financial market
could be redefined by separating the social component that provides targeted support from
the market-based element that should not benefit from state aid. However, despite the
government’s recent pledge to reform the HFF, the reform content is still far from being
finalized. The authorities indicated that implementation is unlikely before 2009.
16.
The recent HFF measures aimed at jumpstarting the lower-end of the real estate
market and easing funding pressures were controversial. Specifically:
•

The already-implemented measures to raise HFF lending limits and loan-to-value
ratios were seen by staff as going against the aforementioned reform. These measures
would hinder monetary policy efforts to combat inflation and delay a much-needed
price adjustment in the overheated real estate market. The authorities, however,
expected the economic impact of these changes to be limited.

•

The announced measures related to collateralized borrowing could be potentially
beneficial, in staff’s view, as they could ease funding pressures and improve the CBI’s
collateral quality. The mission cautioned, however, that these measures should be
carefully drafted to prevent a potential risk transfer from private to public balance
sheets and a further significant increase in domestic liquidity provision.

6

As of end-June, the stock of collateralized loans was 330 billion ISK (about 25 percent of nominal GDP in
2007).

16
Iceland: Recent HFF Measures

Authorisations to take HFF rental housing loans are expanded to the general market.

June 19
(in effect July 1)

D. Fiscal Policy
17.
Staff and the authorities had different views regarding the priorities and role of
fiscal policy, stemming mainly from differing positions on prevailing risks.
•

Staff argued for a more cautious fiscal stance to build confidence and support
monetary policy efforts to combat inflation, especially given the risk of a further
króna depreciation. 7 With private sector debt and the government’s contingent
liabilities already large, keeping the (on-balance sheet) public sector debt low would
also convey a positive signal to financial markets. In addition, tax revenue projections
could prove optimistic given potential downside effects of the unwinding of the asset
price boom. Accordingly, the mission argued that while automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate fully, most of the planned stimulus (estimated at 3½ percent of
GDP in 2008–10) should be clawed back, preferably through a slowdown in
expenditure growth. 8

7

Moreover, unlike monetary policy, tightening fiscal policy is less likely to induce the adverse balance sheet
effects described in Box 2.

8

As mentioned in Appendix IV of the April Monetary Bulletin, Iceland’s expenditure multipliers tend to be
smaller than in larger economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Euro Area, suggesting
that discretionary fiscal policy is less effective in stabilizing the economy.

•

In contrast, the authorities believed that domestic risks prevailed, and hence the policy
focus should shift toward preventing a sharp economic downturn. In addition, rolling
back the implementation of the recent pledges and quickly adjusting other spending
(especially social spending and wages) were seen as politically unfeasible, or very
difficult. More generally, the authorities argued that fiscal policy should play a
countercyclical role, using past fiscal savings to smooth the economic downturn. In
the event of a much sharper-than-expected downturn, the authorities noted that with
little public tolerance for high unemployment, the government would be called upon
to support labor markets and help affected groups.

•

Staff saw a more active stabilizing role for fiscal policy only if such a scenario were
to materialize, considering that monetary policy would still need to shore up
confidence in the króna and keep inflation expectations under control. In this context,
targeted and temporary measures could be used, with additional positive distributional
effects (e.g., housing support, unemployment benefits).

18.
Looking forward, staff stressed the benefits of a more rules-based fiscal
framework to help improve macroeconomic stabilization. The authorities agreed that the
current medium-term framework lacked effective, binding spending controls. To achieve
better expenditure control, one reform objective was to develop a multi-year budgeting
approach consistent with policy goals. However, with no other specific plans in the near term,
the authorities saw fiscal reform as a slow-moving process. Staff reiterated the need to make
multi-year targets more binding and increase control of local government finances.

18
E. Financial Sector Policy
19.
A recent FSAP Update points to high and rising vulnerabilities in the financial
sector. Despite reported financial indicators of the banking system being fully compliant with
regulatory requirements (Figure 4), there are several key risks:
•

Liquidity and funding risks, associated with the banks’ reliance on market funding
and sizeable funding needs due to a significant amount of debt maturing over the next
two years. Given the difficult market situation, challenges in securing adequate
liquidity coverage at acceptable price could also reduce bank profitability.

•

Credit and market risks, stemming from the foreign currency and equity exposures
and high levels of debt of domestic borrowers, 9 as well as from collateralized
lending, 10 connected lending and large exposures (mostly related to holding
companies);

•

Operational risks, associated with the banks’ rapid expansion in recent years,
including in new markets and business lines, which could strain risk management
capacity and internal controls;

•

Quality of capital risks, related to complex ownership structures, perceived
substantial related-party lending, and uncertainty about the financial strength of
shareholders following the decline in equity markets. 11

20.
Despite efforts to address market concerns, managing these risks remains a
challenge for the banking sector. The three largest banks have responded by slowing
lending growth, consolidating funding needs, withdrawing from marginal markets,
mobilizing retail deposits abroad, and reducing costs. As a result, they reported adequate
liquidity to meet debt obligations over the next 12 months. But banks’ ability to de-leverage
has been limited by global risk aversion, and their market and credit risk have increased,
pointing to significant risks going forward. Hence, as highlighted by the FSAP Update, it
remains unclear whether these adjustments are sufficient in today’s financial environment.
Access to foreign liquidity remains severely limited, and banks’ CDS spreads have been
rising toward their March peaks. Some smaller banks have reportedly come under liquidity
pressures as well. In this environment, the central bank is now the key liquidity provider to
the banking system.

9

As noted in FSSA (¶19), some indications of a slippage in credit quality have already appeared.

10

See FSSA (¶20).

11

The large banks protected their capital against foreign currency fluctuations by hedging with derivatives.

19
21.
Accordingly, discussions focused on policy options to further mitigate financial
sector risks. Staff welcomed the progress made over the past few years by the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FME) and the CBI to boost monitoring, analysis, and stress-testing of
liquidity, credit, and market risks. Staff stressed, however, that a successful policy going
forward will require strengthening financial buffers and increasing transparency as regards
banks’ ownership and lending relations. 12 Accordingly, drawing on the FSAP’s
recommendations, staff outlined possible options to mitigate risks further, including by: (i)
raising capital cushions, including for operational, credit, and quality-of-capital risks; (ii)
reviewing the robustness of liquidity coverage under different stress scenarios that take into
account the interlinkages among banks and boosting liquidity buffers appropriately; (iii)
improving overall transparency concerning progress in reducing related-party transactions
and concentrated lending. There was broad agreement that, if successfully implemented,
these policies could contribute to a significant slowdown in banks’ balance sheet growth.
However, as mentioned in the FSAP’s findings, more decisive steps to further deleverage
may become necessary.
22.
The mission also covered other issues related to financial stability. Specifically,
staff welcomed the progress made to enhance the quality of supervision, including by
boosting the supervisory powers and resources of the FME and advancing the work on highfrequency monitoring and modeling. At the same time, the mission stressed that lack of the
timely and comprehensive data on the non-financial corporate sector (especially nonlisted companies) impedes the analysis of the sector’s financial situation and its potential
implications for the banks. Therefore, staff urged boosting the enforcement of disclosure
requirements for all corporations—a recommendation that the authorities welcomed.
F. Contingency Planning
23.
Given the large vulnerabilities of the system, discussions also focused on key
elements of contingency planning. In recent years, supervisory powers and resources have
been boosted, formal frameworks for coordination between domestic agencies and across the
Nordic region established and tested, 13 and the task force on liquidity crisis management
(established in late 2007) advanced its work on high-frequency monitoring and modeling.
•

Noting the progress already made, staff stressed that these efforts should continue in
full force, 14 including by compiling all existing elements of contingency planning
into a single framework—a recommendation welcomed by the authorities.

•

There was general agreement that the bank resolution framework should be
strengthened to provide the FME with additional legislative powers.

12

On transparency, see FSSA (¶18, ¶27, and Key Recommendations).

13

An MOU was signed between the Nordic countries to deal with cross-border crises in 2003.

14

See FSSA, Section III, B and C on cross-border policy coordination and crisis management and bank
resolution, respectively.

20
•

The CBI clarified that the liquidity swap agreement with other Nordic banks was
only a precautionary, confidence-building measure.

•

With foreign exchange reserves still low relative to potential liabilities, the
authorities confirmed (and staff welcomed) their commitment to increase the CBI’s
reserves “at the right time.”

•

In response to a query, CBI officials mentioned no specific plans or intentions to
boost the CBI’s LOLR capacity. A review of deposit insurance is underway.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

24.
Iceland’s prosperous and flexible economy is now starting a difficult and highly
uncertain adjustment process. Its long expansion has come to an end. Its legacies are
overstretched private sector balance sheets, large macroeconomic imbalances, and high
dependence on foreign financing. As liquidity constraints are becoming more binding,
economic activity is expected to slow significantly from unsustainably high levels,
inflationary pressures to persist, and the current account to normalize. Uncertainties
surrounding the outlook are unusually large, with significant downside risks dominated by
external factors. Although the current level of the (freely-floating) króna is estimated to be
somewhat below its equilibrium level, the external balance sheet structure remains fragile—
mainly due to the large funding needs of the banking sector—raising concerns about capital
account-based external instability. If risks were to materialize in full, Iceland could face
severe financial strains.
25.
Against this backdrop, policies will have the challenging task to facilitate an
orderly rebalancing process, while mitigating risks by shoring up confidence. Close
coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, along with actions to address financial
sector vulnerabilities, will be key in this respect.
26.
A continued tight monetary policy stance is needed to return inflation to target
and maintain confidence in the króna. A further króna decline would fuel inflationary
pressures, squeeze private balance sheets, and erode households’ purchasing power. In turn,
such developments could further undermine confidence, feeding back into currency
weakness. To prevent this, monetary policy should remain tight until there are clear signs that
inflation is on a firm downward path, while domestic liquidity provision should be carefully
managed. Pressures to ease prematurely should be resisted.
27.
Promptly acting on the pledge to reform the publicly-owned HFF is crucial to
increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. Its role in the financial market could be
redefined by separating the social component that provides targeted support from the marketbased element that should not benefit from state aid.
28.
The highly stimulative fiscal policy needs to be restrained. Given the prevailing
external risks and high leverage in the economy, a more neutral fiscal stance is warranted to

21
help shore up confidence and support the central bank’s efforts to combat inflation. To
achieve a more balanced macroeconomic policy mix, most of the planned stimulus should be
clawed back, preferably by slowing expenditure growth. At a minimum, mounting pressures
to increase spending should be resisted.
29.
The commitment to strengthen the fiscal framework is welcome and should be
followed by concrete steps. Important elements of reform could include: more binding
annual expenditure limits, a multi-year budgeting based on clear policy commitments, and
mechanisms to better control local government finances.
30.
Policy options to mitigate banking sector risks should be pursued with vigor. A
successful policy going forward will require strengthening financial buffers and increasing
transparency as regards the condition of the banks. Possible options could include: (i) raising
capital cushions, including for operational, credit, and quality-of-capital risks; (ii) reviewing
the robustness of liquidity coverage under different stress scenarios that account for the
interlinkages among banks and boosting liquidity buffers appropriately; (iii) improving
overall transparency concerning progress in reducing related-party transactions and
concentrated lending. The implementation of these policies could contribute to a slowdown
in banks’ balance sheet growth. If such efforts proved unsuccessful, however, more
aggressive steps to deleverage would be necessary.
31.
Better enforcement of disclosure requirements for all corporations is needed.
More timely and comprehensive information on the balance sheets of all companies will help
improve understanding of the financial health of the corporate sector and its implications for
financial stability.
32.
The crisis prevention and resolution framework could be strengthened further,
building on progress to date. Ongoing efforts should continue in full force, including by
compiling all existing elements of contingency planning into a single framework. In addition,
the bank resolution framework should be strengthened to provide the FME with additional
legislative powers. Finally, the commitment to boost the CBI’s reserves should be fulfilled at
the appropriate time.

The Icelandic economy faces significant challenges in the near term, but its longterm prospects remain enviable. The economy has a track record of rebounding quickly
from shocks. Labor and product markets are open and flexible; government debt is very low;
the pension system is funded; institutions are sound; and renewable natural resources are
bountiful and well-managed.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. ICELAND: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Iceland’s external debt has ballooned in recent years to a level close to 560 percent of GDP at
end-2007. Large current account deficits in the last five years, driven by investment projects and the
expansion of Icelandic commercial banks and firms abroad, resulted in a sharp increase in gross
external debt, from about 140 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 558 percent of GDP at end2007. The expansion of external debt of the banking sector (from 86 to 462 percent of GDP
between 2003 and 2007) contributed to the bulk of the increase in Iceland’s total external debt.
Short-term debt also increased significantly, again mainly on account of the banks, from 31 to
almost 200 percent of GDP between 2003 and 2007 (with the bulk of the increase occurring in 2007,
thus implying a much larger financing need in 2008). Accounting for residents’ holdings of assets
abroad, net debt has increased from 101 to 252 percent of GDP, while the net international
investment position (IIP) has deteriorated from -63 to -124 percent of GDP during 2003–07.
Iceland’s high external indebtedness and vulnerability, particularly to a króna depreciation,
raise concerns about residents’ ability to service debt and point to the existence of capitalaccount based external instability. Under the baseline scenario, the level of net external debt will
increase further and stabilize around 230 percent of GDP. Various shocks to growth, the non-interest
current account, and the interest rate could drive debt up further by some 20–30 percentage points.
However, debt is most vulnerable to an exchange rate shock. A one-time 30 percent depreciation of
real exchange rate in 2009 could lead an increase in net debt topping 450 percent of GDP (under the
baseline scenario, the real exchange rate is assumed to move toward its equilibrium level by 2013,
which implies a depreciation of about 11 percentage points compared to its end-2007 level).
Concerns about Iceland’s external sustainability are somewhat mitigated by the greater
resilience of the IIP to shocks and its potentially lower “true” value. Given the large equity
holdings of domestic companies abroad, which are not captured
IIP: Real depreciation shock
in the net external debt, the IIP may be a better measure of
30-percent
Iceland’s true external position. Under the same extreme
240
depreciation
209
scenario (30 percent real depreciation in 2009), IIP position at
200
end-2013 deteriorates from 139 to 209 percent of GDP, a
sizeable, but much smaller adjustment than that in external debt. 160
Baseline
139
120
Moreover, potential measurement imperfections may lead to an
undervaluation of the IIP, given the large stocks and differing
80
asset and liability composition. With outward FDI more than
40
double inward FDI, and its recording at book rather than market
0
value, the IIP could have been undervalued by as much as
2003
2005
2007
2009
2011
2013
1
60 percent of GDP at end-2006. Moreover, portfolio assets and
receipts may also be underestimated, as their lower implicit rate of return appears at odds with the
profitability and growth of Icelandic companies recently. Finally, some of the profit of firms owned
by Icelandic holding companies registered abroad is counted as expenditure, further understating the
true value of IIP. 2

ANNEX III. ICELAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the SDDS
specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the
timeliness and periodicity for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). The
Statistics Department (STA) prepared a data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (data ROSC) that was published on November 22, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a
timely manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases,
statistical information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly,
and annual publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the
Ministry of Finance, and Statistics Iceland), and is increasingly available on their internet
sites. Provision of electronic data in English has improved substantially in recent years,
especially from Statistics Iceland.
As regards the national accounts data, the authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000 and
revised the corresponding time series back to 1990. Another revision was carried out in 2002.
A breakdown is disseminated by industry back to the beginning of the production approach
in 1973. Data on GNP and national income, in current and constant prices, as well as data on
net savings for the economy as a whole, are also disseminated. The quarterly data are
seasonally adjusted.
The authorities publish Treasury returns on a monthly basis, and quarterly and annual data on
the general government balance. Iceland reports government finance statistics in accordance
with the GFSM 2001 framework in the GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date contributor to the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Balance of payments data deviate from the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition
(BPM5) in certain respects. In particular, the CBI follows the methodology applied by the
European Central Bank (ECB) for the calculation of income payable by collective investment
institutions (e.g., mutual funds). Unlike the BPM5, the ECB’s methodology includes portfolio
investors’ shares of retained earnings in the balance of payments statement. Some other
departures are: a) income on external debt is compiled on a due-for-payment basis, including
between affiliated enterprises; b) debt between affiliated banks is not identified; c) banking
sector loans are not classified separately from currency and deposits; d) in the international
investment position, foreign direct investments are valued at book value; e) external debt is
valued at face value; f) financial derivatives held by banks are not available as on-balance
sheet items; and, g) domestic currency deposits held with banks by nonbank nonresidents are
not recorded as part of external debt.

Monetary and financial statistics
The concepts and definitions broadly conform to the guidelines of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the MFSM, monetary aggregates
include deposits of the foreign sector and the central government; and the currency-linked
and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are classified as domestic instead of foreign
liabilities. Classification and sectorization are mostly in line with the MFSM, except that, in
the accounts of other depository corporations (that is, commercial and savings banks),
financial derivatives are off balance sheet and positions of nonfinancial public corporations
are included in the government accounts but cannot be identified; and, in the accounts of the
CBI, fixed assets are off balance sheet and IMF accounts are included under other items net
instead of as foreign liabilities. Several banks do not report at market value loans net of
provisions and securities for investment. The CBI has yet to commence reporting monetary
data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ICELAND
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Iceland
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Poul Thomsen and Tessa van der Willigen
September 8, 2008
1.
This supplement provides an update on economic and policy developments in recent
weeks. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The risk premiums of the three largest Icelandic banks have eased following the
banks’ interim Q2-2008 results.
•

Buoyed by considerable gains on foreign exchange positions and inflation-linked
assets, bank profits in the second quarter of 2008 were broadly in line with
expectations. In all three banks, loan impairments on loans increased, albeit from very
low levels, pointing to a deterioration in asset quality.

•

The four largest banks passed the Financial Supervisory Agency’s (FME) regular
stress tests. 1 The FME indicated that the main banks can withstand considerable
financial shocks, but need to focus on maintaining strong capital and even increase it
to reflect rapidly changing financial conditions.

•

Subsequently, the CDS spreads of the three main commercial banks eased by
over 200 basis points (bps) in early August 2008 (Figure 1). However, they remain
notably above those of similarly rated banks. The sovereign spread has declined to
around 250 bps after reaching over 300 bps in July.

3.
Domestic price inflation continued to rise, mostly due to the past króna
depreciation.
•

1

CPI inflation edged up 0.9 percent in August 2008 to reach 14.5 percent in 12 months.
Core inflation maintained an upward trend, increasing to 12.9 percent over a year ago,

Please see the Chapter II of the FSSA for a detailed explanation of the FME’s stress tests.

2
compared to 11.7 percent in July. The impact of the recent króna depreciation
continued to filter through to domestic prices, in line with staff’s estimates.
•

Wages rose 0.7 percent in July 2008, bringing the annual increase to 9.1 percent,
largely due to the impact of previously-settled collective agreements in the public
sector. Real wages continued to contract, denting households’ purchasing power.

•

The króna stabilized in August 2008 after reaching record lows in late June.

4.
Recent economic indicators continued to point to a sharp deterioration in
domestic activity. Consumer confidence edged up in August, but remained at a depressed
level. Credit and debit card turnover continued to slide in July and new car registrations fell
to a 5-year low. These readings point to a contraction in private consumption, as reflected in
staff’s baseline forecast.
5.
The external position deteriorated further in the second quarter, while
international reserves rose.
•

The preliminary current account deficit in Q2-2008 was more than twice as large
compared to the same period a year ago and to Q1-2008, mainly due to a higher
income account deficit. The IIP position also deteriorated. These developments are
broadly in line with staff’s baseline forecast.

•

After a significant deterioration of 28 percent in Q1-2008 (mostly due to krona
depreciation), the net external debt position stabilized in Q2-2008 at Kr. 4.1 billion
(about 287 percent of projected GDP in 2008). This development presents an upside
risk to the staff’s projection of 244 percent of GDP by year-end, which assumes an
improvement in the debt position reflecting banks’ plans to consolidate their balance
sheets.

•

The country’s foreign currency reserves increased by USD 850 million last month and
stood at around USD 3.7 billion as of end-August.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Iceland
On September 10, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Iceland. 1
Background
The economy experienced an extraordinary foreign-funded boom in recent years, with output
rising by over 25 percent during 2003–2007. This rapid expansion, however, left a legacy of
large macroeconomic imbalances, overstretched private sector balance sheets, and high
dependence on foreign financing. The financial sector assets expanded to over
1,000 percent of GDP, while gross external indebtedness reached 550 percent of GDP at end2007, largely on account of the banking sector.
The global turbulence has taken a significant toll on domestic financial markets since end2007. The CDS spreads of the three largest domestic banks have risen sharply, approaching
1000 basis points and the freely-floating Icelandic króna has depreciated by over 40 percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Despite minimum public sector debt, the sovereign is facing a significantly increased risk
premium.
In response to the turmoil, the authorities have taken steps to shore up confidence. The
Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) tightened the policy rate, enhanced liquidity provision to reduce
pressures in foreign exchange and domestic markets, and improved its foreign exchange
liquidity access by entering into currency swap agreements with other Nordic central banks.
The government indicated its willingness to boost CBI’s international reserves and pledged to
pursue fiscal prudence and to reform the fiscal framework and the Housing Financing Fund
(HFF).
At the same time, banks have sought to strengthen their balance sheets and enhance liquidity
buffers. The three largest banks have slowed lending growth, consolidated funding needs,
withdrawn from marginal markets, mobilized retail deposits abroad, and reduced costs,
although their ability to de-leverage has been limited by global risk aversion.
With foreign financing constraints binding, the economy is cooling. Output growth slowed in the
first half of 2008, pulled by a significant retrenchment in domestic expenditure. Consumer
confidence plunged in the first half of 2008, retail sale turnover decelerated sharply, and
domestic investment, especially in the construction sector, came to a halt.
The sharp depreciation of the Icelandic króna contributed to a jump in domestic prices. Annual
inflation shot up from 5.9 percent at end-2007 to 14.5 percent in August 2008. With inflationary
pressures mounting, the CBI raised its target interest rate by 1¾ percent in March-May 2008
and kept it unchanged at 15.5 percent since then. Inflation is expected to remain persistently
above target in the near term, with significant risks on the upside.
The fiscal position is set to deteriorate and spending pressures to rise. The 2008 budget
implies a loosening of the fiscal stance, and the government’s commitment to cutting taxes
further and boosting spending in early 2008 will contribute to an expansionary policy in 2009
and beyond. Given these policies, staff forecast the fiscal deficit to reach 5 percent of GDP
in 2010.
Against this background, economic activity is projected to come to a standstill in 2008 and
contract in 2009–10. Tighter lending conditions, significantly lower real estate prices, weaker
private balance sheets, and declining purchasing power point to a sharp retrenchment in
private consumption. Investment is also expected to decline in 2009–10 while net exports
should remain supportive, on the back of strong aluminum exports and a contraction in
imports. The risks to the outlook are on the downside, dominated by external considerations.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that the Icelandic economy is at a difficult turning point.
The long economic expansion, initiated by aluminum sector investments, sustained by a boom
in private consumption, and fueled by ready access to external financing, contributed to a
build-up of macroeconomic imbalances and financial vulnerabilities. With external liquidity
constraints binding, economic growth is expected to decline rapidly from unsustainably high
levels and inflation to remain well above the central bank’s target, although the current account
deficit is likely to narrow. Directors considered that there are large uncertainties surrounding
the near-term outlook, with significant downside risks. At the same time, they noted that the
long-term prospects for the economy remain promising—even enviable—given Iceland’s
sound governance and stable institutions, open and flexible markets, large and well-managed
renewable natural resource base, and the authorities’ long track record of resilience and
adaptability to changing circumstances.
Directors observed that the authorities face the challenge of facilitating an orderly
rebalancing process, while mitigating risks. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to bolster
confidence, including by entering into currency swap arrangements with other Nordic central
banks, and by committing to maintain tight macroeconomic policies and boost international
reserves. Effective coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policies, and actions to
reduce financial sector vulnerabilities, will be key to achieving orderly adjustment.
Directors recommended that monetary policy maintain its tight stance in order to return
inflation to target and bolster confidence in the króna. They noted the staff’s assessment that
the real exchange rate of the króna is somewhat below its equilibrium level. A further króna
depreciation could fuel inflationary pressures, erode households’ purchasing power, and,
against the background of the high level of private sector external debt and the current global
financial market turbulence, squeeze private sector balance sheets and exert pressure on the
capital account. Directors therefore saw little or no scope for monetary easing until inflation is
placed firmly on a downward path. They also called on the authorities to manage carefully the
provision of domestic liquidity.
Directors encouraged the authorities to act promptly on their pledge to reform the
publicly-owned Housing Finance Fund (HFF), which will be important to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy. They recommended redefining the HFF’s role in the financial
market by separating the social component, which provides targeted support, from the marketbased component, which should not benefit from state aid.
Most Directors considered that a less expansionary fiscal policy would help support the
central bank’s efforts to combat inflation and maintain confidence, and called on the authorities
to resist mounting pressures to boost spending further. A few Directors, however, laying

4
greater emphasis on the threat of recession, saw scope for an active countercyclical fiscal
policy to smooth the downturn. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthen
the fiscal framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to pursue vigorously policy actions to mitigate
banking sector risks. Measures to enlarge capital cushions and boost liquidity buffers could
help restrain the growth of banks’ balance sheets. Directors recommended strengthening
overall transparency, including through better enforcement of disclosure requirements for all
corporations.
Directors welcomed the progress made in strengthening the crisis prevention and
resolution framework. They recommended that all existing elements of contingency planning
be integrated into a single framework, that the bank resolution framework be enhanced, and
that the authorities’ commitment to boost the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves be
made effective when conditions permit.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Jens Olof Henriksson, Executive Director for Iceland and
Bjorn Olafsson, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 10, 2008
The Icelandic authorities greatly appreciate the discussions with the Article IV and FSAP
missions that visited Reykjavík this summer. My authorities also greatly value the Fund’s
advice and dedication and endorse the thrust of the main conclusions in both reports.
Historically, the growth of the Icelandic economy has been based on Iceland’s renewable
marine and energy resources while the service sector has contributed increasingly in
recent years. As a result of its small size and openness, the economy has been prone to
volatility. Economic policy has a history of responding to such changes. Iceland is noted
for its resilience and adaptability. While the short term may present challenges, the
medium-term outlook remains favorable, even enviable as has been noted by staff.
Growth and Trade
After a five year period of robust economic growth, the Icelandic economy has entered a
period of adjustment. It became increasingly imbalanced as reflected in rising inflation
and a large current account deficit, sustained by easy access to global credit. Forecasts
imply that GDP growth in 2008 will be below trend and may even turn negative in 2009
and 2010 while internal and external balance is restored.
The economic upswing was fuelled by rapid growth in the financial sector and large scale
investment in aluminum smelters and associated power plants. Annual aluminum
production capacity has tripled to 800 thousand tons since 2003 and power generation
capacity (hydro and geothermal) increased by 80%. The share of aluminum in total
merchandise exports will increase from 20% in 2005 to 40% in 2009.
The trade deficit is set to disappear quickly as large-scale investment projects come on
stream and imports contract as a result of the depreciation of the króna.
The authorities believe that the IIP may overstate Iceland’s true level of external
imbalances, as it seems likely that residents’ foreign assets have been underestimated by
current statistical methodologies. The findings of a recent study suggest that it is likely
that the value of both FDI assets and liabilities is significantly underestimated in the
official statistics. This discrepancy is due to different accounting treatments of portfolio
equity investment vs. foreign direct investment, the former being valued at market
prices but the latter at book value. Due to the scale in outward FDI investment over the
past years, which has significantly outpaced the growing inward FDI, the proportion of
FDI to total foreign assets is much higher than on the liability side.
The compilation of timely balance of payments figures has become much more
complicated because of the scale of internationalization of Icelandic business, as reflected
in most recent BoP figures. However, the figures that were published last Thursday show
that the trade and service figures are moving towards balance.

2
Fiscal Policy
For the last four years the public sector has delivered a considerable surplus, which
coincided with the growth in the economy. The Treasury surplus from 2005 to 2007
averaged 5½ percent of GDP. The Ministry of Finance projects the surplus to be lower
this year, as the economy slows down. More recent revenue and expenditure estimates
indicate that the surplus will be larger than projected in the budget for 2008. While the
fiscal surpluses have remained large, the stance of fiscal policy has recently turned more
accommodative, as measured by the change to smaller surpluses. In 2008, this is linked to
the automatic stabilization properties of fiscal policy as domestic demand contracts. The
authorities believe that the executive summary description of a “highly expansionary
fiscal policy” is therefore misleading. More so as it is based on further adjustment of the
structural primary budget balance for the effects of the asset price boom. The increase in
revenues due to asset price increases is in accordance with how the fiscal policy is
structured and reflects the automatic stabilization of fiscal policy. Cancelling those
revenues out, by adjusting for them, to determine the fiscal stance is a method that we do
not agree with.
According to the macroeconomic forecast of the Ministry of Finance the public sector is
expected to move into deficit in 2009 and 2010, amounting to about 1 percent of GDP
each year. The deterioration can be traced primarily to the effects of the economic
contraction on Treasury tax revenues, which are projected to decline considerably in real
terms between 2008 and 2010. Revenues from taxes on personal financial income,
corporate profits and consumption tax are also expected to contract, i.e. reflecting the
adverse impact of the ongoing difficulties in international and domestic financial markets
on economic activity. Fiscal policy is thus expected to remain counter-cyclical.
Even though the outlook for public finances is deteriorating it should be noted that record
surpluses in recent years have been used to repay government debt and accumulate
deposits with the Central Bank. Net Treasury debt has been reduced to zero and is set to
move towards a net asset position of 4 percent of GDP at the end of 2008.
The key emphasis in budget management in Iceland is transparency, fiscal rules and
discipline. There are two fiscal reforms in the pipeline, one relates to multi-year
budgeting with the Treasury and the other is targeted at the local authorities requiring
them to adopt expenditure rules to strengthen their medium-term fiscal framework.
Monetary Policy
Attaining the inflation target proved challenging in recent years, and inflation has
remained above target since the second half of 2004. As a result of a sharp depreciation
of the króna in early 2008, triggered by the global financial crisis, inflation has now
reached an eighteen year high. To contain inflation expectations and bring inflation back
to target over the medium term, the Central Bank of Iceland has maintained a tight
monetary policy stance. Inflation is projected to fall during the winter months as the passthrough effects of the króna depreciation disappear and domestic demand contracts.

3
In August inflation measured 14.5 percent in terms of the 12-month rise in the CPI. To
some extent the inflation stems from exogenous factors but the main contributing factors
to the inflation performance are related to the depreciation of the króna and secondary
effects from increasing food and energy prices. The monetary authorities fully realize the
challenges brought on by the current situation. The policy rate is currently 15.5 percent
and inflationary developments warrant a continued tight monetary policy. Economic
indicators show that the economy appears to be cooling faster than previously
anticipated. Declining demand could reduce inflationary pressures in the months to come.
At this juncture, there is a considerable uncertainty about the outlook in general but the
Central Bank’s priorities are clear. The inflation target takes precedence, not only
because it is mandated by law, but also because the long-term cost of not anchoring
inflation expectations is sizeable.
In order to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy and to remove distortions, the
Government will promptly formulate and make public a credible plan for the
restructuring and reform of the Housing Finance Fund system.
The Financial System
The Icelandic banking system has grown at an exceptional pace for the past several years.
The bank’s consolidated assets increased from 100 percent of GDP in 2004 to 900
percent in 2007. The contribution of the banking system to GDP has almost doubled in a
decade. International acquisitions and internal growth have expanded the banks’
combined balance sheets, and the commercial banks now have subsidiaries and branch
offices in the UK, the US, Scandinavia and continental Europe.
The current environment in the global markets has proven challenging for many financial
institutions and the Icelandic banks are no exception. Nevertheless, the three major banks
showed profits in 2007, which has been sustained for the first half of 2008. As recognized
by staff, liquidity ratios are high and capital levels are well above minimum levels. Also,
the banks pass liquidity tests as required by the Central Bank and their capital ratios
remain above required minimums in considerably stringent stress tests conducted by the
Financial Supervisory Authority (FME).
My authorities concur with the assessment in the FSAP report that the main vulnerability
in the Icelandic financial system relates to access to global international liquidity which
has contracted significantly in the past year. As underlined by staff the banks have
implemented various measures to manage their risks and increase market confidence.
This inter alia includes diversification of funding resources, extension of maturities,
enlargement of the deposit base, a contraction of loan books and the selling of noncore
assets. Due to these measures, the banks estimated that they have at hand sufficient
liquidity to meet their debt obligations through early 2009. The authorities cooperate
closely on contingency planning and information sharing according to the Memorandum
of Understanding on financial stability and crisis management by the Central Bank,
Financial Supervisory Authority and the relevant Ministries.

The Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) monitors the banking system closely and has
recently focused on credit risk in particular. The FME’s scope of monitoring the Icelandic
banks’ operations extends to their overseas activities. While stress-testing methodologies
have been significantly enhanced, my authorities agree with staff that improvements can
still be made and they are working on further refinements.
The authorities continue to monitor carefully all new developments in the Icelandic
financial system. Various measures have been undertaken by the authorities which inter
alia include currency swap agreements between the Central Bank of Iceland and central
banks of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, increased issuance of short-term instruments
(CDs and T-notes), amended rules on eligible collateral and reserve requirements for
banks at the CBI, aligning them with those of other central banks, and funding in the
international market to buttress the foreign reserves of the Central Bank. In addition, the
Financial Supervisory Authority has increased its cooperation with host authorities of the
three major banks. Iceland will become a signatory to the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) on co-operation between the Financial Supervisory Authorities,
Central Banks and Financial Ministries of the European Union.
Other Issues
Iceland’s pension system is virtually fully funded and the age distribution is favorable,
making demographic trends easily manageable. At the end of last year the total assets of
the pension system amounted to 133 percent of GDP. This situation creates added leeway
for fiscal policy to be counter-cyclical and flexible in the face of rapid economic changes,
more than offsetting tax cuts and measures to strengthen the welfare system.
The authorities have declared a target to increase ODA from 0.3 percent in 2008 to 0.35
percent of GDP by 2009. Iceland has the potential to make a purposeful contribution in
certain fields, especially in the development of fishing industry and utilization of
geothermal energy in the low-income countries.
