STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 30, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Paraguay has strong economic fundamentals—low debt, sizeable official
reserves, and small fiscal and external imbalances. The main challenge ahead is to
improve social and economic development, while strengthening the macroeconomic
policy framework to cement strong fundamentals. To address these challenges, the
government that assumed office in August 2013 with a strong mandate, has proposed
important reforms and made a solid start by enacting key pieces of legislation—new
taxes, and private-public partnerships (PPPs) and fiscal responsibility laws.
Prospects: Paraguay’s outlook for 2014–18 is favorable with broadly balanced risks,
despite less buoyant external conditions. The economy would continue to be one of the
most dynamic in the region, with growth returning to potential of about 4.5 percent a
year by 2016, inflation in line with the central bank’s target rate and small fiscal and
current account deficits. Consistent with this outlook, a tightening in the policy stance
should take place in the near term, with policies guided by the fiscal responsibility and
incipient inflation targeting frameworks over the medium term.
Cementing sound economic fundamentals: The fiscal responsibility law provides a
sound anchor to underpin fiscal sustainability but stronger budget institutions are
needed to improve the quality of spending along with strengthened tax and customs
administration and capacity to deal with potential risks from PPPs. Civil service and
pension reforms are also needed to further strengthen the fiscal framework. The central
bank has made important advances in implementing an inflation-targeting (IT) regime
along with greater exchange rate flexibility. The focus should remain on steps to achieve
a full-fledged IT regime and on strengthening risk-based bank supervision in line with
international best practices.
Inclusive growth: Success in reducing poverty will depend on ensuring the long-term
sustainability of initiatives underway and on increasing labor market flexibility to reduce
informality as well as improved public enterprises management to bolster access to basic
public services at reasonable cost.

Paraguay’s social and economic development has lagged behind the region. In the late
1980s, per capita GDP peaked at 75 percent of the region’s average in part due the construction of
the two hydroelectrical dams,

about higher productivity and
economic growth. However, limited implementation capacity and fiscal resources—reflecting a small
tax base, low tax rates, and weak tax and customs administration—have continued to constrain
investment and the fight against poverty and (rising) income inequality. On the positive side, the
past two decades have seen the expansion of agricultural and livestock output and processed food
industries—Paraguay has become the 4th and the 8th largest exporter of soya bean and meat in the
world, respectively. More recently, export processing zones have attracted a rising number of
companies, mainly to serve the Brazilian market.
2.
The government’s reform strategy would buttress growth and reduce poverty. This
strategy rightfully focuses on fostering investment in infrastructure and human capital, improving
the business climate, and modernizing the public sector, including by curbing corruption and tax
evasion while improving transparency and accountability of public resources. The private sector and
foreign companies are expected to play a key role in closing the large infrastructure gap in the
country. In support, the authorities will maintain fiscal discipline and stable low inflation while
further strengthening bank supervision in line with international best practices.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Strong Recovery along with Low Inflation in 2013
3.

In 2013, the economy recovered sharply from the previous year’s severe drought. After

contracting by 1.2 percent in 2012, real GDP grew by 14.5 percent (y/y) in the first three quarters of
2013, as a result of a strong rebound in the
primary sector (about 30 percent of GDP),
mainly owing to higher soy output. While

weather-related shocks—with the nonagricultural sector growing around potential.
4.
Macroeconomic policies broadly supported the recovery amid low inflation. The fiscal
stimulus implemented in 2012 to counterbalance the effect of the exogenous shock in agriculture
reverted to neutral in 2013 (see table on medium-term fiscal outlook). This reflected lower execution
of public investment in part due to the political cycle and stricter spending controls. Last year, tax
revenue increased by only 6 percent in nominal terms despite continued strong non-agricultural
output growth, and the central government fiscal balance posted a deficit of about 2 percent of
GDP. The deficit was financed by local bonds, though at times during the year, the government had
to request short-term financing from the central bank due to limited cash availability. Public debt
remained the lowest in the region at about 14 percent of GDP.2 Monetary policy was on hold until
December 2013, when, in view of rising inflationary pressures, the central bank raised the policy rate
by 50 basis points to 6 percent—the first increase since August 2012—followed by another hike in
January 2014, bringing the policy rate to 6.5 percent and monetary policy closer to neutral settings.3

1

The large differential between the official and parallel exchange rates of the Argentinean peso combined with
subsidies on food items in the neighboring country has led to a sharp increase in smuggling, in turn, affecting formal
imports, tax collection and local food sales.
2

The low public debt reflects eight consecutive years (2003–11) of fiscal surpluses averaging 1 percent of GDP a year.

3

As a result of this hike, the ex post real policy interest rate reached about 2.5 percent, within the staff’s estimate of a
neutral real interest rate of between 3 percent and 2.2 percent (the latter estimate based on: “To Cut or Not to Cut?

Paraguay’s inflation picked up pace during 2013 on higher food prices, but end-year inflation
finished lower than expected at 3.7 percent—also below the central bank’s target rate of 5 percent
for the third consecutive year—in part due to a decline in beef prices and a significant increase in
price competition from smuggling food and other products from Argentina favored by the weaker
peso and porous border.

5.
The current account balance switched to a surplus in 2013 owing to buoyant
agricultural and meat export volumes. The current account balance reached a surplus of almost
1 percent of GDP despite rising imports and a deterioration in Paraguay’s terms of trade. As a result
and despite lower net capital inflows, net international reserves (NIR) increased by almost US$900
million to US$5.9 billion by end-2013, exceeding a range of reserve coverage indicators. However,
over half of this increase was accounted for by a US$500 million international bond—the country’s
first international sovereign bond—issued in January 2013 to finance infrastructure and energy
projects, along with delays in the implementation of projects to be financed by the bond. External
debt has remained low at about 20 percent of GDP.
6.
The banking sector continued to show adequate profitability, liquidity and
capitalization in 2013. The total assets of the banking system have grown significantly since
2007–08 fueled by rapid credit growth, that has slowed down to about 17 percent a year in nominal
terms since end-2012. Loans have remained concentrated on the agriculture and livestock sectors,
which transact mainly in U.S. dollars, but loans for consumption have also grown considerably, albeit
from a small base, now accounting for about 15 percent of total banks’ loan portfolio. Despite the
rapid increase in credit, the loans to deposits ratio has stayed below one and NPL ratios declined to
2.2 percent of total loans in November (Annex I). However, concentration ratios have continued to

increase with the four top banks accounting for 61 percent of total assets by end-2012 from 52
percent in the mid-2000s and lending rates and spreads have remained high.4
7.
Congress has supported the government’s reform strategy by approving key laws. To
broaden the tax base, on top of the new personal income tax, Congress approved in October 2013 a
revamped tax on agricultural income and a generalized VAT to include unprocessed agricultural
products. It also recently approved a Fiscal Responsibility law (FRL) which will be applied to the 2015
budget, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and joint-venture laws to foster private sector
investment in infrastructure as well as the State Financial Administration Modernization law to
improve the government’s cash management. Laws are being drafted to update financial sector
legislation and perk up the business climate (Table 1).
8.
The authorities have broadly agreed with policy recommendations in previous Article
IV consultations. In August 2012, the personal income tax became effective, though the minimum
taxable income will be gradually decreased every year through 2019 to expand the taxable base, and
in 2013, the fiscal stimulus was withdrawn. The government that took office in August is
implementing macroeconomic policies and long-term reforms broadly in line with Fund
recommendations. Paraguay has also heavily used Fund technical assistance (TA) across all areas.
Moreover, the authorities have embraced transparency in the discussions by publishing the
concluding statement immediately at the end of WHD missions, including staff’s views and policy
recommendations, which usually receive broad press coverage.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The staff and authorities broadly agreed with the economic outlook and risks. Reforms
underway together with sustained macroeconomic stability will most likely lead to higher private
investment. That said, it is too early to determine precise amounts, as existing institutional and
structural weaknesses—difficult to overcome in the short run—constitute the main constrains to
faster growth in the near term. The authorities expect that the PPPs and other initiatives will attract a
large participation of the private sector and foreign companies in the government’s ambitious
infrastructure investment plan.5 They also consider that Paraguay’s cost advantage over Brazil (lower
electricity rates, wages and payroll and other taxes) and access to the European market through the
General System of Preferences plus Scheme (GSP+) will continue to draw export-oriented industrial
investment projects into the country.
10.
Growth is expected to be in line with medium term potential output, accompanied by
low inflation. Real GDP would grow by 4.8 percent in 2014, supported by continuing dynamism in

See Chapter 1 in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

5

The government estimates that Paraguay needs some US$1.2 billion (about 4.0 percent of GDP) in investment per
year over the next decade to modernize infrastructure, including transportation and water and energy sectors. The
Ministry of Public Works plans to tender in infrastructure projects US$500 million in 2014, and US$1billion in 2015,
up significantly from an annual execution level of about US$200 million in the past years.

the agricultural and livestock sector, and an increase in overall investment (of 0.5 percent of GDP).
Rising food prices and public services tariffs will most likely push inflation to the central bank’s
target rate of 5 percent toward end-2014.6 As for the medium term, expected higher investment in
export-oriented industries and infrastructure would support real GDP growth of about 4.5 percent a
year in the period 2015–18, while inflation would remain in line with the central bank’s target. In this
scenario, the current positive output gap would gradually close, as potential output growth would
moderate slightly from about 5 percent in 2011–13 to 4.7 percent by 2018 (Annex II). The authorities
viewed these growth projections as reasonable for a baseline scenario amid a less benign external
environment characterized by lower external demand, higher global interest rates, and a
deterioration in the terms of trade.

11.
The external current account will likely post small deficits. In 2014, the current account
balance will likely swing to a deficit of about 0.9 percent of GDP, owing to a softening in
international soybean prices even as volumes of other exports (e.g. soy derivatives) are likely to
expand further. Over the medium term, along with some moderate deterioration in Paraguay’s terms
of trade, expected stable private sector net savings would contribute to maintaining the current
account deficit low at about 1.0 percent of GDP. In this baseline scenario, foreign direct investment

(FDI) would rise to 2.9 percent of GDP by 2018, compared with close to 2.0 percent in recent years,
attracted by rising investment opportunities. This, in turn, would allow the central bank to keep the
reserve coverage ratio within the recommended levels identified in the IMF’s reserve adequacy
metric.
12.
Paraguay’s external position appears broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals, though some model based estimates suggest a degree of real exchange rate
overvaluation. The staff’s assessment that the guaraní is, on average, about 8 percent above its
equilibrium level reflects largely the results from CGER’s fundamental equilibrium exchange rate
model for Paraguay, complemented by other indicators, such as relative prices and market share
analysis (Annex III). However, after a small depreciation in 2012, the average real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciation of some 7 percent in 2013 mainly reflected the sharp bilateral nominal
appreciation of the guaraní against the currencies of Argentina and Brazil, since it depreciated
against the U.S. dollar and the Euro following the trend of other currencies in the region. The
authorities believe that the loss of competitiveness with respect to Argentina from recent peso
depreciation would be most likely temporary, as rising inflation has usually eroded these gains in the
past in that country. Moreover, Paraguay maintains an important cost advantage vis-à-vis Brazil.
Also, tighter fiscal settings should facilitate some rebalancing in the medium term and lower
pressure on the real exchange rate. As such, the current account deficit, while widening some, is
projected to remain small over the medium term, amid sizeable foreign reserves, and improvements
underway in infrastructure, which should support the country’s external competitiveness going
forward.
13.
The risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. On the downside, lower growth in key
regional partners, specially Brazil (Box 1), hard landing in China and/or disorderly withdrawal of
monetary stimulus in the United States could affect Paraguay through lower external demand and
commodity prices and higher sovereign borrowing costs, while weak PPP management and/or
execution of public investment could also reduce growth prospects in light of the sizeable projected
pick-up in the medium-term baseline projection.7 On the upside, more employment in the formal
sector through improved labor market flexibility, and faster reduction of institutional weaknesses
could increase growth potential. Supply constraints coupled with possible additional increases in
food and administrated prices pose an upside risk to inflation. Weather-related shocks remain a
looming risk in Paraguay. However, low debt, sizeable official reserves, greater exchange rate
flexibility, a sound financial system, and a stronger policy framework provide the government with
better buffers than in the past to cope with these shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions focused on policies and reforms to cement strong economic fundamentals
and promote inclusive growth over the medium term. The authorities broadly agreed with the
policy recommendations and pointed out that the Fund continued support through TA will remain
critical to implement the reform agenda.
15.
A policy mix rebalance should take place in the near term. Fiscal policy is expected to be
tightened in 2014 and 2015 to reflect the transition toward a more rigorous fiscal stance under the
FRL. While the 2014 budget recently approved by Congress envisages a deficit of 2.8 percent of
GDP—higher than the 2.2 percent of GDP submitted by the government—staff estimates a lower
deficit (1.8 percent of GDP) as a result of expected lower capital expenditure execution in line with
past experience (60 percent of the budgeted amount), and a further reduction in the deficit (to
1 percent of GDP) in 2015, as the FRL takes effect. Thus, a fiscal withdrawal of close to 1 percent of
GDP would take place in 2014 and 2015, which will also support some external rebalancing.
Monetary policy settings have recently tightened, moving closer to neutral levels. The central bank
stressed that it will continue to adjust the policy rate as necessary to keep inflation near the target
rate of 5 percent.

A. Stronger Fiscal Framework
16.
Staff welcomed significant improvements in the fiscal framework. The fiscal
responsibility law provides an effective fiscal anchor, limiting current spending and making fiscal
policy more predictable, though the regulation to implement the law could include more explicit
guidelines for compliance, accountability, and escape clauses (Box 2). In addition, new taxes will add
much needed revenues and contribute to making the tax system more progressive. The
implementation of a Treasury Single Account and the issuance of short-term debt beginning in 2014
under the recently approved State Financial Administration Modernization law, will help use limited
public resources more efficiently, with the Treasury moving from the present system of cash
rationing to a modern cash management system. This, in turn, should eliminate the need for shortterm loans from the central bank as was the case in 2013.
17.
Fiscal settings will be guided by the FRL over the medium term. Thus, staff projects the
central government deficit to be, on average, about 1.0 percent of GDP a year in the period 2016–

fiscal policy stance is expected to become broadly neutral in the period 2016–18, as the economy

Staff observed that additional efforts are required to strengthen the fiscal policy
framework. Stronger budget institutions (design, control and monitoring) are needed to enhance
the credibility of fiscal policy and improve the quality of spending. Ongoing efforts to implement
results-based budget monitoring are welcome. Despite some progress over the past decade, tax
collection remains relatively low (estimated at about 51 percent of its potential vis-à-vis a regional
average of 71 percent) as a result of limited human and information system resources.9 The tax
agency is not fully prepared to rapidly absorb an increase in taxpayers by about 15 to 20 percent in
the short-run due to the new taxes, hindering the mobilization of additional revenue. Consequently,
it might be necessary to revise some current low tax rates. In this context, the authorities clarified
they are considering raising the VAT on financial services from its current 5 percent to the
10 percent general rate, on top of the recent increase in rural and urban property taxes. Staff
suggested the authorities be cautious on revenue projections and, in line with Fund TA advice,
strengthen tax and customs administration by giving priority to new information and risk
management systems, improving the quality of taxpayer’s registry and controls via database
crosschecks, and enhancing audit and arrears collections systems and procedures.
19.
Staff recommended that a civil service and pension reform be part of a medium-term
strategy to further strengthening the fiscal framework. A civil service reform must seek to attract
9

and maintain qualified personnel at a competitive salary, while at the same time opening the fiscal
space to increase essential social spending. Staff welcomed work under way in the domestic tax and
customs agencies with Fund TA to overhaul human resource policies, including through the creation
of a professional career system. Although the aggregate pension system still generates a small cash
surplus (equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013), several pension regimes run deficits of about
0.3 percent of GDP that are covered by the central government. A pension reform is required to
reduce potentially large fiscal liabilities but also to improve national savings and foster development
of domestic capital markets. With the assistance of other multilateral agencies, the authorities are
working on drafting new legislation and establishing a pension regulator.
20.
While PPPs offer potential efficiency gains, they can also pose significant fiscal risks.
Although the PPP law seems to provide a sound legal framework to reduce these risks, staff advised
the authorities to first of all focus on strengthening public investment management, planning and
regulatory capacity before engaging in any large PPP project (Box 3). Moreover, staff recommended
including PPP projects in the national public investment system (SNIP) and publishing data on all
contingent liabilities along with the budget documentation to increase transparency and
accountability. Prioritization of PPP infrastructure projects that are likely to have high economic rates
of return, such as roads and energy, will be key to preserving strong growth momentum. The
authorities agreed with these recommendations and pointed out that the regulatory decree under
discussion that will guide the implementation of the PPP law, will clarify many of these issues.
21.
Several initiatives are being put in place to speed up investment. A ministerial group
was formed to ease the decision-making process on priority investments while an inter-ministerial
group would remove bureaucratic obstacles and enhance monitoring, particularly of PPP projects.
The authorities are considering outsourcing management of public investment projects in certain
cases, following closely the experience of other countries with this type of initiative. All PPP projects
will be done through international open bids. They also expect that the diverse legal framework in
place—PPPs, joint ventures, leasing, concessions—will facilitate the private sector’s response to new
investment opportunities in infrastructure. Ongoing efforts to improve the business climate by
strengthening the legal protection of investment and drastically reducing red tape will likely further
encourage private and foreign investment.10

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy at the Forefront to Manage Risks
22.
The central bank has made significant advances in implementing an inflation-targeting
(IT) regime since 2011, and further steps are in train. In line with Fund TA, recent implemented
measures include publishing a bi-annual inflation report and the minutes of the monetary policy
committee as well as refining liquidity management and monetary policy instruments—daily
10

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce already reduced red tape for all transactions linked to activities in the
export processing zones (EPZ) from weeks to just a few days and additional reductions are envisaged in 2014. For
instance, approval time to establish a new company in an EPZ went down from 50 days to 20 days and a further
reduction to 5 days is expected in 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PARAGUAY

liquidity forecasts are now being prepared and actively used as the basis for decisions on liquidity
management operations (Annex V). The central bank has recently introduced an overnight standing
lending and deposit facility, establishing a corridor of ±100 basis points around the policy rate, to
ensure that the overnight interbank rates remain within a predefined corridor and to increase the
flexibility of the commercial banks’ internal liquidity management. The central bank is also moving
reserve requirements (RR) towards an average system (from a fixed amount) within a reserve
maintenance period, which was facilitated by the launching in November of the Real Time Gross
Settlements (RTGS) payments system. This average RR will likely contribute to reducing the need for
banks to maintain excess reserves. In addition, beginning in 2014, the central bank narrowed the
band around the target inflation rate of 5 percent from ±2.5 to ±2.0 percent.
23.
The central bank reaffirmed its commitment to complete the transition towards a fullfledged IT regime in the near term. This regime has been successful in reducing inflation along
with a decline in the exchange rate pass-through (the latter, an important development in a highly
dollarized economy).11 To complete this transition, priority will be given to developing an active
interbank money market by increasing the predictability of central bank operations and available
instruments, further improving communication with market participants and eliminating legal
impediments to secondary markets trading. Reversing the perception of high credit risk among
banks by strengthening bank risk supervision will be also needed to reduce the intermediary role of
the central bank in all interbank transactions. Staff reiterated previous Fund recommendations to
fully recapitalize the central bank with marketable and fungible securities, further strengthening the
recapitalization process initiated in 2012 when the Ministry of Finance offered the central bank
nonmarketable bonds (paying only 0.25 percent a year).
24.
Staff endorsed recent steps taken by the central bank to establish a foreign exchange
(FX) policy that is more transparent, better communicated and more consistent with a fullfledged IT regime. The central bank indicated that since mid-2013, they have followed Fund TA
advice, implementing a more disciplined FX framework by pre-announcing an auction system for the
sale of government dollar proceeds from revenue of the two binational hydroelectrical companies,
including the nature, frequency and size of these sales. This framework has contributed to improving
the predictability about the central bank’s role and participation in the market. FX interventions outside
the pre-announced sales have been limited to offsetting excessive volatility as the exchange rate is
subject to strong seasonal pressures. The authorities confirmed that they adhere to a flexible
exchange rate policy and do not target the level of the exchange rate. Staff indicated that
maintaining exchange rate flexibility will create incentives for the deepening of the incipient
forwards market in Paraguay as the private sector learns to internalize exchange rate risks and this,
in turn, could also contribute to reducing dollarization.

11

According to staff estimates, the exchange rate pass-through declined to 21.5 percent in the period 2000–2013
from 26.7 percent in 2000–2010 (period excluding IT which started in 2011).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

25.
Further entrenching the de-dollarization process would strengthen the effectiveness of
the monetary policy framework. After declining during much of the 2000s, dollarization ratios
started to increase in the past few years—at 40 percent for both loans and deposits, they still remain
one of the highest in the region. While cementing macroeconomic stability should instill confidence
in the guaraní, the use of carefully designed macro-prudential tools could also create incentives to
internalize the risks of dollarization, tilt against foreign currency loans and deposits, and enhance
the transmission mechanism. Key steps could include increasing provisioning requirements for
foreign currency loans and the spread in required reserve ratios between foreign and domestic
deposits.12 The authorities agreed that reversing certain macroprudencial measures taken at the
time of the global financial crisis, such as the reduction in banks’ reserve requirements for foreign
currency deposits, could help sustain a gradual de-dollarization process. However, they pointed out
that for the foreseeable future, dollarization would remain a key feature given Paraguay’s openness
and the prominence of the agricultural sector, which trades exclusively in dollars.

C. Stronger Supervisory-Regulatory Framework
26.
The supervisory-regulatory framework of the financial system has undergone major
improvements in recent years in line with FSAP recommendations. Staff welcomed ongoing
efforts to align bank and central bank legislation with international best practices in risk-based
supervision and prudential norms, as well as steps to migrate to international accounting standards
(i.e. IFRS) for bank and supervisory reporting (Annex VI). The supervisory approach and soundness of
cooperatives (which account for 20 percent of financial system assets) will be strengthened over a
period of two years beginning in 2014, as a result of new legal requirements (e.g., increased capital
adequacy, provisioning and liquidity requirements and better information reporting). This, in turn,
would facilitate introduction of a liquidity assistance facility and a deposit insurance scheme for
cooperatives in line with FSAP recommendations. Recommended changes to strengthening
cooperatives governance are still pending.
27.
Although credit growth has stabilized since end-2012, closer monitoring is warranted
if it accelerates further. The authorities indicated that although banks usually request solid
collateral from their clients (real estate, land, agricultural output which are usually valued below
market prices to reduce risk) or direct salary deductions in the case of consumer loans, a significant
improvement in credit information would take place in the near term by providing up-to-date data
on corporate and household balance sheets to credit registry agencies. Staff indicated that
additional efforts are also needed to strengthen the bank supervisor’s loan classification system by
requiring institutions to properly identify transactions’ terms and credit quality, and to increase
competition in the banking sector to reduce large interest rate spreads.

12

Staff estimates show that by reducing dollarization ratios in loans by 10 percentage points from currently
40 percent, the long-run pass-through from the policy rate to retail interest rates could increase by 14 percentage
points (the current pass-through is 36 percent, well below the regional average of 50 percent). See Chapter 2 in the
accompanying Selected Issues Papers.

28.
Paraguay’s anti-money laundering plan (AML/CFT) launched in June 2013 is being
activated. The authorities’ recent agreement with the Central Bank of Brazil on measures to control
cross-border cash flows is an important step. However, additional efforts are needed to address
legal and operational shortcomings that remain in controlling the cross border physical
transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments while corruption continues to be a serious
obstacle for effective actions.

D. Promoting Inclusive Growth
29.
Staff commended the government’s focus on reducing poverty. Poverty and inequality
in Paraguay are among the highest the region. Staff endorsed the government’s holistic approach to
tackle key dimensions of poverty supported by sustained strong economic growth (Box 4). These
dimensions include: vulnerability through social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfer
programs; social exclusion through increased access to basic services, such as schooling, health care,
electricity and safe water and sewerage; and economic exclusion through opportunities to increase
earnings via programs to improve rural infrastructure and enhance small-scale farmers’ earnings,
including through a reforestation program. Assuring the long-term sustainability of all these
initiatives will be crucial to succeed in the fight against poverty.
30.
Labor market inefficiencies must be addressed to support the development strategy.
The large informal sector in Paraguay has hindered productivity and overall economic growth. To
some extent, this informality has flourished given labor market institutions that are weak by
international standards, with structural rigidities linked to hiring and firing practices and redundancy
costs. Efforts to increase female labor force participation—a large part of the informal sector–– and
to improve the quality of training would also help raise productivity and lower poverty.
31.
A public enterprises (PEs) reform is needed to improve both efficiency and access to
basic public services. PEs play an important role in key sectors, and increasing their efficiency can
help ease their capacity constraints that limit investment.13 Public enterprises combined operating
surplus declined from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2013, with their
investment level representing below 10 percent of total expenses. Staff welcomed important steps
taken to strengthen PE monitoring and performance as well as increased transparency in PEs
accounts and audits. While staff agreed with the authorities that it would be ideal to achieve
improvements in cost efficiency before increasing tariff rates to support investment plans, water and
electricity rates will likely need to be raised in the near future, after been fixed for about 11 years.
Staff also advised eliminating the general diesel fuel subsidy, which benefits the agriculture sector
the most. However, any increase in tariffs must be accompanied by targeted safety net measures to
ensure that the most vulnerable are protected. In addition, it would be crucial to establish a long-

term development plan to make sure that PEs can accommodate the robust growth outlook,
particularly in the energy sector, to avoid bottlenecks.14

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Staff commends the government’s ambitious agenda of growth-enhancing reforms
and poverty reduction. Paraguay’s per capita income remains significantly below the region
average and income distribution has deteriorated. The reform strategy targets key areas, in
particular closing the large infrastructure gap, to sustain robust economic and productivity growth in
support of Paraguay’s aims to transition to a dynamic emerging market economy over the next
decade. The country’s medium-term look is positive with balanced risks. Critical legislation has been
already enacted, which signals Paraguay’s commitment to address institutional and structural
weaknesses. However, the regulation to implement these laws will need to be executed carefully.
33.
A steady implementation of the FRL will be critical to buttress fiscal discipline and
supportive of near term macro management needs. Implementation of the FRL will support a
desirable near term policy mix of tighter fiscal settings and monetary policy settings close to neutral.
Congress and the executive should take advantage of the new fiscal framework to work closer to
ensure that the budget becomes a true macroeconomic planning instrument. As experience is
gained with the implementation of the new framework, some features of the law might need to be
revised to provide more flexibility across economic cycles and to make escape clause more effective
and clear.
34.
Additional efforts are needed to cement a stronger fiscal policy framework.
Strengthening budget design, control and monitoring, with a stronger emphasis on results, and a
medium-term expenditure framework should be priorities as much as mobilizing additional
resources. Moreover, strengthening public investment management, planning and the regulatory
capacity will reduce potential fiscal risks associated with PPP projects and ensure that these and all
public projects provide high-quality infrastructure services efficiently. A civil service and pension
reform must be also part of a medium-term strategy to further strengthen the fiscal framework and,
in turn, to open fiscal space to increase essential social spending and reduce potentially large fiscal
liabilities. To bring Paraguay’s tax collections to par with other countries in the region, high level of
informality, tax evasion and exemptions will need to be drastically reduced. To this end, Fund TA
recommendations provide an appropriate reform guide.
35.
The central bank’s track record in keeping inflation on target amid greater exchange
rate flexibility is fortifying the credibility of the IT framework. To complete the transition to a
full-fledged IT regime and further enhance the monetary policy transmission mechanism, priority
should be given to developing an active money market while strengthening bank supervision in

order to reduce the perception of high credit risk among banks. Macroprudential measures, such as
reversing the decline in banks’ reserve requirements for foreign currency deposits, could help
sustain the de-dollarization process over time. Although credit growth has recently slowed down,
closer monitoring is warranted if it accelerates further, in part through improved credit information
of companies and households. Given uncertainties as the regime transitions, it will be important for
the central bank to remain vigilant to respond to incipient price pressures.
36.
Maintaining exchange rate flexibility remains instrumental in cushioning the economy
against potential shocks and supporting the IT regime. While limited foreign exchange
intervention could be necessary to reduce volatility and to contain excessive risks to the balance
sheets in a highly dollarized economy, the exchange rate ought to continue to be driven by
fundamentals. Moreover, maintaining exchange rate flexibility will create incentives for the
deepening of the incipient forwards market in Paraguay as the private sector learns to internalize
exchange rate risks.
37.
To succeed in the fight against poverty, it will be crucial to assure the long-term
sustainability of all initiatives underway to address social and economic exclusion. In addition,
labor market inefficiencies together with efforts to increase female labor force participation, will
need to be addressed to reduce informality and lower poverty. Improved public enterprises
management and long-term investment plans will facilitate access to basic public services at
reasonable cost—though increases in certain rates might be unavoidable in the near term despite
ongoing efforts to reduce operating cost.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Impact of External and Domestic Shocks on Paraguay’s Non-Agricultural Sector
Paraguay is a landlocked, small open economy highly dependent on agribusiness (20 percent of GDP), and featuring strong
regional economic and financial ties. Ties are particular strong with Brazil, which absorbs close to one-third of the country’s
exports; also, a Brazilian bank, Itau, is the second largest in Paraguay, and Brazilian branches and subsidiaries account for 20
percent of total bank credit to the non-financial private sector. While external shocks are mainly transmitted to the economy
primarily through the agricultural sector, staff analysis suggests modest spillovers onto non-agricultural sectors (industry,
construction and services).
Commodity prices shock: The industrial sector is the only non-primary
sector directly affected by the impact of a commodity price shock,
given that its production is geared towards processing agricultural
products and livestock. A 10 percentage point change in commodity
prices increases industrial production by about 1.2 percent over a year.

Regional shocks: Services (60 percent of non-agricultural GDP) is the
non-agricultural sector with the largest response to a shock stemming

previous Article IV report, cross-border lending by foreign banks is a
main transmission channel of foreign shocks into the Paraguayan
economy. The report finds that the external financial channel accounts

which can be driven by the historical large exposure of banks to the
agricultural sector (35 percent of loans are directed towards agriculture). The total response of the non-agricultural sector is
roughly 0.5 percent. This small impact is not surprising: as discussed in IMF 2011, the small effects of the agricultural sector in the
rest of the economy stem from the fact the sector relies heavily on imports of intermediate and capital goods, it is a land and
capital intensive sector, and pays little taxes.

percent of GDP.
The FRL aims to restore fiscal discipline, setting stringent conditions. It was enacted in October 2013 with effect
in 2015. The authorities are working on the regulatory aspects of the law and plan to use it as guiding benchmark
during the execution of the 2014 budget. The law sets the following limits/ceilings:
1.

The real growth of current primary spending of the consolidated public sector (excluding municipalities)
should not exceed 4 percent a year; a relatively tight limit since it is below estimates of potential GDP
growth. As a result, current primary expenditure would decline as a ratio of GDP over time, which in turn
would create fiscal space for higher investment while satisfying the fiscal deficit ceiling.

2.

The overall deficit of the central government, including transfers to the rest of the public sector, should not
exceed 1.5 percent of GDP (3 percent in periods of crisis). Further, the FRL sets a medium-term (3 years)
average deficit ceiling of 1 percent of GDP a year—the annual budget is required to include a medium-term
framework. However, given the current deficit (2 percent of GDP in 2013), complying with this rule would
depend on successful revenue mobilization from the recently implemented tax measures and/or more
stringent growth limits on current (or overall) spending.

3.

Public sector wages will increase in line with the increase in the minimum wage (which is adjusted when
accumulated annual inflation reaches 10 percent).

Going forward, the approved framework could be strengthened in some areas. The current coverage of the law
is quite broad as it includes central government’s transfers to the rest of the public sector, except municipalities,
which are autonomous entities under Paraguay’s Constitution. However, since the latter can issue debt, it would be
appropriate to also encourage them to apply similar rules. The regulations to implement the law could include more
explicit guidelines for compliance, accountability and escape clauses. While the expenditure ceiling limits the
potential procylicality of using a headline balance rule, the demand-management role of fiscal policy could be further
strengthened by setting the deficit ceiling in terms of a structural/cyclically-adjusted balance.

Box 3. Paraguay: The Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Law
Paraguay has an ambitious investment plan in infrastructure for the upcoming years. The
recently approved PPPs law is expected to play a key role in encouraging and facilitating private
sector participation in this plan. The government has identified three possible projects to be awarded
through PPPs: the modernization and operation of the Asuncion airport (US$100 million), the
concession of the Asuncion-Ciudad del Este-Encarnacion roads (US$900 million) and the Paraguay
River dredging (US$100 million).
The PPPs law is comprehensive and covers essentially all relevant issues for managing fiscal
risks. It also includes many components of international best practices, such as:


A clear definition of PPPs and a broad institutional scope. The Ministry of Public Works
will be responsible for developing, selecting, awarding and executing transportation projects.
The PPP unit under the Secretaría Técnica de Planificación (STP) will promote, communicate
and coordinate the initiatives in other sectors.



A limit to the government’s exposure to PPP operations. The law states that contingent
and actual liabilities are not to exceed 2 percent of GDP in net present value and not to be
higher than 0.4 percent of GDP in a given year. A Fiduciary Guarantee and Liquidity Fund will
be set to meet contractual obligations derived from PPP projects. The Ministry of Finance will
participate as a gatekeeper throughout project implementation to limit the financial exposure
of the government from PPP operations.

Some aspects of the law could be strengthened and clarified in the upcoming regulatory
decree:


Risk allocation. While allocating risks in each contract allows for some flexibility, it could
make contract renegotiations more difficult given the weak institutional capacity in the
contracting entities at the public sector. Accordingly, regulations of the law should provide
clear guidelines about typical risks (construction, demand and availability). At the same time,
the legal framework should provide guidelines for renegotiating and terminating PPP
contracts.



Fiscal risks. The methodology for accounting and reporting contingent liabilities in the fiscal
accounts and in the budget needs to be better specified in line with international standards.

Box 4. Paraguay: The Government’s Strategy to Reduce Extreme Poverty
Despite a decline over the past decade, poverty in Paraguay still remains among the highest in the
region. Amid the economic and financial crisis, overall poverty in Paraguay worsened significantly in the
second half of the 1990s and early 2000s reaching a peak of 49.7 percent by 2002. Since then, it has
gradually declined, reaching 32.4 percent in 2011, just slightly below the level achieved in the mid-1990s
(36.1 percent). In contrast, practically no improvement in extreme poverty has taken place, still affecting
in 2011, 18 percent of the population (or 220,000 families, of which 67 percent live in rural areas)
compared with 18.8 percent in the mid-1990s. At the same time, income inequality has continued to
deteriorate over the past decade, in contrast with the trend in the region.
The government’s program “Sembrando Oportunidades” aims to halve extreme poverty to about
9 percent by 2015. Under this program, the poverty reduction would be mainly achieved by providing
opportunities to increase income:


Support small-scale farmers with technical, financial and managerial assistance to improve
their access to markets and the development of value chains. This will be done in part by
expanding the Paraguay Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project (PRODERS), with
an additional financing of US$100 million from the World Bank. The idea is to scale up the
existing project to some of regions in the country with the highest incidence of rural poverty. The
government plans to increase the number of beneficiary families from 50,000 in 2013 to 120,000
in 2014. In addition, it plans to expand income opportunities for families through work in
reforestation activities.



Investment in infrastructure. To generate an alternative source of income for families not
involved in agricultural activities, the government plans to hire rural labor to work in building and
maintaining infrastructure, such as roads, schools, health centers, and water and sewage.

Annex I. Paraguay: Banking Credit Developments1
1.

Total assets of the banking system have grown significantly in recent years fueled by rapid
2

credit growth. Following a sharp decline in the mid-1990s and early 2000s during the banking crises,
credit to the private sector has started to recover and grew briskly since 2007. As a result, credit reached
about 36 percent of GDP in 2013—an increase of almost 20 percentage points of GDP in six years,
catching up to the region’s current average and Paraguay’s credit level prior to the banking crises. All
bank credit categories have experienced strong growth rates but especially consumer loans, which now
3

represent 15 percent of total credit (compared to 8 percent in 2007). Bank loans continue to be mainly
concentrated in the large agriculture and livestock sectors, which account for 1/3 of the banking system’s
4

total loan portfolio. Economic stability, a strengthening of labor markets and a marked reduction in
poverty, have been important factors in increasing the demand for credit by businesses and households
since the mid-2000s.

The banking system hold assets equivalent to 77 percent of total system assets, with foreign asset ownership
representing about 45 percent of total bank assets. There are 15 commercial banks, of which three are foreignowned and five are majority foreign-owned. The financial system also consists of 12 finance companies, 372
cooperatives, 32 insurance companies, and 5 pension funds, with the rest of financial services entities being financial
warehouses, exchange houses, and second-tier banks.
3

Consumer loans are mainly linked to direct salary deposits.

4

Despite the large exposure to the primary sector, recent supply shocks to the sector did not spillover to the
financial system. Risks have been limited by farmers’ large buffers and high profits in recent years and by banks’
strong capital and loss related buffers. Due to the high volatility of growth (agriculture accounts for 20 percent of the
GDP), banks are subject to periodic stress tests.

2.

High credit growth, if continued, could pose risks to the stability of the financial system.

International experience shows that periods of rapid credit expansion have often been associated with
increased macro-financial vulnerabilities. Dell’Ariccia et al. (2012) find that about one in three booms
have been followed by a period of
sub-par growth or a banking crisis.

5

These authors classify credit
expansion episodes as credit boom
when the annual growth rate of the
credit-to-GDP ratio exceeds
20 percent. According to this
definition, Paraguay experienced a
credit boom from the last quarter of
2007 up to the first quarter of 2011.

Despite the rapid increase in credit, the loans to deposits ratio has remained significantly

below the 1.5 benchmark ratio for potential banking crises. Banks in Paraguay rely almost entirely on
deposits. On average, deposits constitute

addition, according to the 2011 FSAP update, most banks appear resilient to shocks, although the
exposure to large borrowers is high and some small banks are exposed to significant liquidity risk.
5.

Regulation and supervision of the banking system has undergone major progress in recent

years, in particular, becoming more risk-based. With regards to bank capital, the central bank
approved a capital adequacy adjustment with regard to risk weighted assets and liabilities, in line with
the definition of the Basel Accord (Basel I). More stringent provisioning measures and higher capital
requirements became effective in January 2012, helping strengthen financial institutions’ buffers.
However, central bank’s work on modernizing banking supervision has been constrained by an outdated
legal framework. The current banking and central bank laws are unusually detailed and prescriptive, and
determine quantitative limits, risk weights, and even the amount of fines, with very limited delegated
capacity to the central bank. New central bank and banking laws are being drafted to establish principles
and general requirements, while given the central bank the responsibility for establishing specific
requirements and technical details. Additional efforts are also needed to improve the availability of credit
information on borrowers and to strengthen the bank supervisor’s loan classification system.

However, this reflects changes in the composition of NPLs, with the share of recently overdue loans (which carry a
lower provision) increasing. Regulations on provisioning have actually been tightened by the Central Bank.

Annex II. Assessing Paraguay’s Potential Growth over the
Medium Term1
1.

The assessment of Paraguay’s long-run potential output growth builds on a standard growth
2

accounting exercise. Specifically, the following Cobb-Douglas production function is estimated:

where

is total output,

is a technology parameter or TFP,

and

denote the capital stock and labor

inputs, respectively, and α is the share of capital income in total output (assumed to be 0.3).

2.

In this setting, the capital stock evolves according to the following law of motion:

where It is total investment and δ is the depreciation rate of the capital stock. This methodology requires
the estimation of Paraguay’s capital stock.

3.

To estimate the capital stock an initial condition is required, which is obtained from the following

steady state relation,

where g is the long-run growth rate of the capital stock. The capital stock of the year 1962,
, is set as the initial condition for the model. Specifically, this is obtained from Eq. (3) using
investment figures for the year 1962,

, and setting δ=0.08—a capital depreciation rate of 8 percent

per year—and g is set to 4.2 percent—the average GDP growth rate over the last 60 years, equal to 4.06
3

percent. Over the long run (in the steady state), the growth rate of the capital stock and GDP should
coincide. The capital stock later evolves according to Eq. (2).

4.

Results show that over the medium term, maintaining the growth rates in potential GDP of about

5 percent observed in the last five years will require:


Growth of physical capital is expected to accelerate somewhat, reflecting a pickup in investment
of around 3.6 percentage points of GDP between 2013 and 2018—driven primarily by higher
foreign and private domestic investment.



The young labor force is envisaged to continue growing at around 3 percent, with labor continue
to be the main driver for economic growth.



Our baseline projections also entail a slowdown in TFP growth for Paraguay, consistent with the
normalization in the business cycle. TFP performance is typically procyclical, and—as the output
gap close and growth moderate to medium term potential—TFP would grow at rates closer to its
2008–12 average.



Under less favorable external conditions —softening in terms-of-trade, downside risks for
economic growth in main trading partners, and a normalization of the easy external financing
conditions—economic growth will likely remain slightly below potential growth rate of
4.9 percent, with the positive output gap narrowing over time. However, growth prospects could
improve if structural reforms increase TFP growth, public investment management is
strengthened and domestic and foreign investors respond more rapidly to the PPPs framework.

Annex III. Paraguay: Balance of Payments Stability Assessment1
Paraguay’s external position appears broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals though some
model based estimates point at a degree of real exchange rate overvaluation. Exchange rate strength
reflects in part continued appreciation vis-à-vis the Argentinean peso and the Brazilian real. However, the
country’s external position would remain sound over the foreseeable future, amid sizeable foreign reserves,
and expected improvements in infrastructure.

C. Competitiveness

Although Paraguay’s exchange rate appears to be slightly over its equilibrium level, a
broader assessment yields no competitiveness concerns. However, the results vary
substantially among the different methods.

Under the CGER methodologies, the guaraní appears to be slightly above equilibrium
on average by about 8 percent, mostly due to the results under the equilibrium real exchange

External Volume Competitiveness

Relative prices and market shares indicators
were also used to assess Paraguay’s
competitiveness. Changes in market shares for
the country’s primary products in major export
markets are measured through the evolution of the
substitution ratio of Paraguayan vs. domestic
products sold in export markets. Changes in
relative prices are measured with respect to local
producer prices in export markets. These
indicators are compared with their respective

Business Environment. Paraguay has widespread structural and institutional weaknesses
that affect its capacity to attract private investment and diversify its production base. The
country’s overall ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Index in 2014 went down to 113
from 110 in the previous year. Although it

show that the most problematic areas for
doing business in the country are: an inadequate educated workforce and supply of
infrastructure, corruption and inefficient government bureaucracy. On the institutional front, the
latest International Transparency Indices show that Paraguay is performing worse than the
regional average on perception of institutional corruption (Congress and political parties), and
paying bribes.

D. Capital and Financial Account and International Investment Position
9.

The capital and financial account has been on surplus since 2008. Given that portfolio
inflows in Paraguay are very small, the main components of the capital account are FDI and
private and public sector borrowing. FDI
Net IIP, latest observation
has hovered around 1.4 percent of GDP in

average, even though according to the

annual report of the Economic Commission

for Latin America (ECLAC), the profitability

region and the country offers substantial
incentives to (foreign) investors, particularly -20

production cost in other countries in the region. Among the sectors that are attracting FDI are:
agricultural, metallurgic, and maquila or export processing zones (clothing, shoes and auto
parts).
10.

The net international investment position (IIP) has been improving in the past years.
As of 2012, the net position of the IIP was negative equivalent to 37 percent of GDP, compared
to a negative position of 153 percent of GDP in 2005. It is important to highlight that the main
cause of the negative position is the debt of the two binational electricity companies that was
included as a net liability after a change in the national accounts methodology. The stock of this
debt is estimated at US$9 billion (35% of GDP) for 2013. The debt has been declining mainly
because Itaipu’s debt has been repaid by the Paraguayan government with the procedures of
the energy sold to Brazil and is expected to be expire by 2023.

E. Reserve Adequacy
11.

Paraguay’s reserve position is within
the suggested adequacy rate. Net
international reserves reached US$5.9
billion at the end- December 2013, an
increase of $0.8 billion from end-2012.
Using the composite reserve adequacy
metric (100–150 percent), the actual level
of reserves is above the recommended
range. For the medium term, the projection
indicates that reserves will cover around 4
months of imports.

Exchange Rate Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní. The exchange
rate regime is classified de facto as other managed arrangement (the de jure regime is classified as
floating). The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market but the central
bank intervenes in the foreign exchange and monetary markets to smooth out excessive exchange
rate fluctuations due to strong seasonal pressures. The U.S. dollar is the principal intervention
currency. Paraguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfer for current international transactions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK UNDER JMAP
1.
Meeting of teams. The Fund and Bank Paraguay teams met in November 2013 to exchange
views on economic developments in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work and work plans for the
year ahead. This Annex provides a summary of the discussions.
2.
The teams agreed that Paraguay’s macroeconomic policies must be kept broadly
neutral over the medium term. In 2013, the economy recovered sharply from the previous year’s
severe drought. After contracting 1.2 percent in 2012, the economy rebounded to a 13 percent
growth in 2013, as a result of a strong recovery in the primary sector, mainly attributed to higher soy
output. Against this background, macroeconomic policies supported the recovery amid low inflation.
The fiscal stimulus implemented in 2012 to counterbalance the effect of the exogenous shock in
agriculture, reverted to a neutral position in 2013, and is expected to present a modest withdrawal in
2014-15—transition years to a more rigorous fiscal stance under the new Fiscal Responsibility law—
and to remain broadly neutral through the end of projected period (2018). Real GDP would grow by
4.8 percent, supported by continuing dynamism in the agricultural and livestock sector and by
higher overall investment. Although inflation at the end of 2013 was 3.7 percent, rising food prices
and tariffs of public services will most likely push inflation to the central bank target (5 percent) by
end-2014. Monetary policy was more accommodative during much of 2013, but the central bank
raised the policy rate by a total 100 basis points in December 2013 and January 2014, bringing it up
to 6.5 percent and monetary policy to a more neutral position.
3.
Over the medium term, policies need to cement economic fundamentals and promote
social development. The fiscal responsibility law provides an adequate anchor to maintain fiscal
sustainability. The central government deficit will most likely decline on average to about 1 percent
of GDP in the period 2015–18, becoming broadly neutral and supporting the gradual closing of the
current positive output gap. Regarding monetary policy, after the recent policy rate hikes, the
central bank stressed that it will continue to adjust it in the period ahead as necessary to keep
inflation within the target. To promote social development and address structural and institutional
weaknesses and rising inequality, the government proposed important reforms and the Congress
approved key laws in 2013 that will be implemented starting in 2014. Going forward, stronger
budget institutions are needed to improve the quality of spending along with strengthened tax and
customs administration. A civil service and pension reforms must be part of a medium term strategy,
along with improved public enterprises management to bolster access to public service.
4.

The following reform areas have been identified as critical:

Tax policy and revenue administration reform. Additional tax policy and reforms are
needed to increase low revenues. These include increasing taxation on the financial sector
and revenue collection efficiency while reducing exemptions.

Public financial management. Better budget design, monitoring and control is
needed along with a medium-term expenditure framework are needed to increase the
quality of public spending and improve the allocation of resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

PARAGUAY


Public-Private Partnerships. The recently approved PPP law offers potential efficiency
gains, but it can also increase fiscal risks. It is important to strengthen public investment
management, planning and regulatory capacity. The regulation of the law should provide
clear guidelines for risk allocation and accounting of contingent liabilities.

Financial system. Continue reforms to banking and central bank legislation are
needed to keep bolstering the banking system and strengthening regulation and
supervision. There is also a need to strengthen regulation and supervision for cooperatives
and establishing a safety net for the sector.

Monetary framework. To complete the transition to a full-fledged inflation targeting
regime, the central bank (BCP) would need to develop an active interbank monetary market,
improving communication with market participants and eliminating legal impediments for
secondary markets trading.
5.

The division of labor between the teams would be along the following lines:

Tax and customs administration reform. The Fund and the Bank will continue
providing technical assistance (TA) to support authorities’ efforts to reform the tax system
and increasing revenue collection productivity.

Public financial management. The Bank will provide TA on strengthening the
corporate governance of public enterprises. The Fund will provide TA on strengthening the
medium-term budget framework and cash management.

Monetary framework. The Fund plans to provide TA on further strengthening
monetary operations and transitioning to an inflation targeting regime.

Money Laundering. The Fund will provide TA to implement the plan on money
laundering and control of terrorism financing.

Medium-term debt management. The Fund’s will continue providing TA to develop a
medium-term debt strategy so as to reduce domestic debt servicing costs and promote the
development of a domestic government debt market.

Infrastructure and Logistics. The Bank will provide TA on infrastructure and logistics
required for the implementation of PPPs.

Poverty assessment and support. The Bank will provide TA on equity assessment and
poverty support. An approved loan of U$100 million will be used to expand the coverage of
the Paraguay Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development Project.

Education and social programs. The Bank will provide TA on education programs,
social assistance, and rural and agricultural development.

Pensions. The Bank will continue providing TA to improve the pension system
supervision, including with best practices.

Growth volatility. The Bank will provide TA on mechanisms to mitigate the impact of
growth volatility.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 31, 2013)
The Inter-American Development Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved in 2009 the Country
Strategy with Paraguay (2009–2013).1 Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the program was
expected to reach approximately US$1 billion.
Under the Strategy, the national authorities and the Bank identified the following priority sectors in
which the IDB Group would focus both its financial and non-financial products and services: (i)
transport; (ii) energy; (iii) water, sanitation, and solid waste; (iv) agriculture and tourism; (v) climate
change; (vi) health; (vii) education; (viii) institutional capacity; (ix) financial sector; and (x) urban
development. Regarding the Bank’s private sector operations, the Bank approved loans and
technical assistance in the foreign trade and social responsibility sectors, which derived to an
increase in approval of loans to companies: US$28 million in 2010, US$52 million in 2011,
US$9 million in 2012 and US$132 million in 2013.
The strategic areas were selected taking into account the following objectives: (i) strengthen the
governability and institutional capacity at the public sector to increase efficiency and transparency;
(ii) create the basis for sustainable growth, increasing regional and global integration to promote
private investment and improve competitiveness; and (iii) reduce poverty and improve the quality of
life of the poor by developing human capital and giving access to basic services.
As of December 31, 2013, the Bank’s portfolio in Paraguay included loans for the financing of 25
projects. The lending portfolio amounts to US$866 million, of which US$544 million are pending
disbursement. Disbursements in 2014 are expected to total US$74 million. The current portfolio
includes lending to support the Government in the following sectors: infrastructure, social, public
sector institutional strengthening, competitiveness, and regional integration. The portfolio also
includes loans to the private sector for US$203 million. In 2013, the Bank approved loans to the
public sector in the areas of transport and investment promotion.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 2013)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Following a data ROSC mission in January–February 2006, the authorities’ response to
the report and the mission’s recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on June 30,
2006. The country is a GDDS participant.
1.
National Accounts: National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of
the 1993 SNA, were released in 2005. However, no comprehensive regular program for data
collection through economic surveys exists (an industrial survey was conducted in 2002). An
economic census was undertaken in 2011. Source data for nonfinancial services, household
consumption, and changes in inventories are insufficient. Major areas of concern include: (i) the
1994 reference year needs to be updated; (ii) excessive use is made of fixed coefficients for value
added and household consumption; (iii) changes in inventories are obtained residually; (iv) informal
activities are not monitored; and (v) supply and use tables have been compiled only until 1997.
Annual GDP meets GDDS recommendations, and QNA meets DSSD timeliness requirements (90
days). Several STA missions on the compilation of quarterly national accounts (QNA) were fielded in
August 2007, August 2008, November 2009 and March-April 2011. QNA series were published in
December 2010. The STA mission of March-April 2011 assisted the authorities in outlining a work
program for updating the national accounts’ base year.
2.
Labor market: Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage
and quality of employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. Since 2010,
data are released on a quarterly basis, although the latter covers the Asuncion area only. The last
available observation for the quarterly series is the third quarter of 2013, whereas the annual data
for 2012 has just been released in September 2013.
3.
Prices statistics: Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on
a regular and timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a
new CPI index based on the 2005–06 household budget survey (Dec. 2007=100). The geographic
coverage of the CPI is limited to Greater Asunción (the capital and metropolitan area) and
expenditure weights are representative of the consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI
has a base weight period of June 2010 and its basket (185 items) is representative of current
national output; electricity, water, and gas are not covered.
4.
The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector
statistics and constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA.
The authorities have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of the
recent compilation of a new CPI and the production of QNA series. A new ROSC mission has been
scheduled for February 2014.

5.
Government finance statistics: The Government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal
purposes and for reporting to WHD is broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual
on Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The authorities have not yet prepared a plan to
migrate to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Monthly data are available
for the central administration (budgetary central government). The asset position of the social
security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration include data of
the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the statistics of the
nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations ––four employer social
insurance schemes. These social insurance schemes are treated as financial corporations in the
monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium and long-term external debt are reliable and
available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available on request, but need to be fully
integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies remain in recording short-term supplier and
commercial credit of the public sector. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data reported
by the monetary and fiscal authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting more
transparent.
Annual data covering general government for 2011 have been reported for publication in the 2012
edition of the GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no outstanding debt data and no breakdowns for
expenditure by function have been provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook. Monthly and
quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS.
6.
Balance of payments: The classification of the balance of payments and the international
investment position (IIP) follows the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual,
5thedition. Quarterly data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001 onwards, and
are reported only once a year to STA for publication in the IFS. In May-2013, the CBP revised the
BOP and IIP time series to exclude transactions and positions between residents and the bi-national
hydroelectric energy enterprises, they are now considered 50% residents. Improvements have been
made in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially in the coverage of foreign direct
investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions. Special studies by the central bank
have improved the estimation methods for remittances of Paraguayans abroad and unregistered
trade transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.
Also, there are deficiencies in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to register due
to Paraguay’s open capital account. An STA mission on Balance of Payments Statistics assisted the
BCP in November 2006 in implementing recommendations of the ROSC mission. In particular, the
mission focused on: (1) assessing the surveys used to capture data on services, direct investment,
nonfinancial private sector portfolio investment, and other investment; (2) reviewing and updating
the statistical techniques used to calculate unrecorded trade; (3) reassessing the treatment of the
binational hydroelectric energy enterprises in the external sector accounts; and (4) reviewing and
preparing a preliminary template for reporting data on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Paraguay
On February 14, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with Paraguay.1
Paraguay enjoyed robust economic growth in the past decade, on the heels of the export
commodity boom, and supported by prudent macroeconomic policy implementation. Despite
weather-related shocks hitting the key agribusiness sector, the economy has grown at an average
rate of 4.7 percent a year since 2003 compared with about 2 percent the previous decade. Robust
growth has been accompanied by declining inflation, particularly since 2011 when the central
bank adopted inflation targeting. Despite the acceleration in growth in the 2000s, poverty and
inequality in Paraguay remain among the highest in the region.
Activity rebounded to an estimated 13 percent in 2013 as the agricultural sector recovered
sharply from the previous year’s severe drought. Rising agricultural output led to higher exports
and a surplus of close to 1 percent of GDP in the external current account, despite a deterioration
in the terms of trade. Non-agricultural activity has been less volatile, growing at about potential
in the past two years, underpinned by rising consumption. End-2013 inflation fell to
3.7 percent—below the central bank’s inflation target rate of 5 percent—despite increasing food
prices. Private sector credit growth has slowed to about 17 percent in nominal terms since end2012, with loans concentrated on the agricultural sector; consumer credit has also grown rapidly,
albeit from a low base. Paraguay’s banking sector remains well capitalized and profitable, with
low nonperforming loans.
Macroeconomic policies broadly supported the recovery. Fiscal spending under the stimulus
implemented in 2012 decelerated in 2013 due to stricter spending controls, though the central
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in the summing up can be found here:

government deficit increased slightly to about 2 percent of GDP from 1.8 percent in 2012 as tax
revenue remained modest. Monetary policy was on hold during much of 2013 until the central
bank raised the policy rate by 100 basis points over December 2013 and January 2014, in light of
incipient inflationary pressures.
The outlook for 2014 is positive. Growth should be strong at 4.8 percent, underpinned by
continued dynamism in the agricultural sector and rising infrastructure investment. Annual
inflation will likely increase to the central bank’s target rate of 5 percent. The fiscal deficit
should remain low, under the introduction of the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The external current balance would revert to a small deficit amid slightly deteriorating terms of
trade and rising import volumes. Overall, the risks to this outlook are balanced. The main
downside risks stem from regional growth and global borrowing conditions, while upside risks
include faster-than-expected progress in reforms.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Paraguay’s recent economic recovery and favorable outlook,
underpinned by strong economic policies and fundamentals, with low debt, sizeable official
reserves, and small fiscal and external imbalances. Directors noted that the key challenge ahead
is to improve social and economic development, while strengthening the macroeconomic policy
framework. They took positive note of the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda and the critical
legislation that has already been enacted to address institutional and structural weaknesses.
Directors emphasized that resolute implementation of these laws and continued sound
macroeconomic policies are necessary to reduce poverty and foster broad-based sustainable
growth.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of the fiscal framework. The fiscal responsibility law
provides a sound anchor to underpin fiscal sustainability. They encouraged the authorities to
make the framework stronger, by further improving the quality of government spending,
strengthening tax and customs administration, and enhancing the capacity to deal with potential
risks from public-private partnerships. Civil service and pension reforms are also needed.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent monetary policy stance and the advances made in
implementing an inflation-targeting regime. They encouraged additional steps to complete the
transition towards a full-fledged inflation-targeting regime, including developing an active
interbank money market, strengthening risk-based bank supervision, and updating financial
sector legislation. Maintaining exchange rate flexibility and greater efforts to reduce dollarization
will strengthen the monetary policy framework and help cushion the economy against potential
shocks. Over the medium term, macroeconomic policies should be guided by the fiscal

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

responsibility law and inflation-targeting frameworks. Directors called for steps to address the
remaining deficiencies in the anti-money laundering regime.
Directors agreed that reducing poverty and inequality is a priority. They encouraged the
authorities to sustain all the initiatives underway to promote social and economic inclusion while
protecting vulnerable groups through social safety nets. Reform efforts should particularly focus
on improving the business climate, addressing labor market inefficiencies, and increasing female
labor participation as well as human capital investment. Improved public enterprises
management will also facilitate access to basic public services at reasonable cost.
