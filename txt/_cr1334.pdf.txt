STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, FIFTH
REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY AND UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND REQUEST FOR WAIVER AND
MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERION

KEY ISSUES
Context, outlook, and risks. Growth has accelerated to over 6 percent in 2012, led by mining, agriculture,
agroprocessing, and services. Inflation remains subdued. Growth will likely moderate to trend in 2013 (4–
4½ percent), reflecting weaknesses globally and in FDI. Key risks include geopolitical developments in the
region (Nagorno-Karabakh, Iran).
Fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to an adjustment path that would stabilize debt. In 2012,
consolidation will again be larger than expected, reflecting spending restraint and project delays. Gradual
revenue gains are taking place, but more is needed.
Monetary and financial sector. The financial sector is sound, and credit has continued to expand at a
healthy pace. The authorities are taking measures to address risks from dollarization and are implementing
FSAP Update recommendations.
External stability. External consolidation has continued, supported by the fiscal adjustment, but the external
current account deficit remains large. Reserves are adequate, but will come under pressure with repayment of
crisis support. Greater exchange rate (ER) flexibility would help preserve buffers and contribute to external
adjustment.
Structural reforms. Important actions are underway in regulatory streamlining and anti-monopoly
enforcement. More ambitious structural reforms are needed, however, to further improve the business
environment and enhance competitiveness.
Program. The program is broadly on track, with all but one of the performance criteria (PC) and indicative
targets (IT) met. All structural benchmarks were observed or are on track with brief delays. The June PC on
reserves (NIR) of the central bank (CBA) was missed because of intensified efforts to defend the dram in the
face of unexpectedly strong market pressures. The September NIR IT was also missed. The authorities are
requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the June NIR PC, based on corrective actions being taken, and
modification of the December NIR target. They are also requesting that SDR 33.5 million become available
with completion of the reviews.
Article IV. Discussions focused on ensuring medium-term stability and sustainable and inclusive growth via:
(i) greater revenue mobilization to strengthen the fiscal outlook; (ii) continuing monetary and financial sector
reforms; (iii) greater ER flexibility to underpin external consolidation and sustainability; and (iv) improvements
to the business climate and competitiveness. The last consultation took place in 2010. Directors supported
the swift response to the crisis, but highlighted many of the same challenges: a more flexible ER, enhanced
revenue collections, and an ambitious structural reform agenda.

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

CONTEXT
1.
The post-crisis recovery has accelerated, but challenges remain. Robust growth in 2012
has reflected strong performance across a range of sectors and industries. Risks are mainly on the
downside, however, given global and euro area weaknesses. Inflation has remained subdued, as
fiscal consolidation has continued. Public spending has remained restrained, and pressures are
growing (infrastructure, health and education, pension reforms). Public debt is sustainable, with low
risk of distress, and reserves are adequate. However, the end-June NIR target was missed, reflecting
unexpected pressures. Reserves could come under further strain as debt repayments come due
in 2013–15. Substantial external adjustment has taken place, but further consolidation is needed,
supported by ER flexibility and an acceleration of structural reforms.
2.
Armenia is between parliamentary elections in May 2012 and presidential elections
next February. The May elections gave a boost to President Sargsyan and the Republican Party,
which gained a majority of seats in parliament. Political uncertainties remain ahead of the
presidential elections, however, and pre- and post-election developments could pose risks of
delayed or indecisive fiscal and structural reforms. The geopolitical environment remains complex,
with continuing tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh and Iran.
3.
Economic policies have been broadly consistent with Fund advice. As described in the
accompanying Ex Post Assessment, Armenia has had a long program relationship, and programs
have generally remained on track. Overall, the authorities and staff have agreed on the need to
implement policies to attain stability and foster growth. Past Article IV consultations have
emphasized a more flexible ER, enhanced tax revenue collections, and an ambitious structural
reform agenda. The authorities have implemented measures in these areas, but the results have
been mixed. Tax revenues have not increased markedly, ER flexibility remains a challenge, and
structural reforms have not yet led to a decisive breakthrough in the business climate.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Performance has strengthened in 2012. Growth has accelerated to over 6 percent, led by
agriculture, agro-processing, mining, and services. Construction, a key pre-crisis growth driver, is
finally stabilizing. Credit has continued to expand at a healthy pace, and the financial sector remains
well capitalized. However, private investment has remained weak. Inflation has been subdued,
reflecting low agricultural prices and supportive policies. The CBA has kept the policy rate at
8 percent since September 2011. Significant spillovers from the euro area have not materialized,
although there have been weaknesses in some financial flows, particularly FDI.

As in 2011, fiscal consolidation will be
larger than budgeted in 2012. The headline deficit
is expected to reach 2.1 percent of GDP, compared
with a target of 3.1 percent and last year’s outturn of
2.8 percent. The lower deficit reflects spending
restraint, mainly due to delays in large, foreignfinanced infrastructure projects. Tax revenues were
below projections in the first half, but have picked up
and are likely to meet nominal budget targets.

Credit growth has been strong, especially
in foreign currency (FX), but the banking sector remains robust. Credit grew by 24 percent yoy
through August, with FX loans growing by 27 percent. Banks remain well capitalized, with a capital

External adjustment is proceeding, although financial flows have been weaker than
expected. Exports and remittances have continued to expand at a healthy pace, although strong
growth of export volumes has been partly offset by lower metals prices. FDI has fallen sharply,

however, putting pressure on the balance of payments
and the dram. In addition to global and regional concerns,
FDI in Armenia has been dominated by large energy and
communications projects, which are winding down.

of favorable weather dissipates and credit expansion
slows. Weakening FDI and low domestic private investment also suggest slower growth. The output
gap is small and negative and should close over the course of 2013. Staff’s inflation projections are
in line with the CBA’s target range (4 ± 1.5 percent). During the discussions, the authorities
recognized the weaker environment globally and in Europe, but also pointed to high growth rates in
the region and suggested that implementation of new export diversification and industrialization
policies would keep growth at 6–7 percent. They viewed FDI weaknesses as temporary, noting
planned projects in mining, manufacturing, and energy. They also suggested that pension reforms
would help mobilize domestic savings and foster financial sector development. Staff observed that
business environment reforms had not so far proved sufficient to sustain private investment growth
and reduce unemployment, but agreed that accelerated reforms could help strengthen and diversify
domestic investment and FDI to sectors such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and IT.

9.
Risks are mainly on the down side and come from potential external shocks, political
uncertainties, and regional conflicts (Box 1). A stagnation of global growth, possibly emanating
from Europe, is the main risk, with spillovers through trade, finance, and investment channels,
particularly if Russia is strongly affected (Box 2). A disorderly external adjustment remains a risk,
given the still-large external current account deficit and the likely need for a medium-term
adjustment of the real exchange rate (Annex I). A disorderly adjustment, however, is likely to come
about in the event of a low-risk event, such as another global shock. The authorities’ sound policy
framework and official support are likely to mitigate impacts. Geopolitical risks are rising, both with
respect to Azerbaijan and spillovers from a possible confrontation of the West or Israel with Iran.
Finally, there are risks in the run-up or after the February 2013 presidential elections. The authorities
broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of risks and reaffirmed their commitment to
strengthening buffers and reducing vulnerabilities through continued consolidation and greater ER
flexibility.

FIFTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EFF/ECF
The program is broadly on track, although the June NIR PC was missed in the context of unexpected
pressures. The authorities are requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the June PC based on corrective
actions being taken, and modification of the December target. New benchmarks were agreed in bank
reporting, and pension and regulatory reforms.

10.
The June NIR PC was missed due to heavy intervention to defend the dram in a
weaker-than-expected external environment. The dram had been stable for several months, but
came under pressure in May-June. While allowing depreciation from AMD 385 to AMD 420 per
dollar (a maximum since 2006), the CBA also intervened significantly to calm the market, resulting in
an end-June NIR shortfall of $50 million. The developments reflected a strengthening of the dollar
amidst euro area concerns, a significant fall in FDI, and lower tourism receipts from Iran.

participants on factors that are affecting the FX market and
the ER. The dram has appreciated since mid-June, and the
CBA has purchased $40 million. However, additional large-scale reserve accumulation to meet the
original end-year targets, which had built in extensive third quarter purchases, would have placed
excessive pressures on a thin market. Staff and the authorities saw little scope to tighten other
policies. Fiscal policy is already tight, and with inflation low and growth expected to slow, raising
interest rates would be undesirable. Against this background, the authorities are requesting a waiver
of nonobservance of the June PC based on corrective actions being taken and downward revision of
the December NIR target by $60 million, $10 million larger than the end-June breach amount. Gross
reserves would remain above 3.5 months of prospective imports. Staff supports this request. 1
12.
Monetary conditions have otherwise remained stable. The June PC and September IT on
CBA net domestic assets (NDA) were met, along with the June and September ITs on reserve money
(RM). In connection with reduction of the NIR target, the authorities request a downward revision of
the December RM IT, leaving the NDA target unchanged. Achieving these targets should not require
significant monetary operations that would send mixed signals about policies, given the corrective
actions being taken. Staff supports this request.

A FIN staffer joined the mission for a safeguards visit and recommended full provisioning of illiquid CBA
deposits in the 2012 financial statements, amending the CBA’s reserve guidelines by limiting holdings in the
region, and appointing external experts to the CBA audit committee.

Box 2. Output Linkages of Armenia, the CCA and Russia
Spillovers from the euro area have so far been moderate. Lower FDI appears to reflect, at least in part, the
end of a cycle of large privatizations and investments in telecommunications, energy, and transportation,
along with continuing caution on the domestic business environment, Armenia’s small market size and
relative isolation, and geopolitical risks. Staff analysis for the Fall 2012 MCD Regional Economic Outlook
suggests that spillovers from the euro area to Armenia are channeled (and amplified) via Russia, given
strong trade, remittance, FDI, and bank linkages. Russia continues to benefit from high oil prices and its own
strong links to the “core” euro area (especially Germany), which has performed better than the euro area
“periphery.”
Business cycles of the eight Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries exhibit a substantial degree of
synchronicity among themselves and with Russia. Like Armenia, this reflects trade, financial, and remittance
linkages. At the country level, output changes are driven by both domestic and common developments that
affect the region as a whole. Common shocks could be due to global developments (e.g., slower global
demand, global financial market tensions, falling commodity prices). Co-movement of commodity prices,
such as oil and copper, are an important factor. For some CCA countries, domestic factors may be more
important; the common factor may dominate for others. This distinction is important, as different responses
might be warranted, depending on whether “internal” or “external” shocks dominate.
A state-space model was used to extract the “common factor” from GDP series of the CCA countries. This
common factor can be analyzed relative to country-specific CCA GDP series and to Russia’s real GDP. We
find that the common factor has a strong correlation with Russian (0.89) and Armenian (0.86) output,
suggesting that output dynamics in Armenia (also Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Kazakhstan) are driven by
external factors closely related to developments in Russia. This underscores the need for close monitoring in
Armenia of Russian leading indicators and assessment of consequences for flows to Armenia. Efforts should
also be made to build greater resilience by diversifying exports, while allowing for greater ER flexibility.

The CBA is continuing efforts to strengthen
the interest rate channel (LOI ¶11). Interbank interest
rates continued to exhibit significant volatility in mid2012, and staff urged the CBA to further strengthen
operations to increase the relevance of the policy rate.
The CBA noted that the width of the interest rate
corridor had been reduced from 600 to 400 basis points
to reinforce the transmission mechanism; the corridor
was further narrowed to 300 bps in early November. The
CBA also pledged to step up fine-tuning operations
while strengthening communications to better anchor
expectations.

The banking system is sound, although it remains heavily dollarized. With high capital
adequacy and dram liquidity ratios and moderate rates of NPLs and profitability, banks remain
sound. Nonetheless, since the 2009 crisis, credit has become increasingly dollarized, and almost
two-thirds of loans are denominated in FX (up nine percentage points from a year ago).2 Staff
advised the CBA to assess possible policy actions, including expanding the difference between
reserve requirements for FX and dram liabilities and further adjusting capital ratios for FXdenominated loans.
15.
The CBA is improving the regulatory and supervisory framework in line with FSAP
recommendations (LOI ¶12–13).3 The CBA introduced a new prudential norm for bank FX liquidity
ratios, effective in January 2013, and is committed to gradually increasing these ratios. The CBA also
required banks to report on potential currency mismatches of large borrowers. Staff suggested
using this new information to strengthen the assessment of sectoral risks and tailor stress-testing
guidance to banks. In line with FSAP recommendations, the CBA will require banks to immediately
report changes that have a material adverse impact and will review calculation of large exposures to
determine whether treatment is in line with best practice. The CBA and government will assess
whether changes are needed to streamline the execution of collateral, following recent reforms to
the system of property registration.

B. Fiscal Policy
16.
Strong adjustment is continuing in 2012, with the deficit again expected to be lower
than budgeted. While the consolidation is supported by the authorities’ tax package (0.6 percent of
2

The increase in credit dollarization has occurred even as the CBA increased loan-loss provisioning
requirements and capital risk weights for FX loans in 2010. The loan dollarization rise may have been due in
part to bank efforts to limit currency mismatches, particularly as a significant share of funding attracted by
banks has been in foreign currency and after the CBA’s shift of the currency of denomination of reserve
requirements for FX liabilities to dram. As banks converted these required reserves to dram, they may have
rebalanced the currency match on their balance sheets by increasing FX loans.

GDP), the smaller deficit relative to the budget reflects lower spending, mainly due to delays in
initiating infrastructure projects, in particular the North-South highway. The authorities also
highlighted efficiency gains and spending restraint in other areas, and staff commended strong
budgetary management during successive election years.
17.
Tax collections are on track to meet the targeted gain, with higher tax revenues
compensating for lower social contributions. While revenue targets for the second half of the year
are ambitious, collections picked up in the third quarter. However, staff observed that increases may
be posing a strain on the business environment and SMEs, which have complained of a substantial
tightening of the tax net (e.g., stepped-up presumptive approaches, more frequent inspector visits,
requests for tax advances) and an increasingly uneven playing field. This threatens to undermine
gains in e-filing and taxpayer services. Both sides look forward to a major new USAID-World Bank
tax administration project on strategic planning, revenue analysis, internal control, and IT. New
transfer pricing legislation should also help, although implementation may begin only in 2014, once
guidelines and regulations are in place.
18.
The 2013 budget targets a headline deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP, as project delays
should be overcome. Current spending items will remain restrained. For example, most public sector
wages and pensions will remain constant in nominal terms, implying a substantial cut in real terms.
19.
While staff and the authorities agreed on the headline deficit target for 2013, there
were differences of view on revenues. Staff urged the authorities to raise revenues by 0.4 percent
of GDP to ease spending constraints, focusing on excise taxes (including covering pressurized gas)
and elimination of exemptions. The authorities noted strong opposition to tax hikes and warned
that tax proposals might lead some parliamentarians to propose tax cuts. In the end, they proposed
0.2 percent of GDP, reflecting both tax policy changes and revenue administration improvements
(LOI ¶5), as well as elimination of PIT exemptions for the military and police amounting to a further
0.7 percent of GDP, offset by targeted wage increases. Staff agreed, noting that the PIT measure
sends an important signal on exemptions.
20.
Pension reform implementation is on track. To ensure that progress continues, the
authorities agreed on a new benchmark on key two pension regulations. Under the pension reform,
PIT and social contributions will be integrated in 2013, and the authorities are preparing to launch
an electronic system for individual accounting and recording under the new unified PIT.

C. Structural Issues

The authorities continue to implement structural reforms focused on business
environment improvements and deregulation (LOI ¶14–16).


The centerpiece “Regulatory Guillotine” program, with strong support from the President, Prime
Minister, and donors, was launched with preparation of comprehensive legislative packages to
streamline regulation and red-tape in three areas, from a total of 17 areas. Further guillotine
areas will be initiated in the first half of 2013.



The competition committee has continued to step up enforcement efforts, and further legal
changes in the competition area are expected to be proposed to parliament with a short delay.
Staff welcomed these actions, but observed that distortions to competition also arise from
selective application of laws and regulations.



No actions have been taken with respect to Nairit, the troubled synthetic rubber producer and
Armenia’s largest industrial complex. There is investor interest from a Russian energy firm, and
the authorities again stressed they would only assume liabilities (including guarantees) in
consultation with the Fund and the World Bank.

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: SECURING SUSTAINABLE
AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Discussions focused on ensuring medium-term stability and fostering sustainable and inclusive growth
through: (i) greater revenue mobilization to strengthen the fiscal outlook; (ii) continuing monetary and
financial reforms; (iii) greater ER flexibility to underpin external consolidation and sustainability; and
(iv) further improvements to the business climate and competitiveness.

D. Fiscal Policy: Consolidation While Creating Space to Support Growth
22.

Armenia’s fiscal policy faces a number of important challenges:



Further consolidation is needed to ensure debt sustainability. Staff estimates indicate that a
headline deficit of 2 percent of GDP or lower is needed to stabilize debt, albeit at a relatively
high level (39 percent of GDP in 2032), leaving little room to respond to shocks.4 Moreover,
historical shocks to output, interest rates, and the ER imply a high probability that debt would
follow an upward trend with a deficit of 2 percent of GDP. Accordingly, the deficit should ideally
be reduced below 2 percent of GDP.



Revenue performance, while increasing gradually since 2009, remains a constraint. The
authorities have taken steps to strengthen and modernize tax policy and revenue administration,
including enactment of a new mining royalty, adoption of risk-based approaches in tax and
customs administration, initiation of e-filing and taxpayer service centers, and formation of a
high-level tax appeals committee. Still, these actions have not translated into significantly higher
revenues collected in a business-friendly manner. Collections remain 4–6 percentage points of
GDP below regional and international comparators.



Fiscal consolidation and low revenues have limited growth- and welfare-enhancing
spending. Education and health outlays have decreased by 1.1 percentage points of GDP

4

See the updated debt sustainability analysis in Annex III. The debt-stabilizing deficit level is estimated at 3
percent of GDP (see IMF Report 11/366). A headline deficit of 2 percent would be consistent with this level, in
light of recurrent external net lending of 1 percent of GDP recorded below the line.

since 2009 and are below many other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The Family
Benefits Program (FBP), Armenia’s flagship poverty-reduction initiative, is well-targeted and cost
effective. FBP spending has remained stable at 0.9 percent of GDP, but coverage is relatively
narrow and has fallen with the crisis. Investment spending has also declined in recent years. The
authorities have utilized extensive net lending operations in recent years to mitigate the crisis
and ease spending pressures, but exposing the government to risk (Box 3).


Spending pressures are expected in priority areas. The World Bank and other partners have
called for higher outlays in areas such as road maintenance and modernization of health and
education facilities. The implementation of pension reform in 2014 is expected to add costs of
0.4–0.7 percent of GDP annually, and possibly significantly more if minimum pensions are
increased. Graduation from concessional financing is expected to increase borrowing costs.
Box 3. Armenia: Net Lending Operations
Public sector lending to the domestic economy amounts to nearly US$1 billion or 10 percent of GDP. The
modalities are complex, with a variety of programs depending on the source and targets of lending. A
significant expansion took place in 2009 as a response to the crisis, with financing from Russia, the World
Bank and KfW. In 2010–11, there was a modest net repayment. Funding was directed to SMEs, renewable
energy and housing finance, and gas and mining companies. Most of the Russian loan has maturity of 5–10
years and floating interest rates linked to LIBOR. Loans from KfW and the World Bank have longer maturity
and lower interest rates.
Domestic lending entails fiscal risks. Credit risk may materialize as repayments commence. Sizable loans to
the energy sector fall due soon. There are also FX and interest risks, due to currency denomination and
floating rates. It will be critical to closely monitor borrowers to ensure that repayments are made on a timely
basis and external financing is repaid accordingly. Lending operations also need to be managed consistently
with broader macroeconomic management and limiting distortions for private lenders. In the discussions,
the authorities noted that they are monitoring borrowers carefully while including these assets improves
Armenia’s (net) debt profile.

23.
Staff noted that continued difficulties in raising revenues would compel a mediumterm path of restrained spending, with negative consequences for growth and socioeconomic development. Staff commended the authorities’ tight expenditure control and efficiency
gains but noted that an annual fiscal gap will emerge from 2014, which could rise to as much as
4½ percentage points of GDP by 2020 if spending pressures fully materialize and revenues do not
rise.5 This called for more aggressive reforms to raise revenues, including further improvements in
tax policy (exemptions) and administration (strengthened coverage of large, well-connected
taxpayers). It would be particularly important to avoid an erosion of social spending.

5

In the energy sector, supply adequacy will be an issue with the future decommissioning of Metsamor nuclear
power plant by 2020. Estimates for replacing Metsamor are not included in the projections; these run to $4.5–5
billion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

24.
The authorities agreed that the path is challenging, but argued that growth should be
higher, while recent gains show that they can ensure sufficient medium–term revenue
mobilization. Higher medium-term growth, including through higher domestic savings connected
with pension reforms, would ease pressures. Moreover, recent tax policy measures had already
contributed to an improving tax ratio, including the expected 0.6 percentage point increase in 2012,
while significant progress had been made in the use of IT in tax administration. These should lead to
further revenue gains, together with improved approaches in areas like transfer pricing. Staff noted
that tax buoyancy remained low and that tax administration practices were flagged in surveys as the
most significant business climate constraint. Further measures such as the establishment of an
independent tax ombudsman, would help.

E. Monetary and Financial Sector: Underpinning a Robust Monetary
Framework and a Sound Financial Sector
25.
Staff supported the CBA’s continued strengthening of the inflation-targeting
framework, which has contributed to low inflation and well-anchored expectations. Efforts
include significant modeling development (with support from MCM and RES) and improved liquidity
management through weekly forecasts and fine-tuning operations (LOI ¶10). Based on Fund TA, staff
suggested further strengthening, including enhancing communications, augmenting the survey of
private forecasters, and developing term money-market instruments. Staff added that further ER
flexibility would enhance the independence of monetary policy and the transmission mechanism.
The authorities agreed in principle, but also noted that it was important to continue to smooth
unusually large movements or policies could lose hard-fought credibility gains.
26.
The regulatory and supervisory framework is sound, and the CBA is paying further
attention to key vulnerabilities and financial deepening. Staff observed that there is a
concentration of exposure at some banks, along with high dollarization of deposits and lending, and
a decline in capital ratios (due in part to risk weights on FX assets). The CBA will further improve the
framework by using Basel II Pillar II powers to assess and mitigate individual, institution-specific risks
and indirect FX risks. On financial deepening, staff stressed the importance of a sound framework for
investment policy and asset managers under the pension reform. The authorities agreed, noting that
they would be guided by FSAP recommendations and their medium-term debt strategy in their
efforts to further improve domestic financial markets and instruments.

F. External Sector: Greater Dram Flexibility to Support Consolidation
27.
Despite significant consolidation since 2009, the external current account deficit
remains high, underscoring the need to strengthen competitiveness. The current account
continues to be characterized by a significant gap between the actual and sustainable deficits, and
further narrowing the current account deficit is critical, as FDI has not recovered to pre-crisis levels
and the terms of external financing will harden over the medium term. So far, the consolidation has
been driven by fiscal consolidation; going forward, the private sector will have to lead the
adjustment.

adjustment of the dram in real effective terms is needed over
the medium term. This would help ensure that the export
sector, which halved in percent of GDP during a period of
real ER appreciation in the mid-2000s, faces appropriate price signals. ER flexibility will also be
essential to ensure a comfortable level of reserves. While appearing adequate by most traditional
metrics, reserves are expected to come under pressure over the medium term as crisis support
unwinds. The FSAP update found that the financial system would be resilient to greater exchange
rate flexibility, including a depreciation on the scale of the 2009 adjustment, which would be
significantly greater than the estimated amount needed to bring the exchange rate into line with the
fundamentals.

29.
The authorities concurred on the need for
further external consolidation, and reiterated their
commitment to a flexible ER, as demonstrated by
the movement in 2012. However, they disagreed with
staff’s assessment of the extent of overvaluation of the
dram and placed less emphasis on the role of ER
adjustment and more on structural measures to
improve export performance and import competition.
To this end, the authorities launched an export
diversification and industrialization strategy in 2011
that identified 11 sectors with significant potential.

Sector-specific strategies are being developed to identify and remove obstacles to growth. They also
noted that assessing the appropriate value for the ER was a difficult task, and that a strong
resumption of FDI or remittance growth could lead to a resumption of appreciation pressures.

G. Structural Reforms: Achieving Inclusive Growth
30.
Armenia faces important barriers to ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth. These
include a difficult geopolitical situation and relative isolation (risks and high costs), a small economy
with limited diversification, and a perception of dominance by well-connected businessmen
(“oligarchs”). Armenia has made advances in global competitiveness surveys, for example, ranking
55th out of 183 countries in the World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business (DB) indicators and jumping
significantly further—to 32nd place—in the 2013 DB rankings. However, staff observed a disparity in
Armenia’s performance: good scores in areas related to opening a business (registering a business or
property), but weaker scores in areas related to running a business (paying taxes, receiving
electricity, trading across borders, protecting investors), although scores for protecting investors,
paying taxes, and obtaining electricity improved dramatically (from low levels) in the 2013 DB
rankings. Moreover, Armenia has underperformed other countries in Europe and Central Asia
(Annex II). In areas where scores had improved sharply, it was essential to ensure that higher
rankings—often based on new legislation—translated into durable changes on the ground and that
further progress was recorded. The authorities agreed, noting that initiatives such as the export
diversification and industrialization strategy, continued customer-oriented tax and customs reforms,
the regulatory guillotine, and actions against market dominance would bring results. Staff agreed
that improvements in growth prospects will rest on ambitious business climate reforms.
31.
High unemployment remains a challenge. While Armenia is regarded as having a flexible
labor market (the World Economic Forum recently ranked Armenia 30th out of 144 countries in labor
market efficiency), a lack of employment opportunities has continued to push Armenians abroad
(60 thousand annually). Moreover, high levels of skilled emigration seem inconsistent with a flexible
labor market. Once again, staff and the authorities agreed that improvements would depend on
business environment improvements to support private investment and SME creation and
operations. Budgetary resources for reintegration of returning migrants and targeted skill-building
programs might also be helpful.
32.
The crisis has had a negative impact on meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). With worse socioeconomic conditions and higher poverty rates, Armenia faces greater
challenges in meeting the MDGs by 2015. The authorities considered that efforts to protect key
social spending since the onset of the crisis (e.g., the FBP) had prevented a more dramatic
deterioration in poverty. Continued donor support was essential to their efforts.

PROGRAM ISSUES
33.
The authorities indicated their intention to seek a successor arrangement next year.
They noted that a new program would provide policy continuity and support to the continuing

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

external and fiscal adjustment through a period of debt repayments. A key objective would be to
further establish buffers and policy space, especially strong reserves and higher tax revenues.
Structural reforms should target further financial sector development and decisive improvements in
the business environment and competitiveness.6
34.
Program design and monitoring remain broadly unchanged. The authorities are
requesting a waiver for nonobservance of the June PC on NIR based on corrective actions being
taken and modification of the December target. The NIR adjustor would be modified to lock in any
CBA deposits received from the CIS Interstate Bank. New structural benchmarks focus on key
pension reform decrees, bank reporting to the CBA, and further regulatory guillotine areas. The
program is fully financed through the end of the period covered by the EFF/ECF arrangements
(June 2013). However, staff estimates indicate additional financing needs of around 2.1 percent of
GDP in the balance of payments and 1.4 percent of GDP in the fiscal accounts in the latter half
of 2013. Talks are underway with partners who have provided significant recent financing, including
the EU and the Asian Development Bank, and staff sees good prospects for these gaps to be filled in
the near future.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Performance has strengthened in 2012, and is expected to remain sound in 2013.
Growth has accelerated to over 6 percent in 2012, inflation has remained subdued, the fiscal deficit
declined, credit growth remained robust, and adverse spillovers from the euro area slowdown have
not materialized beyond weaknesses in some financial flows. Economic activity has benefitted from
especially strong outcomes in agriculture, agroprocessing, mining, and services. Credit growth has
been particularly strong in FX. Performance in 2013 is expected to be broadly similar, although GDP
growth is expected to moderate back to potential—i.e., 4 to 4½ percent—as positive, weatherrelated factors dissipate and credit growth moderates.
36.
Still, vulnerabilities remain. While Armenia’s reserves appear broadly adequate by most
metrics, the external current account deficit remains high, leaving Armenia significantly exposed to
shocks—such as a decline in exports and remittances connected with a severe slowdown in the euro
area and Russia. The moderate depreciation of the dram so far this year should contribute to reduce
the current account deficit going forward, but staff estimates that an adjustment of the dram in real
effective terms is needed over the medium term. In addition, the banking system continues to
exhibit high rates of deposit and credit dollarization, which could cause pressures on bank balance
sheets if a disorderly external adjustment takes place.
37.
Monetary and financial policies remain appropriate, but reforms to strengthen the
banking system should continue. The authorities’ objective of strengthening the CBA’s monetary
6

Consultation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

policy framework and of allowing greater ER flexibility should help enhance the transmission
mechanism and reduce external imbalances, while better absorbing shocks. At the same time, recent
financial regulations regarding currency mismatches of large borrowers and FX liquidity ratios are a
step forward in strengthening the soundness and supervision of the banking system. These
regulations should be complemented with other policies to reduce dollarization, and consideration
should be given to expanding the difference between reserve requirements for FX liabilities and
dram liabilities, and increasing FX liquidity ratios beyond their current levels. The CBA is urged to
implement the findings of the safeguards visit.
38.
Fiscal policy also remains appropriate, although increasing revenue collection to allow
for higher social and investment spending while reducing the deficit and debt is gaining
urgency. The fiscal deficit is expected to close 2012 at 2.1 percent of GDP, almost 6 percentage
points below the 2009 deficit. The strong consolidation has not only arrested the rise in debt, but
has also contributed to the reduction of the current account deficit. Nonetheless, the consolidation
needs to further emphasize revenues to provide space for much needed investment and social
outlays. Increasing excise taxes (which have eroded sharply over the past decade), eliminating
exemptions, and significantly improving tax and customs administration to raise greater revenues in
an even-handed, business-friendly manner should be emphasized.
39.
Ongoing structural reforms are welcome, and they should be complemented by a
better business environment and periodically assessed to ensure that they are achieving
objectives. Determined implementation of the regulatory guillotine program should help streamline
red-tape in key areas. The strengthening of competition policies and launching of an export
diversification strategy are also important steps. The challenge going forward is to follow up and
complement these measures, ensuring that they are indeed attaining the objectives set. In this
context, measures to improve the business environment in areas such as tax administration,
investment, education, dispute resolution, and fair competition should be implemented to bring
Armenia closer to a business climate consistent with its peers and its per-capita income. Staff
continues to urge against large-scale public involvement in Nairit.
40.
Policies under the program remain broadly on track. All but one PC and most ITs were
met. All structural benchmarks were observed or are on track with brief delays possible. On the basis
of the corrective actions being taken by the authorities and difficulties in meeting the targets set at
the time of the Fourth Review without placing excessive pressures on the FX market, staff
recommends completion of the Fifth Review, a waiver for the missed end-June NIR PC, and
modification of the end-December NIR PC. Staff also supports the authorities’ request for
SDR 33.5 million to become available with completion of the reviews.
41.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Armenia be held in
accordance with the September 28, 2010 Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles.

ANNEX I. EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY AND EXCHANGE RATE
ASSESSMENT
External consolidation is proceeding, driven by fiscal adjustment, strong growth in mining exports, and
a recovery of remittances. However, with a relatively narrow export base and concentrated remittances,
Armenia remains vulnerable to shocks, and its pre-crisis buffers of low debt and high reserves have not
been rebuilt. Staff assess that a depreciation of the dram in real terms would be needed over the
medium term to bring the current account into equilibrium. Stepped-up structural reforms and further
ER flexibility should facilitate an orderly adjustment.
Armenia’s reserves appear broadly adequate. They are equivalent to over 3½ months of
prospective imports, more than twice short-term debt, and around 195 percent of the Fund’s new
composite metric. However, these measures do not take account of dollarization, which for Armenia
(60–70 percent of liabilities and loans) suggests holding higher reserves, given potential banking
sector FX liquidity needs.1 Furthermore, the concentrated nature of some financing flows
(remittances) suggests the need for a relatively high buffer. Armenia’s reserves will also come under
pressure over the medium term as support provided during the crisis is repaid. Repayments to the
IMF peak next year at around $270 milllion, and remain significant in 2014–15. Repayment of the
large Russian crisis support also begins in 2013.
Armenia’s public and external debt remains sustainable.2 Public debt increased from 16 percent
of GDP in 2008 to 41 percent at end 2011, but has now stabilized. Assuming that the planned
medium-term fiscal consolidation is implemented, Armenia should remain at low risk of debt
distress. However, the large pre-crisis buffer will not be rebuilt unless growth is stronger or the
headline deficit is reduced to well below 2 percent of GDP. Private external debt also increased
rapidly from $0.7 billion at end-2003 to $3.7 billion at end 2011, but much of it has come as longerterm and inter-company lending, as well as lending by IFIs to support private sector development.
Current account consolidation is underway but has further to go. The current account defict
peaked in 2009 at around 16 percent of GDP, before falling to 11 percent in 2011. The strong fiscal
consolidation (5 percent of GDP during 2009–11) has been the primary driver. Looking forward, the
private sector will have to drive much of the remaining adjustment. Structural reforms will be key to
reducing impediments to export and import-competing sectors, while continued movement of the
real ER to its equilibrium value over the medium term will also be important to ensure that price
signals support adjustment and that the economy recovers competitiveness lost in the mid-2000s.
1

If the new metric is extended to cover 30 percent of FX deposits, Armenia’s gross reserves would amount to
around 140 percent of the revised metric. See WP/07/265 for a discussion of the optimum level of reserves in a
dollarized economy. Goncalves’ model assumed coverage of foreign currency deposits by official reserves and
banks’ liquid foreign assets at 100 percent for non-residents and 30 percent for residents.

Based on an elasticity of the current account to the real effective ER of -0.30 percent, this would
imply that a real effective depreciation over the medium term would be necessary to bring the
underlying current account into line with the norm.



Based on the assumptions in the DSA, the External Stability approach suggests that a noninterest current account deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP would stabilize debt at its current level.
This compares with an underlying non-interest current account of -6.9 percent of GDP,
suggesting that a real effective ER depreciation over the medium term would be needed to
bring the underlying current account to its NFA-stabilizing level.

These methodologies are subject to limitations and are sensitive to assumptions; they should
therefore be viewed with some caution. For example, this MB approach does not take into account
FDI flows, which in the case of Armenia have been supported by investments from the large diaspora
(not always solely for purely economic purposes), and may result in a larger sustainable current
account deficit than would otherwise be the case. The ES and ERER approaches may therefore provide
a better indication of the degree of overvaluation for Armenia, although the objective of stabilizing
debt at its current level would leave Armenia with little or no room to accommodate future shocks.
And while the exact magnitude of overvaluation is difficult to determine with certainty, the results do
tend to confirm the view suggested by the evolution of the balance of payments, that the real ER
remains moderately overvalued, despite developments in 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Further current account adjustment of 4 percent of GDP is likely necessary over the medium
term. This would still allow for a sizable deficit as Armenia uses external finance to support
development. Net official financing of the public sector is expected to fall as fiscal consolidation
continues and crisis support unwinds, but may nevertheless continue at just under 2 percent of GDP.
Net bank flows may diminish as credit/GDP ratios approach their equilibrium, and private
investment comes increasingly from FDI.
During 2012, depreciation has brought the dram closer in line with its equilibrium value.
However, CBA sales of FX have been larger than purchases, and further flexibility would be an
important part of the adjustment process, particularly in the event of shocks. Potential sources of
shocks include trade links with the EU and Russia, a fall of remittances, and fuel price fluctuations:


Exports to the EU account for roughly 50 percent of total exports over the last five years,
around three times higher than exports to Russia. However, almost two-thirds of EU exports
consist of ores and metals, compared to only around 15 percent of exports to Russia. This would
suggest that the impact of a downturn in Europe might be relatively contained if the global
economy grows at or near potential. Exports to Russia, however, tend to be higher value-added
and aimed more specifically at the Russian market, suggesting less transferability.



Remittances averaged 16 percent of GDP over the last five years (down from 19 percent
in 2004).3 They are a critical FX source, averaging 38 percent higher than total exports, twice
higher than FDI, eight times higher than bank flows, and four times higher than official
government inflows. Remittances finance around 40 percent of imports. Russia accounts for 80–
90 percent of remittances, and statistical analysis shows that lagged Russian GDP has the largest
impact on remittances. While remittances have been seen as a relatively stable source of finance,
they have exhibited significant volatility in Armenia, notably with the global downturn in 2009.



Armenia has no significant reserves of oil or gas, and fuel is largely imported from Russia.
While the ageing Metsamor nuclear power plant provides a significant component of domestic
electricity production, an increase in fuel prices could have an adverse impact. However, this may
be mitigated by the large role remittances from Russia have on the Armenian economy: to the
extent that high fuel prices support economic activity in Russia, the flow of remittances from
Russia would increase. The positive effect on Armenia’s economy from increased remittances
may outweigh the direct, negative impact of an increased fuel bill.

ANNEX II. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS
The evolution of Armenia’s business environment indicators presents a mixed picture.
Advances have been made, for example, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators (WBDBI),
where Armenia ranked 55th out of 183 countries in 2012 and 32nd out of 185 countries in 2013.
However, there is an important disparity in performance: Armenia performs well in areas related to
opening a business (e.g. registering a business or property), but performs relatively poorly in areas
related to running a business (e.g. paying taxes, receiving electricity, trade, protecting investors).
WBDBI gains through 2012 were due only to first group of indicators. Scores for protecting
investors, paying taxes, and obtaining electricity improved dramatically (from low levels) in the 2013
rankings, helping to boost Armenia’s overall ranking. These higher scores, based in large part on
new legislation, need to be translated into durable changes on the ground, while further progress
from still-low levels should be made.
WBDBI rankings indicate that Armenia has underperformed relative to its peers in Europe and
Central Asia (ECA). Comparing the evolution of WBDBI in Armenia with the average WBDBI for two
groups of ECA countries between 2007 and 2013 shows that for Armenia, three of the eight
indicators worsened (left chart), while for ECA middle-income countries, seven of eight indicators
improved, on average (right chart).1 In ECA low-income countries (Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova,
Tajikistan), half of the indicators improved. For Armenia, the deterioration took place in key areas for
operating a business (enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency). In other important areas, such as
paying taxes or trading across borders, there has been an improvement but Armenia remains
significantly behind ECA middle-income countries.

Business climate challenges appear to have undermined gains in competitiveness. The 2013
World Economy Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index (GGI) ranked Armenia 82nd out of 144
countries, a significant improvement from 2012, but more moderate progress compared with 2005,
when Armenia was first included. Armenia is in “Stage 2” of WEF’s levels of development meaning
that “basic requirements” pillars (institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health
and primary education) account for 50 percent of its assessment of Armenia’s competitiveness.2 If
Armenia is to reach higher growth and income levels, it must increase productivity while ensuring
sufficient physical factor accumulation. To do so, the basic requirement pillars must support
productivity gains. This calls for structural reforms in such areas as tax administration, investment,
education, and fair competition in domestic markets.
Compared with other WEF Stage 2 ECA
countries, Armenia lags in three of
four “basic requirements” and three of
six “efficiency enhancers.” Armenia
does not score markedly better than the
ECA Stage 1 countries: it is higher in two
of four “basic requirements,” in four of
six “efficiency enhancers,” and in one of
two “innovation factors.” Armenia
outperforms the ECA Stage 2 countries in
just one efficiency-enhancer: labor
market efficiency.

A key challenge is to improve the efficiency of markets for goods and services. Armenia ranks
just 130th of 144 countries in the intensity of local competition, and 118th in effectiveness and trust
in anti-monopoly policies. That said, the 2013 GCI survey shows gains in the extent of market
dominance (133rd in 2012; 90th in 2013). The authorities should continue efforts of the competition
committee to improve domestic competition and markets, and of the regulatory guillotine initiative
to reduce red-tape, inefficiency, and room for corrupt practices. Two other pillars with key
challenges are financial market development (78th) and technological readiness (92nd).

2

The GCI assesses the competitiveness based on twelve pillars grouped three main sub categories: (1) basic
requirements (which includes four pillars, institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, and health
and primary education), (2) efficiency enhancers (which includes six pillars higher education and training, goods
market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, and market
size) and (3) innovation and sophistication factors (which includes two pillars, business sophistication and
innovation).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

To improve medium-term growth prospects, Armenia needs productivity increases in the
tradable sector to support export-oriented growth. Over the past decade, it is noteworthy that
productivity fell, despite high levels of investment. A large share of this investment, however, took
place in the non-tradable sector (real estate). Implementation of the export-led industrial policy
focusing on agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and IT is an important step toward ensuring high and
sustainable medium-term growth. Countries with successful export diversification strategies have
built strong export-promotion frameworks, underpinned by greater trade openness.3

ANNEX III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Bank and Fund staff have undertaken an updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Armenia
using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries (LICs).1 Based on the external LIC
DSA, Armenia is assessed to be at a low risk of debt distress, with all indicators below the revised
country-specific thresholds under the baseline scenario. One flow indicator briefly exceeds the
threshold under the stress tests.2 The public sector DSA also suggests that following the post-crisis
consolidation underway, public debt is likely to remain sustainable. In a post-crisis context of lower
growth, weaker buffers, and less concessional financing, continued fiscal discipline will be essential
to preserve sustainability. The DSA suggests that a headline deficit significantly in excess of
2 percent of GDP would likely lead to an unsustainable increase in debt levels.

Background
Armenia’s total nominal external debt stood at $7.3 billion as of end-2011, the equivalent
of 73 percent of GDP, up from $6.1 billion (65 percent of GDP) at end-2010. Public debt
increased by US$270 million, while private external debt increased by $840 million. Half of the
debt stock at end-2011 consisted of public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt, of which over
two-thirds was owed to multilateral creditors, and the balance to official bilateral creditors. The
PV of the external PPG debt stood at $2.9 billion, or 29.1 percent of GDP. Including domestic
debt, Armenia’s total nominal public debt increased from 16.1 to 41.8 percent of GDP
during 2008–11. Most of this increase stemmed from external borrowing, with the IMF and
Russia providing almost two-thirds of the additional financing during the crisis period.3
Armenia’s external private sector borrowing has increased rapidly in recent years (Figure 1).
The stock of private debt increased from $0.7 billion at end-2003 to $3.7 billion at the end of last
year. Borrowing by the banking sector accounted for 44 percent of the total, of which 62 percent
consisted of long-term borrowing, mostly from parent banks and the official sector. Intercompany lending and other long-term lending accounted for 49 percent of total external
borrowing. Solvency stress tests conducted as part of the recent FSAP suggested that the
banking system is robust enough to withstand significant shocks, although rapid FX credit
growth is a key risk.

1

The debt data underlying this analysis were provided by the Armenian authorities. Data beyond end-2011
are staffs’ and authorities’ projections.
2

Armenia is classified as a strong performer, based on its three-year average score of 4.24 on the Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which measures the strength of a country’s policies and
institutions. For a strong performer (three-year CPIA rating above 3.75), the indicative thresholds for
external debt sustainability for a country where remittances are high are: PV of debt-to-GDP+remittances
of 45 percent, PV of debt-to-exports+remittances of 160 percent, PV of debt-to-revenues of 300 percent,
debt service-to-exports+remittances of 20 percent, and debt service-to-revenues of 22 percent.

3

ER changes and the decline of GDP in 2009 also contributed to the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio.

The macroeconomic assumptions for the DSA have not changed significantly (Box 1.1). A
key difference from the 2010 exercise is a somewhat lower-than-projected PPG debt-to-GDP
ratio reflecting a faster fiscal consolidation as well as a stronger dram.4 However, private
borrowing was higher than anticipated, leading to a higher overall external debt-to-GDP ratio.
While the current global uncertainties represent a downside risk, medium and long-term growth
rates have been retained from the previous DSA, given that there is little sign of any impact on
Armenia’s remittances or exports. Exposure to the euro area is also largely limited to commodity
exports, which may be well placed to find alternative markets, unless there is a decline in global
growth.
External DSA
Baseline Scenario
Under the baseline scenario, the public debt
burden is expected to remain sustainable, with all
indicators remaining under the policy-dependent
thresholds (Tables 1 and 3). The PV of PPG external
debt would peak at around 32 percent of GDP this
year, before falling to 28 percent in 2017 and remain
around that level for the rest of the projection period.
As a percentage of exports plus remittances, the PV of
public debt is also expected to peak this year at

100 percent, declining to around 75 percent at the end of the projection period. The PPG debt
burden currently stands at 142 percent of government revenues, and is expected to fall to
around 120 percent over the next five years and 108 percent at the end of the projection period.
Box I.1. Armenia: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario (2010–30)
Real GDP growth is projected at around its estimated potential of 4.3 percent per year during 2013–16.
Inflation is expected to average just under 3 percent this year, reflecting favorable base effects and
positive developments in the agricultural and the energy sectors. Consistent with the target range, inflation
over the long term is assumed to be around 4 percent.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to remain at around 2 percent of GDP over the long term, or the
equivalent of around 2.8 – 2.9 percent of GDP after including external lending. Net domestic financing is
assumed to cover just under half of the deficit, with external financing covering the balance.
Gross external financing is assumed to average just under 3 percent of GDP over the forecast period, in
line with the average in the decade prior to the crisis, and implying net external financing of around
2 percent of GDP after amortization (or 1 percent after amortization and Armenian external lending). No
successor Fund program is assumed. New lending terms are projected to harden as Armenia graduates
from IFI concessional financing into the non-concessional lending windows over the medium term, and
then further harden as Armenia begins to access the commercial bond markets. The DSA assumes that the
government gradually begins to access loans on fully commercial terms from 2018 onwards, although
official non-concessional financing is expected to make up the bulk of the borrowing until the late 2020s.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow from 14.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to under 9 percent
in 2013. Over the long term, the deficit is expected to average around 7 percent of GDP, as consolidation
continues and crisis financing unwinds. Exports are projected to grow at around 8 percent per year in dollar
terms, reflecting efforts to unlock potential in minerals, agriculture, and IT.
Remittances will continue to play an important role in financing Armenia’s trade deficit, but will continue
the declining trend as a percentage of GDP they have manifested since the peak in 2004, and are projected
to fall gradually from around 7 percent of GDP in the near term to around 4 percent at the end of the
projection period.
FDI is expected to average just under 5 percent of GDP. In the near term, FDI is likely to be concentrated in
mining. Over the longer term, business climate improvements should yield a more diversified FDI structure.

The PPG debt service ratios also remain sustainable throughout the projection period. The
debt service-to-revenue ratio peaks next year at 18 percent, but declines rapidly thereafter. The
debt service of PPG external debt in percent of exports and remittances also peaks in 2013 at
12 percent, but will fall to 5 percent by 2017, increasing slowly thereafter but remaining under
10 percent.
The total external debt-to-GDP ratio (public and private) is also expected to decline over
the medium term. Unlike most PRGT-eligible countries, private sector external debt in Armenia
is larger than the public debt stock. While the debt stock has increased rapidly in recent years,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

much of it consists of long-term lending to the banking sector from parent banks or official
lending, intra-company lending, and long-term loans to other sectors of the economy. It is
anticipated that the pace of external private sector borrowing will moderate with the current
account consolidation projected over the medium term, and as dedollarization efforts and the
development of domestic debt markets reduce the demand for FX loans. Nevertheless, the
significant private external debt stock constitutes a source of vulnerability, particularly in light of
the limited ability of the CBA to provide emergency liquidity assistance in foreign currency.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
While Armenia’s debt stock remains sustainable under alternative scenarios and bound
tests, the results point to debt flows exerting significant pressure in the short term. The PV
of PPG debt remains under the relevant thresholds as a percentage of GDP plus remittances,
exports plus remittances, and revenues under the standard menu of alternative scenarios and
bound tests. The PV debt-to-GDP ratio reaches its highest level, 39 percent, under a scenario that
projects a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2013. Such a
depreciation would see the PPG debt service-to-revenue ratio reaching 26 percent of revenue
in 2013, exceeding the 22 percent indicative threshold. However, in view of the fact that
Armenia’s CPIA rating makes it a very strong performer, and that the threshold is exceeded only
for one year and under just one of the bound tests, Armenia should continue to be regarded as
being at low risk of external debt distress.
The impact of accelerated IDA repayments in the event of IDA graduation is likely to be
relatively muted (Table 3).5 The acceleration of repayments would increase the PV of debt-toGDP+remittances by around 1 percent, and the PV of debt-to-exports+remittances by around
4 percent. The PV debt-to-revenue ratio would increase by around 6 percent. The debt service
ratios would only be marginally affected, since the principal repayments would continue to be
spread out over more than a decade. In all cases under this scenario, the ratios would stay below
the relevant thresholds.
In addition to the factors analyzed under the alternative scenarios, remittances are a
further source of vulnerability in Armenia. Remittances averaged around 16 percent of GDP
over the last five years, with 80–90 percent coming from one country (Russia). Staff projections
suggest that a one-off 40 percent fall in private transfers in 2013 would increase the PV of debtto-exports+remittances by 8 percent, while the debt service-to-exports+remittances ratio would
increase from 12 to 13 percent.

The scenario assumes accelerated repayment on the pre-FY07 IDA debt commencing in FY15.

Public Sector DSA
Baseline Scenario
The baseline scenario indicates that Armenia’s debt is sustainable (Table 2). The PV of
public sector debt would peak this year at 37 percent of GDP and remain broadly stable
thereafter. The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio also peaks this year at 177 percent, before
dropping gradually to under 135 percent at the end of the projection period. The indicators for
public debt would remain at reasonable levels throughout the projection period, below their
indicative thresholds. However, taking into consideration the legal requirement in Armenia to
keep public debt lower than 50 percent of the previous year’s GDP, the public debt ratios leave
limited space in the event of a significant exogenous shock such as that which Armenia
experienced in 2009.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
The standard menu of alternative scenarios and bound tests indicates that Armenia’s
public debt outlook would be most adversely affected by a permanent fall in the rate of
economic growth (Table 4). Under an extreme adverse growth scenario, stress tests indicate
that public debt ratios would follow a persistent upward trend through the projection horizon.
The most extreme adverse scenario in the medium term is a 30 percent depreciation in 2013,
which would push the NPV of debt to 49 percent in 2013, and would remain at this elevated level
over the long term. This adverse scenario also worsens Armenia’s liquidity situation, implying a
debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent in 2013.
A customized alternative scenario shows the impact of averaging an overall deficit of
3 percent of GDP over the medium and long term rather than 2 percent (Table 4). Under
this scenario, the debt would increase throughout the projection period, resulting in an end-2032
PV debt to GDP ratio of 52 rather than 35 percent in the baseline. This result reinforces the
importance of maintaining a medium-term overall deficit target of two percent or less of GDP if
the debt is to be kept on a stable or declining path.
Conclusion
In the staffs’ view, Armenia should be considered at low level of debt distress, based on
external debt burden indicators, and even after taking account of the significant private
sector debt burden. The public sector DSA suggests that Armenia’s overall public sector debt
dynamics are sustainable in light of the current size of the debt stock.
Nevertheless, the rapid accumulation of public debt since the onset of the global crisis
calls for continuing the pursuit of fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Public
external debt was only about 14 percent of GDP at end-2008, but reached 36 percent of GDP at
end-2011, and is expected to remain at similar levels over the medium term. While the projected
debt-to-GDP levels do not breach the indicative thresholds, the ratios remain at much higher

levels than prior to the crisis, pointing to a permanently lower resilience of the Armenian
economy to exogenous shocks.
By targeting a deficit of less than 2 percent over the long term, the authorities could
rebuild the macroeconomic buffers used during the crisis and increase the resilience of the
economy. A one percent deficit, for

Alternatively, if Armenia were able to
attain a higher growth trajectory, a two percent deficit target would allow for an increase in fiscal
space and a more rapid increase in buffers. If real GDP growth were to average 6 percent rather
than the 4–4½ percent assumed in the baseline, the PV debt-to-GDP ratio would fall steadily
from over 35 percent of GDP in 2012 to 28 percent at the end of the projection period, instead of
remaining broadly constant as under the baseline.
The authorities agreed with the broad thrust of the DSA. However, they stressed that the
4.3 percent long-term growth rate was conservative. In their view, the economy’s growth
potential is somewhat higher. Secondly, they emphasized that when viewed from a net rather
than gross perspective, their debt situation is more favorable: the total outstanding stock of
loans by public sector agencies to the domestic economy is AMD 379 billion, equivalent to
$913 million, or about 10 percent of GDP. Assuming that these amounts are to be repaid as
scheduled, the public debt burden could be reduced by around one-quarter.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT FOR THE FIFTH REVIEWS UNDER
THE EXTENDED FUND AND EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITIES
Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Yerevan, November 20, 2012

Dear Madam Lagarde:
1.
Armenia’s economic performance has strengthened in 2012. Growth has accelerated
to over 6 percent, with particularly strong performance in agriculture, agro-processing, mining,
and services. Construction is showing signs of recovery. Credit has continued to expand at a
healthy pace. The financial sector remains strong and well capitalized, and inflation is subdued
with low agricultural prices, benign global price developments, and supportive policies. Fiscal
consolidation in 2012 will be stronger than expected, reflecting efficiency gains, spending
restraint, and delays in large capital projects. Despite a fall in metals prices, export volumes grew
rapidly, and the external current account consolidation continues, albeit at a somewhat slower
pace than expected. In addition, while significant spillovers from the euro area have not
materialized, there have been weaknesses in some financial flows, particularly FDI and banking
sector inflows.
2.
In 2013, further deterioration in Europe and in the global environment are
downside risks. We expect growth to moderate. Inflation should remain within the target range
(4 ± 1.5 percent). Over the medium-term, we are committed to strengthen buffers and reduce
vulnerabilities through continued fiscal and external consolidation. Structural reforms to improve
the business environment and competitiveness will support private investment growth and boost
productivity. These reforms and prudent macroeconomic management should support growth
over the medium-term, as financial flows recover.
3.
Our program, supported by Extended Fund and Extended Credit (EFF/ECF)
arrangements, remains broadly on track. All but one continuous and quantitative performance
criteria (PC) and most indicative targets (IT) for end-June 2012 [and September 2012] were met.
The end-June PC and end-September IT on net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of
Armenia (CBA) was missed, however, due to unexpected pressures in the foreign exchange
market. All structural benchmarks were observed or are on track with brief delays possible. This
letter of intent (LOI) describes policies for the remainder of 2012 and the first half of 2013. These
continue to aim at containing pressures, limiting disruptions to the recovery, enhancing growth
and poverty reduction, strengthening fiscal and debt sustainability, and further developing a
sound financial system. We anticipate policy continuity following presidential elections in
February.

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

I. THE PROGRAM FOR 2012–13
A. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
4.
We have continued our strict fiscal management. We expect the deficit for 2012 to be
around 2 percent of GDP, 1 percentage point lower than budgeted. Revenue is on track to
achieve the envisaged 0.6 percent of GDP gain over 2011. Expenditure will be lower, most
notably by delayed implementation of a few large, externally-financed capital projects. The 2013
budget will aim at a headline deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP with a further 0.9 percentage point
increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio. The headline deficit is in line with our 2013–15 medium-term
framework, which aims to reach the debt stabilizing deficit level by 2015. In recent years,
including in connection with mitigating the effects of the crisis, the government and CBA have
undertaken extensive lending operations (e.g., energy, mining, SMEs). As repayments to external
lenders commence soon, we will closely monitor borrowers to ensure timely debt service.
5.
We are continuing our efforts to improve tax policy and revenue administration to
support higher revenues. We are on track to submit legislative proposals to adopt OECD
guidelines for transfer pricing regulation (Structural Benchmark, November 2012), with support
from the IFC. Implementation will depend on preparation and issuance of guidelines and
regulations, which we expect will take place during the course of 2013. We will propose a range
of tax policy measures to support the envisaged revenue increase in 2013, including removal of
personal income tax exemptions for all occupations, including the military and the police
(0.7 percent of GDP), and an additional 0.2 percent of GDP from introduction of a turnover tax
for small businesses and expansion of the range of application of the patent law. The revenue
gains will also reflect scheduled increases in tobacco taxes, as well as further improvements in
revenue administration. We will begin to receive the new mining royalty, based on 2012 results.
Key tax administration reform efforts planned for 2013, including launching an electronic system
for individual accounting and recording under the new unified personal income tax, which will
bring together the income tax with social security contributions. The reforms are far-reaching,
complex, and critical to the launch of the new pension system. The work is being undertaken on
an ambitious time schedule and will be supported by World Bank financing and USAID TA on
strategic planning, revenue analysis, internal control processes, and IT infrastructure.
6.
We are augmenting growth-enhancing expenditures and strengthening social
protection. After delays in 2011–12, we have now launched the major North-South highway
project and will accelerate implementation of urban infrastructure projects. We will also begin to
reverse the erosion in education spending. We have made progress in our efforts to integrate the
wide range of social services to improve efficiency and service quality. We adopted a list and
timetable of legal amendments needed for integration in July (Structural benchmark,
October 2012) and have begun a pilot program to test and refine the functioning of one-stop
service centers. We will integrate the results of the pilot and submit the legal changes to
parliament in the second half of 2013.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7.
We are on track in our preparation for pension reforms. Preparation of government
decrees and regulations and legislative changes has proceeded as planned, and an on-line
system of individual accounts will be launched and managed by NASDAQ-OMX Armenia to
running in parallel with the unified income tax IT system. Two key decrees are to be submitted to
Cabinet by end-December 2012. These would establish procedures for managing the guarantee
fund for mandatory, funded contributions and quantitative and currency restrictions on investing
mandatory funded pension assets in financial instruments (New structural benchmark,
December 2012). We have stepped up our awareness campaign with involvement of highranking officials and expanded access to the Internet, in light of the integration of personal
income tax and social contributions that will start in 2013. We are also making progress toward
producing updated estimates of the fiscal costs of the reform (including the contingency costs of
state guarantees), with the first set of comprehensive estimates to be completed by year end
(Structural benchmark, December 2012).

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
8.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at maintaining price stability. Activity has
expanded faster than expected, but this has reflected largely supply side developments
(agriculture, mining), and inflation has remained subdued. We have kept the policy rate steady at
8 percent since September 2011. Under the baseline scenario, the output gap is expected to
close gradually while growth moderates, and headline inflation is likely to stay in the target range
over the policy-relevant horizon. Thus, further interest rate policy action is unlikely to be needed.
We will, however, remain vigilant to both upside and downside risks and stand ready to adjust
policies using the full range of tools.
9.
Balance of payments pressures caused us to miss the end-June reserves target. To
mitigate market pressures, we sold reserves in May and June to contain what we perceived as
temporary turbulence. Over the course of the summer, however, it became clear that the
pressures reflected more persistent, weaker-than-expected external flows, and we were unable to
rebuild NIR as planned. We therefore request an adjustment of the end-December NIR target,
supported by corrective actions that we are taking. Since the start of the year we have allowed
the dram to adjust by 5 percent in real terms. We have strictly limited foreign exchange sales,
and will confine our interventions to smoothing unusually large movements, while maintaining a
strong NIR buffer against shocks. We will continue to communicate frequently with the markets
and the public on developments. More broadly, we are confident that continued structural
reforms, fiscal consolidation, and a flexible exchange rate will support the continued reduction of
the external current account deficit. In support of these efforts, we have updated our reserve
management guidelines in consultation with the Fund staff.
10.
We will further improve our inflation-targeting framework. We are improving our
policy framework by making organizational changes and enhancing our capacity for model
building and forecasting with support from IMF TA. Two key recommendations under
implementation are: augmenting the current survey of private forecasters by requiring banks to
regularly submit macroeconomic forecasts (output, inflation, interest and exchange rates,
52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

external current account) to the CBA; and devising a communications strategy on the monetary
policy framework, covering the objectives and operations of exchange rate and inflationforecast-targeting policies (by end-2012).
11.
We are also strengthening monetary operations to increase the relevance of the
policy rate to market rates. We are closely communicating with market participants and
providing enhanced information on liquidity conditions. We will continue to conduct timely and
sufficient fine-tuning operations aiming to further reduce the volatility of interbank rates. To
reinforce this aim, we have narrowed the width of the interest rate corridor around the policy
rate from 600 to 400 basis points. We will further reduce the corridor to 300 basis points by end2012. For the enhancement of the monetary transmission mechanism, we are also supporting
efforts of NASDAQ-OMX Armenia to develop a term interbank trading platform, which is
expected to start during the fourth quarter of 2012 and to introduce longer-term money market
instruments.

C. Financial Sector Stability and Development
12.
We will continue to safeguard the stability of the banking system, especially in light
of rapid growth of loan portfolios. In line with the program’s structural benchmarks and FSAP
recommendations, we have introduced a new prudential norm for bank foreign currency liquidity
ratios, which will become effective in January 2013 and increase gradually thereafter. In addition,
we issued a regulation requiring banks to initiate transmission to the CBA of information on
potential currency mismatches of large borrowers. We will consider standardizing reporting of
this information, and use it to assess risks and tailor our stress-testing guidance to the banks. We
will continue efforts to reduce the high levels of dollarization of the banking system, primarily by
fostering a stable macroeconomic environment anchored on our inflation targeting framework.
In light of continued strong growth of FX deposits and lending, we are assessing possible policy
actions, including expanding the differential between reserve requirements for foreign currency
liabilities and dram liabilities. Finally, in line with FSAP recommendations and in light of changes
to the system of property registration in 2012, the government and CBA will assess whether
further changes are needed to streamline the execution of collateral.
13.
We are strengthening our regulatory and supervisory framework in line with FSAP
recommendations. We will continue our effort to integrate the use of Basel II Pillar II powers in
the supervisory toolkit to mitigate individual, institution-specific risks, including application of
additional capital and other prudential requirements in case banks are not following appropriate
risk-management practices. From this perspective, we will further strengthen our structured
dialogue with bank boards or senior management on their capital adequacy assessments. We will
amend and issue new regulations to require banks to immediately report changes to operations
that have a material adverse impact on the bank by end-2012 (New structural benchmark,
December 2012). Also in line with FSAP recommendations, we are reviewing the calculation of
large exposures to determine whether changes are needed to bring treatment fully in line with
international good practice. Finally, we will take further steps to clarify the division of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

responsibilities between the CBA and the government in crisis management, including setting
out in CBA rules that the Finance Ministry and the Deposit Guarantee Fund should participate in
the Financial Stability Committee when financial institutions become insolvent and state budget
allocation and deposit payouts are needed.

D. Structural Reforms
14.
We continue to pursue a structural reform agenda aimed at improving the business
environment. We are implementing a government action plan comprising more than 50
measures to improve the business environment in 2012. Key milestones include approval of legal
changes to streamline customs operations and electronic systems for notary services and
construction permits. We expect to adopt a similar action plan for 2013 by end-December 2012.
We have also initiated full operation of the Regulatory Guillotine program, with preparation
in 2012 of comprehensive legislative packages to significantly streamline regulation and red-tape
in three areas—transportation, utilities, and healthcare—from a total of 17 areas. These will be
submitted to parliament by end-year (Structural benchmark—one area). Further guillotine
reforms areas will be initiated in the first half of 2013, possibly covering education and tax and
customs (New structural benchmark—one area, March 2013). Reform of inspection and safety
agencies is another key area, with a focus on merging and rationalizing functions, limiting
administrative influence, and risk-based approaches.
15.
The State Committee for the Protection of Economic Competition (SCPEC) has
continued to step up enforcement efforts against abuse of market dominance. Armenia’s
ranking in the 2013 World Economic Forum competitiveness index improved significantly owing
to improvements in competition policies and SCPEC actions. These actions have focused on the
fuel sector and pharmaceuticals. Further legal changes to strengthen the definition and
assessment of anticompetitive practices, increase fines, and introduce sanctions were returned by
the Cabinet and are now expected to be proposed to parliament by end-December rather than
end-October (Structural benchmark). In 2013, the SCPEC will focus on new actions within public
procurement, state aid, and agro-processing.
16.
We continue to explore options for Nairit that strictly minimize government
exposure and use of public funds. We are assessing a new feasibility study commissioned by a
potential investor from the region and covering the state of Nairit’s plant and equipment, the
market for its products, possible modernization plans (including environmental impacts), and
other options (including closure). We would only assume liabilities (including guarantees) in
consultation with the Fund and the World Bank, and we expect no participation in the company
in the future. In the event that we are unable to find a relevant private-party solution, we look
forward to IFI assistance in handling Nairit’s wide range of concerns (including workforce,
environmental clean-up, and safety issues).

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

E. Successor Program
17.
We intend to seek a successor arrangement with the IMF, after the current program
concludes in mid-2013. The new program would provide significant policy support to the
continuing external and fiscal adjustment throughout a period of elevated repayment of crisisrelated assistance. Key objectives would be to further establish policy buffers, especially strong
CBA reserves supported by a flexible exchange rate–as a result of an improved policy framework
and further development of the policy toolkit—and higher tax revenues to create fiscal space for
growth-enhancing and poverty reducing outlays, while helping further reduce the fiscal deficit
and public debt. Continued structural reforms would target sustained and accelerated growth by
supporting further financial sector development, business environment improvements, and
competitiveness.

F. Conclusion
18.
In support of its policies, we request that the IMF Executive Board complete the
Fifth Reviews of the EFF/ECF-supported program and approve the associated
disbursements. We also request that the Board grant a waiver of nonobservance of the PC on
NIR at end-June 2012 and modification of the end-December PCs on NIR of the CBA and of the
end-December indicative target on reserve money. Finally, we request that SDR 33.5 million be
made available upon completion of the reviews.
19.
We will maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund and stand ready to take
additional measures, as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of our social and economic
objectives under the EFF/ECF program. We will continue to consult with the Fund on the
adoption of measures, and in advance of revisions of the policies contained in the LOI, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We will also provide the Fund with
information it requests for monitoring program implementation. The program’s quantitative PCs
and ITs, as described in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding, and structural
benchmarks are set out in Tables 1 and 2. The Sixth Review is expected to be completed on or
after March 30, 2013.

ATTACHMENT I. UPDATED TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Armenian authorities and
the IMF staff regarding the definition of performance criteria and indicative targets, their
adjusters, and data reporting requirements for the three-year EFF/ECF Arrangement as per the
Letter of Intent dated November 20, 2012 (LOI).
2.
For program monitoring purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities, and
flows in the monetary accounts will be evaluated at program exchange rates. The program
exchange rate of the Armenian dram to the U.S. dollar is set at 385 dram per one U.S. dollar. The
cross-rates for other foreign currencies are provided in Table 1.
I.

Quantitative Targets

3.
The program sets performance criteria and indicative targets for defined test dates (see
Table 1 in the LOI). The program sets the following performance criteria:


Floor on the net official international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA);



Ceiling on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBA;



Ceiling on external public debt arrears (continuous); and



Floor on the program fiscal balance;

The program sets the following indicative targets:


Ceiling on reserve money;



Floor on average concessionality of new debt; and



Floor on social spending of the government.

4.
The net official international reserves (stock) of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) will
be calculated as the difference between total gross official international reserves (excluding
commercial bank required and excess reserves at CBA in FX) and gross official reserve liabilities.


60

Gross official international reserves are defined as the CBA’s holdings of monetary gold
(excluding amounts pledged as collateral), holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs),
including the August 28, 2009 General Allocation and the September 9, 2009 Special
Allocation, the country’s reserve position at the IMF, and holdings of convertible
currencies in cash or in nonresident financial institutions (deposits, securities, or other
financial instruments). Gross reserves held in the form of securities and other financial

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

instruments are marked to market. Excluded from gross reserves are the balance on the
government’s Special Privatization Account (SPA), capital subscriptions in foreign
financial institutions and illiquid foreign assets, any assets that are pledged, collateralized,
or otherwise encumbered, claims on residents, claims in foreign exchange arising from
derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options), precious metals other than gold, assets in nonconvertible currencies,
and illiquid assets.


Official reserve liabilities shall be defined as the total outstanding liabilities of the
government and the CBA to the IMF and convertible currency liabilities of the CBA to
nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year, as well as
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards,
swaps, and options).

NIR is monitored in U.S. dollars, and, for program monitoring purposes, assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted into dollar-equivalent values using the
exchange rates as specified in Table 1.
5.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency issued, required and excess reserves,
and current and time deposit accounts of certain resident agents. Liquidity absorbing
transactions under reverse repurchase agreements, foreign currency swaps, and securities issued
by the CBA are excluded from the reserve money definition. The ceiling will be considered as met
if the outcome is within AMD 5 billion of the indicative target sets in Table 1 attached to the LOI.
0F0F

6.
Net domestic assets are defined as reserve money minus NIR, minus other assets not
included in gross official international reserves, minus commercial bank required and excess
reserves at CBA in FX, plus medium and long-term foreign liabilities (i.e., liabilities with a maturity
of one year or more) of the CBA, plus other foreign liabilities not included in official reserve
liabilities, minus the balance of outstanding Fund purchases credited to the government account
at the CBA. NDA is composed of net CBA credit to the general government plus outstanding
credit to domestic banks by the CBA (including overdrafts) minus liabilities not included in
reserve money and other items net.
7.
External public debt arrears are defined as all unpaid debt-service obligations (i.e.,
payments of principal and interest) arising in respect of public sector loans contracted or
guaranteed, including unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these obligations that
are overdue beyond 30 days after the due date.1 The ceiling on external payment arrears is set at
zero.

1

The public sector is here defined following the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS 2001) and System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). It includes the general government and nonfinancial public enterprises (as defined
in paragraph 12).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

8.
The program fiscal balance is cumulative from the beginning of the fiscal year and is
measured from the financing side as the negative of the sum of net domestic banking system
credit to the central government, net domestic nonbank financing, and net external financing to
the central government. Should a general subsidy or any other fiscal transaction be introduced
off-budget, the overall balance will be measured including the subsidy and other fiscal
transactions as part of government spending


Net banking system credit to the central government equals the change during the
period of net credit to the central government.



Net nonbank financing equals the sum of: (1) the change during the period of
outstanding treasury bills and bonds to nonbanks (including accrued interest for treasury
bills and excluding accrued interest for treasury bonds); 2 (2) any other disbursement or
transaction that increases nonbanks’ claims on the central government plus withdrawals
from the special privatization account or the treasury sub-account containing
privatization proceeds in drams, less amortization paid by the central government to
private resident nonbank agents.
2F2F



Net external financing equals total debt-increasing disbursements from non-residents
to the central government (including Fund net purchases credited directly to the
government accounts at the CBA) less total amortization from the central government to
non-residents. All foreign currency-denominated transactions are recorded in drams
using the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

9.
External and domestic net lending, which are recorded as financing items, are excluded
from the calculation of the program fiscal balance. This effectively treats net lending as an
expenditure item when loans are made and as a revenue item when the loans are repaid.
10.
Some project implementation units maintain accounts at the CBA. Grants received by
these units are recorded in the fiscal accounts as external grants on the revenue side and as
foreign-financed expenditure on the expenditure side. In addition, any loans to finance
investments that are intermediated through the banking system are recorded in the financial
accounts as a financing item below the line and are thus excluded from net lending. Under
previous Technical Memoranda of Understanding, these activities were excluded from the
calculation of the program fiscal balance. This treatment reflected lags in receiving information
from project implementation units and on project loans intermediated through the banking
system. With the shift to semi-annual program reviews with the EFF/ECF arrangement and
consolidation of the accounts of these units in the Treasury, there is no longer a need for such
exclusion, and these activities are now fully accounted for in the program fiscal balance.
2

Domestic nonbank holdings of treasury bills and treasury bonds are defined as total outstanding treasury bills
and bonds less holdings by the banking system and the State Fund for Social Insurance.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

11.
Foreign currency proceeds from selling enterprises are deposited into the Special
Privatization Account (SPA). The SPA is held at the CBA and the proceeds are invested abroad
together with the CBA’s international reserves. These proceeds are included in the definition of
the monetary accounts of the CBA as part of net foreign assets with a counter entry in other
items net. Any budgeted withdrawal from the SPA will be accounted for as privatization proceeds
used to finance the budget and will be recorded below the line. Any unanticipated withdrawal
from the SPA will be recorded below the line as privatization receipts; these withdrawals,
however, will be replenished during the same fiscal year. Domestic currency proceeds from
selling enterprises to residents are deposited in a sub-account of the treasury single account and
are also treated as a financing item and recorded below the line.
12.
The program sets an annual indicative floor of 30 percent on average concessionality of
new debt on a contraction basis on debt with nonresidents with original maturities of one year or
more contracted and guaranteed by the public sector.


The grant element is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its
nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of
debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates used for this purpose
for 2011 onwards are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by OECD. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average
CIRR is used to calculate the PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a
maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR is used. The margins for
differing repayment periods (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years,
1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years
or more) are added to the ten-year and six-month CIRR averages.



The public sector here comprises the general government, the central bank, and
nonfinancial public enterprises (enterprises and agencies in which the government holds
a controlling stake—typically owns more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not
consolidated in the budget).



For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of
the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving
payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the
public sector to finance partially or in full any shortfall incurred by the debtor.

13.
The program sets a floor on social spending of the government. For the purposes of
the program, social spending of the government is defined as 100 percent of the budgeted
amount of the family benefit program and lump-sum financial aid.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

II.

Adjustors

14.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the program are
subject to the following adjusters, calculated, where relevant, using program exchange rates:

64



Changes in reserve requirements: The ceiling on the NDA of the CBA and the ceiling on
reserve money will be adjusted downward (upward) by the amount of banks’ reserves
freed (seized) by any reduction (increase) of the reserve requirement ratio on both
domestic currency and foreign currency liabilities relative to the baseline assumption as
per the following formula: ∆NDA = ∆rB, where B denotes the level of liabilities subject to
reserve requirements in the initial definition and ∆r is the change in the reserve
requirement ratio.



KfW and World Bank loan disbursements: the ceiling on the NDA of the CBA will be
adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount of any excess (shortfall) of
disbursements from the KfW and World Bank loans directed at SME financing compared
to programmed amounts (Table 2). The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward)
by the cumulative amount of any excess (shortfall) of these disbursements compared to
program amounts.



Budget support grants to the public sector are defined as grants received by the
general government for direct budget support from external donors and not related to
project financing.



Budget support loans to the public sector are defined as disbursements of loans from
bilateral and multilateral donors for budget support and Fund purchases credited directly
to the government accounts at the CBA.



Project financing to the public sector is defined as disbursements of loans from
bilateral and multilateral donors for public sector projects.



The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative amount of any
excess (shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants (excluding Fund
disbursements to the government) compared to program amounts (Table 3). The floor on
NIR will be adjusted downward for any external public debt amortization amounts in
excess of program amounts. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upwards by the amount of
any funds received in respect of deposits held at the Inter State Bank.



The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative amount of
any excess (shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants compared to
program amounts (Table 3).



The floor on the program fiscal balance on a cash basis will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the cumulative total amount of the budget support grants received in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

excess (to account for a shortfall) of the program amounts (Table 3), subject to a cap of
$50 million in either direction. The floor on the program fiscal balance on a cash basis will
also be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative total amount of the project
financing received in excess (to account for a shortfall) of the program amounts (Table 3),
subject to a cap of $100 million in either direction.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, an update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of
Armenia (CBA) was completed in November 2010 with respect to the current EFF/ECF Arrangements. A
safeguards monitoring visit to the CBA was completed in September 2012. The visit made
recommendations to strengthen: (i) controls over management of foreign reserves and; (ii) CBA oversight
arrangements.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure arrangement is “free floating.” The de facto arrangement was reclassified to “floating” from a
“stabilized arrangement” effective March 3, 2009. The official exchange rate is quoted daily as a weighted
average of the buying and selling rates in the foreign exchange market.
Armenia maintains no multiple currency practices or exchange restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultations
The 2010 Article IV consultation with Armenia was concluded on December 1, 2010. Armenia is subject to a
24-month consultation cycle.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs
A joint World Bank-IMF mission assessed Armenia’s financial sector as part of a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update during February 1–14, 2012. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment
(FSSA) report was approved by the Executive Board in June 2012. The most recent previous FSAP update
took place in 2005.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(AS OF OCTOBER 18, 2012)
1.
As of September 30, 2012, the EBRD had approved 109 projects in the power, transport,
agribusiness, municipal and infrastructure, manufacturing and services, property,
telecommunications, and financial sectors. Total commitments amounted to around
EUR 562.3 million. During January-September 2012, the EBRD signed 8 projects with a total volume
of EUR 43.0 million.
2.
There are five sovereign projects. First, the EBRD approved a sovereign guaranteed loan of
EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal power plant in March 1993. The
government was contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5 as the completion of this plant
was constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had funded TA for the Hrazdan
privatization prospectus and followed the privatization process. Second, in November 1994, the
agreement on a EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in Zvartnots airport was signed
under a guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport was transferred to private
management in 2002 (according to a concession agreement). The new management prepared a
master plan for the development of the airport, which is expected to generate further cargo traffic
for the cargo terminal. In April 2007, the EBRD approved a EUR 7 million loan to the State
Committee for Water Systems, owner of the water and wastewater assets located in the small
municipalities outside of Yerevan. The proceeds of this loan have been used to improve wastewater
treatment in five municipalities located near Lake Sevan. In March 2010, EBRD signed a first EUR 5.0
million sovereign loan with Yerevan Metro Company. This project is providing emergency
investments in the Yerevan Metro, covering immediate rehabilitation needs including safety
upgrades and energy efficiency. The investment is part of a plan to improve and reform public
transport services in the capital of Armenia. In August 2012, EBRD signed its second EUR 5.0 million
sovereign loan with Yerevan Metro to primarily address issues related to water ingress into the
tunnels.
3.
Most of the Bank’s projects (93 percent) in Armenia are in the private sector. In addition to
the loan to Electric Networks of Armenia (see section 5 below), the Bank approved an additional
loan to Zvartnots International Airport in the amount of EUR 29.6 million (supplemented by
investments from ADB and DEG). This project followed on from the successful completion, in May
2007, of the first phase of the Passenger Terminal, for which the Bank provided a EUR 14.8 million
loan together with DEG (USD 10 million). This project involved the construction and purchase of
equipment for the second phase of the Passenger Terminal complex at Zvartnots International
Airport and facilitated the completion of Airport Terminal development reallocating all operations
(arrivals and departures) from the old Airport building. The loan was a commercial facility with no

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

sovereign support. Other private sector finance includes relatively smaller loans to private
companies and equity participation in a number of companies in various sectors of the industry.
In the first three quarters of 2012 the Bank committed EUR 43 million to Armenia through 8
transactions, including 5 projects in the financial institutions sector, 1 in equity funds, 1 sovereign
project with Yerevan Metro Company, and 1 in natural resources sector. In early 2012, EBRD
together with other international financial institutions supported the creation of the Caucasus
Growth Fund. This fund will be managed by the Small Enterprise Assistance Funds (SEAF), a global
fund manager, and will be the first institutional quality fund to provide debt and equity to SMEs in
the Caucasus region.
4.
In the banking sector, a first equity participation in the Commercial Bank of Greece-Armenia
(EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999. Now there are four local banks where EBRD participates
in equity: Armeconombank, Byblos Bank Armenia, Ararat Bank and Procredit Bank.
The Armenia Multi-Bank Framework Facility II (AMBFF II), established to provide loans and equity to
commercial banks and leasing companies in Armenia, was approved by the EBRD Board in March
2006 for an amount of $40 million, and then extended for another $80 million in November 2007. In
late 2009, the EBRD has approved a further $100 million extension to AMBFF II in order to support
increased financial intermediation and the development of the financial sector in Armenia and to
contribute to economic development by providing medium to long-term funding to selected
Armenian financial intermediaries. Another extension to this Facility of $100 million was approved in
mid-2011. The Facility will seek to develop new products for financial institutions, including
provision of local currency loans, agricultural credit lines and mortgage financing. Additional TA will
be provided to partner banks.
The EBRD expanded its relationship with partner banks in Armenia from four to twelve (taking into
account that two EBRD clients – Ameria Bank and Cascade Bank merged in 2010). Nine banks were
provided with new credit facilities under the AMBFF. One institution (Armeconombank) was
provided with a mortgage facility, and the first leasing facility in Armenia was signed with ACBA
Leasing in 2008 for EUR 5.9 million. A co-financing facility with six local banks was also extended
resulting in 14 sub-loans to Armenian corporates. By means of co-financing lines, the Bank has
entered such new sectors as healthcare and telecoms, in addition to significantly expanding its
portfolio of agribusiness loans. A Trade Facilitation Program with the purpose of facilitating access
of Armenian banks to trade financing was also made available to nine Armenian banks.
As of end September 2012, the EBRD has disbursed about EUR 50 million equivalent in local
currency financing to Armenian commercial banks and microfinancing institutions. The Currency
Exchange (TCX) provides the Armenian dram hedge to the EBRD. In parallel, the EBRD and IMF are
assisting the government and the CBA to implement reforms aiming to facilitate financing in dram,
reduce the level of dollarization, and foster the development of local capital markets.

5.
Supporting development of renewable energy is another core activity of the Bank. To that
end, the EBRD joined forces with the WB, USAID, and Cascade Credit (a financing arm of Cafesdjian
Foundation) to launch the Armenian Renewable Energy Programme (AREP). The Bank’s participation
took the form of a loan to Cascade Credit. The Bank also continued to finance renewable energy
projects on its own through a Direct Lending Facility, with two such projects signed. In addition to
renewable energy, the Bank returned to the mainstream segment of the sector, seeking to support
post-privatization development with a loan to the Armenian privately-owned power distribution
company. In April 2009, the EBRD signed a EUR 42 million loan with Electric Networks of Armenia
to upgrade and modernize obsolete low-voltage infrastructure and improve energy efficiency.
6.
The EBRD launched the Enterprise Growth Programme (EGP) and Business Advisory Service
programs in Armenia in 2003 to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Since 2003,
BAS has completed 916 projects in the amount of EUR 5.9 million, as well as 45 Market
Development Activity (MDA) projects. EGP has delivered more than 25 projects. Among the donors
are Canada, Taipei China, the United Kingdom, the EU, EU - Eastern Partnership Multi-Beneficiary
Technical Assistance, the United States, the Early Transition Countries Fund (ETCF), the EBRD, EBRD
Shareholder Special Fund (ESSF).
7.
The Bank has launched a USD 25 million program to finance projects for industrial energy
efficiency and renewable energy through local banks. In October 2010, the first USD 3.0 million,
energy efficiency credit line was signed with Anelik Bank. TA has been put in place financed by the
Government of Austria. The Bank has also launched a TA program to review and amend the legal,
regulatory, institutional, operational and technical frameworks for energy efficiency in the residential
sector. At a later stage, the EBRD will offer financing and capacity building to a selected number of
commercial banks to support investments in this sector. The residential sector in Armenia is a large
energy consumer with significant potential for energy savings and carbon emission reductions.
8.
As part of inspection reform and doing business programs, the EBRD is assisting the
government improve the business environment. The EBRD is actively promoting and supporting the
preparation of a corporate governance code in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy, the
Central Bank, the Stock Exchange and the IFC. The Bank is also providing assistance to the Public
Services Regulatory Commission for telecommunications sector regulation. This assistance is being
financed by the Government of Finland.
9.
The EBRD’s current country strategy was approved in May 2012. The key priorities of the
EBRD for the coming three years are: (i) developing the financial sector and improving access to
finance; (ii) improving municipal and urban transport infrastructure; (iii) developing agribusiness and
high value-added, export-oriented industrial companies; and (iv) improving the regulatory and
institutional framework for sustainable energy and increasing value added in the mining sector.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ASDB)
(AS OF OCTOBER 18, 2012)
1.
The AsDB’s economic report and the interim operational strategy for 2006−09 for Armenia
were approved in 2006. The country operational business plan (COBP) for 2012−13 was endorsed by
AsDB’s Board of Governors in November 2011, and an update of the COBP for 2012−13 is expected
to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2012. A new COBP is pending completion of the AsDB's new
Country Partnership Strategy for Armenia, expected to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2013.
The indicative focus areas of the updated COBP are (i) regional cooperation, (ii) private sector
development, and (iii) infrastructure.
2.
As of October 15, 2012, the AsDB had approved loans for eight projects in the transport,
municipal infrastructure, finance, and general budget support sectors. Total commitments amounted
to $482.6 million for sovereign and $108.0 million for non-sovereign loans. One non-sovereign loan
was provided to Armenia International Airports for the Zvartnots Airport Expansion Project (Phase 2).
The loan financed the construction of a new terminal building and purchase of equipment to
supplement the existing concourse building. In November 2012, AsDB approved a non-sovereign
lending program totaling $65 million for four commercial banks to expand lending to small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
3.
The first AsDB sovereign loan ($30.6 million), approved in November 2007, financed
rehabilitation of 220 km of rural roads. The second loan ($36 million), approved in December 2007,
financed repair and replacement of water supply infrastructure in small towns and villages; in April,
2012, AsDB approved additional financing of $40 million to continue the project. The third was a
supplementary loan ($17.3 million) to the rural roads project, approved in November 2008, to
finance an increase in project cost from higher construction materials prices, domestic inflation, and
appreciation of the dram. The fourth was a crisis recovery support program loan ($80 million),
approved in July 2009, to protect budgetary social expenditures. The next two loans were Tranches 1
($60 million) and 2 ($170 million) of the North-South Road Corridor investment program, approved
in October 2009 and December 2010, respectively. Tranche 1 is financing rehabilitation of 18.4 km of
the four-lane Yerevan-Ashtarak highway and safety enhancement of a four-lane road between
Yerevan and Ararat. Tranche 2 is financing an upgrading of the Ashtarak-Talin road section from two
lanes to four lanes. The final loan was the first tranche ($48.6 million) of the Sustainable Urban
Development Investment Program approved in April 2011. The loan finances construction of two
missing road links of the Yerevan inner bypass and strengthening of institutional and management
capacity of the Yerevan municipality and urban transport service providers.
4.
With the exception of the North-South Road Corridor Tranche 2 investment program loan,
all approved sovereign loans are from the AsDB's concessional window under the Asian
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Development Fund (AsDF). The Tranche 2 loan for the North-South road is from the AsDB’s nonconcessional window under ordinary capital resources (OCR).
5.
Two additional sovereign loans are expected to be approved by the AsDF's Board in 2012: (i)
the Women's Entrepreneurship Support Sector Development Program (total of $40 million ADF), to
support business development services for women, capacity development, and policy reforms
through a program loan to the government ($20 million), and to finance the expansion of SME
lending to women's businesses by commercial banks in a program administered by the German
Armenian Fund of the CBA ($20 million); and (ii) Tranche 3 of the North–South Road Corridor
Investment Program, to finance continuing construction of the road to Gyumri (amount of financing
still to be determined).
6.
In 2011, AsDB signed trade finance agreements under AsDB’s Trade Finance Program with
six banks in Armenia, a move that is expected to further bolster the country's trade sector and help
ensure sustainable economic growth.
7.
In addition to financing projects and programs, the AsDB is also involved in advisory services
and capacity development. The AsDB provided TA to develop Armenia's Transport Outlook, a
transport-sector master plan for 2011−2020; and to assist the government in introducing an online
business registry system. Armenia is also included in a number of AsDB's multi-country TA projects,
providing assessments and development plans in topics of common interest across countries.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 24, 2012)
Background
1.
Data provision by Armenia has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. In
November 2003, Armenia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and the
overall quality, timeliness, and coverage of macroeconomic statistics have improved significantly
over the past few years. The Fund has supported this process through TA from the Statistics
Department (STA), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), and the Monetary and Capital Markets
Department (MCM). An April 2008 data ROSC mission prepared a detailed evaluation of the quality
of macroeconomic statistics. A multi-topic statistics mission visited Yerevan in February 2010 to
review progress with implementation of past recommendations and follow up on outstanding issues
in national accounts, balance of payments, and monetary and financial statistics. A follow up STA
mission in September 2010 provided further guidance, focusing on improving the accuracy of
annual and quarterly GDP estimates. Further improvements in real, fiscal, and external sector
statistics would be desirable to facilitate enhanced design and monitoring of economic policies.
Real sector statistics
2.
The National Statistics Service (NSS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly
national accounts. The NSS also compiles and disseminates annually a full set of accounts (up to
financial accounts) for the total economy and by institutional sectors. The NSS is developing a plan
for implementing the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA).
3.
The accuracy of the annual estimates of the national accounts is undermined by the lack of
exhaustive source data for informal activities and of appropriate price and volume indicators,
particularly for construction activities. Construction output volume measures are derived by
deflating current values with a price index for output, which uses weights and base year prices from
a survey in 1984. To improve volume measures of construction, the NSS has started compiling a new
construction output price index based on more sound methodology. Until the new construction
price index becomes available, the NSS should use other indicators for deriving construction
aggregates at constant prices. The NSS should also implement new surveys to derive a proper
benchmark for informal activities.
4.
The production-side estimates at current prices are derived partially from cumulative source
data (from business statistics surveys) and partially from discrete data sources. The NSS validates
and reconciles data from different sources, but underlying problems associated with de-cumulating
the cumulative output data distort the quarterly pattern. The NSS is currently working to produce
GDP data at current and at constant prices to be fully in accordance with the SNA. The NSS received
IMF TA on estimating quarterly GDP from discrete data sources only and is using statistical

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

techniques that conform to international standards. Recent publications of the NSS have reflected
this effort. The NSS has discontinued compiling GDP volume measures at the prices of the
corresponding quarter of the previous year. The compilation procedures now use only average
prices of 2005. The NSS also adopted the recommendation of the IMF STA mission to compile only
one set of quarterly GDP estimates—quarterly GDP at previous-year average prices—and derive
time series through chain-linking. These estimates would be conceptually consistent with the annual
data. They would also allow comparisons between different periods, which are essential for analysis
of the business cycle. As of January 2011, the NSS also started compiling a monthly indicator of
economic activity (IEA), following international best practices. The monthly GDP compilation was
discontinued. The monthly IEA is an implicit volume index compiled by aggregation of monthly
volume indices of output using gross output weights. The CPI covers 11 large population centers
and Yerevan. Since January 2011, the CPI has been computed using 2010 weights. Concepts and
definitions used in the compilation of the CPI are broadly in line with international standards; source
data and compilation techniques are generally adequate. The NSS compiles a ten-day and a
monthly CPI. The ten-day index and the monthly index are disseminated jointly. A February data
2009 ROSC mission recommended development of an approach to include household expenditure
on owner-occupied dwellings in the CPI calculations.
Government finance statistics
5.
The budget execution reporting system compiles government finance data on a cash basis,
supplemented with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and payables.
Daily revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government are available with a lag of one
to two days and monthly data on central government operations are disseminated one month after
the reporting period. The ministry of finance (MoF) is undertaking a comprehensive reform of the
treasury system, including the introduction of an internal auditing system in line ministries and their
respective budgetary institutions. A treasury single account (TSA) was introduced in 1996, and all
bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were closed, except for project implementation units
(PIU) that are required by donors to operate with commercial bank accounts. These PIU accounts are
being moved gradually to the CBA. Starting in 2002, some budgetary institutions have been
converted into “noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units have been taken out of the
treasury system and have their own bank accounts, but since 2003 report data on cash flows and
balances to the MoF. The February 2009 ROSC report recommended including NCOs in the
government finance statistics data published on national websites. These exceptions
notwithstanding, all government receipts and payments are processed through the TSA, although
there are still shortcomings on the timeliness and quality of data on the operations of local
governments.
6.
The budget presentation and the classification of items under the economic and functional
classification of expenditures need to be made more transparent; for instance, the data have been
subject to frequent reclassification, and wages for military personnel are reported in the category of
“other” goods and services rather than as a wage item. The February 2009 ROSC report

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

recommended using market value rather than face value for financial assets other than loans, and
for nonfinancial assets. The reconciliation of central government with general government
operations is done by the NSS in cooperation with the MoF.
7.
Since 2008, government finance statistics meet the classification requirements of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for the central government.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are provided on a timely basis. Data on the accounts of the
CBA are provided daily with a one-day lag, while monthly data on the monetary survey are provided
with a three-week lag (and preliminary weekly data with a one-week lag). The balance sheets of the
CBA and of the deposit money banks follow IAS methodology. Monthly interest rate data are
provided with a one-week lag.
9.
Responding to an IMF STA request, the CBA has compiled and submitted a complete set of
monetary data beginning from December 2001 using standardized report forms (SRF). STA validated
the resulting monetary aggregates, and the data have been published since the December 2006
issue of IFS Supplement and are used to update IFS. An integrated monetary database has also been
established by STA to share the SRF data with the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department.
The CBA also produces the financial soundness indicator table every month, published on both the
IMF and CBA websites.
External sector statistics
10.
In 2009, the Armenian authorities decided to transfer the responsibility for compiling the
balance of payments, international investment position (IIP), and external debt statistics from the
NSS to the CBA. The February 2010 STA mission provided advice on an action plan aimed at
ensuring a smooth institutional transfer of responsibility, as well as consistency and continuity in the
production of the external sector statistics. The responsibilities of compiling external sector statistics
were de facto transferred to the CBA in January 2011, and since then, the CBA has compiled balance
of payments, external debt, and IIP data for 2011. The transfer of responsibilities was smooth and
during the short period after the transfer, the CBA undertook a number of important actions aimed
at improving the compilation system. A follow up IMF STA mission in October 2011 undertook a
comprehensive assessment of the institutional arrangements, data sources, methodology, and
compilation practices for external sector statistics employed by the CBA, and advised on areas for
improvement including further developing data sources and compilation practices.
11.
The coverage of external sector data has improved in recent years. Trade statistics are
provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin, destination, and commodity are generally
available within a month. Price data for exports and imports are less readily available. Quarterly
balance of payments statistics are generally available with a three-month lag. However, for
remittances, there are considerable discrepancies among available source data. Remittance data

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

obtained from surveys are considerably lower than data obtained through the money transfer
system. The absence of a comprehensive, continuously updated business register hampers the
coverage of transactions and institutional units; in particular, the coverage of the financial account
items for the private nonbank sector. There are also concerns with regard to the collection of data
on international trade in services, specifically on import of services. The CBA is currently considering
the implementation of an international transactions reporting system that would allow for collecting
data on all cross-border payments and receipts going through the banking system.
12.
Quarterly data on the international investment position are published by the CBA within one
quarter after the reference period, and the annual data within two quarters; and are also provided
for publication in IFS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under EFF/ECF Arrangement for
Armenia and Approves US$51.4 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed its fifth
review of Armenia’s economic performance under a program supported by Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) and Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangements. The completion of the
review enables the authorities to draw an additional SDR 33.5 million (about US$51.43
million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangements to SDR 211.8 million (about
US$324.4 million). The three-year SDR 266.8 million (about US$408.7 million) EFF and
ECF arrangements with Armenia were approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on June 28,
2010 (see Press Release No. 10/263).
The Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance of
the end-June 2012 performance criterion on the floor on net official international reserves,
which was missed due to unexpected market pressures, and the modification of this same
performance criterion for the end-December 2012.
The Executive Board also concluded today the 2012 Article IV Consultations with Armenia,
which discusses economic policies from a medium-term perspective, and considered an Ex
Post Assessment Update report on Fund relations with Armenia.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“Armenia’s economy has continued to recover from the deep recession experienced in 200809 in the context of the global financial crisis. Growth accelerated in 2012, and is expected to
be around potential in 2013. Nonetheless, vulnerabilities remain, particularly due to the large
current account deficit and high degree of dollarization in the banking sector.
“Policies under the program remain broadly on track, but net international reserves came
under unexpected pressures in May-June when the central bank acted to avoid a
destabilization of the market. Since then, the central bank has been able to buy back part of

2

the lost reserves. However, full recovery of reserves would have involved undue pressures on
the market.
“Fiscal consolidation has continued to play a key role in the stabilization of the economy, and
the authorities’ commitment to continue with that fiscal strategy is welcome. Going forward,
fiscal consolidation should rely more on increasing revenues to allow for higher social and
investment spending while reducing the deficit and debt.
“The financial sector remains sound, and steps have been taken recently to enhance
supervision and the liquidity of the system. For the business environment more generally,
structural reforms have continued, but further measures are needed to strengthen the legal
framework, improve governance, and enhance competitiveness.”

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Armenia
On December 7, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Armenia. 1 The Board also discussed an Ex Post
Assessment of Armenia’s long-term involvement with Fund-supported programs. 2 On the same
day, the Board also completed the fifth review of Armenia’s economic performance under
program supported by Extended Fund Facility and Extended Credit Facility arrangements
(see Press Release No. 12/478).
Background
The recovery of the Armenian economy has continued for a third consecutive year. After a
major decline in activity in 2009 in the context of the global financial crisis, growth resumed
in 2010 and 2011, although at a moderate pace. In 2012, growth is projected to accelerate to
over 6 percent, led by agriculture, agro-processing, mining, and services. Construction, a key
pre-crisis growth driver is finally stabilizing. Inflation remained subdued in 2012, reflecting sound
macroeconomic policies and low agricultural prices, and is expected to average about
4 percent, within the authorities’ target range (4 ± 1.5 percent).
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
2

An EPA is required for all members having longer-term program engagement with the Fund. EPAs
are intended to provide an opportunity to step back from continuing program relations to consider an
analysis of the economic problems facing the country, review progress under Fund-supported
programs, and draw forward-looking lessons for future Fund engagement.

2

Fiscal consolidation has continued, and in 2012, the headline budget deficit is expected to reach
2.1 percent of GDP, lower than the previous years’ outturn. The external adjustment has also
proceeded, but at a gradual pace—with the current account deficit projected to remain slightly
below 10½ percent of GDP in 2012. The financing of the current account deficit has continued
to come mainly from foreign direct investment, government external borrowing, and bank flows.
Foreign exchange inflows in the first several months of 2012 had been somewhat weaker than
expected, contributing to a decline in international reserves of the Central Bank of Armenia
(CBA). However, reserves have recovered and are expected to close the year at over 3½
months of imports.
The banking sector remains robust, with the capital adequacy ratio of the system as a whole
reaching almost 17 percent, and no bank below the required 12 percent. At about 4 percent of
gross loans, nonperforming loans of the banking system continue to be low. Dollarization of
both deposits and credit remains high, constituting a source of banking system vulnerability;
measures under the Fund-supported program aim to reduce dollarization. Credit to the private
sector has been strong, especially in foreign currency. In spite of rapid credit growth in 2012
and in previous years, the ratio of credit to GDP in Armenia remains relatively low compared to
more advanced economies.
The authorities’ policies remain geared towards maintaining macroeconomic stability and
fostering sustainable and inclusive economic growth. The CBA continues to conduct monetary
policy under an inflation targeting framework accompanied by exchange rate flexibility and to
implement policies aimed at maintaining and strengthening financial sector stability. Fiscal
policy remains focused on keeping the deficit and debt at manageable levels, while augmenting
growth-enhancing expenditures and strengthening social protection. In addition, the authorities
are pursuing an agenda of structural reforms to improve the business environment in Armenia.
An Ex Post Assessment Update (EPA) was conducted to review Armenia’s economic
performance during its long-term involvement with the Fund. The report covered the country’s
performance during 2005–12 under four Fund-supported programs: a 2005–08 Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility, a 2008–09 PRGF, a 2009–10 Stand-By Arrangement, and the
current Extended Fund Facility and Extended Credit Facility arrangements approved in 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for implementing economic and financial
policies which have contributed to a sustained recovery. Growth has accelerated, inflation has
remained subdued, the fiscal deficit has declined, and credit growth has been robust. Directors
called for continued commitment to sound macroeconomic policies and ambitious structural

3
reforms to address remaining vulnerabilities, ensure medium-term macroeconomic stability, and
foster sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors recognized the role that fiscal consolidation has played in curbing the rise in debt and
reducing the large current account deficit. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
continued consolidation, but underscored the importance of relying on stronger revenue raising
measures to create space for higher social and investment spending. Continued improvements
in tax policy and administration should be key priorities going forward.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate as it has kept inflation
under control and anchored expectations. They encouraged further strengthening the monetary
policy framework, including enhancing communications and developing term money-market
instruments to enhance the transmission mechanism. Directors stressed the importance of
allowing greater exchange rate flexibility to help narrow the current account deficit, increase
resilience to shocks, and ensure a comfortable level of reserves.
Directors noted that the banking system is robust and welcomed the recent financial regulations
aimed at strengthening the soundness and supervisory framework of the banking system. They
encouraged further efforts to reduce high dollarization, including expanding the differential
between reserve requirements for foreign exchange and dram liabilities.
Directors welcomed the advances in the structural reform agenda but underscored that further
measures are needed to improve governance and the business environment, enhance
competitiveness, and foster export diversification. Full implementation of the regulatory
guillotine program will be important to reduce red tape in key areas. Directors also cautioned
against large-scale public involvement in Nairit.
Directors broadly agreed with the findings of the ex post assessment. While Fund programs
have helped Armenia maintain macroeconomic stability and respond to shocks, results in the
areas of tax revenues, exchange rate policy, and structural reforms have been mixed. Directors
generally welcomed the authorities’ interest in a successor arrangement, stressing that a
stronger commitment in these areas should be at the core of any future program.

Statement by Mr. Snel, Executive Director for Armenia and
Mr. Hadzi-Vaskov, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 7, 2012

The Armenian authorities would like to thank Executive Directors, Management, and staff for
their continued support, valuable advice, and constructive discussions. The authorities also
highly appreciate the thorough analysis of the Armenian economy presented in the staff
reports.
The authorities’ economic program, supported by the Extended Fund and Extended Credit
Facilities (EFF/ECF), remains broadly on track. All but one performance criteria (PCs) and most
indicative targets (ITs) were met, while all structural benchmarks were observed or are on
track with possible brief delays. The end-June PC on net international reserves (NIR) was
missed due to unexpected pressures on the foreign exchange market in May and June,
largely reflecting external uncertainties. Notwithstanding persistent pressures over the
summer, the authorities have managed to rebuild a significant part of the reserves. Based on
the commitment to rebuild buffers and carry on corrective actions that include strictly limited
foreign exchange sales and the restriction of interventions to smoothing unusually large
movements, the authorities are requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the end-June PC on
NIR. They also request a modification of the end-December NIR target and a downward
revision of the end-December IT on reserve money in line with the reduction in the NIR
target.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
Supported by a set of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, economic growth has
accelerated to 9.2 percent yoy in Q3 of 2012, against a backdrop of strong performance in
agriculture, agro-processing, mining, and services. Inflation remained subdued, reaching 3.6
percent in November 2012, amid low agricultural prices and supportive policies. Reflecting
the authorities’ firm commitment to prudent policies, the financial sector remained robust
and well-capitalized, while the fiscal consolidation has been stronger than expected. While
prices of metals decreased, export volumes continued to grow, contributing to a
consolidation of the external current account, albeit at a somewhat slower-than-expected
pace. While significant adverse spillovers from the external downturn have not materialized,
certain financing flows, particularly FDI and bank inflows, have weakened further.
A further deterioration in the global environment presents a major downside risk for 2013.
Recognizing weaker global prospects, the authorities expect growth to moderate and
inflation to remain within the target range (4 +/- 1.5 percent) of the Central Bank of Armenia
(CBA). Over the medium term, the authorities expect growth to be higher than staff’s
projections, supported by the implementation of structural reforms, aimed at improving the
business environment, diversifying exports, and enhancing competitiveness.

2
Fiscal policy
Anchored in strict fiscal management, tight expenditure control and efficiency gains, the
authorities expect the fiscal deficit in 2012 to be about 2 percent of GDP, 1 percentage point
of GDP better than budgeted, and almost 6 percentage points below the 2009 fiscal deficit.
Tax revenues are expected to achieve the envisioned increase of 0.6 percent of GDP in line
with the authorities’ target, while expenditures are expected to be lower by about 1
percentage point of GDP, mainly due to delays in the implementation of a few large capital
projects. Ensuring debt sustainability in line with their medium-term framework, which aims
at reaching a debt stabilizing level by 2015, remains the authorities’ firm goal.
The target for the 2013 headline budget deficit is 2.6 percent of GDP, which encompasses an
additional increase in tax revenues of 0.9 percent of GDP. In light of weaker performance
compared to regional peers, the authorities are firmly committed to continue increasing tax
revenues through tax policy reforms as well as continued improvement of the revenue
administration. Envisaged tax policy reforms include legislative proposals to adopt OECD
guidelines for transfer pricing regulation, removal of personal income tax exemptions for all
occupations, scheduled increases in tobacco taxes, and the start of collection of the new
mining royalties. The main tax administration efforts, which include the launch of an
electronic system for individual accounting and recording under the new unified personal
income tax, will be supported by World Bank financing and USAID technical assistance on
strategic planning, revenue analysis, internal control processes, and IT infrastructure.
On the expenditure side, the authorities plan to expand growth-stimulating expenditures,
while further strengthening social protection. Following delays in 2011-2012, they have
launched the major North-South highway project and plan to accelerate the implementation
of additional infrastructure projects. Besides making progress with their efforts to integrate a
wide range of social services, and improve efficiency and service quality, the authorities have
started reversing the erosion of education spending.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Maintaining price stability remains the CBA’s main objective. The policy rate has been kept at
8 percent since September 2011, while inflation stayed close to 4 percent, the midpoint of
the target range. The monetary authorities do not envisage any interest rate policy action in
light of expectations of an only gradually closing output gap and inflation likely staying
within the target range over the policy-relevant horizon. However, they remain vigilant and
stand ready to adjust policies if needed. While recognizing the instrumental role of the
stability of the dram in anchoring expectations, the authorities remain committed to a
flexible exchange rate policy, and envisage limiting foreign exchange interventions to
smoothing excessive volatility. The authorities take note of staff’s assessment on the
exchange rate, and consider that medium-term structural measures will play a key role in
supporting the external adjustment.

3

Ongoing efforts to enhance the monetary policy framework are being guided by findings
from the FSAP and key recommendations from Fund TA. These include: expanding the
current survey of private forecasters by requiring banks to regularly submit macroeconomic
forecasts to the CBA; devising a communication strategy on the objectives and operations of
the monetary policy framework; and continued strengthening of monetary operations to
increase the relevance of the policy rate and enhance the policy transmission mechanism. In
particular, their efforts focus on enhancing communication with market participants on
liquidity conditions and reducing the volatility of interbank rates by narrowing the width of
the interest rate corridor. The authorities also support efforts by NASDAQ-OMX Armenia to
develop a trading platform for term money market instruments.
Financial sector
The banking system remains robust, with a capital adequacy ratio close to 17 percent,
nonperforming loans (NPLs) at about 4 percent of total loans, and liquid assets at about 120
percent of short-term liabilities. In light of the rapid credit growth (24 percent yoy), especially
in foreign currency, the authorities continued to strengthen the stability of the banking
system in line with recent FSAP recommendations. First, the CBA introduced a new prudential
norm for foreign currency liquidity ratios, which will become effective in January 2013 and
will gradually increase thereafter. Second, the CBA issued a regulation requiring banks to
report to the CBA information on potential currency mismatches of large borrowers. Third,
the authorities will continue to improve the sound regulatory and supervisory framework
through efforts to integrate the use of Basel II Pillar II powers in the supervisory toolkit to
assess and mitigate individual, institution-specific risks, amend and issue new regulation that
requires banks to immediately report changes with a material adverse impact, and review the
calculation practice of large exposures. Given the continued strong growth in foreign
currency deposits and lending, the authorities are assessing possible policy actions, including
expanding the differential between reserve requirements for foreign exchange and dram
liabilities. Finally, the authorities will continue their efforts to reduce the high level of banking
sector dollarization, mainly by further promoting a stable macroeconomic environment.
Structural reforms
Armenia registered progress with several international competitiveness indicators, including
a significant improvement in the 2013 World Bank’s Doing Business rankings from the 55th
to the 32nd place. Ensuring a more even progress across different indicators remains an
important task for the coming period. The authorities continue to implement structural
reforms aimed at further improving the business environment. First, they continue realizing
more than 50 measures from the government’s action plan, including legal changes to
streamline customs operations and electronic systems for notary services and construction
permits. Second, they are firmly committed to the continued full operation of the Regulatory
Guillotine program, aiming to significantly streamline regulation and red-tape in key business

areas. Third, the authorities envisage further reform of inspection and safety agencies, with a
focus on merging and rationalizing their functions. On options to revive the chemical plant
Nairit, the authorities reiterate their commitment not to assume any liabilities, including
guarantees, without consultation with the Fund and the World Bank.
EPA
The Armenian authorities would like to thank staff for useful discussions in the preparations
of the ex-post assessment. Given the complex circumstances, the authorities believe that
other factors, besides lack of program ownership, may have contributed to the limited
success in some areas. In the authorities’ view, a reflection on success stories of reforms
during the crisis period is also critical for future joint efforts in designing sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. For example, significant fiscal consolidation
immediately after the crisis reflects the authorities’ continued commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies and strong program ownership. On monetary and financial sector
developments, the authorities believe that two important achievements should be
highlighted: the implementation of a modern inflation-targeting framework and the very
positive outcome of the recent FSAP report. Finally, the authorities consider worth
mentioning that intermediation and credit to GDP ratios increased by factors of 2.7 and 4.5
respectively in less than 5 years, while Armenia remains among few countries that observed
increase in the deposit base of the banking system during the crisis years.
Successor program
The authorities intend to seek a successor arrangement with the Fund after completion of the
current arrangement in mid-2013, which would support the external and fiscal adjustment
through a period of elevated repayment of crisis-related assistance. Key objectives would be
to further establish policy buffers and expand policy space, primarily through strong CBA
reserves and higher tax revenues, while continuing to implement structural reforms aimed at
sustained and accelerated growth through further financial sector development, and business
environment improvement.
