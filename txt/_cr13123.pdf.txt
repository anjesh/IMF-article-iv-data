STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 25, 2013

KEY ISSUES
The economy is projected to enter a second year of near zero growth. The outlook
reflects weak external conditions and a loss of cost competitiveness relative to European
partners. The growth potential is also constrained by adverse demographic and
productivity trends, which call for continued structural reforms. Priorities should go to
improving wage setting (to better align wage growth with productivity trends),
reforming social benefits (to increase labor participation), and reducing labor and
product market rigidities (to increase productivity).
Risks to macroeconomic stability stem from fiscal and financial vulnerabilities.
Decisive fiscal action delivered structural adjustment of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2012, but
debt and contingent liabilities remain high, and cross-exposures between the sovereign
and the banks are a risk factor. Balance sheet repair has resulted in a smaller and less
leveraged banking sector, refocused on the domestic market. However, low profitability
could constrain the capacity of banks to reinforce capital in the medium term.
Continued fiscal adjustment (based on structural targets) is needed to reduce
vulnerabilities. A deferral of the medium-term balanced budget objective is warranted
by the weaker growth environment, but steady adjustment is nonetheless required to
place the high debt ratio (just under 100 percent) on a downward path. Priority should
go to reducing the growth in social spending, consistent with structural reform
objectives. The authorities’ revised 2013 budget aims at reducing the deficit to
2.5 percent of GDP, based on primary structural adjustment of 0.8 percent of GDP.
Future consolidation should be rebalanced toward expenditure measures. A clearer and
rule-based multi-year fiscal policy framework would increase policy efficiency.
Policy actions have strengthened financial stability but continued vigilance is
required. The legacy of the crisis, euro area vulnerabilities, and the sovereign-banking
nexus call for a further strengthening of capital buffers, maintaining the positive
momentum of supervisory reform, and reinforcing the resolution framework. Completing
the banking union in Europe will help remove the obstacles to the efficient
intermediation of the liquidity surplus of Belgian banks.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONTEXT
1.
After a prolonged political stalemate, the broad coalition government that came into
office in December 2011 was able to take decisive fiscal and structural measures to stabilize
the economy; its term will end with the May 2014 elections. In the face of rising financial
instability, the six-party coalition government undertook significant fiscal consolidation, introduced
ambitious reforms to pensions and unemployment insurance, and decided on a further devolution
of powers to the regions and communities. The popularity of the Flemish nationalist party is a
source of uncertainty in the upcoming elections.
2.
Weak external conditions, but also a loss of competitiveness, have weighed adversely
on economic activity. The economy showed considerable resilience through 2011, reflecting the
effects of large automatic stabilizers and job subsidies, as well as the strong financial position of the
non-financial private sector which prevented a severe retrenchment of private investment and
consumption (Figure 1). However, the rebound stalled in 2012 as rising unemployment and the weak
outlook in Europe took a toll on consumption and investment: domestic demand contracted by
0.6 percent, and real GDP by 0.2 percent. Since 2011, Belgium’s export performance has also fallen
behind that of its main economic partners (Germany, France, and the Netherlands), as unit labor
costs (ULCs) have grown faster, pushed by sticky inflation and wage indexation (Figure 2). The loss of
competitiveness prompted the government to decree a real wage freeze in the private sector
for 2013 and 2014.1 The government has also revised the composition of the price index, which
should dampen the inflation pass through by an
estimated 0.4 percentage points in 2013-14.2

Demographic and productivity trends
pose a significant challenge to Belgium’s
potential growth prospects. The interactions
of the pension and unemployment benefit
systems, as well as various schemes to promote
partial employment have created
unemployment traps and encouraged early
departure from the labor force. As a result, the
employment rate has been structurally low (67
percent of working age population in 2011).

The government undertook important reforms in 2012 to increase incentives to work, with the
objective of raising the employment rate to 73 percent by 2020 (Appendix I). At the same time, total
factor productivity (TFP) growth has also slowed significantly over the past decade, undermining real
wage growth prospects with a risk of further increasing the gap between market and reservation
wages.
4.
Fiscal consolidation reduced the structural fiscal deficit by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2012,
but continued efforts are hampered by spending rigidities. Despite this fiscal effort, the headline
deficit rose from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.9 percent in 2012, reflecting not only cyclical
factors but also a further recapitalization of the Dexia Group in late 2012 amounting to 0.8 percent
of GDP.3 The improvement in the structural deficit was achieved through revenue measures of
1.3 percent of GDP and by containing the growth in primary spending to 0.9 percent in real terms.
Expenditure containment was achieved by a marked reduction in public service employment at the
federal level (about 3 percent), lower
subsidies to companies, and cuts in purchase

increases to social benefits on top of that.
5.
The 2013 budget (adopted in November 2012) targeted a deficit of 2.2 percent of
GDP, consistent with the medium objective of reaching a balanced fiscal position by 2015, but
was based on optimistic growth projections. Based on the outcome of the 2012 budget, updated
macroeconomic assumptions, and a revised fiscal assessment of subnational governments, the
November budget would have resulted in a structural primary adjustment of only 0.1 percent of
GDP relative to 2012, and a headline deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013.

3

Eurostat determined that the recapitalization should be treated as a capital transfer (with an impact on the deficit)
rather than as a financial transaction. The decision reflected Eurostat’s determination that the recapitalization was
aimed at covering Dexia’s losses and that the injected funds are unlikely to generate a positive return.

Defined as in the Excessive Deficit Procedure.
As measured by IMF Staff. Structural adjustment in 2013 as measured by the authorities is

1 percent of GDP owing to differences in potential GDP estimates.

6.
The high public debt and large contingent liabilities are the main sources of fiscal
vulnerability. The gross financing need of the government stands at 21 percent of GDP in 2013,
and is expected to stay around this level in the medium-term (Figure 3). The government debt ratio
has risen by 15½ percentage points since 2007 (to just below 100 percent in 2012). About half of
this increase stems from financial sector rescue operations, and another 15 percent from financial
assistance to EU member states and participation in the EU rescue funds. Contingent liabilities in the
form of guarantees to the financial sector stood at 18 percent of GDP at end-2012.
7.
Fiscal consolidation is complicated by the difficulty of coordinating policies across the
different levels of government. Subnational governments, encompassing regional, community,
and local governments account for about 40 percent of total government primary spending. The
regions and communities receive net transfers from the central government that are linked to real
GDP and inflation, with other parametric adjustments. In 2012, the Flemish government was in a
balanced position, while the other subnational governments ran a combined deficit of 0.4 percent of
GDP. Over the period 2002-12, real primary spending grew at an average annual rate of 3.2 percent
for subnational governments and 3.5 percent for the federal government (central government plus
social security). The contribution of regional and community governments to the consolidation
effort is negotiated in terms of deficit targets. Although transfers from the central to the subnational
governments are predetermined by law, there is in principle a claw back provision related to the
contribution that subnational entities should make (but have not yet made) to cover their share of
civil service pension contributions. Unless subnational governments agree to run surpluses (or to
lower net transfers from the central government), the responsibility for the fiscal consolidation will
fall primarily onto the federal entity (and the social transfer system in particular). The Sixth Reform of
the State, agreed in late 2011, will increase the degree of fiscal federalism by devolving additional
spending responsibilities (estimated at 4.4 percent of GDP) to subnational governments and
reforming their funding (Box 2 in Belgium’s

an agreement on the terms of future financial transfers from the central government, which will be
critical to defining the degree of burden sharing in future consolidation.
8.
Financial sector repair has continued to reduce risks to financial stability. As a result of
decisive policy actions and divestment of cross-border operations, the banking system has become
smaller (from nearly 500 percent of GDP in 2007 to 310 percent in mid-2012), less complex, and less
leveraged. In the process, foreign ownership of banks has increased to 65 percent of assets
(essentially BNPP and ING), and government ownership to 16 percent of assets (i.e., Belfius, the
nationalized and rebranded banking arm of Dexia). A large and stable deposit base and the strategic
re-orientation towards the domestic market helped support domestic credit supply, while nonperforming loans have remained low so far. However, this reorientation to the domestic market has
also increased loan concentration. Supervisory action, deleveraging, and improved risk management
pushed banks to stronger capital positions, with aggregate Tier 1 capital ratio rising to 15.3 percent
in September 2012 (Figure 4). The largest part of legacy assets has been removed from the balance
sheet of banks, although KBC (the largest Belgian private bank) and Belfius still retain some
structured products (in runoff mode). Liquidity has improved and domestic banks have made
progress in repaying European Central Bank’s (ECB) longer-term refinancing operations (LTRO)
support since the beginning of the year.

Box 1. The EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP)
Belgium’s fiscal consolidation since 2009 has fallen short of the commitments under the EDP. The EU
Treaty requires EU member states to maintain a general government deficit below 3 percent of GDP and
gross government debt below 60 percent of GDP. Failure to comply with these requirements triggers an
EDP. Belgium has been subject to the EDP since December 2009, when the overall deficit rose to 5.6 percent
of GDP. The government committed to bringing the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2012 in a ―credible
and sustainable manner,‖ with an annual structural budgetary effort of 0.75 percent of GDP in 2010-2012.
However, the headline deficit breached the 3 percent of GDP ceiling for a fourth successive year in 2012 and
the cumulative improvement in the structural balance for 2010-12 was below 1 percent of GDP.

As a result, Belgium could face a fine of up to 0.2 percent of GDP. The fine, based on a recommendation
by the European Commission, and after consideration of a possible reasoned request put forward by
Belgium, shall be deemed adopted by the Council of Ministers, unless a qualified majority of member states
overturns it. The Council, acting by qualified majority, may amend the Commission's recommendation. The
Commission will make its assessment in the context of its 2013 Spring Forecast, which will be published in
May 2013. Belgium is the first EU member state faced with the prospect of a fine for having failed to take
effective action to correct its excessive deficit.

9.
With the retrenchment of banks onto the domestic market, the main financial
vulnerabilities are related to the weak growth outlook and increased linkages with the
sovereign. Increased domestic competition, in a context of economic stagnation, is constraining
banks’ profitability, which is already hampered by low lending rates, and structurally high costs. The
recent FSAP Update stress tests found that, while bank capital buffers are strong in aggregate,
deterioration of profitability under stress in some banks could create capital shortfalls in the
medium term relative to Basel III requirements. Exposures to the sovereign, accounting for
11 percent of assets, create vulnerabilities to a downgrade of the sovereign. Insurers meet the
current regulatory solvency regime, but vulnerabilities are apparent when a more risk-based
solvency framework is applied.

Pressures on profitability also
reflect the broader impact of financial
market segmentation in Europe and the
difficulty Belgian banks face in putting
their structural liquidity surplus to use in
a saturated domestic market. Structural
over-liquidity (as illustrated by a low loanto-deposit ratio and a high deposit-to-GDP
ratio) reflects the combination of a high
financial saving rate by households and the
preferential tax treatment of retail deposits.
Whereas domestic deposits were used by
banks to fund cross-border business in the
past, market segmentation along national
lines has now forced these funds to
compete in a smaller and less buoyant
market. Similar to other countries in Europe,
segmentation was influenced by: (i) limits
set by the regulator in 2011 to the exposure
of subsidiaries to their foreign parent banks,
prompted by the spillover risks associated
with an incomplete banking union; and (ii)
forced divestments and a ban on new crossborder operations imposed by the EC as a
condition for public support of banks. Since
2008, the structural liquidity surplus
generated by banks has been reflected in
the improvement of their liquid asset ratio,
from 23 percent in 2008 to 35 percent in
June 2012. Pressures to deploy these
resources efficiently will increase going
forward.

Financial conditions remain
accommodative for Belgium. Real lending
rates (based on consensus expected inflation)
have been positive, but low and declining. In expost terms, real interest rates have been rising,
reflecting the fact that the consensus inflation
forecast did not anticipate the recent
deceleration of inflation. Overall, the
transmission of ECB policy rates to domestic
lending rates appears to be efficient and
symmetric, with interest rates on loans to nonfinancial corporations and households in
Belgium co-moving with the ECB refinancing
rate. The growth in lending to households and
non-financial corporations continues to outpace
the euro area average, even though credit
standards were tightened in 2012 (Figure 5).

to historical average suggest significant
overvaluation. However, these measures do not
account for the fact that housing was relatively inexpensive to begin with, and that there is therefore
a large catching up effect underlying the rise of these indicators. Also, the rental market is very
narrow as it is focused only on low-income social housing on one hand and high-end apartments in
Brussels on the other. A broader assessment, including a comparison of absolute price levels relative
to the rest of Europe, suggests that the degree of overvaluation is of the order of 5 to 20 percent.

need to reduce risks from contingent liabilities
and high debt, is thus consistent with
exchange rate stability. The additional loss of cost competitiveness relative to euro area partners
(since 2011) could, if not reversed, lead to an assessment of real exchange rate misalignment. Other
indicators of competitiveness confirm that, while competitiveness has been stable or improved in
global terms since 2008, Belgium’s position relative to its European partners has deteriorated. This is
also reflected in a faster loss of export market share.

infrastructure spending by local authorities.
Insufficient employment growth should push
the unemployment rate to 8 percent in 2013. Headline and core inflation are expected to decelerate
markedly reflecting lower food and energy prices, the reform of the domestic energy market, the
real wage freeze in the private sector, and the adjustment to the measurement of inflation. Given the
relatively healthy financial position of households and the non-financial corporate sector, domestic
demand is expected to recover apace with an improvement in external conditions in 2014.
16.
Staff has revised downward Belgium’s potential growth outlook. The revision reflects
steadily declining total factor productivity (TFP). In their latest forecast, the authorities maintain a
more optimistic outlook for GDP and potential GDP growth (Figure 6).
17.
The main external risks, and related spillovers, stem from the possible reemergence of
euro area tensions and protracted stagnation in Europe. These medium-likelihood risks would
have a medium to high impact in Belgium. Stagnation in Europe would threaten Belgium’s ―soft
core‖ status owing to its high exposure to European trade, the vulnerability of public debt dynamics
to lower growth and higher interest rates (especially in light of the high rollover need), and a further
erosion of the profitability of banks and insurers, all of which could reactivate a feedback loop
between sovereign and financial sector stress. To a large extent the policy response to the
realization of these risks would lie at the European level, in the form of a supportive monetary policy
stance by the ECB, accompanied by appropriate liquidity support. At the national level, these risks
call for locking in adequate adjustment before the 2014 elections (see paragraph 18), and
strengthening banks’ capital buffers (see paragraph 29). Belgian banks have limited direct exposure
to the euro area periphery, but a large share of the banking sector is vulnerable to inward spillovers
from (cross-border) intra-group exposures to French, Dutch, and German banks. The main channel
of outward spillovers is from the exposure of a large Czech subsidiary to its Belgian parent (KBC).
Regulatory measures by host countries to limit intra-group exposures of subsidiaries have, however,
diminished the spillover risks from parents since the crisis.

Domestic vulnerabilities stem from political uncertainty, financial sector fragilities,
and the housing market:


Possible backtracking on fiscal consolidation. A prolonged period of political uncertainty
following the elections could undermine confidence and raise sovereign and banking sector
spreads. In the absence of new policy measures (e.g., under a caretaker government), the
primary balance of the federal government would likely deteriorate, driven by rising social
transfers. A scenario that assumes unchanged policies for the three year period 2015—17 is
included in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for illustrative purposes (Appendix II). Even if a
stable majority can form a government, fiscal and structural reforms which are key to reducing
macroeconomic vulnerabilities will remain difficult to coordinate in the fractured institutional set
up of central, regional and community governments. Sustaining consolidation would be more
difficult if the adjustment responsibility fell solely on the federal government.



Prolonged squeeze on bank profitability or spillover from high sovereign spreads.
Realization of these two risks could again threaten financial stability and, in the process,
reactivate the sovereign-financial nexus. Activation of state guarantees to the financial sector
could also be triggered by a rise in the cost of rolling over Dexia’s liabilities or valuation losses
on the asset side (notably from the structured product portfolio). However, the guarantees are

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

unlikely to be called all at once, given Dexia’s extended run-off schedule. The DSA (Appendix II)
illustrated the impact of a partial realization of these guarantees.


Housing price correction. Overvaluation of real estate (see paragraph 13), even if moderate, is
likely to lead to a price correction, which could be triggered by the recent tightening of
mortgage lending standards and low income growth. This medium-likelihood risk would likely
have a low to medium impact, since such a correction would likely be gradual, reflecting the fact
that there is no oversupply, households are generally not over-indebted, absolute prices are
moderate by international comparison, and high real estate transaction taxes deter market
transactions. Wealth effects could nonetheless contribute to dampening the recovery of
consumption, particularly among lower income households. In the event of a sharp and rapid
housing downturn, pressure on banks’ capital could emerge.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Staff and the authorities agreed on the short-term outlook, although the authorities
retain a more positive view of medium-term growth prospects. The authorities shared the
staff’s risk assessment and also underscored that policies followed by the government
have matched past Fund recommendations (Appendix III). Discussions focused on policies
to reduce macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities and to support growth, with
emphasis on the appropriate pace of fiscal adjustment and its instruments, labor market
reforms, and measures to reinforce financial sector stability and efficient intermediation.

A. Sustaining Quality Fiscal Adjustment
19.
Sustaining the consolidation effort was recognized as critical to addressing
vulnerabilities and the authorities underscored that, despite the weak economic situation,
they would take additional measures in 2013 to accelerate the pace of structural adjustment.
Even though the original budget target for 2012 appeared beyond reach, the authorities considered
it important to keep the debt ratio from breaching the 100 percent level. Staff also underscored that,
in the Belgian context, the government had a narrow window of opportunity to lock in durable fiscal
adjustment ahead of the next elections and the risks that came with it. Staff proposed that the
structural adjustment effort embedded in the 2012-15 Stability Program of June 2012 remained a
relevant guide to policy, and that accordingly the authorities should aim to lock in before elections
an improvement of the structural primary balance of 1.5 percent of GDP over two years, i.e. 2013–14.
Staff emphasized the merits of anchoring policies to a structural target, so as to reduce reliance on
one-off measures and allow more predictability in policies. Based on the staff’s macroeconomic
assumptions, this path of fiscal adjustment would reduce the headline deficit to around 2½ percent
of GDP in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014 (Figure 3). The debt ratio would return to a downward path
starting in 2014. Following the mission, the authorities agreed on new measures with the objective
of reducing the deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2013. The package is about evenly divided between
revenue and expenditure measures. Based on staff estimates, the structural primary balance would
improve by 0.8 percent of GDP in 2013 relative to 2012, consistent with staff recommendations.
20.
In view of the already high burden of taxation, and the need to increase the
economy’s growth potential, staff recommended that the fiscal effort be redirected to
expenditure containment over revenue measures. Given the unsustainable trend rise in social
spending (which will be further boosted by rapid population ageing) and the need to create fiscal
space to sustain pro-growth public spending in support of R&D, training, and infrastructure, staff
urged further reforms of social transfer policies, notably pensions, as well as curbs on discretionary
increases in benefits over and beyond price indexation. It also suggested tightening controls on
health spending, targeting a faster compression of public sector employment through attrition at
the subnational level, reducing subsidies and transfers that discourage labor participation, and
increasing the use of means-testing for government benefits and tax expenditures. Staff
underscored that revenue measures should be used primarily to achieve a revenue-neutral shift of
the tax burden from labor taxes to less distortive taxes. The authorities indicated that they had

launched a consultation on pension reform, which could inform deeper reforms by the next
government.
21.
Staff noted that meeting the requirements of European fiscal governance provided an
opportunity to strengthen internal mechanisms of fiscal coordination to ensure adequate
burden sharing and effective correction mechanisms at all levels of government. Such reforms
would also mitigate the risks of backsliding on fiscal consolidation. The authorities indicated that
they had not yet begun to transpose into national legislation the requirements of the Fiscal
Compact, and recognized the challenge given that institutional reforms were actually going in the
direction of greater decentralization of fiscal authority. Presently, fiscal coordination is facilitated by
the High Council of Finance (HCF), whose advisory opinion on the medium-term deficit objectives of
the various governments carries significant legitimacy on account of its broad political
representation. In its latest opinion, communicated at the end of March, the HCF recommended that
the government focus on meaningful structural consolidation, with the objective of achieving a
structural surplus of 0.75 percent of GDP in 2016. Underlying this objective is a fiscal effort
consistent with the staff’s advice, although given the authorities’ (and HCF’s) more optimistic
potential growth assumptions, the medium-term target would be reached much sooner in the HCF
scenario than in the staff’s scenario. This advice will form the basis for the government’s new three

shows an unchanged policy scenario, where
expenditure is assumed to grow at the same rate it did in 2011 under the care-taker government.

B. Labor Market and Other Structural Reforms
22.
Demographic and productivity trends are putting increasing strains on the Belgian
economic and social model. This model places a premium on redistribution, which however carry
costs in the forms of disincentives to work and invest. These costs were manageable in a higher
growth environment, but are increasingly difficult to sustain. The discussions focused on ways to
raise the economy’s growth potential, by improving the wage formation process, continuing to
reform social benefits, and reducing labor market rigidities.
23.
There was agreement that restoring cost competitiveness was, in the short term, the
most effective way to boost growth, with discussions focused on wage indexation and the
high tax wedge on labor. The authorities acknowledged the need to reverse the accumulated loss
in cost competitiveness relative to partners and noted that steps in this direction had already been
taken, including the real wage freeze for 2013-14 and technical changes in the measurement of
inflation. The authorities also considered that competitiveness could be improved by reducing the
high tax wedge on labor, but given the fiscal constraint this would require a budget-neutral increase
in other taxes, which remains controversial.
24.
While indexation itself is politically difficult to tackle, revisions to the 1996 Law on
Competitiveness could help ensure that labor cost developments in Belgium bear a closer link
to those in neighboring countries and that sufficient flexibility be allowed to correct for past
deviations. Although this was in fact the intent of the law, three flaws have undermined its
effectiveness: first, the norm for domestic real wage negotiations under the law is based solely on
expected wage developments in partner countries, and does not take into account the possibility of
diverging productivity growths; second, nominal wage growth in partner countries has proven very
difficult to project with any accuracy; third, the law does not provide a formal correction mechanism
for past deviations of wages from the desired norm, although the government has some
discretionary powers to intervene in exceptional circumstances, as it has in the recent wage round.
Possible improvements to the law include: establishment of a formal correction mechanism (e.g., in

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

the form of a cap on wages) for past deviations relative to wage (or preferably ULC) developments in
partner countries; and introduction of a safety buffer in the forecasts to reduce the risk of
overstating foreign wage growth and underestimating domestic inflation.
25.
Staff noted that price indexation in the economy more generally creates risks for cost
competitiveness. Indexation is pervasive, including in government contracts and market services
such as in public transport, legal services, rents, and insurance premia. Such indexation contributes
to accentuate second round effects from increases in energy prices, as seen in recent years. Staff
noted that the current low inflation environment provided an opportunity to phase out such
practices, with limited consequences on the public.
26.
Low labor participation (and employment) rates are another growth handicap for
Belgium, which point to the need for continued pension and labor market reforms, as well as
improved activation and training policies. Measures already undertaken to raise the effective
retirement age appear to have shown some early positive results. However, to reach the 73 percent
employment rate target set for 2020, more measures will likely be needed beyond those already
taken, i.e., increasing the degressitivity of unemployment benefits and tightening job search and
monitoring. Subsidies to enterprises to support job creation have also succeeded in raising
employment of less skilled workers, but at a considerable fiscal cost of around 1.5 percent of GDP.
The authorities noted that they had commissioned a study to propose further pension reforms that
could be adopted by a new government after the 2014 elections. Staff submitted that additional
changes to the pension system could be enacted before the elections, and that various subsidy
schemes that reduced labor market participation (such as the ―time credit‖ mechanism6) should be
tightened.
27.
Labor market rigidities more generally adversely affect the economy’s competitiveness
and employment creation. High statutory severance payments, long notification periods, and
special procedures for collective dismissals, all intended to protect jobs and workers, seem to
encourage enterprises to postpone restructuring rather than doing so preemptively. Staff noted that
the retooling of such workers for alternative employment before the failure of a company would
result in less value destruction overall. Rules on severance payments differ between white and blue
collar workers, and the ongoing discussions on aligning the two regimes has brought this issue to a
head. Implicit labor costs would be raised appreciably if convergence takes place toward the more
costly white collar regime.
28.
Innovation, education and competitive markets could also boost productivity growth
and provide a source of sustained growth. Overall expenditures on research and development are
not far from the euro area average, and Belgium also compares favorably in terms of innovation of
existing processes. However, research efforts have not translated into product innovation and a
move up the value added chain in terms of exports. The authorities described regional programs to

Under the time-credit system, employees can work less than full-time and receive a top-up to their part-time salary
from the government. Workers above 55 with a 25 year professional career are eligible to participate until their
retirement.

foster innovation and research and development and pointed to some budding clusters around
certain universities as early signs of progress. On market competition, the telecommunications and
retail electricity and gas markets have been opened up to greater competition, and the authorities
noted that prices had declined as a result. With respect to electricity, they agreed that reform of the
distribution activities will be an important next step to reduce costs. Beyond these network
industries, competition could be increased in other services, notably professional services where
barriers to entry are high.

C. Financial Sector Stability
29.
Supervisory challenges remain considerable in the wake of the crisis, and in the face of
euro area vulnerabilities and the reorientation of banks to the domestic market. The
authorities welcome the FSAP Update recommendations and are already taking steps to implement
them (Appendix IV). They acknowledged that continued vigilance is required as weak profitability
would not only impair banks’ ability to raise capital buffers through retained earnings, but could also
lead to a loosening of lending standards and the possible fueling of a domestic asset bubble. The
NBB noted that it had asked banks to tighten lending standards to households, and lending surveys
already point to tightening. The NBB also underscored that profitability could be improved sizably
by reducing the very high operating costs (the cost-to-income ratio stands presently at 71 percent).
The authorities agree with staff recommendations for strengthening the banks’ capital buffers in line
with forthcoming Basel III requirements and for taking additional actions, as required in response to
the ongoing reviews of banks’ business models. The authorities welcome the introduction of the
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and are cognizant of the important role that national
authorities will continue to play in both the transition and steady-state stage.
30.
The long-term restructuring process of Dexia requires continued close monitoring. The
Belgian and French authorities undertook a new round of recapitalization of the runoff Dexia Group
of EUR 5.5 billion (of which Belgium contributed EUR 2.9 billion under a new burden sharing key) at
the end of 2012 to address its deteriorating capital position. Going further, the complex execution of
the Dexia Group restructuring plan continues to require close oversight and coordination with the
French authorities and, with advent of the SSM, the ECB.
31.
As long as the Belgian banks attract a surplus of liquidity, cross-border operations will
remain a natural outlet for these funds, and the authorities noted that the constraints of
market segmentation are waning. Already, limits on intra-group exposures are being overcome:
BNPP and ING have responded to the regulatory limits on the upstreaming of liquidity by
downstreaming group assets and operations to their Belgian subsidiaries, such as trade and project
financing. The regulator acknowledges the added supervisory challenge of assessing the quality of
the downstreamed assets and of cross-border credits. By the same token, once the ban on KBC on
engaging in cross-border operations (as per European Commission state aid conditionality) is lifted
in November 2014, KBC will be in a position to develop its external network if needed. In the
absence of a full banking union, the NBB considers, and staff agrees, that the current liquidity
regime

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

(including limits on exposure to foreign parents) should be maintained until the new liquidity rules
are fully phased in at the European level in 2018.
32.
The banks’ ability to attract a surplus of liquidity reflects, in part, the tax advantages
that benefit savings accounts at the expense of other financial instruments. The combination of
declining interest rates and a high cap on the tax exemption that can be claimed per account (EUR
1,880 in 2013) has resulted in a massive shift of savings toward saving accounts. To a large extent,
however, the shift appears to have occurred at the expense of term deposits rather than non-bank
financial instruments. The regulator noted that, even though saving accounts have been historically
stable, they are in fact callable and as such they are associated with higher liquidity requirements
that term deposits. Discussions touched on the desirability of reforming these tax breaks, not only
for fiscal reasons, but also with a view to level the playing field across financial instruments. It was
agreed that tax advantages, if any, should be used to promote long-term saving rather a specific
financial instrument.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The economy has entered a second year of near zero growth amid persistent
vulnerabilities. While an improvement in external conditions, even if gradual, should support the
recovery, the economy’s capacity to rebound and create jobs is constrained by structural rigidities
and a loss of competitiveness. The financial sector has been transformed and downsized in the
aftermath of the financial crisis, but vulnerabilities remain. Combined with the fragile situation of
public finances, these vulnerabilities could, in an adverse environment, undermine macroeconomic
stability.
34.
Despite the weak growth outlook and current low interest rate environment,
macroeconomic vulnerabilities put a premium on maintaining a steady pace of fiscal
adjustment. The government’s policy resolve in addressing a fragile financial situation in 2011 was
met with a marked improvement in market confidence. The window of opportunity that exists
before the next elections should be used to lock in some additional durable and quality adjustment.
The government’s revised 2013 budget is welcome in this regard. The pace of structural adjustment
targeted by the authorities is in line with what staff considers appropriate at this juncture. An
average structural primary adjustment target of 0.75 percent annually appears appropriate in this
regard, and is consistent with maintaining the momentum of social expenditure reform which is
needed to promote growth. The government’s decision to launch a consultation on deeper pension
reform is welcome, but additional (parametric) measures could already be taken ahead of a more
comprehensive reform. Anchoring fiscal adjustment to a structural deficit target would also increase
the predictability of policies, avoid reliance on stop gap revenue measures to meet annual deficit
targets, and allow automatic stabilizers to operate in the event of higher or lower than anticipated
growth. A clearer rule-based multi-year fiscal policy framework would increase policy efficiency, as
well as ensure adequate burden sharing across all levels of government and consistency with fiscal
targets agreed at the European level.
35.
The structural reforms agenda should continue to focus on raising growth by restoring
cost competitiveness, raising labor market participation rates, and boosting productivity.
Absent an acceleration of reforms, Belgium risks losing additional ground to peers that are engaged
in structural reforms. Substantial productivity gains could be realized by reorienting labor market
policies away from protecting specific jobs to making the labor force more adaptable to the
requirements of a dynamic economic through skill development and job search support. Also,
deeper pension and social policy reforms, consistent with fiscal consolidation objectives, are needed
to raise the effective age of retirement, and increase employment rates generally. These actions
require close coordination across all levels of government given the divided competencies.
36.
Wage and price indexation continue to create risks of cost misalignment and lost
growth. Beyond the recent real wage freeze, a reform of the 1996 Law on competitiveness could
strengthen the link between domestic wage developments and those in partner countries, and
provide flexibility to correct for past deviations. A one-off improvement in cost competitiveness
could be achieved by reducing further the high tax wedge on labor in a budget-neutral way, and in

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

the framework of broader tax reform. More generally, Belgium needs to confront the inherent
structural weakness of maintaining wage indexation while its peers do not. Price indexation in the
economy, notably in services, should be phased out.
37.
Important policy actions have helped to safeguard financial stability, but the legacy of
the crisis and euro area vulnerabilities require continued attention. Banks’ capital buffers should
be further strengthened in line with forthcoming Basel III requirements. In this regard, possible
pressures on profits, as well as remaining vulnerabilities related to legacy assets, call for a regular
review of the viability of banks’ business models as underlined in the FSAP Update. The national
resolution and deposit insurance frameworks are also in need of strengthening, and positive
changes to supervisory practices need to be sustained in view of the important role that the national
supervisor will play in both the transitory and steady state stages of the SSM. The unwinding of the
Dexia Group is progressing, but its full resolution will take time and requires continued supervisory
and government oversight.
38.
The incomplete banking union in Europe has hampered the efficient intermediation of
the liquidity surplus of Belgian banks, but the tax advantage granted to savings account may
have exacerbated the problem. While national regulatory measures to limit intra-group exposures
may complicate liquidity management within large cross-border groups and contribute to financial
fragmentation in Europe, they are a prudent response to addressing the liquidity stress and
resolution problems that have resulted from the financial crisis in Europe and the absence of a
common resolution framework. The market response of bringing assets to the local deposit base is
providing a partial solution to the intermediation problem, albeit one that requires added
supervisory oversight and that may result in less efficient cross-border financial intermediation.
A common resolution framework and deposit guarantee scheme in the euro area, together with
harmonized liquidity regulations, in line with the Basel III framework will eventually help eliminate
regulatory and market obstacles in the intermediation of savings and credit. At the same time, the
Belgian banks’ need to intermediate a large pool of saving may reflect not only the strong financial
position of households, but also the tax advantages that benefit bank deposits. Taxation of financial
income should be rethought to promote long-term saving regardless of the underlying financial
instruments.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
To better appreciate risks, staff expanded the DSA to include scenarios that reflect some of the
specific risks highlighted in the Staff Report (paragraphs 15-18). The shocks illustrated in Appendix II
Figure I are as follows:



Growth shock. This scenario assumes a permanent decline of real GDP growth by 1/2
standard deviation, i.e., 0.9 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. While debt
dynamics would become clearly explosive, this shock appears to be on the extreme side of
the probability distribution.



Backtracking on fiscal consolidation. To capture risks associated with the uncertain policy
context in the post 2014 election period, this scenario assumes that no new fiscal measures
are taken for the three year period 2014-16, and that consolidation resumes thereafter,
albeit gradually. Specifically, for the period 2014-16, the tax ratio is assumed to remain
constant, and primary expenditures are assumed to grow by 1.5 percent in real terms
annually, consistent with the experience of 2011 when Belgium was under a caretaker
government. The scenario illustrates that the additional amount of adjustment locked in for
2013, helps offset the subsequent slippage.



High interest rate scenario. To capture the risks of renewed euro area tensions, this
scenario assumes that interest rate spreads (vis-à-vis Germany) rise to the same (peak) level
observed in 2011 (300 basis points), and then converge gradually back to the baseline
scenario level by 2018. It does not differ very much from the standard bound test.



Combined scenario. Reflecting the fact that backtracking on fiscal consolidation would
likely undermine confidence, and possibly weaken growth in the short term, this scenario
combines the previous two scenarios. In addition, this scenario assumes that the economic
recovery will be delayed by a year, with zero real growth in 2014.



Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes that half of the state guarantees to the
financial sector are called upon in 2013. While the debt impact is high, the nature of the
state guarantees is such that they are unlikely to be exercised to such a degree.

Appendix III. Main Recommendations of the 2011 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions Taken
Fiscal Policy

Focus fiscal consolidation on
expenditure containment
particularly pensions, health care,
and public sector employment.

Growth of health care costs reduced and effective retirement age
increased through pension reform. Additional reforms under
consideration. Public sector employment reduced at the federal
level, but gain more than offset by increases at subnational level.

Adopt a rules-based framework
and a burden-sharing agreement
between all levels of government

Burden-sharing subject to continued negotiations, including on the
terms of the Sixth reform of the State; rule-based system difficult
under fiscal federalism.

Allow automatic stabilizers to
operate freely around mediumterm consolidation path.

Automatic stabilizers allowed to operate, but fiscal policy still
guided by nominal budget targets defined on a year-by-year basis.

Financial Sector Policy
Strengthen capital buffers and
stand ready to provide the
necessary backstop if private
capital cannot be tapped.

Capital buffers in private banks reinforced through private capital
injections. Public injection of capital into Dexia, most recently in
December 2012. Stress-test results of FSAP Update used to review
viability of business plans and future capital needs.

Strengthen bank supervision and
implement the Basel III and
Solvency II regulatory frameworks.

Bank supervision being strengthened in line with FSAP Update
recommendations. Implementation of Basel III and Solvency II in
line with EU calendar.
Structural Reforms

Push ahead with labor and product
market reforms, including a reform
of the wage indexation system.

Adjustment made to the indexation system. Zero real wage growth
imposed for 2013-14. Reform of the 1996 law on competitiveness
under consideration to improve linkage to wage developments
abroad.

Job-friendly and revenue neutral
tax reform to shift the burden away
from labor taxes.

Social security contributions by employers have been reduced for
certain categories.

Appendix IV. Main Recommendations of the FSAP Update
The FSAP Update for Belgium took place between November 2012 and January 2013. The mission
found that the Belgian financial system has largely stabilized since the onset of the global financial
crisis, but pockets of vulnerability remain. Both banks and insurers are challenged by low
profitability, persistently low interest rates, and large sovereign exposures. The new regulatory
structure is functioning relatively well, with clear improvements in the prudential supervision of
banks and insurers. The main recommendations relate to:
Continue to enhance the intensity and intrusiveness of supervision by:


putting in place a more systematic an proportional supervisory approach for smaller banks;



improving the supervisory tools for monitoring conglomerates-specific risks;



making stress testing an integral part of the macroprudential policy and surveillance framework.

Expand the review process of business models of financial institutions by:


broadening the scope of the review to a larger sample of banks and insurance companies;



analyzing financial stability implications of the ongoing transformation of the business models;



implementing timely supervisory follow-up, as needed.

Strengthen the resolution framework and the deposit guarantee system (DGS) by:


formalizing the domestic institutional arrangements for crisis management and resolution;



revamping the DGS by establishing a segregated fund, with a recalibrated target size and
enhanced scope;



improving the resolution toolkit by introducing greater options for burden sharing; broadening
the scope of asset transfers; and strengthening the powers of special inspectors.

The National Bank of Belgium (NBB) has approved an action plan to implement the FSAP Update
recommendations. Immediate steps have already been taken: an MOU on cooperation and
information exchange has been signed between the NBB and the Financial Services Regulatory
Authority (FSMA); the NBB is considering designing the macroprudential institutional framework in
line with staff advice; and a program for a systematic monitoring of small banks utilizing a risk
scoring methodology has been endorsed by the NBB Board.

FSAP Participation and ROSC:
Belgium: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on
the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics:
Banking Supervision, Securities Regulation, Insurance Supervision and
Regulation, and Securities Settlement Systems

IMF Country Report
No. 06/75

Summary: The 2006 FSAP found that the financial system was resilient and benefited from a
number of Belgium-specific features that helped stability. The report outlined that near-term
vulnerabilities appeared low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant banking system, the
generally benign international financial environment, the strong financial condition of the corporate
sector, and the relatively healthy financial position of the household sector. Nevertheless, identified
risks may increase with a downturn in the business cycle, the increased cross -border operations, and
deeper links to the global money centers.
Maintaining the soundness of the financial system and safeguarding financial stability would, in the
short run, call for actions aimed at: (i) addressing identified weaknesses in the supervision of the
insurance sector; (ii) establishing an effective mechanism for consolidated supervision of the
bancassurance groups; (iii) devoting adequate resources and capacity to the oversight and
supervision of the Euroclear Group/Euroclear Bank; (iv) putting in place an overarching corpora te
governance framework applicable to the financial sector; (v) continuing to place emphasis on
liquidity management; and (vi) further enhancing the existing crisis management arrangements.
The 2006 FSAP outlined that over the medium term, the main challenges were to: (i) ensure that the
authorities’ capacity to identify and address risks in the financial system keeps pace with the rapidly
evolving markets and increased complexity of financial groups against the backdrop of European

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

3

BELGIUM

and global integration; (ii) maintain vigilance over the financial sector’s expansion abroad to prevent
such a beneficial move from threatening the stability of the financial system; and (iii) overhaul the
supervision of the pension industry.
During the 2013 FSAP Update, staff assessed progress with the implementatio n of the 2006
recommendations. The report outlines that the authorities have made progress in addressing the
recommendations of the 2006 FSAP but many recommendations in the area of conglomerate
supervision and governance remain relevant. The new institutio nal model is a work in progress and
better communication and coordination between supervisory institutions is needed. Improvements
are evident in the intensity of banking supervision and the adoption of analytical too ls to support
system-wide monitoring, including the introduction of an intensive process for determining Pillar II
capital requirements, liquidity stress testing for the banking sector, and introduction of macro financial risk dashboard to monitor systemic and emerging risk. Funding and risk management
standards are being improved. Supervisory tools for monitoring group -wide risks need to be
upgraded. The crisis management framework, while updated for handling systemic firms, is in need
of a further upgrade owing in part to EU-wide developments.
Insurance supervision has been significantly strengthened although further work is needed,
particularly, in strengthening the solvency framework. Both bank and insurance supervisory
frameworks integrate vertical analyses of individual insurers with horizontal review of the sector. The
adoption of the new institutional architecture has allowed the FSMA to focus solely on market and
business conduct and the adoption of EU directives in the interim has addressed many of the
recommendations for the securities sector. The FSMA’s plan to adopt a risk-based approach to
conduct supervision must be adequately resourced. Pension regulation and supervision has been
strengthened. While pension funds remain the remit of the FSMA, there is currently a debate as to
whether this should be the responsibility of the NBB.

Belgium: Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—
Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 08/116

Summary: The report found that in many areas Belgium meets, and in some cases exceeds, the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code. The basic government finance processes are
supported by a sound institutional and legal framework. Roles and responsibilities in the budget
process are clear, with a well-defined separation of powers between the executive and legislature.
Fiscal information is provided through regular publications and extensive use of the internet. Budget
formulation is appropriately supported by medium-term macroeconomic forecasts and clearly

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETAR Y FUND

BELGIUM

formulated medium-term fiscal policy goals, and fiscal policy is presented clearly, and in a mediumterm context. Finally, audit processes are extensive and help improve budget management
decisions, practices and standards, with government financial decisions evaluated ex ante and ex
post by various institutions.
There is room to improve the quality and openness of budget processes: (i) there is limited insight
about the objectives and targets of government expenditure; (ii) the medium-term budget estimates
need to make budgetary decision-making more oriented to the medium-term; (iii) the presentation
of new policy measures and their medium-term costs could be clarified; (iv) and budget
implementation by departments and agencies could be streamlined. Information available to the
public on the following topics could be increased: (i) fiscal risk and tax expenditures in budget
documents; (ii) in-year budgetary data on local government and agencies; (iii) the content of the
final government accounts; and (iv) the governance of state-owned equity holdings.
Institutional arrangements for fiscal policy coordination could be strengthened by (i) reinforcing and
expanding the role of the High Council of Finance, including by providing additional institutional
safeguards as to its continuity and independence, and having the Council cover all important issues
bearing on fiscal policy; and (ii) converting the budget agreements between the federal government,
regions, and communities into published agreements which specify the targeted balance for each
partner and identify the measures needed to achieve this target.
Finally, internal audit processes could be better coordinated and simplified by reducing the number
of internal control and audit layers—which makes the Court of Audit’s recent Single Audit initiative
to minimize overlap, coordinate work programs, and to share common data and analysis,
particularly timely.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
In line with the relevant IMF Board decisions, a full reassessment of Belgium’s AML/CFT framework is
required. Belgium was last assessed in 2005 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and is
tentatively scheduled to undergo a new assessment to be conducted by the FATF in September
2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and
provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these comprehensive
databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium is a SDDS subscriber.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutio ns and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with EUROSTAT
requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts statistics. Unlike in
other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts statistics. Quarterly accounts
are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and quarterly accounts data are of good
quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which are based on unit
values, rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations and
quarterly data on general government operations since April 2007.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On May 10, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belgium. 1

Background
The economy has entered a second year of near zero growth amid persistent vulnerabilities. The
economy showed considerable resilience through 2011 both in terms of output and employment,
reflecting the effects of large automatic stabilizers and job subsidies, as well as the strong financial
position of the non-financial private sector which prevented a severe retrenchment of private
investment and consumption. However, the rebound stalled in 2012 as rising unemployment and the
weak outlook in Europe took a toll on consumption and investment: domestic demand contracted by
0.6 percent, and real GDP by 0.2 percent. Since 2011, Belgium has also fallen behind its main
economic partners (Germany, France, and the Netherlands) in terms of export performance, as unit
labor costs (ULCs) have grown faster, pushed by sticky inflation and wage indexation. To help
restore competitiveness, a real wage freeze is in force for 2013 and 2014. The revision of the
composition of the price index, in line with an updated consumption basket, is expected to moderate
measured inflation by an estimated 0.4 percentage points in 2013-14.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
After a prolonged period of political negotiations, the broad coalition government that came into
office in December 2011 was able to take decisive action which contributed to a marked
improvement of financial market conditions for Belgium. Specifically, the government undertook
significant fiscal consolidation, introduced ambitious reforms to pensions and unemployment
insurance, and decided on a further devolution of powers to the regions and communities.
Consolidation efforts reduced the structural fiscal deficit by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2012. However,
the headline deficit rose from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 3.9 percent in 2012, reflecting cyclical
factors and a further recapitalization of the Dexia Group in late 2012. Notwithstanding these efforts,
the trend growth of primary government spending remains elevated due to widespread indexation of
public spending, occasional real increases in social transfers on top of that, and rising operational
expenses and employment at the level of subnational governments.
Demographic and productivity trends pose a significant challenge to Belgium’s potential growth
prospects. The interactions of the pension and unemployment benefit systems, as well as various
schemes to promote partial employment have created unemployment traps and encouraged early
departure from the labor force. As a result, the employment rate has been structurally low
(67 percent of working age population in 2011). The government undertook important reforms
in 2012 to increase incentives to work, with the objective of raising the employment rate to
73 percent by 2020. At the same time, total factor productivity growth has also slowed significantly
over the past decade, undermining real wage growth prospects.
Financial sector repair has continued to reduce risks to financial stability. As a result of decisive
policy actions and divestment of cross-border operations, the banking system has become smaller,
less complex, and less leveraged. In the process, foreign ownership of banks has increased to
65 percent of assets, and government ownership to 16 percent of assets (i.e., Belfius, the
nationalized and rebranded banking arm of Dexia). A large and stable deposit base and the strategic
re-orientation towards the domestic market helped support domestic credit supply, while nonperforming loans have remained low so far. Supervisory action, deleveraging, and improved risk
management pushed banks to stronger capital positions, with aggregate Tier 1 capital ratio rising to
15.3 percent in September 2012. The largest part of legacy assets has been removed from the
balance sheet of banks, although KBC (the largest Belgian private bank) and Belfius still retain some
structured products (in runoff mode). Liquidity has improved and domestic banks have made
progress in repaying ECB Long-term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) support since the beginning of
the year.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the efforts undertaken by the government to consolidate public
finances and the result in improvement in market confidence. Notwithstanding these efforts, the
external environment remains unfavorable and the growth outlook continues to be weak. Directors
called for sustained strong policies to mitigate vulnerabilities in the fiscal position, competitiveness,
and the financial sector.
Directors emphasized that the weak macroeconomic environment, high public debt, and contingent
liabilities put a premium on maintaining a steady pace of structural fiscal adjustment. They agreed
that anchoring fiscal adjustment to a structural deficit target would have several benefits, including
more predictable policies, a reduced reliance on one-off revenue measures, and the ability of
automatic stabilizers to operate. In this context, most Directors broadly welcomed the government’s
revised 2013 budget and considered the targeted pace of structural adjustment to be appropriate. A

3
number of Directors suggested that an accelerated pace of fiscal adjustment would help strengthen
credibility and anchor expectations. Directors saw benefits in a clear rule-based multi-year fiscal
policy framework, which would ensure adequate burden-sharing across all levels of government and
consistency with overall fiscal targets.
Directors agreed that structural reforms should be accelerated to enhance productivity, restore cost
competitiveness, and boost labor supply, which would contribute to enhancing growth prospects.
They emphasized that further pension and social policy reforms, consistent with fiscal consolidation
objectives, are needed to raise the effective age of retirement and employment rates. Directors
noted that wage and price indexations reduce the economy’s ability to adjust to cost misalignments.
They recommended the authorities phase out price indexation and strengthen the link between
domestic wage developments and those in partner countries, while providing flexibility to correct for
past deviations.
Directors welcomed the important actions taken to preserve financial stability, and encouraged the
authorities to maintain the momentum to address remaining vulnerabilities. Directors recommended
that banks’ capital buffers be further strengthened in line with Basel III requirements and noted that
pressures on profits call for a regular review of the viability of banks’ business models. They
underscored the need to strengthen the national resolution and deposit insurance frameworks and
to sustain positive changes to supervisory practices. Finally, Directors considered that the
incomplete banking union in Europe has hampered the efficient intermediation of the liquidity surplus
of Belgian banks, but the tax advantage granted to savings account may have exacerbated the
problem. Directors recommended that taxation of financial income should be rebalanced in favor of
long-term saving regardless of the underlying financial instruments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
