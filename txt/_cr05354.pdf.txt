Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation, Fourth Review Under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility Arrangement, and Request for Waiver of
Performance Criterion
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with the Finance, Fiscal Affairs, Legal, Money and Financial Systems,
Policy Development and Review, and Statistics Departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Mark Plant
August 23, 2005
Discussions on the 2005 Article IV consultation and the fourth review under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement were held in Ouagadougou during May 24-June 9. The mission
team comprised Mr. Rogers (head), Mr. Geiregat, Mr. Gudmundsson, and Ms. Barkbu (EP) (all AFR).
The mission was assisted by Mr. Zejan, the Fund’s Resident Representative. Mr. Seck (World Bank)
attended the meetings as well.
The mission met with President Compaoré; Prime Minister Paramanga Ernest Yonli; Minister of Finance
and Budget, Mr. Compaoré; National Director of the central bank, Mr. Zallé; and other senior officials
and representatives of the private sector, civil society, and the press.
Executive Directors approved an arrangement under the PRGF on June 11, 2003, in the amount of
SDR 24.08 million (40 percent of quota). The first review was concluded on March 19, 2004, and the
second and third reviews were concluded on February 2, 2005. Upon completion of the fourth review, a
disbursement in the amount of SDR 3.44 million would become available.
Program performance under the PRGF-supported program was broadly satisfactory, notwithstanding the
nonobservance of one performance criterion. In the attached letter, the government reports on recent
developments and sets forth economic objectives and policies through 2006, and requests a waiver for
the nonobservance of the performance criterion for March 2005 pertaining to net domestic borrowing
(Appendix I).
Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and shares a
common fixed exchange rate and common external tariff with other members. Monetary and exchange
rate policies are conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO).
Burkina Faso has accepted the obligations under Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Relations with the Fund and
the World Bank are summarized in Appendices II and III, respectively, statistical issues are covered in
Appendix IV, and the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is presented in Appendix V.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Burkina Faso’s economic and policy performance in 2004 was strong. Growth remained
robust and inflation was low. The fiscal deficit widened, as programmed, as expenditures on
priority poverty programs increased. Despite the widening of the fiscal deficit, the external
current account deficit shrank as cotton exports reached a record high. Planned structural
reforms in the areas of tax and customs administration and fiscal transparency were fully
implemented. In addition, the cotton sector was liberalized with the establishment of the first
wholly private-owned cotton ginning companies.
Economic growth prospects have weakened for 2005 following a sharp deterioration in
the external terms of trade, which have reached a 25-year low. Real GDP growth is
projected to slow, inflation to increase, and the fiscal and external current account deficits
are projected to rise. For the cotton companies, given the fall in cotton prices in world
markets, some financial losses are projected for 2005. Growth in the medium term should
increase with a gradual improvement in the terms of trade and the implementation of
structural reforms.
The 2005 budget strikes an appropriate balance between the needs for fiscal restraint
and additional spending in support of the Millennium Development Goals. The budget
allows for the first wage increase since 1997 and additional recruitments of teachers and
health workers. The deficit is nearly covered by net external financing, but given the mix
between grants and loans, external debt indicators are projected to deteriorate temporarily.
Structural reforms focus on tax and customs administration, fiscal transparency, and
enhancing competitiveness.
The outlook is subject to important risks. Foremost among them is uncertainty
surrounding developments in world cotton and crude oil prices, as well as the euro-dollar
exchange rates. Presidential elections are scheduled for November 2005 and could give rise
to additional expenditure pressures. Finally, regional drought conditions and locust
infestation could spread.
The PRGF-supported program is broadly on track. The fiscal deficit was smaller than
programmed in the first quarter of 2005, but the quantitative performance criterion pertaining
to net domestic borrowing by the government was not observed because some expenditure
authorizations made late in 2004 did not clear the payments system until early 2005. All
other quantitative and structural performance criteria were observed. The staff and authorities
believe that the fiscal targets for 2005 set at the end of 2004 remain appropriate and
achievable.
The staff supports the authorities’ request for the completion of the fourth review and
for a waiver for the nonobservance of one performance criterion.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Burkina Faso is among the world’s poorest countries. Nearly half the population
lives on less than € 0.30 cents per day and the country is ranked 175th out of 177 countries in
the UNDP’s Human Development Index.1 About four-fifths of the population live in rural
areas and engage in largely

deforestation.
2.
Despite these challenges, the economy has responded well to the government’s
economic reform program. Real GDP growth has averaged over 6 percent per year since
1994, among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa—reflecting broad-based growth, including
strong growth in agriculture and livestock activities—and the exchange rate peg has
contained inflation. Macroeconomic management has been strengthened and structural
reforms have resulted in a more flexible, market-based economy. The poverty headcount
based on household surveys declined by 8 percentage points between 1998 and 2003 (to
about 45 percent) and the UN Human Development Index improved. Nonetheless, social
indicators remain low and some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) seem
difficult to reach.
3.
Increasing fiscal revenue has been a persistent challenge for the authorities. This
problem was accentuated by the revenue loss arising from the adoption of the WAEMU
common external tariff (CET) in 2000. Notwithstanding some progress since then, revenue
remains low by regional standards. In combination with relatively high spending levels, this
has resulted in sizable fiscal and external current account deficits.

The government has been successful in finding donor funding to cover most of
its financing needs, but much of this has been in the form of loans, putting pressure on
external debt dynamics. Large borrowing in the 1990s led to a debt overhang, which was

Burkina Faso’s track record of implementing Fund policy advice has generally
been positive. Burkina Faso has had five Fund arrangements since 1991, including four
under the PRGF (Box 1). To date, all reviews under the PRGF arrangements have been
completed, except for the first in 1993, and the authorities have implemented all structural
reforms covered by Fund conditionality, albeit sometimes with delays.
6.
Presidential elections are scheduled for November 2005. President Compaoré is
running against 12 candidates from the opposition parties and multiple voting rounds are
possible. Municipal elections are scheduled for February 2006. Regional security concerns
continue to disrupt supply lines, raising transport costs and reducing access to a traditional
export market.
Box 1. Fund Relations
The last Article IV Consultation was concluded on June 11, 2003. Executive Directors commended
the authorities for their sound economic policies and progress in structural reforms. They stressed the
need to achieve a competitive economy, capable of delivering sustained economic growth and faster
improvements in social indicators. Upon completion of the third PRGF review, Directors noted the
challenge posed by the deterioration in the external terms of trade and the worsening external debt
indicators. They welcomed the financing of the fiscal deficit in 2005 with net donor flows in the form
of grants, debt relief and highly concessional borrowing, but encouraged the authorities to strengthen
tax administration and resist additional spending pressures during an election year.
Burkina Faso has been receptive to the Fund’s policy advice, as demonstrated by satisfactory
implementation of four successive PRGF-supported programs. The authorities’ policies have
contributed to a strengthening of macroeconomic stability and sustained GDP growth over the past
ten years, despite exogenous shocks. Notwithstanding some delays linked at times to limited
administrative capacity, the authorities have made considerable progress in the area of structural
reforms. Their reforms have been geared at liberalizing the country’s trade regime, removing price
controls, and opening the economy to greater private sector participation, improving budget execution
and monitoring, reforming the civil service, and strengthening the tax and revenue administrations.
While the authorities have successfully reformed the cotton sector to increase its competitiveness,
faster progress will be needed in the energy and telecommunications sectors, where high costs remain
a key obstacle to economic diversification and competitiveness.

closely with the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization to move
supplies from surplus to deficit regions, and has indicated that the situation is under control.
8.
Following a period of deflation in the first half of 2004, inflation increased to
8.8 percent by June 2005 (12-month change), reflecting the rebound in food prices from
the five-year low reached in 2004. Nonfood inflation has remained low, despite an increase
in fuel costs. The real effective exchange rate depreciated moderately in 2004, as the decline
in consumer prices during the year offset the appreciation of the euro, to which the CFA
franc is tied.

The external current
account deficit (excluding official
transfers) shrank to 10.7 percent
of GDP in 2004, as improvements
in private sector savings offset the
increase in the fiscal deficit. Cotton
exports increased sharply due to
both volume and price effects, as
virtually all the cotton crop was sold
before world cotton prices began to
decline. This improvement was
sufficient to offset the impact of
higher world oil prices.

The external terms of trade began deteriorating sharply in the second half of
2004 and have reached a 25-year low. World cotton prices (measured in euros, to which the
CFA franc is pegged) fell to a record low by end-2004. Although rebounding somewhat since
then, they remain low by historical standards and world oil prices have continued to increase.
While cotton prices are forecast to continue rising in the medium term, the average price for
the 2006-08 period is projected to remain lower than in 2004,3 and well below the 30-year
average.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
The discussions focused on the three main macroeconomic challenges facing
Burkina Faso: (i) establishing the conditions for the resumption of high rates of economic
growth in the aftermath of the terms of trade shock; (ii) increasing public spending to
implement the poverty reduction strategy without undermining debt sustainability; and
(iii) enhancing external competitiveness in the context of the fixed exchange rate regime.
A. Economic Outlook and Growth Strategy
13.
The staff and authorities agreed that the growth projection underpinning the
2005 program (3.5 percent) remained broadly appropriate, although their assessments
of the risks differed. The mission noted that the terms of trade shock for 2005 was projected
to be worse than envisaged earlier and that downside risks to economic growth had
increased. The authorities were generally more optimistic, noting that cotton production was
substantially larger than had been projected and that the economy had demonstrated its
resilience to external shocks in the wake of the conflict in Côte d’Ivoire. Average inflation
for 2005 is projected to rise to about 4 percent for the year, based on price developments
through June and expectations of normal weather conditions for the remainder of the year.
14.
The authorities’ medium-term growth strategy focuses on maintaining a stable
macroeconomic environment and implementing policies to diversify the economy and
increase productivity. Given the large number of people who live in rural areas, the
authorities consider the development of rural infrastructure, agricultural diversification, and
enhanced agricultural productivity as crucial to poverty reduction. The accompanying
selected issues paper finds that there is considerable potential to diversify agricultural
production, and that important measures have been implemented to exploit that potential;
however, low mechanization, inadequate infrastructure, and the land tenure system are likely
to remain significant challenges to diversification in the medium term. The authorities noted
that their structural reform program attempts to address these concerns (see below). They
emphasized that their diversification strategy would benefit from the elimination of
agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries.
15.
A review of long-term growth trends served as a benchmark for the discussions
of near and medium-term growth prospects (Box 2). With a modest improvement in the
terms of trade over the medium term, the continued implementation of structural reforms,
and further improvements in infrastructure, real GDP growth could rise to about 6½ percent
by 2008, in line with the 10-year trend. This would be somewhat higher than the 5 percent
estimated by the World Bank to be necessary for the authorities to achieve their goal of
reducing the incidence of poverty to about 30 percent by 2015.4
4

Burkina Faso has no poverty baseline for 1990 by which to assess concretely progress to the MDG
pertaining to halving that rate of poverty by 2015. In addition, Burkina Faso, in consultation with the
World Bank, has defined the poverty line at € 0.30 cents per day. The World Bank has accepted the
authorities’ target as being at least as ambitious as the MDG target.

- 11 -

Box 2. Burkina Faso: Economic Growth Prospects
Following a year of exceptionally high growth (8 percent) in 2003, real GDP growth slowed to 4.6 percent in 2004
as output moved towards trend levels. The output gap was positive but shrinking in 2004.
The adverse terms of trade shock dampens Burkina Faso’s medium-term growth prospects. Output is expected to
fall below trend in 2005, as illustrated below for a projected growth rate of 3.5 percent.
Output is expected to return to trend in the long run. Growth is projected to increase from 5 percent in 2006 to
6½ percent in 2008. Trend growth averaged around 5.6 percent during last 25 years, but has picked up to 6 percent during
the last decade. Projected growth rates would be nearly sufficient to eliminate the negative output gap by 2008 on the
basis of the 10-year trend.
Higher trend growth rates could be achieved by the authorities’ strategy to enhance competitiveness and to
diversify agricultural activities. Productivity growth, through investments in new equipment and in education, would
improve competitiveness. Agricultural diversification would render Burkina Faso less vulnerable to fluctuations in cotton
prices.

B. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
16.
Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2004. The fiscal deficit, excluding grants,
increased to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2004, which was smaller than programmed. Revenue was
on target, rising by more than one-half
percent of GDP, and expenditure was
lower than targeted. The deficit was
fully financed from external sources,
including grants amounting to
4.4 percent of GDP, and all quantitative
and structural indicative targets for endDecember were observed.

17.
The staff and the authorities agreed that the fiscal targets for 2005 remained
appropriate. The fiscal stance was tighter than programmed in the first quarter, as both
revenue and expenditure were lower than projected. Nonetheless, there was an overrun in
domestic financing (see below). The authorities explained that revenue was weaker than
anticipated because of the nonpayment of compensation by WAEMU related to the tariff
reform of 2000 and delays in registering tax receipts following the computerization of
procedures at the tax directorate.5 Revenue has subsequently picked up and performance
through May indicates that the annual target of 13.3 percent of GDP remains attainable.
Expenditure authorizations in the first quarter were lower than planned because of the
delayed start of budgetary operations linked to the installation of new expenditure tracking
software. This problem has been resolved. Expenditures will be slightly higher than
envisaged earlier because of additional donor budget support (amounting to about 0.2 percent
of GDP). The mission advised against using the additional resources on expenditures that
would lock in future commitments. The authorities indicated that they would increase outlays
on materials, equipment, rural roads, and other capital projects. The budget contains
provisions for emergency food relief, which the authorities have been using to respond to
food shortages in drought-affected regions. The mission encouraged the authorities to
monitor the situation closely, in cooperation with external partners, and to ensure that
additional resources be made available should the need arise. Concerning other expenditure
areas, the authorities indicated that adequate provisions were made in the budget for the
financing of the November presidential elections, and underscored their commitment to resist
election-related spending pressures. The overall fiscal deficit excluding grants will rise to
9.6 percent of GDP, all of which is financed by net donor flows.

5

The authorities indicated that the WAEMU has not been able to pay full compensation for shortfalls
linked to the implementation of the CET. The shortfall amounted to CFAF 5.3 billion during the first
quarter of 2005. Payments are to be phased out at end-2005, and discussions are underway to
determine how to settle outstanding amounts.

- 13 -

18.
The authorities’ revenue strategy focuses on strengthening tax and customs
administration and broadening the tax base to avoid increasing the fiscal burden on
existing tax payers. No increase in tax rates is currently envisaged. Key measures
undertaken in 2004 included the establishment of the large taxpayer division and the
computerization of customs offices. In the first quarter of 2005, the authorities introduced a
new single taxpayer identification number and centralized tax collection responsibilities.
Future actions include the completion of a taxpayer census, the establishment of a joint taxcustoms brigade to conduct comprehensive audits of tax payers, measures to reduce
smuggling, and the introduction of an integrated revenue system. The mission and authorities
agreed that on the basis of these reforms the revenue yield could continue to increase on the
order of ½ percent of GDP per year on average, broadly in line with the experience since
2000. This would bring revenues in line with the WAEMU convergence criterion by 2015.
19.
The authorities’ draft medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for
2006-08 envisages a leveling off of expenditures at about 24½ percent of GDP next year.
The increase would be mostly for additional capital spending and, to a lesser extent, nonwage priority social outlays. About two-thirds of the draft capital budget is for rural feeder
roads, education, health, and water management. The wage bill would remain at about
5 percent of GDP, sufficient to allow for further recruitments of teachers and health workers.
The authorities were not willing to commit to a staff recommendation to decrease the fuel
subsidy to SONABEL (the state-owned electricity utility) in 2006, which amounts to about
0.6 percent of GDP (roughly equal to external debt service). They noted that the tariff
increase necessary to accomplish this in the context of current world oil prices could be
overly disruptive to markets and household budgets, already badly affected by the surge in
domestic fuel prices. Based on the revenue outlook, this MTEF would cause the fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) to rise to 10½ percent of GDP in 2006 and then to gradually decline to
10 percent by 2008. The strategy envisages donors financing most of the deficit.
20.
The increase in the fiscal deficit presents the authorities with two challenges. The
first is to obtain the necessary external financing. Average external financing for the 2006-08
MTEF would need to be some 50 percent higher than the average of 2000-04. The authorities
have identified sources covering most of the needs for 2006 (amounting to about 9½ percent
of GDP). The second challenge is to obtain financing on terms compatible with external debt
sustainability. On this count the indications are mixed. The authorities recognized the
importance of ensuring external debt sustainability, but indicated that this needed to be
weighed against the need to increase expenditures in support of the MDGs.

begin improving before 2015. This is also the case for most of the bound tests. The
accompanying selected economic issues paper analyzes the fiscal adjustment and grant-loan
mix of external financing that would be required to achieve a more rapid reduction in debt
indicators, and examines the relationship between world interest rates and debt sustainability.
22.
The authorities are taking measures to increase absorptive capacity to help
ensure that the proposed scaling up of expenditures would be effective. Donor
procedures for releasing budget support have been harmonized, easing the administrative
burden on the government. However, no such harmonization has been achieved for project
financing. The capacity of the economy to meet the government’s demand for goods and
services has occasionally been insufficient, leading to delays in project implementation. The
authorities are addressing these constraints through programs to support small and mediumsized enterprises engaged in construction and other services, and reforms in the area of
public procurement.
C. Cotton Sector Issues
23.
Cotton is the dominant cash crop in Burkina Faso, accounting for 70 percent of
merchandise exports and employing an estimated fifth of the population. The sector is
largely private, with the government owning a minority share of the largest of three ginning
companies, two of which were created in 2004 as part of the sector reform strategy. The
producer price consists of two parts; a floor price of CFAF 175 per kilo, which is set in the
context of the Interprofessional Agreement between growers and ginning companies, and a

Burkina Faso is in the first quintile of the World Bank’s country policy and institutional assessment
(CPIA) rating, and its policy-dependent thresholds are therefore higher than those for countries with
lower ratings.

ristourne (or bonus), which is based on the profits of the previous year. The ristourne was set
at 35 CFAF per kilo in mid-2004, before the world cotton price began to fall, resulting in a
record high producer price. Cotton production in the 2004/05 campaign also reached record
high and gross payments to cotton farmers increased by nearly 50 percent. Against the
background of the decline in world cotton prices, farmers and ginning companies agreed that
no ristourne will be paid in 2005/06, resulting in a 17 percent decline in the producer price.
24.
While the outlook for ginning companies has improved recently, financial losses
are still projected for 2005. At world prices and exchange rates of June 2005, and
incorporating average prices for sales already made, the staff projects losses on the order of
one-third percent of GDP, compared with one percent projected in the last staff report.
However, the companies were more pessimistic regarding the price they would receive for
their cotton, projecting losses at about one percent of GDP. The companies also noted that
the impact of low world cotton price had been exacerbated by the appreciation of the euro,
which they argued had eroded competitiveness.
25.
The government reiterated its policy of allowing the cotton companies and
farmers to find their own solution to low world prices without direct government
financial support to cover losses. The government would continue to support the sector
through donor-funded projects to improve infrastructure, enhance productivity, and
undertake research. In addition, the 2005 budget contains a small amount (CFAF 3 billion) to
help offset the impact of higher fertilizer prices on farmers’ costs arising from the disruption

- 16 -

of supply routes through Côte d’Ivoire. The mission advised against raising the fertilizer
subsidy in response to the rising world price, noting that the subsidy was meant to provide
temporary relief while companies found alternative supply routes, and not to insulate farmers
from changing world prices. Furthermore, the mission noted that with farmers’ record
incomes from the 2004/05 campaign, it was difficult to justify additional income support,
especially given the other demands on government resources. It was thus agreed to keep the
subsidy at the current level.
D. Financial Sector Issues
26.
Monetary policy is conducted at the regional level by the BCEAO with the
objective of sustaining price stability through the exchange rate peg. Credit to the
economy is projected to slow during the second half of 2005 in response to the increase in
reserve requirements noted earlier. However, given the need for some domestic bank
financing for fiscal operations, overall domestic credit would continue to expand and net
foreign assets of the banking system are projected to decline in 2005. In the medium term,
with a gradual reduction in domestic borrowing by the government, the banking system
should be able to rebuild net foreign assets in the while providing for an adequate expansion
of credit to the economy.
27.
The monetary authorities indicated that the banking system is basically sound.
All but one of the eight commercial banks met the minimum risk-weighted capital
requirement at end-2004. After rising during 2004, the ratio of non-performing loans to total
loans fell during the first quarter of 2005. Compliance with the other prudential ratios is
mixed, notably those applying to loan concentration risk and portfolio quality. Concentration
risk stems from the existence of a few relatively large borrowers, including in the cotton
sector. Commercial banks hold some open positions vis-à-vis the cotton sector, as loans are
secured by cotton inventories. However, with the recent rebound in world prices, and the
other assets of the cotton companies, the banks indicated that the risk was manageable.
28.
The authorities continue to push ahead with reforms to improve financial
intermediation and strengthen credit services for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). Bank representatives indicated that constraints for financial development,
particularly for lending to SMEs, include insufficient long-term sources of funding,
difficulties in obtaining and realizing guarantees, and the low quality of loan applications.
The recently established Maison de l’Entreprise is helping SMEs with accounting and
administrative procedures. However, the national strategy for microfinance continues to be
subject to delays. The government intends to establish a housing bank as a minority
shareholder in partnership with private sector participants. The staff recommended against
the government’s proposal to take an initial 100 percent share in the bank, but to wait until
all partners were ready to pay in their shares simultaneously.

- 17 -

E. External Policies and Regional Integration
29.
The authorities continue to have difficulties obtaining debt relief from non-Paris
Club bilateral creditors. Agreements were signed with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, but none
have been signed with Algeria, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Libya, or Taiwan Province of China,
despite the authorities’ repeated efforts. The authorities indicated that the terms of the
Kuwait agreement were comparable with those of Paris Club creditors at the time of the
completion point, but that those of Saudi Arabia were not.
30.
Trade reform in Burkina Faso is pursued in the context of the WAEMU. Tariff
reform was largely completed with the adoption of the WAEMU CET and Burkina Faso has
an unweighted average import duty of 14.6 percent that includes a 5 percent degressive
protection tax (TDP).7 The mission encouraged the authorities to phase out the TDP by the
end of 2005 as scheduled. They indicated that the issue would be taken up in the context of
regional discussions that will take place by end-2005. The mission also recommended
eliminating the special import authorization for sugar that requires government approval for
importing a minimum quantity. The authorities indicated the approval was pro forma and
since it did not set an upper limit on imports, it does not constitute a quantitative restriction,
and indicated that its purpose was to curtail the smuggling of sugar. The mission encouraged
the authorities to address concerns about smuggling through enhanced customs control and
they agreed to review the practice before the 2006 budget is submitted to the National
Assembly.
31.
The authorities view
regional trade integration as
fundamental to export
diversification and indicated
their support for removing the
remaining barriers to intraregional trade. Other WAEMU
countries are the principal markets
for non-cotton exports, mostly
livestock and food crops. While
all WAEMU countries produce

declined every year between 1999 and 2002. Since 2002, the minimum and maximum rates have been
2½ percent and 5 percent, respectively. The TDP was supposed to be phased out by end-2002, but has
been extended twice.

similar products, there is some scope for exploiting comparative advantage and Burkina
Faso’s small size relative to the union as a whole indicates a potential for increasing its share
of intra-regional trade.
F. Competitiveness, Structural Reforms, and Governance
32.
The staff expressed concerns regarding competitiveness in light of the failure of
the real exchange rate to depreciate in the face of the deterioration in the terms of
trade. While there was agreement that the cotton sector is not competitive with the current
constellation of world prices and exchange rates, the authorities were confident that the
combination of a gradual increase in cotton prices and continued structural reforms would be
adequate to address these concerns. The authorities are preparing the energy and
telecommunications sectors for increased private sector participation and the National
Assembly recently approved a law amending the legal and regulatory framework of the
power sector, though more work with development partners is needed to make it operational.
While the authorities recognized the need for cost-based tariffs in the power sector, they
were not willing to accept the staff’s recommendation to move toward an automatic
electricity tariff mechanism. Competitiveness will also be enhanced through public
investments in the rural road and irrigation systems. The latter would support agricultural
diversification and help reduce dependence on rainfall, thereby reducing the volatility of
income and prices (Box 3). A review of the land tenure system, which is currently based on
traditional rights that inhibit land improvement and access to credit, is underway.
Box 3. Volatility of Economic Growth
Real GDP growth in Burkina Faso is volatile, and much of the volatility can be explained by
agricultural output. This volatility is of particular concern to populations in rural areas, which
represent close to 90 percent of people living below the poverty threshold, and whose resources are
barely sufficient to meet their basic consumption needs. Agricultural output constitutes between 20 and
25 percent of total output and is highly volatile because of its dependence on rainfall. The standard
deviation of the growth rate of agricultural output is 14 percent. This volatility transmits to GDP, as
can be seen from the high correlation coefficient of 0.7 in the table below. Volatility in output can to a
much smaller extent be explained by volatility in non-agricultural output, even though it constitutes
more than ¾ of aggregate output.

33.
Fiscal transparency and combating corruption are key components of the
government’s poverty reduction strategy. Members of the Finance Committee of the
National Assembly expressed their broad satisfaction with the budget preparation and
approval process, noting the high degree of cooperation with the Council of Ministers. The
government has also improved the timeliness of the submission of audited accounts and the
budget law to the National Assembly, which has strengthened the policy review process and
the national debate on economic priorities. As detailed in the issues paper, the authorities are
continuing to improve governance and further the fight against corruption. The government
recently approved a national strategy for good governance, and the four most egregious cases
of alleged corruption identified by the High Authority for the Coordination of the Fight
against Corruption have been forwarded to the tribunals and are under investigation.
G. Statistical Issues
34.
Economic and financial statistics are generally sufficient for purposes of
program monitoring, but weaknesses inhibit the quality and timeliness of
macroeconomic analysis and planning. The official national accounts have been finalized
only through 1999. In addition, the lack of high-frequency data hinders the timely and
accurate assessment of the effectiveness of policies and external debt data are subject to
errors and revisions. The authorities are taking steps to address some of these problems.
Staffing constraints at the National Institute of Statistics and Demographics will be eased
with a near doubling of the number of statisticians by end 2006. They also intend to develop
a plan to strengthen their capacity to monitor and analyze external debt statistics by end of
2005 in the context of a broader framework for monitoring external financing. Work will
begin soon on the 2006 census and household survey, and the authorities intend to launch a
village data collection program focusing on agricultural production, livestock, and social
indicators. Coverage of the consumer price index, which is limited to Ouagadougou, will be
extended nation-wide in 2006.
H. Program Issues
35.
The authorities describe policy implementation under the program in 2005 and
specify policies through 2006 in the attached Letter of Intent. The fiscal stance was
tighter than programmed in the first quarter of 2005. The end-March 2005 performance
criterion on domestic borrowing was missed because some expenditure authorizations made
late in 2004 (consistent with the program) did not clear the payments system until early 2005.
However, cumulative domestic borrowing from the beginning of 2004 through endMarch 2005 was lower than programmed, and on this basis the authorities are requesting a
waiver. Fiscal reforms are proceeding on schedule and all structural indicative targets and
performance criteria for end-March 2005 were observed. The current program expires on
August 15, 2006; the fifth review will be based on quantitative and structural performance
criteria through end-September 2005, and the final review will be based on quantitative
performance criteria through March 2006 and structural performance criteria through
May 2006. The authorities wish to discuss the possibility of a new Fund-supported program
in the context of discussions for the fifth program review. An ex-post assessment of

prolonged engagement with the Fund will be required ahead of any successor PRGF
arrangement.
IV. MACROECONOMIC AND PROGRAM RISKS
36.
The macroeconomic outlook is subject to a number of risks. The main near-term
risk stems from the weak terms of trade. Losses in the cotton sector may put companies
under severe financial stress, leading to weaker investments in the sector, slowing
improvements in productivity and undermining medium and long-term growth prospects.
There is also a risk that spending pressures will rise in the run up to presidential elections in
November 2005. In addition, the country remains vulnerable to drought and the locust
infestation spread.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Economic and policy performance were generally strong in 2004. The decline in
economic growth reflected a return of agricultural production to more normal levels
following record harvests. Inflation remained low and most program objectives were
realized. The government made notable progress in strengthening tax and customs
administration, which have been instrumental in improving revenue performance and
sustaining macroeconomic stability. Fiscal transparency and accountability have also
improved, strengthening the national debate on economic priorities and policies.
38.
The Burkinabè authorities now face three major challenges. First, to establish the
conditions for high rates of economic growth in the context of an unfavorable external
environment. Second, to increase public expenditure in support of the poverty reduction
strategy without undermining external debt sustainability. The solutions to these challenges
are mutually supportive. Higher rates of economic growth would increase revenues and help
limit the need for foreign borrowing, while increased spending on rural infrastructure,
education and health, would enhance Burkina Faso’s economic growth prospects. Finally, the
authorities need to accelerate the pace of structural reforms to restore high rates of economic
growth.
39.
The authorities’ fiscal targets for 2005 remain appropriate and achievable. The
easing of fiscal policy to smooth the adjustment to the terms of trade shock is appropriate
given the need to push ahead with poverty-reducing expenditures. The 2005 budget is
entirely financed with donor grants and highly concessional loans, which are crucial to
ensuring debt sustainability.
40.
The draft medium-term expenditure framework, which reflects the authorities’
desire to make more rapid progress toward the MDGs, would pose a moderate risk to
external debt sustainability. The staff considers the risk to be acceptable in light of the
substantial expenditure needs facing the country and given that most indicators would remain
below the policy-dependent indicative thresholds. However, the findings from the DSA
underscore the need for the authorities to continue their efforts in improving debt-service

- 21 -

capacity, notably by fostering the growth of exports. The staff urges the authorities to
proceed with their expenditure plans only if adequate financing on appropriately
concessional terms can be obtained, to ensure that the benefits of past debt relief are not
unwound by new unsustainable borrowing. In the same vein, the staff urges the authorities to
continue negotiating to obtain full HIPC debt relief from its non Paris Club creditors.
41.
Fiscal reforms correctly include steps to raise revenue through improvements in
tax and customs administration. The completion of the computerization of the major
customs offices and the introduction of a new single taxpayer identification number were
important achievements in this regard. The envisaged taxpayer census and the establishment
of the joint tax-customs brigade will help to broaden the tax base and improve tax
compliance.
42.
Other structural reforms appropriately focus on enhancing economic
competitiveness. Progress in this area is urgent given the sharp decline in the external terms
of trade. Pushing ahead with utility reform is especially important, as this will establish the
conditions for expanding and improving the quality of services, which will help reduce
production costs elsewhere in the economy. The mission urges the authorities to work toward
an automatic electricity tariff adjustment mechanism to ensure the financial viability of the
sector while eliminating the need for budgetary support to cover sector losses.
43.
The government has made notable progress regarding fiscal transparency and in
combating corruption. The timeliness of submitting audited government accounts to the
National Assembly has improved and the government has followed up on the report of the
High Authority on the Coordination of the Fight against Corruption. The government’s
approval of a national strategy for good governance should lay the groundwork for a
comprehensive approach to improving economic governance and reducing corruption.
44.
The government’s policy with respect to the cotton sector has served the sector
and the economy well. The sector has grown rapidly during the past 10 years, has generally
been profitable, and has shown substantial resilience to external shocks in the past. Financial
prospects for the ginning companies have improved with the rebound in world cotton prices
in the first half of 2005, but the possibility of losses remains.
45.
The banking sector, based on available information, appears sound and
adequately provisioned to withstand the recent price shocks. The recent decline in the
ratio of non-performing loans to total loans is a welcome development. The staff urges the
authorities to monitor banks closely as the 2004/05 cotton campaign comes to a close and the
loans to the cotton companies fall due.
46.
The timeliness and quality of economic and financial data need to be improved.
Plans to strengthen the National Institute of Statistics and Demographics are welcome and
the authorities are encouraged to provide adequate budgetary resources. The authorities
should also take measures to improve the quality of external debt data to ensure that the debt
implications of fiscal policy can be quickly and accurately assessed.

- 22 -

47.
The authorities’ economic strategy adequately addresses the key risks to the
economic outlook and PRGF-supported program. Donors have indicated their willingness
to support structural reforms and other productivity-enhancing programs in the cotton sector.
The government has demonstrated its commitment to responsible expenditure management
and indicated that it will reallocate resources from non-priority programs should additional
spending for the elections prove necessary. While droughts and (to a lesser extent) locusts
contribute to highly volatile food production and prices, the economy has demonstrated the
ability to rebound quickly from these shocks in the past.
48.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been broadly
satisfactory. The fiscal stance during the first quarter of 2005 was tighter than programmed
and the nonobservance of the performance criterion pertaining to domestic borrowing by the
government was minor and temporary. Against this background, and on the basis of policies
set forth in the authorities’ Letter of Intent, the staff recommends that their request for a
waiver be granted and that the fourth review under the PRGF arrangement be completed.
49.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board decision on consultation cycles.

APPENDIX I

Ouagadougou, August 16, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington DC 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The government of Burkina Faso is implementing a program of macroeconomic
and structural reforms for the period 2003-06 with the support of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). An arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), for an amount equivalent to SDR 24.08 million (40 percent of quota), was
approved by the IMF Board on June 11, 2003. The program expires in August 2006.
2.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP)
supplements the one attached to my letter to you dated December 20, 2004. The
supplemental MEFP describes progress under the 2005 program and sets forth the broad
objectives and policies for 2006 and the medium term. The policies for 2005 set forth in
the previous MEFP remain appropriate, and we do not envisage a need for new measures.
3.
The economic program for 2005 remains on track. For technical reasons, the
performance criterion for end-March 2005 pertaining to net domestic borrowing by the
government was not observed, because some expenditure authorizations made late in
2004, in line with the program, did not clear the payments system until early 2005. As a
result, the ceiling was exceeded by a small amount of FCAF 0.3 billion. For this reason,
we are asking for a waiver of the nonobservance of this performance criterion. All other
performance criteria were observed. On the basis of this performance, and on the strength
of the policies set forth in the attached memorandum, the government requests that the
IMF complete the fourth review under the PRGF and disburse the fifth loan in the amount
of SDR 3.44 million.
4.
The government believes that the policies set out in the MEFP are adequate to
achieve the program objectives; However, it stands ready to take any further measures
that may prove necessary. The government of Burkina Faso will continue to provide the
staff of the IMF with the information required to properly evaluate Burkina Faso’s
progress in executing the policies contained in the attached MEFP. It will also continue to
consult with the IMF on its economic and financial policies, in accordance with the
provisions and practices of the Fund governing such consultations.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Jean-Baptiste Compaoré
Minister of Finance and Budget
Officer of the National Order
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

BURKINA FASO
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
of the Government of Burkina Faso for 2005-06
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS FOR 2005
1.
Economic and program performance during 2004 was generally favorable, despite a
sharp deterioration in Burkina Faso’s external terms of trade during the second half of the
year. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 4.6 percent, following a year of exceptionally
high growth associated with a record cereal harvest. Production of seed cotton increased by
31 percent in 2004 to a record level. Ample food stocks led to a reduction in food prices and
helped keep overall inflation low, despite an increase in transport costs linked to rising world
oil prices. The overall fiscal deficit (both including and excluding grants) was smaller than
programmed because of restrained non-priority expenditures; while outlays on priority
poverty-reducing programs were lower than programmed, they increased by 25 percent
compared to 2003. The combined effects of declining world cotton prices and rising world
oil prices contributed to an overall balance of payments deficit.
2.
The current outlook for 2005 is not appreciably different from the one set out in the
government’s previous MEFP. World cotton prices rebounded by about 16 percent during the
first four months of this year (measured in CFA francs), but they remain low by historical
standards and world oil prices have increased sharply. Thus, Burkina Faso’s external terms
of trade are still projected to reach a 25-year low. Against this background, we are
maintaining the projections of real GDP growth in 2005 at 3.5 percent. Inflation reached
7.2 percent in May (12-month change), reflecting the return of food prices to trend, as well as
the impact of rising world oil prices. Food price inflation should soon ease with normal
weather conditions and world oil prices are projected to stabilize around recent levels. On
this basis, overall inflation is projected to average about 4 percent for the year as a whole,
while core inflation (excluding food and beverages) should average about 2¼ percent.
3.
The fiscal stance was tighter than programmed in the first quarter, despite a
temporary shortfall in cash revenue. The revenue shortfall had two causes: (i) the nonpayment of compensation related to the tariff reform of 2000 by the West African Economic
and Monetary Union; and (ii) delays in registering tax receipts following the computerization
of procedures at the tax directorate. Tax collection procedures have been normalized and
revenue collection through May indicates that the revenue target for the year as whole
remains appropriate. Expenditure authorizations were slower than expected because of the
delayed start of budgetary operations linked to the installation of a new version of the
expenditure tracking software integrating a new nomenclature for streamlined documentation
requirements. The new expenditure controls are now fully operational and aggregate
expenditures are proceeding in line with the program. While we will adhere to the overall
programmed expenditure ceiling for 2005, we intend to reallocate expenditures from nonpriority areas toward transfers to autonomous public institutions. In line with the program

- 31 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

adjustor pertaining to excess balance of payments assistance, we are in the process of
identifying priority social programs that could effectively absorb the extra CFAF 6.1 billion
in budget support for which we have received assurances in 2005. Improvements in tax and
customs administration have been proceeding as scheduled and all structural performance
criteria and benchmarks for end-March were observed (Table 4).
4.
The outlook for the cotton sector has improved somewhat since the end of 2004, but
the situation remains difficult. Cotton producers received CFAF 210 per kilo of seed cotton
for the 2004/05 harvest (including a ristourne of CFAF 35 per kilo), an historical high. Gross
payments to cotton farmers increased by 48 percent during the 2004/05 campaign to
CFAF 130 billion (also a record high). Cotton ginning companies and the farmers association
recently confirmed the producer price for the 2005/06 season at CFAF 175 per kilo for seed
cotton and agreed that no ristourne would be paid. As noted in our previous MEFP, the
cotton sector in Burkina Faso is largely private, with the government owning a minority
share in one of three companies, and the interprofessional agreement between the farmers
association and other shareholders in the cotton companies has served the sector well. If
cotton companies incur financial losses because of the recent decline in world cotton prices,
shareholders would be expected to find an internal solution. For its part, the government
provided for a fertilizer subsidy in the 2005 budget to help the sector adjust to the increase
transport costs associated with the disruption in normal supply routes because of regional
security disturbances. The government will also continue to support the cotton sector by
actively seeking donor assistance to accelerate improvements in competitiveness and
diversification. We will also continue to push for the removal of cotton subsidies by
industrialized countries.
5.
We are continuing to strengthen our efforts to improve governance and fight
corruption. The four most egregious cases of alleged corruption documented in the 2003
report of the High Authority for the Coordination of the Fight Against Corruption have been
forwarded to the tribunals and are being investigated. In total, the Ministry of Justice is
conducting six investigations of fraud involving public funds. The High Authority also
drafted the National Strategy to Fight Corruption, which was discussed with civil society in a
workshop in December 2004. This strategy is part of the broader National Strategy for Good
Governance, an updated version of which was adopted by the Council of Ministers in
July 2005.
6.
We have continued to make progress in implementing structural reforms to support
private-sector led economic growth, principally through our privatization program,
regulatory reform, and reducing bureaucratic barriers to private investment. In March 2005,
the Council of Ministers approved a new strategy for privatizing the national
telecommunications company (ONATEL) under which a majority of shares will be sold to a
qualified private operator. The National Assembly approved a new law in May that amends
the legal and regulatory framework for the power sector. Bids were received to perform the
audits of SONABEL and SONABHY and are currently being evaluated. In May, the Council
of Ministers approved the creation of a center for business registration that consolidates and

- 32 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

simplifies administrative requirements (including the reduction of administrative fees) for
establishing businesses. A center of arbitration was created to expedite the resolution of labor
disputes. We have decided to postpone the adoption of the strategy for the microfinance
sector in order to benefit from a mission of high-level experts to analyze the experience of
the sector in other countries, and from the results of discussions at the sub-regional level
being held by the BCEAO.
The PRSP and Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework for 2006-07
7.
The government recently published its poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) for
2004-06, as well as the priority action plan (PAP). The PRSP is founded on four pillars:
(i) accelerating broad-based economic growth; (ii) promoting access to basic social services
by the poor; (iii) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the poor; and
(iv) promoting good governance. While the PRSP is revised every three years, the PAP is
updated annually and incorporates the rolling three-year medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF), which aligns public expenditures with the objectives of the PRSP. In
this context, we are preparing the 2006-08 MTEF to be included in the 2005 PAP.
8.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework, which will underpin the updated
MTEF, will reflect a gradual improvement in Burkina Faso’s economic growth prospects and
the continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies. We envisage real GDP
growth rising to about 6-7 percent in 2008. The exchange rate peg, together with low world
inflation and normal rainfall, would contain inflation between 2 and 3 percent. Reducing
external debt vulnerability is a key component of sustaining high rates of economic growth
and ensuring that debt service does not divert an increasing share of scarce fiscal resources
from poverty-reducing programs. Consistent with this policy, we will be seeking levels of
grant financing consistent with a gradual decline in the overall fiscal deficit including grants,
and give high priority to highly concessional loans. This strategy will also help reduce
pressure on the external current account and allow Burkina Faso to play a role in maintaining
adequate international reserves at the BCEAO. The medium-term economic framework will
be finalized by end 2005.
9.
Real GDP growth in 2006 is currently projected at 5.0 percent and inflation at
2 percent. On the basis of continued improvements in tax and customs administration and the
inherent buoyancy of the tax structure, we anticipate that fiscal revenue will increase to about
14 percent of GDP. We are currently projecting the wage bill to rise on the order of
10 percent to CFAF 155 billion, primarily reflecting the expansion of educational
opportunities, especially for girls, which will entail hiring more teachers. Continuing the
policy of waiving school fees for girls and increasing outlays on other priority social
programs, notably in the areas of health and rural infrastructure, would push total
expenditure and net lending to about 750 billion, amounting to about 24½ percent of GDP.
The overall deficit, excluding grants, would be nearly covered by net external flows. Total
budget support would need to rise to about CFAF 140 billion, of which we have identified
about CFAF 105 billion. In the context of consultations with our development partners, we
will stress the need to maximize the share of grants in the total financing package in order to

- 33 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

ensure that our poverty reduction strategy is consistent with external debt sustainability in the
medium term. If sufficient resources cannot be obtained on appropriate terms, we would need
to revise the proposed expenditure levels downward, undermining the attainment of the
Millennium Development Goals.
10.
Structural reforms will continue to focus on enhancing tax and customs revenues,
improving budget execution and transparency, finalizing the privatization of key utilities,
providing support to enhance agricultural productivity and diversification, and combat
corruption. In the area of fiscal reforms, we will put in place a fully operational Joint Brigade
of the Tax and Customs Directorates with an annual work program for 2006 by endDecember 2005. In addition, by end-March 2006, the Joint Brigade will conclude at least six
joint audits and submit its report and recommendations for follow-up actions to the Minister
of Finance and the Budget. We will also complete the taxpayer census in Ouagadougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso and submit to the Minister of Finance by May 15, 2006 a report that will
include the list of taxpayers and their taxpayer identification number. These three measures
would constitute structural performance criteria under the program. We also intend to
strengthen customs controls to reduce smuggling and to implement a new computerized
revenue management system in 2006. Other key structural reforms include: (i) the
establishment of an autonomous regulatory agency for the electricity sector and the issuance
of a tender for the selection of a private operator for the management of SONABEL (the
electricity utility) before end-June 2006; (ii) the issuance of bidding documents for private
sector participation in the capital of SONABHY (the oil importing company) before endJune 2006, and the sale of a minority stake by the end of 2006; and (iii) privatization of
ONATEL (telecommunications) by the end of 2006. A key medium-term objective for the
development of the energy sector is to eliminate the need for the subsidization of fuel.
However, there may be a need to maintain the subsidy to SONABEL in 2006 if the world
price of oil does not retreat from its current high level. This would only be done in the
context of other reforms set forth in our sector strategy recently agreed with development
partners.
PROGRAM MONITORING
11.
To monitor progress in implementing our program, the government has established
quantitative and structural performance criteria for March 2006 and indicative targets for
end-June (Tables 3 and 4). The program includes an adjuster on domestic financing for
deviations in external debt service relative to program projections. In addition, domestic
financing will be adjusted upward for a shortfall in budget support, up to a maximum of
CFAF 50 billion. The program allows the government to spend budget support in excess of
projected amounts on priority social programs, up to a maximum of CFAF 25 billion.
12.
We expect to complete the fifth review under the program by end-February 2006 on
the basis of results at end-September 2005, and the sixth review by August 15, 2006 on the
basis of results at end-March 2006. We also wish to discuss the possibility of a new program
supported by the International Monetary Fund in the context of discussions for the fifth
program review.

BURKINA FASO
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
Ouagadougou, August 16, 2005
1.
This memorandum of understanding defines the quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also sets the deadlines for reporting
data to Fund staff to facilitate program monitoring.
DEFINITIONS
2.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the following definitions of “debt,”
“government,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:
•

As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000, debt
will be understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to obligor by the lender made
on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, obligations, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods have been delivered or the services provided; and (iii) leases,
that is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified periods of time, which are usually shorter than the total
expected life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease)
of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement,
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) regional market, are included in domestic
debt for the purposes of this memorandum.

•

Government is defined as the central government of Burkina Faso and does not
include any political subdivision, government-owned entity, or central bank having a
separate legal personality.

- 39 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

•

External payments arrears are external payments due but unpaid. Domestic payments
arrears under the 2005-06 program are domestic payments due (following the
expiration of a 90-day grace period, except where the obligation provides for a
specific grace period, in which case that grace period will apply) but unpaid.

•

Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government accepted as such
by the government (including any government debt).
QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
Cumulative Change in Net Domestic Financing to the Government

Definition
3.
Under the 2005-06 program, net domestic financing of the government is defined as
the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government, including both the net bank credit to the
treasury as defined below, and other government claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking
institutions; (ii) the unredeemed stock of government bills and bonds held outside national
commercial banks; and (iii) privatization receipts.
4.
Net bank credit to the treasury is defined as the balance of the treasury’s claims and
debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Treasury claims include the cash holdings of the
Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central bank, deposits with the commercial banks,
secured obligations, and government deposits with the postal system (CCP). Treasury debt to
the banking system includes funding from the central bank (including statutory advances,
consolidated advances, IMF financing, and refinancing of secured obligations), government
securities held by the central bank, funding from commercial banks (including government
securities held by commercial banks), and Caisse Nationale d’Épargne Postale (CNE)/CCP
securitized deposits.
5.
Net bank credit to the government is calculated by the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO), whose figures are deemed valid within the context of the program. The
stock of treasury bills and other government debt is calculated by the Ministry of Finance.
6.
At end-March 2005, net domestic financing of the government was
CFAF 27.2 billion, made up of CFAF 39.8 billion in changes in net bank credit to the
government and CFAF -12.6 billion in nonbank financing.
Quantitative performance criterion/indicative targets
7.
The ceiling on the cumulative change (from January 1, 2005 onward) in net domestic
financing of the government is set at CFAF 25.3 billion at June 30, 2005, and
CFAF 4.2 billion at September 30, 2005. These ceilings represent an indicative target at endJune 2005 and a performance criterion at end-September 2005. The ceiling is programmed at
CFAF 8,9 billion at December 31, 2005 and (from January 1, 2006 onward) at
CFAF 14.8 billion at March 31, 2006. These figures will be re-examined and set as an

- 40 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

indicative target at end-December 2005 and a performance criterion at end-March 2006
during the fifth program review.
Adjustment
8.
The ceilings on the cumulative change in net domestic financing to the government
will be subject to adjustment when actual disbursements differ from program forecasts of
external budgetary assistance. When disbursements exceed forecasts, the ceilings will be
adjusted downward by the amount of excess disbursements, with the exception of up to a
maximum of CFAF 25 billion in expenditure for priority social programs. In contrast, when
disbursements fall short of forecasts, the ceilings will be adjusted upward by the amount of
the shortfall. However, upward adjustments of ceilings are limited to a maximum of
CFAF 50 billion at end-December 2005 and CFAF 50 billion at end-December 2006. In
addition, the ceiling will be adjusted for deviations in external debt service relative to
program projections.
Reporting deadlines
9.
Data on net bank credit to the government will be forwarded monthly to the IMF by
BCEAO staff, and those on the stock of government bills and other government debt by the
Ministry of Finance within six weeks following the end of each month.
Nonaccumulation of Domestic Payments Arrears
Definition
10.
The government undertakes not to accumulate any new domestic payments arrears on
government obligations. The treasury keeps records of domestic payments arrears on
government obligations and records pertinent repayments.
Performance criterion
11.
The government will not accumulate any domestic payments arrears on government
obligations in 2005 and 2006. Said nonaccumulation of domestic payments arrears is a
performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
12.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of domestic arrears on
government obligations will be reported monthly within four weeks following the end of
each month.
Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears
Performance criterion
13.
The government’s external debt is the stock of debt owed or guaranteed by the
government. External payments arrears are external payments due but unpaid on the due

- 41 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

date. Under the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments
arrears on its debt, with the exception of external payments arrears arising from government
debt being renegotiated with external creditors, including non-Paris Club bilateral creditors
and multilateral creditors participating under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Nonaccumulation
of external payments arrears is a performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
14.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external payments
arrears will be forwarded monthly within four weeks following the end of each month.
Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed
by the Government of Burkina Faso
Performance criterion
15.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any external debt maturing in
one year or more with a grant element of less than 35 percent (calculated using the interest
reference rate for borrowed foreign currencies provided by the IMF). This performance
criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted by the IMF’s Executive Board on
August 24, 2000,1 but also to all commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has
not been received. However, this performance criterion does not apply to treasury bills and
bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market. This commitment is a
performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
16.
Details on any government loan (terms of the loan and creditors) must be reported
monthly within four weeks of the end of each month. The same requirement applies to
guarantees extended by the government.
Government Short-Term External Debt
17.
The government undertakes not to accumulate or guarantee any new external debt
with a contractual maturity of less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only
to debt as defined in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt, adopted by the IMF’s Executive Board on August 24, 2000, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Excluded from
this performance criterion are import- and export-related loans and treasury bills and bonds
issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional market and normal short term suppliers’
credits of one year or less. This obligation is a performance criterion to be observed
1

See para. 2.

ATTACHMENT II

continuously. As of March 31, 2005, the government of Burkina Faso had no short-term
external debt.
Other Quantitative Indicative Targets
18.
The program also includes indicative targets on the basic balance of the government
budget, total government revenue, current expenditure, the government’s wage bill, and
expenditure committed but not authorized.
Definitions
19.
The basic balance of government financial operations is defined as the difference

lending. It is made up of the wage bill, expenditure on goods and services, interest on the
debt (domestic and external), transfers, subsidies, and other current expenditure.
23.
The wage bill is defined as the entire government payroll (on a commitment basis),
including wages and benefits for all permanent and temporary civilian and military

Expenditure committed for which a payment order has not been issued (DENM) is
defined as all expenditure proposed for commitment that has been certified by the financial
comptroller (including HIPC Initiative expenditure) but for which the payment authorization
(mandat) has not been issued and forwarded to the treasury. Its stock is valued according to
the statement of government budgetary execution, which is established monthly in the central
government’s financial operations table prepared by the SP-PPF, in collaboration with the
other directorates of the Ministry of Finance and Budget.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
west African states, which includes Burkina Faso. An on-site safeguards assessment of the
BCEAO was completed in March 2002 and proposed specific remedies to alleviate
vulnerabilities that were identified by staff. Although Fund staff and BCEAO authorities
disagreed on the initial modalities of the recommendations, the following specific
understandings were subsequently reached regarding the key remedies. An updated
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO is underway.

1

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms
at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in
NPV terms at the decision point. Hence, these two amounts can not be added.
2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

Financial reporting framework. Fund staff recommended that the BCEAO formally adopt
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and publish a complete set of financial statements,
including detailed explanatory notes. It was agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that
the BCEAO will strive to improve its financial and accounting reporting by aligning its
practices with those recommended by IAS, as adopted internationally by other central
banks.
Internal controls system. The staff noted that the absence of oversight of the bank’s
governance, financial reporting, and internal control practices by an entity external to the
management of the BCEAO represented a significant risk. It was agreed between the
BCEAO and Fund staff that, after seeking the opinion of the external auditor (Commissaire
Contrôleur), BCEAO staff will propose to the BCEAO Board of Directors that it adopt a
resolution whereby the external auditor will be required to apprise the Board of
Directors, during its annual review and approval of the financial statements, of the
state and quality of internal controls within the bank.
Based on the 2001 financial statements, the staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the
explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled for the next
fiscal year, with a view toward a graduate alignment with IAS accounting to the extent
applicable to central banks by 2005. The external auditor has apprised the Board of Directors
of the BCEAO of the quality of internal controls in June 2003, and the financial statements
for the year 2001 were published on the bank's website. The staff will continue its follow up
on the progress of the BCEAO in implementing the proposed recommendations as part of the
ongoing safeguards monitoring process.”
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Starting on January 1, 1999, Burkina Faso’s currency, the CFA franc, has been pegged to the
euro at the rate of €1=CFAF 655.957. The exchange rate as of May 3, 2005 was
CFAF 770.7=SDR 1. The exchange and trade system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers on current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultations:

The periodicity of Burkina Faso’s Article IV consultation is set in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board Decision on consultation cycles. The 2003 Article IV
consultation and discussions on a new three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) were held during the period February 17—March 7, 2003 in
Ouagadougou. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 03/197; 5/28/03) and the Statistical
Annex (IMF Country Report No. 03/198; 5/29/03) were considered by the Executive Board
on June 11, 2003.

APPENDIX II

ROSC/AAP:

An FAD mission visited Ouagadougou during May 7-18, 2001 to assist the authorities
undertake a draft fiscal module of a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC). The final report, which was issued in July 2002, found that Burkina Faso was
making good progress in a number of areas to increase the transparency and accountability of
government. But additional efforts are needed to bring a number of improvements to the
point of implementation, particularly with regard to expenditure tracking at the local level
and external audit functions. Initial discussions indicated that the authorities were in broad
agreement with the mission assessment. On July 31, 2002, the authorities formally adopted
an action plan based on the recommendations of the final ROSC.
The team, jointly with World Bank staff, also discussed a HIPC Initiative Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP) with the authorities. The aim was to assess the capacity of the public
expenditure management system to track poverty-reducing public expenditures under the
HIPC Initiative and the need for technical assistance to enhance that capacity. The mission
secured the officials’ agreement with the jointly prepared preliminary assessment; identified
the main needs for technical assistance on upgrading the capacity to track such expenditures;
and drew up a draft outline action plan. This plan identifies the main needs for further
technical assistance to improve tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures. The AAP has
been endorsed by the authorities.

Technical Assistance:

Significant technical assistance has been provided since 1989, more recently especially in the
fiscal area:

APPENDIX III

BURKINA FASO: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of July 15, 2005)
Partnership in Burkina Faso’s Development Strategy
1.
Government’s development strategy. The government of Burkina Faso outlined
its development strategy in a revised PRSP (PRSP-2) adopted by the Council of
Ministers on October 27, 2004, along with a Priority Action Program (PAP). The PAP
translates strategic direction into sequenced actions and strengthens results-based
monitoring and evaluation of the PRSP. The revised PRSP and accompanying PAP were
presented to World Bank and IMF Board on May 3, 2005. PRSP-2 reaffirms the four
interrelated pillars as identified in the first PRSP, namely: (i) accelerating broad-based
growth; (ii) promoting access to social services; (iii) increasing employment and incomegenerating activities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance.
2.
Partnership with the Fund. The Fund has supported Burkina Faso under three
arrangements under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility between 1993 and 2002,
and the authorities are currently receiving support under a fourth PRGF arrangement
covering 2003-06. The first review of the latter arrangement was completed in
March 2004, and the second and third reviews were completed in February 2005.
3.
The Fund takes the lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies and
monitors macroeconomic performance through quantitative performance criteria. In
addition, it has established structural performance criteria in the areas of tax policy,
financial transparency and good governance, and trade policy. The Bank is supporting the
implementation of the PRSP in the areas of public finance management, good
governance, decentralization, health, education, and cotton reform through a series of
poverty reduction support credits (PRSC), complemented with a portfolio of specific
projects to address issues relating to HIV/AIDS, basic education, infrastructure
investments in transport, water and urban areas, rural development, private sector
development, and statistical capacity building.
The FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy
4.
Lessons from past support to Burkina. The 2000 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) Completion Report concludes that development outcomes in FY01-05 were
satisfactory, as was Bank performance in supporting implementation of the strategy. Key
lessons from the past CAS have shaped the strategy for FY06-09. First, strong country
commitment and consistent policy reform have succeeded in creating an environment
more conducive to growth. Second, a more aggressive approach to economic
diversification and administrative decentralization will be required in order to accelerate
growth and make it more inclusive. Third, the CAS needs to do more to support
strengthening of national capacity and country systems, in order to get better results and
sustain them. Finally, IDA and other external partners must use the next few years to

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

translate principles of harmonization into reality, in order to reduce the burden of aid
management for Burkina.
5.
The FY06-09 CAS was discussed by the Bank’s Board on June 28, 2005. This
CAS supports the pillars of the revised CSLP with analytic work, technical advice, ongoing operations and new financing. It is built around a results framework that explicitly
defines the assumed causal links between IDA-supported activities, direct outcomes of
these activities and the country’s higher-level development outcomes. IDA will seek to
contribute to the following outcomes:
•

Accelerated and shared growth. IDA will support enhanced regional integration,
expanded and diversified export earnings, an improved investment climate,
decentralized urban development to promote urban-rural linkages, and economic
infrastructure needed to reduce factor costs and stimulate private sector investment
and growth.

•

Improved access to basic social services. IDA will continue to support access to
basic education and improved quality of teaching, expanded coverage of basic health
care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and increased access to clean water and
sanitation, particularly in urban areas. IDA will also provide technical input for better
targeting of social protection to the most vulnerable groups.

•

Increased employment and income opportunities for the poor. A two-pronged
approach will focus, first, on the labor market and employment strategy for urban
workers. Second, IDA will support efforts to reduce risk, increase revenues, upgrade
economic and market infrastructure and enhance women’s opportunities in rural
areas, along with promoting community-based land and natural resource management
for sustainable development.

•

Better governance with greater decentralization. Governance affects the
achievement of development outcomes across all strategic pillars and sectors. Efforts
to enhance governance and accountability will be integral to all IDA-supported
activities. Particular emphasis will be placed on supporting a more efficient judiciary,
promoting public resource management and increased decentralization and
strengthening local capacity and participation in public policy decisions.

6.
The PRSP-2 provides the framework in which the FY06-09 CAS can contribute
to Burkina Faso’s development objectives. Given the country context, recent progress
and medium-term prospects, the main challenges for Burkina in the upcoming CAS
period can be summarized as follows: (i) maintaining commitment to reform despite less
favorable conditions for growth; (ii) overcoming long-standing obstacles to economic
diversification; (iii) improving the efficiency of public spending for social services, water
and sanitation; (iii) decentralizing development to enhance pro-poor growth; and
(iv) creating a public sector interface that inspires private sector confidence.

APPENDIX III

Assessment of Country Policies
7.
In close collaboration with the Burkinabè authorities, IDA has undertaken
substantial analytical work over the past five years to assess key social, structural, and
sectoral development policies and to identify policy and institutional reform priorities for
poverty reduction. IDA has relied on a combination of the PRSP and its annual progress
reports, a second priority poverty survey and two poverty profiles, sectoral policy notes,
and informal papers on specific issues, such as constraints in growth and
competitiveness, or the dynamics of poverty and income inequality. IDA has also helped
the Burkinabè authorities carry out analytical work in key sectors (education, health,
rural development, energy, transport, and private sector development) and assisted with
the preparation of a comprehensive economic study on long-term sources of growth and
competitiveness in 2001. IDA completed a public expenditure review in June 2004 and a
Poverty Assessment in July 2004; a Population Sector Work in April 2005 and a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in June 2005. IDA will continue to support
preparation and dissemination of participatory analytical work in the FY06-09 period
linked to strategic priorities. Areas of particular emphasis in the next few years will
include private sector development (Investment Climate Assessment, Financial Sector
Review, Integrated Trade Framework and Labor Market Study), sequencing of
decentralization, and understanding and addressing persistent malnutrition.
The Bank Portfolio and Proposed Lending Pipeline
8.
The Bank’s cumulative commitments to Burkina Faso as of July 15, 2005 amount
to US$1,578,635 million equivalent for 75 operations, comprising 69 IDA credits and
6 IDA grants.
9.
The current portfolio amounts to IDA commitments of US$465 million, of
which US$379.2 million is undisbursed. Two GEF Projects also complement the IDA
portfolio for a commitment amount of US$12 million, of which $4.0 million has been
disbursed. IDA’s portfolio in Burkina Faso is as follows:
•

The PRSC-5 approved on May 3, 2005 for US$46.1 million equivalent in credit
and US$13.9 million equivalent in grant will support the implementation of
PRSP-2 and its accompanying PAP. Under the growth and employment
objectives, PRSC-5 will support reforms in the cotton, rural, telecommunication
and energy sectors, as well as in the labor market, to lower factor costs, increase
productivity and favor new investments. PRSC-5 will also support policies in the
education, health, social protection, and water sectors with the objectives to
improve access and improve service quality. Lastly, PRSC-5 will support
measures to strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement, and control,
as well as public sector performance, decentralization, and environmental
management.

•

In the agriculture sector, the community-based rural development program
(US$66.7 million equivalent, FY01) aims at reducing poverty and promoting
sustainable development in rural areas. Its first phase provides for building local
capacity to plan and implement rural development projects, accelerating the pace

- 58 -

APPENDIX III

of public transfers for decentralized rural development, and supporting
implementation of the country's decentralization framework.
•

To support human resource development, three operations are being
implemented. In education, a basic education operation (US$32.6 million
equivalent) was approved in January 2002. The project provides support for the
government's ten-year basic education program, which will be implemented in
three phases, the first of which covers the period 2001-05. The main development
objective of Phase I of the ten-year program is to lay the foundation for
accelerating the development of basic education, while ensuring adequate quality
and financial sustainability. The Bank also assists the country with the
implementation of a new development learning center (US$2.5 million
equivalent, FY03) for distance-learning activities that will give the Burkinabè
access to the latest research worldwide. A HIV/AIDS disaster response project
(US$22 million equivalent, FY02) underpins the implementation of the
government's 2001-04 medium-term HIV/AIDS/STIs strategic plan, which has
been endorsed by the country's technical and financial partners. A US$5 million
supplemental grant has been approved on May 3, 2005 to complete the activities
of the original operation. In addition, the multi-country HIV/AIDS Treatment
Acceleration Program (TAP), approved in June 2004, includes US$18 million for
Burkina, to scale up treatment through strengthening the response of associations
of persons living with HIV/AIDS and the Ministry of Health.

•

A water supply project (US$70 million equivalent, FY01) aims at increasing
access to adequate and reliable potable water in Ouagadougou through expanded
distribution and tertiary water networks and improved urban water sub-sector
management.

•

A technical assistance credit for private sector development (Competitiveness
and Enterprise Development Project, US$30.7 equivalent, FY03) provides
support to implement the privatization program; improve the quality, access, and
cost of telecommunications, and promote the development of a strong indigenous
private sector in Burkina Faso through a streamlined business environment and
well-targeted financial and non-financial services to small and medium-sized
enterprises.

•

The Bank approved a transport sector project in April 2003 for US$92.1 million
equivalent. The project concentrates on rural roads as the rural economy is the
main source of income and employment for 80 percent of the population.

•

A statistical capacity building credit for US$10 million equivalent was approved
in March 2004. The project aims at improving policy decision-making, based on
timely and accurate quantitative and qualitative information, that help monitor
progress towards national development goals, including the PRSP goals and the
MDGs.

- 59 •

APPENDIX III

A power sector development project, US$63 million equivalent, was approved
in November 2004, with the aim to increase power supply through domestic
generation and investment in sub-regional inter-connectors for increased
electricity imports.

10.
The Bank’s proposed lending program for the FY06-09 period will consist of:
(i) one programmatic development lending operation per fiscal year; (ii) support to the
agriculture sector through an intensification and market diversification project and its
follow-up project, and the second phase of the community-based rural development
program; (iii) a rural energy project which will aim at increasing access to infrastructure
services, especially for rural communities; (iv) a capacity building project to support the
decentralization agenda; and (v) a Health/HIV/AIDS and an education sector-wide
programs. In addition, Burkina will participate in regional projects to improve
infrastructure networks and increase agricultural productivity.11
Bank–Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
11.
Cotton sector and energy sector. The Bank and Fund staffs jointly follow
developments in the cotton sector because of its importance for macroeconomic
aggregates and rural incomes. The Fund staff focuses on the overall financial
management of the cotton sector in order to limit spillover effects for government
finances and the banking sector. The Bank staff is accompanying the government’s
structural reform agenda in the sector under a series of PRSCs. These reforms aim at
creating a more competitive environment. The reforms have contributed over the past
decade to bought spun-off units from the former monopoly enterprise, prudent financial
management and the increased involvement of producer organizations in decisionmaking processes, including the setting of producer prices.
12.
Public finance management and good governance. The Bank and the Fund
closely collaborate in supporting the government’s reforms in the area of public finance
management and good governance. Important elements of the reform program are
enshrined in the government’s own action plan for the improvement of budget
management and incorporate the main recommendations of the HIPC Assessment and
Action Plan prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff and the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA). Recently, the Bank’s PRSCs supported the
establishment of a functioning Auditor General Office, resumption of regular
submissions of budget audit laws to the Auditor General Office and the National
Assembly, and revisions of procurement laws and regulations. The Bank’s PRSC series is
also supporting extensions of the computerized expenditure circuit to deconcentrate
budget execution and, together with sector-specific projects, is assisting with the
preparation for the political decentralization. The PRGF-supported program included
measures to ensure the effectiveness of the Auditor General Office, and the Fund has
given technical assistance in the area of tax and customs administration. Both the Bank

project and a West African agricultural productivity program.

- 60 -

APPENDIX III

and Fund staffs have followed jointly the government’s anticorruption policies, including
the creation of the High Authority to Fight Corruption. The Fund is focusing its support
under the PRGF on tax administration and tax reform issues while the Bank is supporting
expenditure management and control reform under the PRSCs.
13.
Promotion of private sector activity. Given the importance of private sector
development for accelerating growth, the Bank and Fund staffs take a close common
interest in policies that foster competition, as well as privatization. The Fund focuses on
trade policies and monitors the financial performance of public enterprises. The Bank has
taken the lead in assisting with the privatization of the energy and telecommunications
sectors and removing administrative obstacles to the creation of enterprises and private
investment. IFC and MIGA have intensified their support for private sector investment in
Burkina in the past year.

APPENDIX IV

Burkina Faso: Statistical Issues
1.
Burkina Faso has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since December 2001 and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). The metadata have not been updated since June 2001. Following the
conversion of the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD) into an
autonomous agency, its allocations in human and material resources were significantly raised
in the 2002 budget.
2.
Burkina Faso has received technical assistance under the government finance
statistics component of the regional GDDS project (funded by Japan) for member countries
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)12. A data module ROSC
mission visited Burkina Faso in May 2003.
Real sector
3.
Serious problems have been identified both in the area of national accounts and price
statistics. The INSD compiles the national accounts following the harmonized WAEMU
guidelines, which are globally in line with the 1993 SNA. Annual data are available on
estimates of GDP by economic activity (19 industries) and by expenditure categories at
current and constant (1985) prices, as well as by institutional sector accounts, a general table
of transactions and an overall balance of goods and services.
4.
The quality of the national accounts estimates is impaired by the scarcity of suitable
data sources and by deficiencies in statistical practices. In particular, the informal sector is
not properly captured, with estimates derived from the limited informal sector surveys
conducted in 1989 and 1996. With regard to administrative data, most of the medium and
small enterprises belonging to the “modern sector” fall short of submitting accounting
statements or tax declarations, although they are recorded in the directory of industrial and
commercial enterprises. Other deficiencies emerging from GDDS work on metadata are the
residual estimation of private household consumption in the absence of an adequate
framework to validate data (i.e., supply-use tables), and the use of an outdated base year
(1985) for constant price estimates. Plans for improvement under the GDDS include a survey
of the informal sector and the compilation of a health satellite account requested by the
Ministry of Health. The final 1993–1997 national accounts were published in 2001.
5.
The consumer price index compiled by the INSD follows the methodology of the
harmonized index adopted by the WAEMU member countries. The index covers only
expenditures by households living in the capital. Further restrictions are the exclusion of
non-African households, various types of purchased goods and services, as well as the
services of owner-occupied dwellings. The weight for the item “food, beverages, and
tobacco” (33.9 percent of the total) is very low in comparison with neighboring countries. A
possible explanation is that the survey from which the weights are taken did not cover a full
12

Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo.

- 63 -

APPENDIX IV

year. There are plans—dependent on finding appropriate funding—to update the weights.
The base year for the index is 1996. If a product is unavailable, its price is presumed to
remain unchanged for a period of up to three months. This is in conformity with the
WAEMU methodology, but best practices would impute a price change for these items on
the basis of the prices recorded for closely related products. The software package (CHAPO)
used for calculating the consumer price index needs some improvement. There do not seem
to be other major problems concerning the index, whose periodicity and timeliness meet
SDDS requirements. The index is published by the INSD and is also available on the
websites of the BCEAO and AFRISTAT.
6.
The authorities do not compile a producer price index or wholesale price index.
According to Burkina Faso’s plans for improvement posted on the DSBB, the development
of these indices is not envisaged even for the medium term.
Government finance
7.
Annual data are published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) through
2004. No detailed monthly or quarterly data have been reported to STA. The Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook database contains data that cover only 1984-93. These
data were compiled in accordance with GFSM 1986 methodology and have limited details
and coverage. The data relate only to budget operations and capital expenditure financed
through grants. No data are reported on extrabudgetary and social security operations, or on
operations from foreign financing. The compilation of GFS is constrained by a lack of
coordination among fiscal agencies, which could have a negative impact on the reliability
and timeliness of these data.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Preliminary monetary data for Burkina Faso are prepared by the national agency of
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and released officially with a lag of two
to three months. Most of the problems in the monetary statistics are not specific to Burkina
Faso, but concern all member countries of the WAEMU. One statistical problem arises from
the difficulties the BCEAO has encountered in estimating currency in circulation in each
WAEMU member country because of the large backlog of unsorted banknotes held by the
central bank in its various national agencies. A second problem has been the slower-thanexpected implementation of the new accounting system by banks since its introduction on
January 1, 1996. These delays contribute substantially to the lag in reporting monetary
statistics.
9.
Following technical assistance, although the BCEAO implemented additional
measures to accelerate the bank note sorting operations in order to expedite the reporting of
monetary statistics, the underlying problem was not resolved. Among other consequences of
this problem, broad money, net foreign assets and other monetary indicators have undergone
substantial revisions following the completion of the note-sorting exercise. In fact, the
African Department and the Statistics Department noted recently the issue of these revisions

- 64 -

APPENDIX IV

in three member countries in a joint STA/AFR letter of March 11, 2005. No response has
been received to date.
10.
A follow-up monetary and financial statistics mission visited the headquarters of the
BCEAO in May 2001. The mission reviewed the procedures for collecting and compiling
monetary statistics, and addressed the outstanding methodological issues that concerned all
the member countries of the WAEMU. The authorities agreed on an action plan for the
implementation of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and on the
introduction of an area-wide page for the WAEMU in the IFS, which subsequently took
place in January 2003. The mission discussed the provision of future technical assistance in
monetary statistics for the region.
11.
Following the recommendations of the 2001 monetary and financial statistics
mission, a regional seminar on monetary and financial statistics was organized by the
BCEAO in Dakar during April 22-25, 2003. Participants agreed to set up a working group of
representatives from the national agencies and various departments of the BCEAO’s
headquarters; the working group will follow up on the seminar’s recommendations to foster
implementation of the MFSM. In particular, a BCEAO-sponsored workshop in Dakar on the
classification and sectorization of units in the nonfinancial public sector is scheduled for late
2005. This workshop will build on the cross-cutting recommendations made by the ROSC
and multi-sector mission to several of the WAEMU member countries (Senegal, Mali,
Burkina Faso, and Niger).
Balance of payments
12.
Since December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics has been formally assigned to the BCEAO through area-wide legislation
adopted by the WAEMU member countries. The national agency of the BCEAO is
responsible for completing and disseminating the balance of payments statement, while the
BCEAO headquarters delineates the methodology and calculates the international reserves
managed on behalf of the participating countries. Data consistency has significantly
improved over the past few years, with a full transition to the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition (BPM5), improved sourcing methods, and the training of staff. This
improvement was supported by technical assistance provided by STA (a Statistical Advisor
was posted at the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar from July 1996 through July 1999) and
contributed to the reporting of better yearly balance of payments data in the framework of the
BPM5 for the period 1996-99. This improvement, coupled with the backward revision of data
from 1988 onward, has created a consistent series of annual balance of payments statistics.
The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance of payments statistics with a seven-month
lag, and annual international investment position data with an eighteen-month lag, in full
consistency with the recommendations of the GDDS guidelines. Regarding trade data, the
customs computer system (SYDONIA) was upgraded in 1999, and its installation in the main
border customs offices is complete; this allows for a better monitoring of import data and
should improve the coverage of informal trade. The further improvement of services and
transfers (especially workers’ remittances) coverage is clearly linked to the future
intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies. The ROSC mission that visited Niamey

- 65 -

APPENDIX IV

in 2004 found that the response rate for the survey among industrial and commercial
enterprises was only 40 percent; this implies that the authorities’ commitment to strengthen
the human and technical resources should be enhanced.
13.
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector
are still not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained
through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data. The organization of annual
surveys for the reporting of foreign direct investment transactions in Burkina Faso is still at a
preliminary stage. The BCEAO authorities have indicated that they are looking forward to
integrating two additional sources aimed at improving the quality of the balance of payments
reports: the regional stock exchange transactions, and the firms’ balance sheet database
(centrale des bilans). They have also indicated that quarterly data derived from banking
settlement reports will soon be used to assess the existing information. In addition, the
BCEAO has recently implemented a compilation system allowing commercial banks to
report data on payments involving nonresidents. The balance of payments compilers receive
payments statements every ten days; however, the information is not used in the compilation
of the annual balance of payments statements, but rather to support data quality controls and
to provide early information to the BCEAO authorities.
14.
The computer debt-management system software, SYGADE, developed by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), was introduced in 1999
and is fully operational. Information on debt disbursement has also been fully integrated with
the expenditure-monitoring system.

APPENDIX V

Burkina Faso: Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
This appendix assesses the sustainability of Burkina Faso’s external public debt
using the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) template for low-income countries. The DSA
was conducted jointly by Fund and Bank staff and included a loan-by-loan reconciliation of
the multilateral debt data. The macroeconomic scenario underlying this DSA is summarized
in Box 2 of the appendix. Based on the analysis of the baseline scenario and several
alternative scenarios, the staffs have come to the view that the country faces a moderate risk
of debt distress.
Burkina Faso’s debt situation at end-2004
2.
The focus of the DSA is on Burkina Faso’s external debt situation. While significant
in the past, domestic debt has declined rapidly in recent years in part because of requirements
by the West African Economic and Monetary Union – to which Burkina Faso belongs – to
phase out indebtedness to the common central bank. In 2005, domestic debt represents only
5 percent of GDP, and it is projected to decline further over the medium term.
3.
Burkina Faso’s external debt stock net of HIPC debt relief stood at USD 1.75 billion
at end-2004.13 Multilateral creditors accounted for 72.6 percent of this debt, including IDA
(49.2 percent), the African Development Bank (18.1 percent) and the IMF (5.3 percent).
Most of the bilateral debt is held by non-Paris Club members, some of whom have not yet
started providing their share of debt relief.
4.
In April 2002, Burkina Faso reached the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative. At the time, it was judged that exogenous factors outside of the government’s
control (such as falling cotton prices) had contributed to a significant deterioration of
Burkina Faso’s debt outlook and the country became the first HIPC to obtain an additional
topping-up under the HIPC Initiative. At end-2004, Burkina Faso’s debt situation looked
more optimistic than had been projected at the completion point (Box 1). Despite adverse
exchange rate movements and higher than anticipated new borrowing, at end-2004, the
country had an NPV of debt-to-exports ratio that was lower than the one projected at the
completion point.
5.
The latest World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ranks
Burkina Faso as a ‘strong performer’. Indicative debt-burden thresholds for countries in this
category are an NPV of debt-to-exports of 200 percent; to GDP of 50 percent; and to

The debt stock net of obtained HIPC debt service relief is used to measure the existing debt burden
of the country. The actual debt outstanding reported by the country and the creditors was
USD2.1 billion at end-2004. The two numbers differ because HIPC debt relief is provided only in
part as a reduction of the debt stock. Most creditors provide relief in the form of grants to help cover
debt service obligations for a limited period or in the form of a debt rescheduling.

To assess the risk for future debt distress, the staffs have developed a baseline
scenario and several stress tests that are compared against the indicative thresholds. The debt
service numbers underlying the analysis reflect any debt relief still to be delivered after 2004.
Sections B and C discuss the underlying assumptions and present the results of the analysis,
and section D concludes.

APPENDIX V

The Baseline Scenario
7.
The baseline scenario is developed for 2005–25. The medium-term assumptions for
2005–08 are covered in the Staff Report. The main assumptions for the subsequent years are
summarized in Box 2.

Box 2. Baseline Assumptions
The baseline scenario is developed for 2005-2025. The medium-term assumptions for 2005-2008
are covered in the staff report. For the subsequent years, the main assumptions are the following:
•

Annual real GDP growth is 6 percent. This is in line with the average growth rate over the
past 15 years and also reflects gains from sustained efforts to improve private sector
development and reduce government involvement in the economy;

•

Average inflation as measured by the implicit deflator of GDP is 2.1 percent, owing to the
peg of the currency to the euro;

•

The revenue to GDP ratio is projected to rise gradually from 13.9 percent in 2005 to
18 Percent by 2016 and stays constant afterwards, reflecting the gradual convergence of the
tax revenue ratio to the 17 percent WAEMU norm owing to rising incomes and improved tax
collection;

•

The expenditure to GDP ratio reaches 24.6 percent of GDP by 2008 from 21.4 percent in
2005, reflecting efforts of the authorities to make progress towards meeting the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), and afterwards remains constant as a share of GDP.

•

Cotton exports, which in 2004 were almost 70 percent of total exports, are projected to grow
at 10 percent annually in real terms during 2009–15 and at 5 percent thereafter. These
growth rates are more conservative than the five and ten year historical averages, which were
13 and 17 percent respectively. Growth will come from increasing the cotton growing areas
and from productivity gains, notably from using better crop varieties and increasing the use
of fertilizers.

•

Non-cotton exports are assumed to grow at 5 percent in real terms annually during 2009–15
and at 7.5 percent thereafter. The authorities have identified non-cotton exports as a key
sector for increasing economic diversification, and recent reforms in the mining sector and
ongoing efforts such as building a fruit and vegetables terminal support this strategy.

•

The export projections and the assumption that imports grow on average 7.4 percent
annually over 2008–25 (slightly less than nominal GDP growth) lead to a gradual
improvement of the current account deficit excluding grants relative to GDP, from
11.7 percent in 2008 to 4.9 percent by 2025.

•

Finally, the baseline scenario assumes that the grant share of the total external financing
need is 57 percent and 54 percent for 2005 and 2006 respectively, calculated from
information provided by the authorities. From 2007 onwards, the grant component is
projected to remain at 55 percent, which is more conservative than the ten year historic
average (60.4 percent).

- 70 -

APPENDIX V

8.
Under the baseline scenario, all but one of the external debt indicators maintain a
stable path for the entire projection period and remain well below their respective thresholds
(Table 1a). Only the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches its indicative threshold over the
medium term, but improves again in the long term. Between 2005 and 2013, the ratio
averages 218 percent before falling below 200 percent in 2014. The medium-term
deterioration in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is due to several factors, including the
medium-term run-up in expenditures (from 21.4 percent of GDP in 2004 to 24.6 percent in
2006).
9.
The deterioration in the ratio is compounded by the relatively weak export growth in
the short term, which in dollar terms is projected to grow by 5½ percent on average in 200506 compared to an average growth of 25 percent in 2002-04. Other debt burden indicators
such as the debt service ratios and the NPV of debt-to-GDP and revenue ratios remain stable
over the projection period. Until 2025, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to average
23 percent, and Burkina Faso would spend on average 9 percent of its export proceeds or
7 percent of its total revenues on the payment of debt service.
Sensitivity Analysis
10.
The sensitivity analysis shows that, again with the exception of the NPV of debt-toexports ratio, the indicators remain below their respective indicative thresholds, even under
stress (Table 1b). The projections for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio and the debt service
ratios are most vulnerable to the following three standard scenarios: (i) should export
projections remain subdued and grow at one standard deviation below historical levels, (ii) in
the event of a combined shock or (iii) if the terms of financing available to the country
worsen (bound tests B2 and B5 and scenario A2 in Table 1b respectively). The staffs
performed an additional scenario that assumes that the authorities achieve only half of the
projected increase in the revenue-to-GDP target 2015 (Table 1c). Under this scenario, should
the authorities not be able to compensate the lower revenues with expenditure cuts or a
higher grant share of their financing, the various debt ratios would not improve over the long
run, and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above 200 percent over the entire
projection period. Finally, under the standard historical scenario (scenario A1, Table 1b), all
indicators exhibit a sharp upward trend in the outer years of the projection period. The main
reason for the worsening of the indicators compared to the baseline is that the historical
scenario assumes that the non-interest current account remains at 8.9 percent of GDP leading
to a stark increase in new borrowing.14

14

The historical scenario also does not take into account the forward-looking export price projections
from the latest WEO.

APPENDIX V

Staff Assessment
11.
The findings from Debt Sustainability Analysis lead the staffs to conclude that while
Burkina Faso’s debt dynamics are sustainable, the country faces a moderate risk of debt
distress. The debt situation is deemed sustainable because, with the exception of the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio, all debt indicators remain well below the policy-contingent indicative
thresholds, both under the baseline and under the alternative scenarios. The NPV of debt-toexports ratio breaches the indicative threshold for some years under the baseline before
improving gradually in the outer years of the projection period. Taken as a whole, the staffs
do not view the temporary breach of that threshold as indicative of a fundamental debt
problem.
12.
However, the results from the alternative scenarios underscore the need for the
authorities to continue to implement their program of sound macroeconomic policies and
reforms, including towards achieving higher export growth and other growth-enhancing
measures. The alternative revenue scenario highlights the importance of maintaining efforts
to improve revenue collection. Those factors, combined with unwavering resolve to attract
financing at favorable terms—preferably through grants—would help Burkina Faso in
achieving progress towards the MDGs (as reflected in the ambitious medium-term
expenditure program) while containing the risks to external debt sustainability.

Press Release No. 05/207
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2005

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Burkina Faso's PRGF
Arrangement and Approves US$5.1 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth
review of Burkina Faso's economic performance under a SDR 24.08 million (about US$35.7
million) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No.
03/82). The completion of the review enables the release of a further SDR 3.44 million
(about US$5.1 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to
SDR 17.2 million (about US$25.5 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver of the nonobservance of the
end-March 2005 quantitative performance criterion on the cumulative change in net domestic
financing to the government.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Burkina Faso, on September 7, 2005,
Anne O. Krueger, First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The authorities of Burkina Faso are to be commended for their sound macroeconomic
policies and their progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Economic
performance in 2004 was relatively strong, despite the adverse external shocks that emerged
in the second half of the year, notably the sharp decline in world cotton prices and the
increase in world oil prices. Economic growth remained robust, inflation was low, and all
fiscal targets were met.
“The sharp decline in Burkina Faso’s terms of trade has reduced economic growth prospects
for 2005, and presents the authorities with substantial challenges. The authorities’ program
strikes an appropriate balance between the need for fiscal restraint in the face of this shock
and the need to push ahead with priority expenditures in support of the poverty reduction
strategy. Revenues have been in line with the authorities’ target and expenditures have
remained oriented toward key social services, notably health and education, as well as
growth and productivity-enhancing capital investments.
“The authorities are implementing reforms to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax
administration, in order to boost tax revenue further. Progress with other structural reforms to
enhance external competitiveness is urgently needed. A priority in this area is the power

-2-

sector, where the authorities should move toward pricing based on cost recovery. This will
reduce the need for budgetary subsidies, thereby freeing up resources for priority povertyreducing programs. Pushing ahead with the power sector investment program will help
reduce costs, improve the quality of service, and enhance competitiveness of the economy.
“The authorities are making progress in strengthening governance, as evidenced by the
follow up to the report of the High Authority on the Coordination of the Fight Against
Corruption, including the approval of the National Strategy for Good Governance. These
efforts will be bolstered with the forthcoming approval of a comprehensive strategy for
combating corruption.
“The government’s policy with respect to the mostly private cotton sector has generally
served the sector and economy well. The government has encouraged producers to find their
own solution to the recent decline in world cotton prices without recourse to budget
subsidies. With the assistance of its development partners, the government will continue to
support the sector through projects to improve infrastructure, enhance productivity, and
conduct research.
“The authorities’ draft medium-term expenditure framework envisages a scaling up of
outlays to accelerate progress toward the MDGs. The authorities are encouraged to proceed
with these expenditures only if financing can be obtained on terms consistent with long-term
debt sustainability. In this context, it will be necessary to attract external financing on highly
concessional terms, preferably in the form of grants,” Ms. Krueger said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs
are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5
percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Burkina Faso
September 7, 2005

On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank Management and the staff for their policy
advice and their appreciable work on Burkina as reflected in the set of well-written papers
before us today. I also wish to convey to Executive Directors my authorities’ appreciation of
their contribution to Fund’s assistance in Burkina Faso.
Key quantitative objectives of Burkina Faso’s PRSP comprise the MDGs and those set forth
under the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). These include, among
others, the achievement of an average real growth rate of 7 percent per year during the period
2004-2006. For 2004, the growth objective was set under the assumption of a favorable
external environment. Regrettably, recent adverse developments in oil and cotton prices
constituted a major impediment to meeting this objective. In addition, other factors identified
in recent studies sponsored by the government played a similar role as well, including limited
human capital, poor infrastructure, low access to international markets, and weak capacities.
Consequently, real GDP growth slowed down, but reached a still robust estimate of about 4.6
percent in 2004 against the backdrop of adverse climatic conditions and pricing
developments in the cotton and oil markets.
Despite the sharp deterioration of the terms of trade, down to a 25-year low, the external
current account deficit declined by 2 percentage points of GDP from 12.7 percent to 10.7
percent. In parallel, non-food inflation remained subdued, notwithstanding the oil price
shock. Despite recent inflationist pressures fueled by food price increases, the rate of
inflation is estimated to have been a single digit number as of last June.
On the structural front, the report is fairly indicative of the Burkina’s exceptional track
record of implementing Fund policy advice when staff notes that “To date, all reviews under
the four PRGF arrangements have been completed, except for the first in 1993, and the
authorities have implemented all structural reforms covered by Fund conditionality, albeit
sometimes with delays.” The significant efforts made in privatizing the cotton sector
translated into the current situation where the government is now only a minority shareholder
of one the ginning companies. Tax and customs administration as well as budget execution
and transparency were also among the key focuses of structural reforms. At the same time,
major reforms were implemented in the energy and telecommunications sectors.
In this Board meeting, my authorities are hopeful that Executive Directors will continue to
accord their support for the country’s policies and reform agenda. In this vein, my authorities
are requesting a waiver of nonobservance of the performance criterion for March 2005
pertaining to net domestic borrowing by the government. The nonobservance of this
performance criterion, rightly viewed by the staff as minor and temporary, was simply due to

-2-

technical difficulties that resulted in some expenditure authorizations made late in 2004 to
clear the payment system only early this year.
PROSPECTS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
Although real GDP growth slowed down since last year after exceeding 6 percent in average
over the past decade, it is projected to increase gradually toward this level in the short to
medium-term.
By then, Burkina Faso could face major difficulties, including the current food shortage. This
situation arose from the precarious climatic conditions that prevailed last year in the country
and resulted in a sharp decline in cereal production. The government welcomes the assistance
provided by the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization in coping
with this situation. To avoid the resurgence of this problem in the future, an action plan has
been developed by the authorities to boost cereal production and promote irrigation and
harvesting equipment, and develop rural infrastructure. Success in implementing this plan
may not be ensured if Burkina Faso—and other countries in the region facing similar
circumstances—fails to benefit from a special treatment by the Fund and the donor
community that would help the authorities mobilize the necessary financing. While such a
treatment could materialize into higher donor financing, concerns over debt sustainability
expressed below entail that any assistance provided takes preferably the form of grants or
concessional financing.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
The authorities intend to maintain in the period ahead a prudent fiscal policy, and increased
focus will be put on reducing the government debt burden. On the revenue side, the
authorities are determined to meet the challenge of increasing fiscal revenue. In this regard,
they are determined to enhance the coordination of tax and customs administrations and
finalize the taxpayer census. While making increased efforts to enhance revenue
mobilization, they plan to work on reducing the tax burden levied on private operators with a
view to fostering private sector development and improving economic competitiveness.
On the expenditure side, the authorities are aware of the need to preserve priority social
expenditures in the face of adverse exogenous shocks. As noted by the staff, the authorities
are carrying actions to increase the absorptive capacity of the economy in order to ensure the
effectiveness of envisaged scaling-up of capital spending and priority social outlays. My
authorities wish a rapid and timely attainment of the MDGs, which requires that significant
social expenditure needs be met. Necessary actions will be taken in this direction, while
taking into account the need to maintain debt sustainability in the context of fiscal restraint.
Public expenditure reviews will be conducted systematically in order to increase the
effectiveness of public outlays.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform

-3-

Prudent monetary policy will continue to be implemented by the BCEAO at the regional
level. The key monetary objective of ensuring price stability will remain unchanged.
Strengthening the financial sector remains a key objective of Burkina Faso’s poverty
reduction strategy. The banking system is sound as reflected by the broadly satisfactory
compliance with prudential ratios.
The authorities plan to devise a comprehensive strategy in the area of microfinance, which is
a critical component of the poverty reduction strategy. Key among the principles on which
the microfinance strategy will be built upon is the design of an incentive mechanism to boost
investment of part of commercial banks’ liquidity in the microfinance institutions. However,
the timing for the adoption of this strategy will be set so as to take into account the outcome
of the discussions organized by the BCEAO on the topic as well as the findings of a team of
high-level experts analyzing the experience of other countries in this sector.
Maintaining debt sustainability
My authorities are appreciative of the actions taken by the Paris Club and multilateral
creditors, which led to a topping-up in the context of the HIPC Initiative. They call now on
non-Paris Club bilateral creditors to grant them debt relief. The Burkinabè government
intends to maintain its external debt at sustainable levels. However, given the external shocks
experienced by the economy, its domestic revenues may prove to be short of the amount
needed to fully finance the Priority Action Plan to implement the PRSP in the period ahead.
Under these conditions, the authorities are hopeful that additional donor assistance would be
materialized into the form of grants or concessional financing. In view of the recent
experience, mobilizing such grants and concessional assistance proves to be increasingly
difficult. This situation leaves the authorities with no choice but to contract donor funding in
the form of loans, which could undermine in the long run the hardly-achieved debt
sustainability. In this context, my Burkinabè authorities are hopeful that the recent G8 debt
cancellation proposal will be promptly made operational.
Making progress in Good Governance
The inclusion of good governance among the four pillars of the PRSP is an illustration of the
high level of attention paid by the authorities to this issue. As announced in my statement
during last February’s Executive Board discussion on the second and third reviews under the
PRGF, a national strategy to combat corruption and an action plan to implement it have been
prepared by the High Authority to Coordinate the Fight Against Corruption after broad
consultation with various stakeholders. In addition to raising awareness about the costs of
corruption, the strategy and the action plan formulate various recommendations, including
those listed in the Selected Issues Paper: revisions of the Penal Code, introduction of a law
against corruption, strengthening of enforcement agencies, and enhanced coordination
between public agencies. Progress made in good governance also includes the improved

-4-

fiscal transparency and accountability, particularly with the more systematic and regular
submission of audit accounts and the budget law to the National Assembly.
Addressing issues pertaining to the cotton sector
While on the rise, cotton prices remain far below their average over the past three decade as
noted by the staff. Cotton companies are expected to cope with the financial implications of
the declining world cotton prices. However, the authorities also intend to mobilize donor
assistance with the aim at assisting the cotton sector in increasing productivity, particularly
through infrastructure building and advanced research. Whenever appropriate, they will
ensure continued structural reforms in this sector. They hope that donor willingness to
support structural reforms in the sector will translate into concrete actions.
Nevertheless, even though the authorities are aware of the need to enhance competitiveness,
they are of the view that a key challenge facing this sector relates to the agricultural subsidies
provided by industrial countries to their cotton farmers. For this reason, they call on the
elimination of these policies. In this context, my authorities look forward to the successful
completion of the Doha Round trade negotiations in end-2005.
Diversifying the Economy and Enhancing Competitiveness
The authorities’ awareness of the need for economic diversification and enhanced
competitiveness is reflected by the fact that these issues constitute some of the key themes
around which the structural agenda is built. In this respect, many actions have been
implemented thus far, including, but not limited to, the improvement of the business climate,
infrastructure building, and the reform of the energy and telecommunications sectors. In the
period ahead, the authorities intend to continue tackling the issues of economic
diversification and competitiveness with the same level of determination as in the past.
Among other objectives, progress made on diversifying the economy—particularly
agricultural production—will help cope with the fluctuations in cotton prices and the effects
of adverse climatic conditions, considered by the staff as one of the risks to the economic
outlook. Other exogenous risks continue to make it difficult to make decisive progress in
implementing this agenda. As the staff points out in the Selected Issues paper, the authorities
are implementing various activities aimed at ensuring economic diversification. The impact
of most of these actions is multidimensional in that these could contribute to ensuring
economic diversification as well as enhancing competitiveness.
In particular, the increasing crude oil price constitutes a major impediment to lowering
significantly the high costs in the energy sector, which remain in staff’s view a key obstacle
to economic diversification and competitiveness. The authorities will continue to do their
utmost efforts to cope successfully with this oil price shock. Most likely, however, collective
actions by both oil-exporting and importing countries seem to be the key for overcoming this
major source of global imbalances.

-5-

In the telecommunications sector, the authorities are hopeful that the new strategy for
privatizing the national telecommunications company recently approved by the government
will help lowering the high costs reported by the staff in this sector. Simplifying
administrative procedures for opening businesses is also in the agenda of the authorities. In
this regard, work currently underway after the approval of creation of a center for business
registration looks promising.
Furthermore, the planned and ongoing implementation of other measures will be key in
meeting the stated objective of economic diversification. These measures include, but are not
limited to those aimed at ensuring: (i) agricultural diversification; (ii) rural development; (iii)
a gradual reform of the land tenure system; (iv) the implementation of the abovementioned
microfinance strategy, which will be a big step towards improving access to credit; (v)
transport infrastructure development needed for boosting private sector activity, and
increasing trade with neighboring countries.
Conclusion
My authorities would like to benefit from a new partnership with the donor community based
on regular and open policy dialogue. In this perspective, they are keen to ensure national
ownership of the development strategy and policies, along with their monitoring and
evaluation. Meeting this objective will require that the country receive adequate technical
and financial donor assistance. However, this requires, in turn, that both the authorities and
the donor community make the necessary efforts to increase the currently low absorption
capacity for externally financed projects, which results in the effective disbursement of only
about 70 percent of the resources committed by donors. As noted above, the authorities are
already taking actions to increase the absorptive capacity so as to ensure the effectiveness of
additional public expenditure. On their part, donors could contribute effectively to this effort
by making aid disbursement procedures less cumbersome. In this process, the authorities also
hope that there will be a gradual shift from project aid to budgetary support to correct the
sub-optimal situation that prevailed recently, including during the period 2000–03 where
budget support accounted for less than 40 percent of total external financing, while project
aid exceeds 60 percent of the total.
In light of the above, my authorities request a waiver of nonobservance of the performance
criterion for March 2005 pertaining to net domestic borrowing by the government and the
completion of the fourth review under the PRGF.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 29, 2005

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Burkina Faso
On September 8, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso.1
Background
Over the past decade, Burkina Faso has maintained an average real GDP growth
rate of over 6 percent annually, and inflation has been contained. Structural reforms
and stability-oriented macroeconomic policies have strengthened the marketorientation of the economy and improved its flexibility. The gains from the economic
reforms have resulted in improvements in social indicators, with household surveys
indicating that the headcount poverty index declined by 8 percentage points between
1998 and 2003. Nevertheless, Burkina Faso continues to rank among the poorest
countries in the world, and reaching the Millennium Development Goals poses major
challenges.
Following a year of exceptional growth performance, GDP growth moderated to
4.6 percent in 2004. Despite an increase in cotton production, overall agricultural
production fell due to a decline in cereal production from record highs in 2003.
Average consumer prices decreased by 0.4 percent, but inflation has since picked
up as food prices have rebounded from their five-year lows. Nonfood inflation has
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

been contained, in spite of higher oil prices. Slow growth in money demand and
rapid expansion of medium and long-term credit to the economy resulted in a decline
of net foreign assets of the banking system. Credit expansion has continued at a
strong pace during the first part of 2005 and net foreign assets of the banking
system have declined further. Consequently, the regional central bank (BCEAO) has
raised reserve requirements to stem the pace of credit expansion.
Revenue improvements of one-half percent of GDP and expenditures that were
lower than projected helped contain the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) to
8.6 percent of GDP in 2004, which was lower–than-targeted in the authorities’
program. The deficit was fully financed by external means, with grants accounting for
over half of the deficit financing.
The external current account deficit (excluding transfers) exceeded 10 percent of
GDP in 2004. Cotton exports, which account for about two-thirds of total exports,
increased sharply as most of the crop was sold in early 2004 before world prices
began to decline. This more than offset the impact of higher oil prices and the trade
deficit narrowed in 2004. In the second half of the year, the external terms of trade
deteriorated sharply to reach a 25-year low by year-end. Notwithstanding some
recovery in cotton prices during the first half of 2005, the terms of trade remain near
their historical low and the external trade and current account deficits are expected
to widen significantly in 2005.
Ongoing structural reforms include steps to improve revenue performance, as
revenues are still low by regional standards, with measures focused on broadening
the tax base and improving tax compliance. Revenues performance is also
benefiting from the computerization of the major customs offices and the introduction
of a new single taxpayer identification number. In other areas, structural reforms are
aimed at improving competitiveness. This includes public investments in rural roads
and irrigation systems, which could facilitate agricultural diversification and reduce
volatility in incomes and prices. The legal and regulatory framework of the power
sector has been amended, and the authorities are preparing the energy and
telecommunications sector for increased private sector participation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Burkinabè authorities for their long track record of
implementing sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. These reforms
have resulted in a more flexible and market-based economy that has helped achieve
high rates of economic growth and reduce the incidence of poverty. Nevertheless,
Directors noted that substantial challenges remain, especially in light of the decline in
world cotton prices and the increase in world oil prices that have dampened economic
growth prospects for 2005. Continued implementation of pro-growth macroeconomic
policies, diversification of the economy, and structural reforms will be necessary to

-3-

establish the conditions for a resumption of robust economic growth and to accelerate
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Directors agreed that an easing of fiscal policy in 2004 and 2005 was appropriate in light
of the need to smooth the adjustment to the adverse terms of trade shocks while
continuing to make progress towards the MDGs. They considered that the fiscal targets
for 2005 remain appropriate, and welcomed the continued orientation of expenditures
toward key social services, notably health and education, as well as growth and
productivity-enhancing capital investments.
Directors noted the importance of further increasing fiscal revenues over the medium
term—a core WAEMU convergence requirement—as these remain low relative to GDP.
They welcomed the advances made in tax administration that have already contributed
to an increase in revenues by about half a percentage point of GDP annually since
2000. Directors noted the progress in implementing structural measures to broaden the
tax base and improve tax compliance—including most recently the establishment of the
large taxpayer division, the centralization of tax collection responsibilities, and the
introduction of a new single taxpayer identification number—and looked forward to the
completion of the taxpayer census and the creation of the joint tax-customs brigade to
conduct comprehensive tax audits. They agreed that these measures would help
establish the foundation for further improvement in revenue performance without
increasing the burden on existing taxpayers. Directors urged the authorities to identify
further measures to reach the WAEMU revenue convergence criterion before 2015.
Directors urged the authorities to proceed with their medium-term expenditure plans only
if financing could be obtained on terms consistent with long-term debt sustainability, in
order to ensure that the benefits of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative are not unwound
by new unsustainable borrowing. In this context, Directors underscored the importance
of obtaining external financing on highly concessional terms, preferably in the form of
grants, and stressed the need for non-Paris Club bilateral creditors to offer HIPC debt
relief to Burkina Faso. They welcomed the recent streamlining of budget support among
development partners and measures to improve absorptive capacity.
Directors noted the importance of allowing domestic prices to reflect changes in world
prices, and commended the authorities for implementing the automatic price adjustment
mechanism for domestic petroleum products. They called for a move toward a costrecovery-based electricity pricing mechanism to further enhance price flexibility and
allow for a phasing out of the subsidy to the state-owned electricity utility. This would
free up much needed resources for priority poverty-reducing expenditures.
Directors also welcomed the policy of allowing the cotton sector, which is mostly private,
to find its own solution to difficulties arising from low world cotton prices, while the
government continues to implement structural reforms to enhance productivity in the
sector.
Directors expressed some concern about overall competitiveness in light of the
deterioration in the external terms of trade. They supported the emphasis on measures
to diversify the economy, enhance productivity, and improve the business environment.

-4-

In light of Burkina Faso’s high dependence on agricultural production, Directors
encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their land reform agenda.
They welcomed the decision to maintain the fertilizer subsidy at its current level,
and encouraged the authorities to phase out the subsidy as alternative supply routes are
found and as the regional situation stabilizes. Directors also welcomed the decision to
prepare the energy and telecommunications sectors for increased private sector
participation, and encouraged the authorities to make the recent amendments to the
legal and regulatory framework of the power sector operational. Directors agreed that
increasing regional trade integration would help achieve the authorities’ objectives of
export diversification.
Directors observed that the banking system is generally sound. They welcomed the
decline in non-performing loans in the banking sector in the first quarter of this year,
but noted the mixed compliance with other prudential ratios, which calls for close
monitoring of the sector. They commended the establishment of the agency to assist
small and medium enterprises with accounting and administrative procedures, and urge
the authorities to address delays surrounding the national strategy for microfinance.
They agreed that the government should not assume an initial 100 percent share in the
housing bank, as planned, but should move forward once partners are prepared to pay
their respective shares.
Directors welcomed progress in improving fiscal transparency and governance, noting
the improvement in the timeliness of submitting audited government accounts to the
National Assembly and the follow up to the report of the High Authority on the
Coordination of the Fight Against Corruption. They welcomed the approval of the
national strategy for good governance and looked forward to the comprehensive
strategy on combating corruption.
Directors commended the authorities for improving the monitoring of their poverty
reduction strategy, implementation of which shows encouraging results. The authorities’
management of donor coordination and harmonization is also an important step forward
to strengthen aid efficiency.
Directors welcomed the plan to strengthen the National Institute of Statistics and
Demographics and urged its speedy implementation to improve the timeliness and
quality of economic and financial data. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
improve the quality of external debt data, as these are a necessary component in
evaluating the implications of fiscal policy.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
Burkino Faso may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
