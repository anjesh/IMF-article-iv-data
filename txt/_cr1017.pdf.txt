EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Zambian economy has shown some resilience to the global economic crisis.
Real GDP growth for 2009 is now projected at 5.3 percent, boosted by a significant increase
in copper production and a bumper crop, while inflation is easing gradually from the food
and fuel price-induced highs of 2008. The budget deficit is projected to widen somewhat
in 2009 on weak revenue collections; the current account deficit has narrowed on lower
imports; and international reserves have increased significantly, boosted by the
SDR allocation.
The PRGF-supported program is on track; all of the quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets for end-June 2009 have been met. There were delays in
implementing two of the structural benchmarks: (i) the establishment of a supervisory regime
for the secondary market in government securities has required an extended consultation
process and the benchmark has been reset for end-March 2010; (ii) the benchmark on
introducing a standing overnight lending facility by the Bank of Zambia was met with a
two-month delay.
Fiscal policy in 2010 retains the focus on harnessing domestically-generated resources
to support the diversification of the economy. The 2010 budget, which envisages some
recovery in tax collections, seeks to preserve capital spending and to shift resources to the
health sector to make up for an expected decline in donor support. The wage bill as a share of
GDP is to be restrained.
The structural reform agenda for 2010 will focus on: (i) reviewing tax policy and
administration so as to strengthen tax performance; (ii) improving public financial
management; (iii) advancing civil service reform; (iv) reinforcing monetary operations and
supervision; and (v) ensuring an adequate and reliable supply of electricity.
The Article IV consultation discussions elaborated on the macroeconomic environment
and on policies for sustaining medium-term growth through diversification. Lessening
the dependence on mining and diversifying the economy will require creating fiscal space, on
both the revenue and expenditure sides, to increase investment in infrastructure and the social
sectors. A large foreign exchange reserve cushion will help the economy better withstand
shocks and buffer excessive exchange rate swings, which undermine the competitiveness of
the non-mining sector.
Zambia continues to be at low risk of debt distress, and there is no clear evidence of
misalignment of the exchange rate.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Compared to the first three decades after independence, Zambia’s economic
performance has improved markedly in recent years. Sustained per capita GDP growth
began in the late 1990s as a belated response to the extensive structural reforms and
liberalization of the economy in the 1990s. This trend was given further impetus by the boom
in the copper sector that followed privatization, the subsequent rise in copper prices globally,
and better management of macroeconomic policies, both fiscal and monetary. With fiscal
dominance no longer an issue, the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) has been able to pursue its goal of
bringing down inflation and creating scope for a solid expansion (though from a low base) of
credit to the private sector. The external position of the economy has benefited from the debt
cancellation under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Zambia’s gross international reserves have risen to more than
four months of import cover, a dramatic turnaround from only a few years earlier.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The Zambian economy has shown some resilience to the global economic crisis.
Growth in 2009 is now projected to be in line with the average for recent years, with the
slowdown in the tertiary sector compensated for by a significant increase in copper
production and a bumper crop. Inflation has moderated steadily from the food and fuel
price-induced highs of 2008. The current account deficit has narrowed, helped by a recovery
of copper prices and import compression after a sharp depreciation of the Kwacha. Though
still below the levels seen in other SADC countries, Zambia’s reserve position is now
stronger than it has been in almost four decades at 4½ months of import cover, thanks in part
to the augmentation of PRGF access and the recent SDR allocation.
•

Real GDP growth in 2009 is now projected to be 5.3 percent, somewhat lower than
the 5.7 percent growth recorded for 2008. With copper prices recovering quickly from

•

Consumer price inflation eased to 12.3 percent through October 2009, down from
16.6 percent at the end of 2008. Due to some persistence in food price inflation, the
year-end target was revised to 12 percent and is well within reach.

•

The external current account deficit (including grants) is projected to be 1.8 percent
of GDP in 2009, down from 5.6 percent in 2008. The decline in export values is
expected to be more than offset by a marked contraction in imports and by lower
copper sector profit remittances.

•

The tax revenue shortfall relative to the program is estimated at 0.6 percentage points
of GDP in 2009, due primarily to import-related taxes. There have also been some
shortfalls in donor disbursements. The government has sought to preserve its
domestically-financed capital spending targets by increasing domestic borrowing,
including from the BoZ. As a result, domestic financing is projected at 2.2 percent of
GDP at year-end (0.4 percentage points of GDP higher than programmed). Social
sector spending (particularly on health), and foreign-financed capital spending
(particularly on roads) have, however, suffered. Overall, spending is estimated to be
0.6 percentage points of GDP lower than programmed.

•

The kwacha has continued to be volatile. After coming under sustained pressure in
late 2008 and early 2009, the exchange rate has recently strengthened and stabilized,
supported by the recovery in copper prices. During the period of downward pressure,
the BoZ intervened heavily to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange
market, drawing on the reserves it had built up. Foreign exchange sales also helped
the BoZ meet its reserve money target for the first half of 2009. More recently, the
BoZ has relied primarily on open market operations to manage liquidity.

•

While there has been a significant increase in non-performing loans, the banking
sector remains adequately capitalized and liquid (Table 6). The rise in
non-performing loans has been most pronounced for households and commercial
agriculture.

•

Zambia is making progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(Table 9). Poverty indicators have improved over the past decade, though the issue of
rural poverty and service delivery remains a challenge. Health indicators have been
improving, and Zambia is on track to meet its goal of universal primary education.
III. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

3.
Performance under the PRGF arrangement has been satisfactory. All
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2009 were met (MEFP,
Table 1), as were two of three structural benchmarks (MEFP, Table 3). On the third
benchmark, establishment of a supervisory regime for the secondary market in government

7
securities, delays were encountered because the consultation process was broadened;
nonetheless, considerable progress has been made and the benchmark has been reset for
end-March 2010. Of the two structural benchmarks for end-September 2009, one was met on
time; the other—the introduction by the BoZ of a standing overnight lending facility—was
met on December 1, 2009.
IV. ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2010
4.
As the world economy emerges from recession, prospects for the Zambian
economy are improving. Economic growth is expected to pick up speed in 2010, to about
5½ percent; the unwinding of the one-off factors in 2009 will be compensated for by a more
broad-based recovery, particularly in the tertiary sector. Inflation is targeted to decline to
8 percent by the end of the year. The external position should be generally unchanged;
increased export earnings will be offset by a recovery in imports and profit remittances.
A. Fiscal Policy
5.
The 2010 budget again focuses on harnessing domestically-generated resources
to support diversification of the economy through investment in infrastructure and
human capital (MEFP, ¶11, 12, 13, 14). The overall fiscal deficit is projected to narrow
slightly to 2.4 percent of GDP, with domestic financing amounting to 2 percent of GDP. 1
Revenue collections are projected to increase somewhat to 15.9 percent of GDP, mainly
because administrative efforts are being intensified as an offset to a drawdown of income tax
loss carryovers. On the expenditure side, the government’s ability to increase the share of
capital spending in total government outlays was constrained by the size of the wage bill and
by constitutionally required spending on
a national census and voter registration
before the 2011 presidential and
parliamentary elections. The authorities
pointed to the political difficulty of
resisting wage demands with elections
looming on the horizon, but are
nonetheless aiming to contain the wage
bill as a share of GDP in 2010. The
government is also committed to
pursuing civil service reform, including right-sizing and pay reform while at the same time
protecting the social sectors, with a view to putting the wage bill on a sustainable path.

The domestic debt-to-GDP ratio continues to decline gradually in the period ahead.

8
A performance based pay system is expected to be approved by Cabinet in 2010 (structural
benchmark).
B. Monetary Policy
6.
Monetary policy will be geared to bringing inflation firmly into the single-digit range
by end-2010 (MEFP, ¶17). Reserve money growth is to be limited to 19 percent, which, with
government borrowing plans as described above, would allow credit to the private sector to grow
to about 20 percent, up from 14 percent in 2009, but below the rates seen in 2007 and 2008. The
envisaged growth rate seems consistent with more conservative bank lending plans, since
non-performing loans have risen.
7.
The authorities remain committed to a floating exchange rate regime (MEFP, ¶17).
The flexible, yet orderly, response of the exchange rate to external shocks, whether positive or
negative, has enabled the Zambian economy to adjust relatively smoothly to new circumstances.
However, the exchange rate has at times been excessively volatile and staff expressed support for
the BoZ’s intention to become more active in mitigating unwarranted exchange rate volatility by
relying on its healthier reserve position, that has now been bolstered by the SDR allocation
(see Box 1).
Box 1. Exchange Rate Volatility in Zambia
Zambia’s exchange rate has
suffered bouts of increased
volatility in recent years, and
particularly in the first half of
2009 (Text Figure 1). The
kwacha has tended to be
more volatile than the
currencies of neighboring
countries with free-floating
exchange rates (Text
Table 1).

quickly to the inflation rate and fully

in a feedback effect from the formulation of inflation expectations.

9
The government and the Bank of Zambia also plan to retire some domestic debt, as treasury
securities mature, through a limited sale of foreign exchange from international reserves. 2 The
expectation is that the more limited supply of treasury bills will put downward pressure on interest
rates, lessen the interest burden on the budget, and make Kwacha credit available to the private
sector on more favorable terms. Staff supported this plan provided it would be pursued cautiously
and held under constant review.
C. Structural Policies
Public financial management
8.
Zambia is making progress in the implementation of public financial management
reforms (MEFP, ¶21, 22, 23). After protracted delays, for instance, the budget cycle has been
aligned to the fiscal year through a constitutional amendment. This would ensure that the budget is
approved before the start of the fiscal year, thus allowing more time for budget execution. In 2010,
the government also intends to introduce a planning and budgeting act (structural benchmark) to
reinforce budget planning and execution, and accountability to stakeholders. Long-awaited public
procurement regulations have also been issued, and the government is close to finalizing its
strategy for setting up a treasury single account (TSA) system, with milestones already set
for 2010 (structural benchmark). Moreover, the launch of the integrated financial management
information system (IFMIS) should gather significant steam in 2010. Staff welcomed these
developments and underscored that effective PFM systems are essential for the efficient use of
public resources.
Financial sector development
9.
Financial sector development is also moving ahead (MEFP, ¶24, 25, 26). The first phase
in the financial sector development plan (FSDP I) was recently completed and the second phase
(FSDP II) has just been launched. The overriding goals of the FSDP are to enhance financial
system stability and financial intermediation. Among welcome developments, the BoZ has set up a
standing overnight lending facility that should reduce excess liquidity in the banking system and is
drafting a plan for the secondary market in government securities that should be in place by early
next year. The government is also committed to enacting a lender of last resort policy for the BoZ
by the middle of 2010 (structural benchmark).
Debt and aid management
10.
The government is adopting a comprehensive debt management strategy, based on
technical assistance provided jointly by the IMF and the World Bank (MEFP, ¶29, 30). Adherence
to this strategy is needed because it is likely that the government’s only option in the coming years
will be to engage in external borrowing on commercial terms to fund its share of the cost of

10
high-priority infrastructure projects in the context of PPPs, particularly for electricity generation. 3
Zambia continues to be a low risk of debt distress, even once such nonconcessional borrowing is
taken into account (see paragraph 19).
11.
The government is committed to managing aid better. Closer coordination with donors
will help enhance the consistency and timeliness of aid data. The alleged misappropriation of
donor funds at the Ministry of Health, along with broader donor concerns about governance
issues, could put at risk both direct budget support and sector support for health and roads, which
could ultimately threaten the financing of the budget. The authorities expressed their intention to
fully address donor concerns about governance.
Electricity sector development and the fuel situation
12.
The government continues to implement its strategy of bolstering the electricity
sector (MEFP, ¶27, 28). Zambia experienced serious power shortages in 2008, after years of
neglected maintenance and lack of new investment in power generating capacity. At that time, the
government adopted a strategy to tackle the power deficit that is centered on the following
elements: (i) raise electricity tariffs over time to cost recovery levels to attract private investment,
(ii) open the transmission network to power generators, other than the state-owned electricity
utility ZESCO; and (iii) make ZESCO more operationally efficient, while not providing budgetary
subsidies. A major first step towards cost recovery was taken in August 2009, when electricity
tariffs were raised by 35 percent. A further tariff increase is envisaged by mid-2010 (structural
benchmark), and the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the objective of eliminating the
remaining gap over time. The government also intends to approve a grid code to facilitate access
to the transmission and distribution systems in 2010. Moreover, ZESCO has agreed with the
Zambian Energy Regulation Board (ERD) on a set of key performance indicators to improve its
financial and operational efficiency. However, initial performance relative to these targets has
lagged.
13.
The cost of fuels is high in Zambia and their supply is unreliable. From a regional
perspective and even factoring in Zambia’s landlocked nature, the cost of fuels is relatively high,
to the detriment of both businesses and consumers. There are also periodic shortages of fuel,
usually because of unscheduled shutdowns of the Indeni refinery. Staff cautioned that pump prices
(which have not changed since December 2008) need to reflect underlying kwacha-denominated
costs, in order to avoid distortions and eventual subsidization by the budget. The authorities
indicated that they wanted to avoid subsidizing fuels at all costs and were considering alternative
fuel supply arrangements.

3

Consultations with the World Bank and other relevant institutions would inform the authorities on the economic
viability of such projects; only projects with high rates of return would be considered.

11
D. Program Monitoring
14.
The program is being monitored semiannually. Quantitative performance criteria are
proposed to be revised for end-December 2009 and set for end-June 2010. Indicative targets have
been set for end-March 2010, end-September 2010, and end-December 2010. Structural
benchmarks have been set for 2010. In the structural area, reviews will be based on an assessment
of the authorities’ reform program, particularly in the areas of PFM, financial sector development,
and electricity sector development, in order to achieve the macroeconomic objectives described in
the MEFP.
V. SUSTAINING GROWTH THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook
15.
The government’s main economic policy objective is to sustain robust and diversified
growth over the medium term to create jobs and income opportunities, especially for the
poor. The authorities recognize that attaining this objective will depend on the creation of a
competitive environment for the private sector. They also recognize the variety of ingredients that
are necessary: (i) skilled and healthy human resources; (ii) good transportation infrastructure;
(iii) efficient and reliable utilities; (iv) well-functioning financial markets; (v) limited red-tape;
and, last but not least, (vi) macroeconomic stability. To accomplish all of these, the government
will need to invest significant resources in human capital and infrastructure, as well as make
efforts to reduce bureaucracy, while keeping macroeconomic policies prudent.
16.
The government’s medium-term macroeconomic framework envisages that economic
growth will gradually move to above 6 percent a year. Inflation will become firmly entrenched
below 10 percent. The external current account deficit (including and excluding grants) will trend
modestly upwards relative to GDP because of an upswing in investment related imports.
International reserves will stay above four months of import cover and increase over the medium
term.
B. Increasing Fiscal Space
17.
Reaching Zambia’s development objectives will require increasing the resources for
infrastructure and human capital spending. A sustained effort to open up fiscal space is needed
both on the revenue and spending fronts. Reversing the trend decline in tax revenue relative to the
size of the economy that has been experienced over the past few years will be a major challenge.
The government is therefore committed to reviewing tax policy and administration during 2010 in
order to boost its tax take (structural benchmark). Meanwhile, there has been upward pressure on
current spending, particularly for salaries and benefits of government workers, that would need to
be addressed. (see Box 2).

12
Box 2. Increasing Fiscal Space
Increasing fiscal space is a central challenge for Zambia over the medium term. To attain its
development objectives, it must devote increasing amounts of resources to capital and social sector
spending.
On the resource side, tax revenue will need to make the largest contribution to added fiscal space. Given
the observed downward trend in donor aid and with prospects difficult to predict, and given the need for
continued caution in foreign borrowing, the government will need to finance a large share of investment
and social sector spending from domestically generated resources—tax revenue.
Restoring these revenue sources by broadening the tax base and reinforcing tax collection is essential to
generate more resources for government. The mining tax regime should, over time, yield more revenue
as carryover losses and investment allowances are exhausted, provided, of course, that copper prices
stay reasonably high. The government is aware of the need to reform both tax policy and tax
administration in order to reverse the revenue erosion. The government thus plans to undertake a
comprehensive review of tax policy and administration before preparing the 2011 budget.
Lower current spending is another potential source of increased fiscal space. Here, the wage bill stands
out in that it takes up more than one half of domestically generated resources.

C. Reform of the Monetary Policy Framework
18.
The floating exchange rate regime has served Zambia well in recent years. The
authorities are also weighing the pros and cons of moving away from the reserve money
targeting regime to directly targeting inflation using a money market interest rate as the
principal operating target. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue exploring this
possibility and noted that inflation targeting needs to be built on a well-functioning money
market and a thorough understanding of how monetary policy is transmitted. Therefore,
further analysis would likely be necessary (see Box 3).
Box 3. Strengthening Monetary Policy Implementation
In the past few years, the BoZ has done well in adhering to its operating target, the reserve money
path, within a floating exchange rate regime. This has helped to keep broad money close to the
targeted reserve and M3 path and, together with fiscal restraint, has helped to steadily bring down
inflation (see Figure 3). However, with the gradual deepening of the financial system and the
economy’s vulnerability to large exogenous shocks, the authorities are considering a gradual shift
from strict monetary targets to a framework that would use interest rates as the main instrument to
anchor inflationary expectations, with the ultimate goal of implementing an explicit inflation
targeting (IT) regime in the medium term.
Staff noted that monetary policy in Zambia is hampered by large and volatile foreign exchange
inflows, exposure to copper-related terms-of-trade shocks, and a high degree of exchange rate
pass-through to domestic prices. In addition, banks liquidity and government cash-flow are hard
to predict due to thin money markets and public financial management constraints that make it
difficult for the BOZ to sterilize the required amounts and stabilize the liquidity base.
The authorities concurred that a number of pre-conditions would need to be fulfilled before they
move to an explicit IT framework, such as (i) improving information flows, especially on the real
sector and CPI; (ii) understanding how monetary policy is transmitted: (iii) expanding the
communication strategy by increasing transparency and accountability through media exposure
(e.g. inflation reports); and (iv) formulating a core projection model for forecasting and policy
analysis.

D. Debt Sustainability
19.
The updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Zambia shows that the
country is still at low risk of debt distress and that there is some scope for external
borrowing on commercial terms to finance high-priority infrastructure projects. The
DSA is based on assumptions that are consistent with the authorities’ medium-term
macroeconomic framework. The baseline scenario incorporates a substantial amount of
external borrowing by the government to finance its share of the cost of major infrastructure
projects, particularly for electricity generation. Even with extreme shocks, and taking into
account the contingent statutory liabilities of central government, the debt sustainability
indicators stay well below the relevant thresholds for the risk of debt distress.

14
E. Exchange Rate Assessment
20.
There is no clear evidence of misalignment of the exchange rate (see Box 4). Its
movements in recent years have closely mirrored movements in the terms of trade. While
data limitations impede a robust assessment, indications are that the real exchange rate does
not appear to be too far from its equilibrium level. Moreover, the balance of payments
position does not point to any disruptive movements in the exchange rate.
F. Other Issues
21.
The authorities have made efforts to settle arrears to external private creditors
stemming from the past imposition of exchange controls. Settlement of the outstanding
arrears to commercial creditors was offered on terms similar to those provided by the Paris
Club. The authorities are continuing to verify claims outstanding to private individuals. The
exchange restrictions evidenced by the accumulation of these external payments arrears are
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII.
VI. ECONOMIC STATISTICS
22.
Weaknesses in the quality and timeliness of economic statistics for Zambia
represent a significant obstacle to effective economic analysis and policy making. The
base years for both the national accounts and the CPI are in the early 1990s and are thus no
longer representative of the structure and composition of the economy. Lags in presentation
of reliable national accounts data and unresolved methodological issues also unduly
complicate economic analysis. The authorities recognize that this situation makes them less
effective and are committed to making available to the Central Statistical Office (CSO)
sufficient financial and human resources to ensure that it can quickly re-base the national
accounts and the CPI and publish reliable economic statistics regularly and promptly.

domestic stability and internal
balances, and the current structure of the capital and financial accounts poses no apparent risk to
external stability. Finally, the appreciation of the real exchange rate in recent years does not
appear to have hindered growth and development of non-metals exports, which have enjoyed
double digit growth in recent years, even though copper still dominates exports in both absolute
and relative terms.

16
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
The Zambian economy has shown some resilience to the global economic crisis.
Overall, growth in 2009 is expected to be in line with the average for recent years. Inflation
is moderating, and is now expected to fall to below 10 percent by the second half of 2010.
The current account deficit has narrowed, and international reserves have strengthened
significantly, boosted by the SDR allocation from the IMF.
24.
The government responded appropriately to the revenue shortfall and delays in
release of donor funds. The government has sought to sustain budgeted domesticallyfinanced capital spending, drawing on domestic financing from the BoZ and others. Social
sector spending, particularly in health, has however been adversely affected. The way in
which government has responded to the spending pressures in 2009 is to be commended.
25.
Despite revenue challenges and required constitutional spending, the 2010
budget is well balanced. In particular, it preserves capital spending and shifts some
domestic resources to the health sector to make up for an expected decline in donor support.
Economic objectives for 2010, including a modest pick-up in growth and a further easing of
inflation, are prudent.
26.
The Bank of Zambia has been able to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign
exchange market during a turbulent period. The value of maintaining large reserves was
amply demonstrated in late 2008 and early 2009 when the kwacha came under sustained
pressure. The sale of foreign exchange during this period also helped the BoZ in meeting the
end-June 2009 reserve money target. Against this background, the BoZ envisages a modest
further increase in international reserves during 2010.
27.
One of the government’s major challenges is to increase fiscal space for
infrastructure and social sector spending. The government’s objective of sustaining high
growth over the medium term by diversifying of the economy--which is premised on
investment in infrastructure and human capital--will require substantial resources, most of
which will have to come from domestic sources. A sustained effort is needed on both the
resource and spending sides to create additional fiscal space.
28.
The government needs to reverse the erosion of tax revenue by reforming tax
policy and administration. While the decline in the revenue ratio has been particularly
marked in 2009, it is part of a multi-year declining trend. The trend is evident for all taxes,
with the exception of the personal income tax. A thorough review of the tax system and
administration is necessary to identify measures that can be taken to raise the tax take over
the medium term.
29.
Public financial management reforms need to continue. The alignment of the
budget cycle to the fiscal year is a welcome development that should strengthen budget
execution. However, it is necessary to ensure closer conformity between the adopted and

17
executed budget. A new budget act represents one step in that direction, as do the ongoing
reforms related to the TSA and IFMIS. In general, PFM reforms should aim to ensure that
government spending becomes more efficient.
30.
Reversing the upward trend in the wage bill will free up resources for other
important government priorities. Salaries and benefits of civil servants have taken up a
rather large and rising share of domestically-generated resources. Civil service and pay
reform, and resistance to unaffordable wage demands are necessary.
31.
Zambia’s risk of debt distress is low and there is some scope for external
borrowing on non-concessional terms. The updated DSA shows that, even with extreme
shocks and allowing for substantial external borrowing on commercial terms, Zambia is
unlikely to breach debt sustainability thresholds for the foreseeable future. Thus, there is
some scope for non-concessional borrowing to finance government’s share in essential
infrastructure projects, particularly in electricity generation. External borrowing for this
purpose should be undertaken in the context of a robust debt management strategy.
32.
The floating exchange rate regime and reserve money targeting have served
Zambia well. Developments over the last year demonstrate the important role the floating
exchange rate plays for enabling the Zambian economy to adjust to external shocks.
Adherence to a reserve money targeting regime has also brought greater price stability. Any
decision to transition to an inflation targeting regime, centered on an interest rate-based
monetary policy, should be premised on further analysis and on ensuring that the necessary
preconditions are put in place. Meanwhile, the exchange rate and domestic, economic and
financial policies are consistent with external stability.
33.
Continued financial sector reforms will serve towards enhancing financial
intermediation. Although a large number of banks operate in Zambia, lending rates and
interest rate spreads remain high, slowing the deepening of financial intermediation. Further
financial sector reforms and changes in how the BoZ interacts with financial markets are
needed. To test the interest rate response, the authorities are considering a limited redemption
of government domestic debt through the sale of foreign exchange from international
reserves. The implementation of the second phase of the financial sector development plan
should be pursued assiduously.
34.
An important step has been taken to raise electricity tariffs towards cost
recovery levels. The August 2009 increase in electricity tariffs is the first move toward
creating an attractive environment for private sector investment in electricity generation in
Zambia, However, tariffs still remain well below cost recovery levels and it will be necessary
to adhere to a multiyear program of tariff increases is needed. Moreover, progress in
strengthening the financial and operational efficiency of ZESCO needs to be accelerated.
35.
Improvements in the compilation of economic statistics are needed. The rebasing
of the national accounts and the consumer price index is a priority matter. The government

18
needs to ensure that adequate human and financial resources are made available for this
purpose.
36.
It is recommended that the third review of the PRGF arrangement be
completed. All quantitative performance criteria for the review were met and satisfactory
progress was made on structural reforms.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month
consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved
on July 15, 2003.

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431, U.S.A.

December 3, 2009

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews recent
economic developments and progress in implementing the Government of Zambia’s
macroeconomic and structural program under the country’s three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the IMF Executive Board on June 4, 2008. It also sets out
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that the government will pursue for the remainder
of 2009, in 2010 and over the medium term.
All of the performance criteria for the third review under the PRGF were met. There was good
progress overall in terms of structural reforms, though there were modest delays in the
implementation of two of the structural benchmarks. The Government requests that the fourth
disbursement be made available upon completion of the third review by the Executive Board of the
IMF.
The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of the program. Our economic program for the remainder of
the year has been revised to take into account recent developments, and we request modifications
to the end-December 2009 performance criteria on net domestic assets, net domestic financing,
and gross international reserves. Given the Government’s commitment to these objectives, it will
promptly take any additional measures necessary for their achievement. The Government will
consult with the IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF
requests such a consultation—on the adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to
policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
The Government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund may request in
connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and
achieving the objectives of the program.
The Government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies, and the related Staff Report, including placement of these
documents on the IMF website subject to the removal of market-sensitive information, following
the IMF Executive Board’s conclusion of the review.
Yours sincerely,
/s/
Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane
Minister of Finance and National Planning

ATTACHMENT I
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
This memorandum reviews recent economic developments and outlines policies and
targets that the Government of the Republic of Zambia will pursue for the remainder of 2009,
in 2010, and in the medium-term under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement.
I: RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The impact of the global financial crisis on the Zambian economy has been less
severe than was expected earlier this year. The projection for real GDP growth has been
revised upwards to 5.3 percent for 2009, as a result of historically high growth in mining and
agriculture. Copper prices, which had dropped rather sharply in the second half of 2008,
recovered steadily during 2009, reducing the impact of the crisis on the mining sector, and
the economy as a whole. Copper production reached thirty-year highs as a result of a large
new mine commencing operations, while the agricultural harvest was the highest recorded in
ten years. Notwithstanding the strong performance of the primary sector, overall growth has
been offset by a sharp decline in tourism and a deceleration in other tertiary sectors.
Accounting for increases from the SDR allocation and earlier augmentation under the PRGF,
gross international reserves rose by US$714 million in 2009 to reach a projected
US$1.74 billion at end-2009 (equivalent to 4.5 months of import cover). Whereas the kwacha
depreciated sharply in the first half of the year, it subsequently recovered. The end-year
inflation target of 10 percent is unlikely to be met as a result of somewhat persistent food
inflation and a rise in energy prices. Inflation is currently projected to decline to 12 percent
by end-2009.
3.
Fiscal developments have been characterized by a shortfall in tax collections and
in pledged inflows from cooperating partners in 2009. The shortfall in total revenues and
grants relative to the program is projected to reach 0.8 percent of GDP by the end of the year.
Significant declines in import-related tax collections, amounting to an estimated 1.3 percent
of GDP, were the main contributing factor. Pledged cooperating partner resources amounting
to US$60 million (0.5 percent of GDP) are yet to be disbursed, leading to further potential
shortfalls. The government has committed to contain administrative expenditures to reduce
budgetary pressures and protect the monetary program. Simultaneously, it is committed to
safeguarding poverty reducing capital and social expenditures. As a result, the overall fiscal
deficit is expected to widen marginally to 2.5 percent of GDP, supported by an increase in
net domestic financing.
4.
The monetary program was in line with the program’s targets for the year to
June 2009. This largely reflected the net sales of foreign exchange by the Bank of Zambia
early in the year to dampen excessive volatility in the exchange rate on account of elevated

34
demand pressures. These demand pressures emanated from the continued effects of the
global financial crisis on the domestic economy as well as bunched agricultural input and oil
import requirements. Reserve money declined by 3 percent in the six-month period through
June 2009, compared to the programmed decline of 13 percent. Consistent with the
development in the monetary aggregates, credit to the private sector also slowed sharply from
50.2 percent annual growth in December 2008 to 34 percent growth in June as financial
institutions continued to tighten lending standards as credit quality deteriorated. This
deterioration was evidenced by an increase in non-performing loans in the banking system
from 7.2 percent in December 2008 to 13.8 percent in September 2009.
5.
Having been impacted negatively by the global financial crisis in the first half of
2009, the balance of payments position is expected to improve in the second half of the
year. Imports contracted, as demand from households and firms responded to the movement
in relative prices associated with the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate earlier in the
year. The robust rebound in copper prices from the second quarter of 2009 will also
contribute to the narrower current account deficit (including grants) of 4.7 percent of GDP in
2009 compared to 7.8 percent in 2008. The trade balance is expected to narrow to 1.3 percent
of GDP in 2009 from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2008.
6.
The program was on track through the first half of 2009, with all of the
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets being met. Two of the three
structural benchmarks were met through end-June, with some delays occurring on the efforts
to set up a supervisory regime for the secondary market in Government securities. This delay
was due to the need to complete a wider consultation process in order to allow for effective
implementation. The intention is now to put the framework for the secondary market in place
by end-March 2010.
7.
Significant strides have been made in poverty reduction efforts, and Zambia is
progressing well towards attaining its millennium development goals. Revised data from
the 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey indicate that the proportion of Zambians
living below the poverty line fell to 59.7 percent from 68 percent in 2004. While there has
been significant progress in urban poverty reduction, the challenge for the government
remains to tackle rural poverty and service delivery in the medium term. Data from the 2007
Zambian Demographic Health Survey has also shown significant reductions in maternal,
infant, and child mortality rates, and in the incidence of major diseases. In addition, Zambia
is well on track to meeting its millennium development goal of universal primary education.

35
II: MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
8.
Economic growth is expected to strengthen over the medium term. Real GDP
growth is expected to rise marginally to 5.5 percent in 2010 and further to 6.5 percent over
the medium term. Growth in 2010 will be driven by a recovery in the tertiary sector, and
continued increases in mining and construction activities. Mines that had been closed down
as a result of the crisis are expected to reopen in 2010, and a rebound in tourism activity is
expected in connection with the 2010 Football World Cup in South Africa. Downside risks,
however, still remain amidst uncertainties about a full-fledged global recovery in 2010 and
steadily rising oil prices. Growth over the medium term is premised on the realization of
policy initiatives and structural reforms aimed at economic diversification and enhanced
competitiveness. Additionally, growth will be boosted by new investments in mining and
electricity generation.
9.
The creation of fiscal space will continue to be an important goal of the
government, in order to provide space for increased expenditures on infrastructure and
social sector spending. Despite a favorable medium-term outlook for economic growth,
there are some near-term fiscal challenges relating to containing the rise of public service
wage bill as well as reversing the decline in tax revenues as a proportion of GDP that has
been experienced over the past few years. In addition, there will be some one-time outlays
that will need to be financed, such as statutory expenditures relating to the national census
and the forthcoming presidential elections in 2011.
10.
Over the medium term, mining and non-mining imports are expected to rise
strongly as mines prepare to ramp up production in 2010 and beyond, foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows rebound, and economic growth gathers pace. Furthermore,
large new import-intensive infrastructure projects, particularly in the energy sector, will
require sizable financing. In most of these projects, the Government is likely to have some
equity participation in order to attract private sector investment.
III: POLICIES FOR 2010
A: Fiscal Policy
11.
Fiscal policy will continue to remain focused on supporting the government’s
diversification agenda. Domestic revenues are expected to rise modestly to 15.7 percent of
GDP, premised on tax administration gains and the introduction of some tax measures, such
as the increase in the excise tax on diesel from 7 to 10 percent. Current expenditures will be
curtailed by 1.2 percentage points of GDP, due to declines in cooperating partner support and
in order to provide some fiscal space for capital spending which is expected to reach
4 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to remain broadly unchanged at
2.4 percent of GDP, and domestic financing is expected to be about 2 percent of GDP. This

36
fiscal framework is consistent with the inflation target and provides reasonable scope for
private sector credit growth.
12.
Strengthening revenue performance will be an important component in
medium-term policy. Income tax revenues have remained fairly steady over the years.
While the mining tax regime has received significant attention in recent years, there is need
to improve the performance of non-mining corporate tax collections. VAT collections are
also a source of concern for the Government. In order to address these challenges, the
Government will undertake a comprehensive review of tax policy and administration this
year, drawing on past and prospective IMF technical assistance (structural benchmark for
end-September 2010).
13.
Tax administration reforms are expected to continue, following the successful
completion of the first phase of implementation. Work is underway to further register the
medium and small taxpayer population, re-engineer business processes, institute new systems
and to reform tax administration legislation. Data quality continues to be a challenge in that it
limits the evaluation of the effectiveness of the recently launched Large Taxpayer Office
(LTO), and also delays the establishment of Medium and Small Taxpayer Offices (MSTOs).
The implementation of a new information communications technology (ICT) system and the
legislation reform are among the key components of the modernization of the ZRA in the
near term.
14.
The high and increasing cost of personal emoluments as a proportion of
domestically generated revenues are another source of concern in the medium-term.
Wages and salaries currently account for slightly over 50 percent of domestic revenues,
which has curtailed fiscal space for infrastructure spending. The government, cognizant of
the need to curb this trend, undertook a review of pay policy and the recommendations of this
review are being considered. It is expected that a new performance based pay policy will be
approved in 2010 (structural benchmark for end-June 2010), and implemented over the
medium term. This reform will go hand-in-hand with the right-sizing exercise, as well as the
payroll management and establishment control (PMEC), which has been rolled out to all
provinces and will be extended to ministries during 2010.
B: Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
The global financial and economic crisis and the commodity price shocks of 2008
have provided an important stress test for Zambia’s monetary policy framework. These
shocks increased inflation beyond single digits and created a more volatile exchange rate.
However, the maintenance of a flexible exchange rate regime and the implementation of a
monetary program that provided the Bank of Zambia with the flexibility to intervene in the
foreign exchange market to address excess volatility enabled the Zambian economy to adjust

37
to the external shocks, particularly the decline in copper prices. This has helped in
preserving a viable external sector over the medium-term.
16.
The crisis also exposed the fragile nature of Zambia’s financial markets, as price
adjustments were volatile over an extended period of time and the market for primary
auctions of government securities came under stress. The reversal of short term capital flows
also proved disruptive, despite a level of foreign exchange reserves that was more than
adequate to meet these outflows.
17.
Looking ahead, monetary policy will aim to restore inflation to single digits in
2010, and to strengthen the framework that minimizes exchange rate volatility without
targeting the level of the exchange rate. The government and the Bank of Zambia will aim
to reduce inflation to 8 percent by end-2010 and aim to contain reserve money growth to 19
percent over the same period. After several years of rapid private sector credit expansion,
domestic credit is projected to moderate to 20 percent in 2010.
18.
The Bank of Zambia is actively reviewing its monetary policy framework, with a
view to shift to using interest rates as the main instrument to anchor inflationary
expectations. This could help better entrench the goal of singe-digit inflation. To this end,
work is underway on the institutional, analytical, and communication elements that would be
necessary.
19.
The Government will continue to maintain a fully flexible exchange rate regime.
Interventions in the foreign exchange market by the Bank of Zambia will be limited to the
smoothing of fluctuations, while allowing for a gradual buildup of international reserves. We
welcome the recent SDR allocation of US$627 million from the IMF, the bulk of which we
intend to keep as international reserves.
20.
In an effort to improve the efficiency of public debt, the Government is
considering a restructuring of public debt to reduce costly domestic borrowing and
increase concessional external financing. Domestic debt dominates the current public debt
portfolio, and has served as an expensive source of development financing for Zambia. While
remaining fully respectful of debt sustainability indicators, the Government is actively
examining the possibility of redeeming domestic debt securities, financed through a
drawdown in reserves. It is expected that this portfolio swap will lead to lower debt service
burdens, and create additional room for private sector credit through lower government
borrowing in domestic markets. By reducing government demand for domestic debt, lower
interest rate spreads are also expected. Such an arrangement would be undertaken within the
agreed monetary framework for 2010.

38
C: Structural Policies
Public Financial Management
21.
Considerable progress has been made in implementing public financial
management reforms. After consultation with stakeholders, the government has altered its
budget cycle to ensure parliamentary approval of the budget in advance of the fiscal year.
This is expected to improve budget execution and the legislature’s participation in the
budgeting process. In addition, the government is expected to introduce a planning and
budgeting act in 2010 in order to clearly define the budgeting process and key deliverables
by the government as part of the budget (structural benchmark for end-June 2010).
22.
The government is in the advanced stages of finalizing its implementation
strategy for the establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). A draft strategy was
approved in early 2009 and various modalities of implementation have now been addressed.
The implementation will commence with trial runs at the Ministry of Finance and National
Planning, followed by a full pilot in early 2010, with other Ministries, Provinces, and
Spending Agencies (MPSAs) being added to the pilot in due course. The full introduction of
the Treasury Single Account will be phased, commencing in 2010 when six MPSAs will
adopt the TSA (structural benchmark for end-December 2010), and all MPSAs expected to
use the TSA subsequently.
23.
The implementation of the integrated financial management information system
(IFMIS) will gather significant momentum in 2010, with the first full pilot commencing
in January 2010. Comprising of thirteen technology modules, the IFMIS project will create
substantial efficiencies across government institutions, providing for greater financial
information flows and improved accountability and control. The first pilot site will be the
Ministry of Finance and National Planning, which will operate all thirteen modules starting
in January 2010. Over the course of the year, additional MPSAs will be included, with a full
rollout expected by end-2011.
Financial Sector Development
24.
The government remains committed to a comprehensive and inclusive
mechanism of developing the financial sector through the implementation of the second
phase of the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP II). The successful
implementation of the FSDP II is expected to: (i) support the achievement of low and stable
inflation by enhancing the efficiency of monetary policy; (ii) strengthen the supervision of
the financial sector and build its resilience to system shocks; (iii) continue to develop the
payment system; (iv) enhance the secondary market trading for government securities and
corporate debt; and (v) promote financial inclusiveness. The objectives of the FSDP will be
to improve access to credit, as well as reduce the high cost of borrowing.

39
25.
In order to enhance the efficiency of monetary policy, an overnight lending
facility will be introduced by end-November 2009. It is anticipated that the introduction of
this facility will provide for lower volatility in short term interest rates as well as an easing of
structural rigidities relating to market segmentation amongst financial institutions.
26.
The Bank of Zambia will also revise the lender of last resort policy to align it
with accepted international standards and ensure that it remains effective and relevant.
In addition, a financial sector contingency plan will be drafted to address the impact of a
system-wide crisis in the financial sector and broader economy (structural benchmark for
end-December 2010).
Energy
27.
The government remains committed to addressing medium-term capacity
constraints in electricity generation. While the completion of rehabilitation projects by the
public utility ZESCO has improved the reliability of electricity supply, the medium-term
focus remains to increase generating capacity through the commissioning of new generation
projects. Commencing in 2009, a multi-year tariff framework was announced to raise
electricity tariffs to cost-recovery levels by 2011. A first adjustment of 35 percent has been
implemented in 2009 and concurrently an indicative increase of 26 percent was announced
for 2010. The exact percentage of the next increase will be announced after statutory public
consultation (structural benchmark for end-June 2010). Efforts are under way to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the utility. Plans to expand the installation of pre-paid
electricity meters across the country are progressing, and performance on the key
performance indicators 1 is expected to improve in 2010.
28.
Several sizable electricity generation projects are underway or are being
considered. Work has commenced at the Kariba North Bank extension project, which will
add 360 MW of additional capacity in the medium term. In addition, the government is close
to finalizing technical discussions and will soon commence financial negotiations for the
Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) project, which is expected to add another 600-750 MW of
capacity by 2017. Given the size of the KGL project, expected to be one of the continent’s
largest public private partnerships in the electricity generation sector, the government may
have to contract new non-concessional external financing. It is now expected that this nonconcessional financing will be undertaken in 2010.

1

Each quarter, ZESCO reports on its performance of select indicators that are specified by the Energy
Regulation Board. These Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used as part of the tariff review process to
ensure that any tariff awards are measured against performance by the public utility.

40
Debt and Aid Management
29.
The government is committed to improving public debt management. The debt
management strategy seeks to: improve risk management; ensure that financial obligations
are settled as scheduled; control contingent liabilities; minimize the cost of financing the
budget; support the development and deepening of financial markets; and facilitate effective
coordination between monetary, fiscal and debt management policies. In this context, the
Government will continue working on enhancing and unifying the legal framework,
enhancing the monitoring of public sector debt, including debt contracted by public
enterprises, and strengthening institutional capacity to manage and monitor debt. Efforts in
these areas have been supported by technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank.
30.
There is a growing demand for resources to finance large infrastructure projects
of high economic return in Zambia. Given the constraints of limited concessional
financing, the government has moved to develop a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
framework through which the private sector can be engaged to participate in the process of
national development. In certain cases, however, it may be necessary for the government to
participate as an equity partner in such projects. In order to engage in these infrastructure
initiatives, the there may be a need to raise non-concessional debt to finance such
participation. Any such need would be measured against the economic return of such projects
(after consulting with the World Bank or other relevant institutions, and only high quality
projects yielding substantially high economic returns will be candidates for such financing.
The government expects that such financing needs shall be considered for inclusion into the
program on a case-by-case basis.
31.
The government will continue to strengthen the management of aid. Priority will
be given to further enhancing cooperation with the donor community, including with respect
to the compilation of consistent and timely aid data. In an effort to reconcile data on grant
financing across government ministries, a closer dialogue between cooperating partners, the
Ministry of Finance and National Planning, and the Bank of Zambia is being facilitated. The
government is committed to addressing concerns that cooperating partners may have on
governance issues that may hold back the disbursement of donor funds, as agreed under the
Poverty Reduction Budget Support Memorandum of Understanding with cooperating
partners.
Economic Statistics
32.
Improving Zambia’s statistical data collection and dissemination, particularly
with regard to the quality of national accounts and consumer price data, will be a
priority for the Government in 2010. Resources will be made available to finalize the
economic census, which began in 2008, with the aim to rebase national accounts from the
current 1994 base year. Simultaneously, there will be a comprehensive review of
methodologies that are used to calculate national accounts, with the aim to align them to best

41
practices. A corresponding rebasing exercise is needed for the consumer price index. The
government is also working with cooperating partners to finalize the 2006 Living Conditions
Monitoring Survey, and to undertake a full national census of population in 2010.
IV: PROGRAM MONITORING
33.
Semi-annual disbursements under the PRGF arrangement will be based on the
observance of quantitative performance criteria. Completion of the fourth and fifth
reviews of the arrangement will be based on the observance of quantitative performance
criteria through end-December 2009 and end-June 2010, respectively (Tables 1 and 2). The
fourth review is expected to be completed by June 2010 and the fifth and sixth reviews are
expected to be completed, respectively, by end-November 2010 and end-May 2011.

ATTACHMENT II. TMU
Technical Memorandum of Understanding for the 2008–10
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Zambian authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for the program supported by the PRGF
arrangement, as well as the program adjusters and the related reporting requirements.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS: DEFINITIONS AND
DATA SOURCES
A. Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Bank of Zambia (BoZ)
2.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BoZ are defined as the monthly average (based on
daily data) of reserve money (as defined below) less net foreign assets of the BoZ calculated at
kwacha 4,622.0 per U.S. dollar for 2010. 1 Net foreign assets of the BoZ are defined as gross
international reserves (defined in paragraph 8) plus any other foreign assets, including
US$120 million encumbered reserves at end-December 2009, minus foreign reserve liabilities
(defined below). The kwacha values of net foreign assets are derived from the U.S. dollar
values using the program exchange rate.
3.
Foreign reserve liabilities are defined as short term (one year or less in original
maturity) foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BoZ to nonresidents and outstanding
use of IMF credit.
B. Reserve Money
4.
Reserve money (monthly average based on daily data) consists of currency issued,
required reserves on kwacha deposits, required reserves on foreign currency deposits (at the
program exchange rate), positive current account balances of banks with the BoZ, and deposits
in the BoZ of non-central government institutions.
5.
Data on reserve money, including its components, will be reported by the BoZ on
weekly and end-month basis.

1

Unless otherwise defined, program exchange rates for 2010 between the U.S. dollar and other (non-kwacha)
currencies will be equal to the end-December 2009 values. The U.S. dollar/SDR rate for program purposes is
1.557 for 2010. All other assets (e.g. gold) would be revalued at their end-December 2009 market prices for 2010.

46
C. Net Domestic Financing (NDF)
6.
Net domestic financing (NDF) is defined as the Central Government’s net borrowing
from the banking and non-banking sectors (See Table 1). 2 All government-issued securities
will be recorded at cost (face value less discount). NDF will comprise:
(a)
the net position of the central Government with commercial banks, including:
(i) Treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) loans and advances; less (iv) support to MBZ;
and (v) central government deposits (defined to include account balances under the authority
of controlling officers); plus
(b)
BoZ holdings of: (i) Treasury bills; (ii) government bonds; (iii) kwacha bridge loan
(overdraft facility); less (iv) the government’s deposits at the BoZ; and (v) the donor suspense
account; plus (vi) the outstanding amount of the long-term non-transferable security issued
against the government’s indebtedness to BoZ as at end-2002; plus
(c)

Nonbank holdings of: Treasury bills; and government bonds.

7.
The data source for NDF will be the “Net Domestic Financing” Table produced by the
Economics Department of the BoZ. The Table will be submitted on a weekly basis, and will be
reconciled with the monthly monetary survey.
D. Gross International Reserves of the BOZ
8.
Unless otherwise noted here, gross international reserves of the BoZ will be defined as
reserve assets of the BoZ (See Table 2). Reserve assets are defined in the IMF BOP manual
(5th edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the IMF’s special data dissemination
standards (SDDS). They exclude, for example, foreign assets not readily available to or
controlled by the monetary authorities, and foreign currency claims on Zambian residents.
9.
Gross international reserves consist of: (i) monetary gold; (ii) foreign currency in cash;
(iii) unencumbered foreign-currency deposits at non-resident banks; (iv) foreign securities and
deposits; and (v) SDR holdings and Zambia’s reserve position with the IMF. Gross reserves
exclude non-convertible currencies, any encumbered reserve assets including but not limited to
reserve assets pledged, swapped or used as collateral or guarantee for third-party external
liabilities, commercial bank reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits, and the
US$25 million deposit in MBZ (in liquidation).
10.
For the purpose of this target, as well as those for external debt and arrears, valuation
will be in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates.
2

The Central Government includes all the administrations identified by the budget heads listed in the Yellow
Book for 2010.

47
11.
Data on gross international reserves, including its components, will be reported by the
BoZ on a weekly and end-month basis.
E. External Payment Arrears
12.
The performance criterion on the non-accumulation of new external payment arrears is
continuous. Official external payment arrears are defined as unpaid debt service by the central
Government and BoZ 30 days beyond the due date and/or the grace period. This definition
excludes arrears on debt subject to rescheduling.
13.
Data on arrears are compiled jointly by the Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoFNP) and BoZ and will be reported by the MoFNP on a quarterly basis.
F. Official External Debt
14.
Official medium- and long-term concessional external debt is defined as all forms of
official debt with original maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the
central Government, BoZ, ZESCO, ZAMTEL and Zambia Railways Limited having a grant
element of no less than 35 percent, since the beginning of the calendar year. The grant element
is to be calculated by using currency-specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs)
reported by the DAC of the OECD. For maturities of less than 15 years, the grant element will
be calculated based on six-month averages of CIRRs, and for maturities longer than 15 years,
the grant element will be calculated based on 10-year averages. Lending from the IMF will be
excluded.
15.
This minimum grant element applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274(00/85) of August 24, 2000; see Country Report 08/187), but also to commitments contracted
or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
16.
Official external non-concessional debt is defined as the contracting or guaranteeing of
external debt other than concessional debt as defined in paragraph 14, owed or guaranteed by
the central Government, BoZ, ZESCO, ZAMTEL and Zambia Railways Limited.
17.
The ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of medium and long-term non-concessional
external debt by the central government, BoZ, ZESCO, ZAMTEL and Zambia Railways
Limited excludes: (i) non-concessional loans stemming from the rescheduling of external debt;
and (ii) central government securities issued in domestic currency, placed in the domestic
primary or secondary markets, and held by non-residents.
18.
Official external short-term debt is defined as the contracting or guaranteeing of
external debt with original maturity of less than one year, and includes forward commodity
sales but will exclude normal trade credit for imports, incurred since the beginning of the
calendar year.

48
19.
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85) of August 24,
2000; see Annex).
20.
Detailed data on all new external debt (concessional and non-concessional) contracted
or guaranteed by the central government, BoZ, ZESCO, ZAMTEL and Zambia Railways
Limited will be provided by the MoFNP on a monthly basis. Information will include
(i) amounts contracted or guaranteed; (ii) currencies; and (iii) terms and conditions, including
interest rate, maturity, grace period, payments per year, commissions and fees, and collaterals.
G. Domestic Arrears of Central Government
21.
Domestic arrears are defined as: (i) any bill that has been received by a spending
ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and for which payment
has not been made within 30 days after the due date of payments; (ii) wage, salary and any
other payment to government employees, including pension contributions and all forms of
housing allowances, that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th
of the following month; and (iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days
after the due date of payment.
22.
Information regarding domestic arrears is to be compiled through audits of the
accounts of spending Ministries and agencies, conducted by the Internal Audit division of the
MoFNP. The audits will be completed and data submitted to IMF staff by the Secretary of the
Treasury within six weeks of the end of each quarter.
H. Floor on Social Spending
23.
Social spending is defined as central government domestically financed expenditure on
health and education as listed in the 2010 Yellow Book under the functional classification. The
corresponding indicative target sets the minimum spending on these sectors combined.
III. ADJUSTERS
24.
The quantitative performance criteria specified under the program are subject to the
following adjusters:
General budget support (GBS) net of debt service 3
(i)
The ceilings on NDA and NDF will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full
amount of the excess (shortfall) in GBS net of debt service relative to the programmed levels
specified in Table 1 of the MEFP. 4, 5
3

General budget support consists of grants and loans received by the central Government for financing its overall
policy and budget priorities following Zambian budget procedures.

For the purpose of adjusting the NDA ceiling, external disbursements will be treated as if they were received the
first day of the month. The targeted NDA will be increased by the amount of the disbursement divided by the
number of business days in the month multiplied by the number of business days from the beginning of the month
to the day prior to the disbursement.

Appendix II. Zambia—Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2009 Under
the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries (LIC
DSA), Zambia’s risk of external debt distress remains low as all debt indicators stay well
below the indicative policy thresholds throughout the projection period (2009–29). 1 Due to the
authorities’ conservative debt policy and strategy, the debt level has remained broadly
unchanged since Zambia received debt relief under HIPC and MDRI in early 2006. The
authorities have received technical assistance from the Bank and the Fund to further improve
on debt management practices. 2 While this favorable situation leaves some room for new
borrowing, particularly to invest in much needed projects in the energy sector, 3 the authorities’
intention to contract substantial amounts of new non-concessional external debt bears close
monitoring, to ensure that projects so financed are viable, that debt remains properly managed,
and that debt burden indicators do not start increasing sharply. While some of this financing
should preferably come in the form of FDI, it is prudent to assume at this stage that it will be
in the form of non-concessional borrowing. For this reason, this DSA incorporates an amount
for such anticipated borrowing in the baseline scenario, even if the debt has not been
contracted.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Zambia’s stock of external debt declined substantially with the advent of the HIPC
Initiative and MDRI; external debt-to-GDP declined from about 86 percent in 2005 to around
9 percent in 2006. The debt ratio increased marginally to 11.5 percent of GDP in 2008, most of
which is public and publicly guaranteed debt (PPG). 4

1

Previous LIC DSAs in 2005 and 2007 (Country Report No. 06/39, Appendix VI, and Country Report 08/41)
indicated that Zambia is at a low risk of debt distress.
2

At the request of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, a joint IMF-World Bank mission visited
Lusaka, August 26–September 7, 2009, to provide technical assistance in debt management strategy formulation
and feedback on the authorities’ existing debt management strategy.
3

Preliminary estimates indicate that the construction of three hydropower plants (Itezhi Tezhi, Kariba North, and
Lower Kafue Gorge) during 2010–16, would require financing in the order of US$1.7 billion.
4

Statutory obligations attributed to state owned enterprises are accounted for under PPG as contingent liabilities.
While private debt constitutes debt of non-mining private companies, some of it stems from former state owned
enterprises operating under the commercial code.

II. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 6
3.
While Zambia was negatively affected by the global economic downturn, the
medium-term outlook remains relatively favorable due to productivity increases in
recent years on account of high investment in the mining sector. The mining sector, which
was hit hard in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a steep drop in copper prices, recovered
promptly as copper prices recovered in the first half of 2009. Lasting recovery, however, will
depend on sustained growth in the sector and the resumption of capital inflows, both of which
hinge on the resumption of global demand. Fiscal policy aims to safeguard macroeconomic
stability while prioritizing infrastructure development. In concert, monetary policy aims at
keeping inflation on a downward path while providing much needed support for growth.
Although the balance of payments position has been temporarily weakened by the crisis, full
recovery is expected in the medium term. Over time the Zambian economy is expected to
diversify as nonmining activity expands in response to improvements in the business
environment and infrastructure. There is considerable untapped potential in agriculture and
tourism but much remains to be done with respect to investment in infrastructure, particularly
in the energy sector.
The baseline scenario incorporates the following assumptions:
•

Economic growth: Real GDP is estimated at 5.3 percent in 2009, 5.5 percent in 2010,
6.0 percent by 2011, and 6.4 percent by 2014, supported primarily by activity in
mining and construction. While investment in energy is expected to benefit all sectors
over time, the mining industry is expected to be the immediate beneficiary.
Diversification is, however, necessary in order to make up for the eventual decline in
mining activity, as this non-renewable resource will ultimately be depleted. But
investment in tourism and agriculture are not expected to be as resource intensive as
mining and energy. Hence, once the near-term investment and construction impact
slows, growth is expected to stabilize at a rate slightly below 6 percent in the long-run.
An average growth rate in the order of 5.4 percent in the period 2015–19 is envisaged. 7

•

Inflation: The current objective of monetary policy is to reduce inflation to 12 percent
by end-2009 and to single digits thereafter. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies should
make it possible to reduce inflation to around 5 percent in the medium term.

6

For more details on the macroeconomic framework see Zambia - 2009 Staff Report for the Article IV
Consultation and Third Review Under the PRGF.
7

The growth story is broadly unchanged since the 2007 DSA: It stated that, real GDP would continue to grow at
6–6½ percent a year through 2012, supported primarily by developments in the copper and construction sectors.
Over time, however, the Zambian economy would be expected to diversify as noncopper sectors expand in
response to an improved business environment and infrastructure. Hence, long run growth was expected to
stabilize at 4½ percent.

53
•

External sector: Long-term mining volume is expected to grow in line with GDP.
While copper will undoubtedly remain Zambia’s most important export, its share in
total exports is expected to decline gradually over time. Foreign direct investment
peaked at 12 percent of GDP in 2007. It is expected to decline to around 3 percent of
GDP by 2014, 8 as investment in the mining sector slows due to capacity constraints.
Diversification into other industries such as agriculture and tourism is unlikely to be as
resource intensive as mining.

•

Government revenue and expenditure: Government revenues would rise gradually from
15.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 19 percent by 2029, mainly from improvements in tax
administration; no change in the tax system is assumed. Expenditures would rise
gradually and stay at about 22 percent of GDP.

•

Financing: Grant equivalent external financing is 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, declines
to about 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, and stabilizes at about 2 percent
thereafter. Domestic financing is 2.2 percent of GDP in 2009 and declines to around
1 percent of GDP by 2015 where it stabilizes thereafter.

•

The baseline scenario assumes new public borrowing for energy projects on
commercial terms in the order of US$1.7 billion in 2010-2016. At this relatively
modest level, commercial borrowing would not pose any threat to external debt
sustainability. It is assumed that commercial debt will continue to grow thereafter,
albeit at a slower pace. The average grant element of new borrowing declines thus from
27 percent in 2009 to about 10 percent in 2010–16, and rises thereafter to 21 percent.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline scenario
4.
Although external debt burden indicators rise in the medium term, they are
expected to remain well below the indicative policy thresholds over the projection period
(Figure 1 and Table 1). 9 The stock of external debt is expected to remain around 12–17 percent
of GDP through 2014 and decline thereafter. The present value (PV) of public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP is in the 8–13 percent range through 2014, well below the
40 percent threshold, and declines thereafter. The PV of debt to exports increases from
21 percent in 2008 to 44 percent by 2014, well below the 150 percent threshold, and declines
8

The 2007 DSA concluded in comparison that annual foreign direct investment would decline to an average of
2½ percent for 2008–12 and to 1½ percent of GDP over the long run.

9

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) ranks Zambia as a medium performer
(the average 2006–08 CPIA totals 3.46). Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are (i) PV of debtto-GDP: 40 percent; (ii) PV of debt-to-exports: 150 percent; (iii) PV of debt-to-revenue: 250 percent; (iv) debt
service to exports: 20 percent; and (v) debt service to revenue: 30 percent.

54
thereafter. PV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt to revenue increases from 41 in
2008 to around 80 in 2012–14 after which it declines. This compares to a threshold of 250.
Debt service in percent of exports increases from 1.5 in 2008 to 5 by 2014, compared to the
20 percent threshold. PPG debt service in percent of revenue is in the 2.5-9.0 range through
2014 and declines thereafter, as compared to a threshold of 30.
Stress tests and alternative scenarios
5.
The standard sensitivity analysis points to a low risk of debt distress in absolute
an relative terms, particularly as compared to the situation prior to debt relief (Table 3).
Under the historical scenario, debt burden indicators rise significantly over time without,
however, breaching the indicative thresholds. This scenario reflects the poor performance of
the Zambian economy from 1999 through 2002. Under this scenario, the external non-interest
current account deficit remains at 10.1 percent of GDP from 2009 to 2029—significantly
higher than the deficit assumed in the baseline scenario (2.4 percent by 2019). As a result, the
PV of debt-to-revenue ratio rises steadily from 53 percent in 2009 to 158 by 2019 and 170 by
2029, as compared to the threshold of 250. Similar trajectories are experienced for other
solvency indicators, but in all cases the thresholds are not breached.
6.
The most extreme stress test reflects the one standard deviation shock to exports of
goods and services assumed to occur in 2010 and 2011 before returning to baseline growth
rates. As a result of this shock, the PV of debt-to-exports rises from 24 percent in 2009 to its
peak of 118 percent in 2013 and dissipates thereafter. This compares to a threshold of 150
percent of GDP. All bound tests result in stable ratios higher than the baseline, but well below
the thresholds. Thus, even under difficult circumstances, Zambia’s risk of debt distress is low.
The scenario based on historical averages points to the need to diversify Zambia’s exports
away from copper as a means to make it even more resilient to external shocks.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
7.
Zambia’s public debt remains stable over the projection period (Table 2 and
Figure 2). t increases marginally from 26 percent of GDP in 2008 to 28 percent by 2011 and
declines thereafter to 18 percent by 2019. Thus, public debt is relatively modest and
manageable.
Stress tests and alternative scenarios
8.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that Zambia’s public debt is also resilient
to shocks (Table 4). The alternative scenarios and bound tests show that the outlook for public
debt sustainability is benign. In an alternative scenario where the primary balance is
unchanged from 2009, the PV of debt-to-GDP reaches 21 percent in 2019, as compared to

55
15 in the baseline. This ratio increases marginally to 22 percent under the bound tests (real
GDP growth is at historical average minus one standard deviations in 2010–11; and 10 percent
of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2010). In contrast, the PV of debt-to-revenue
ratio appears to be under some stress in the medium term. It peaks at 185 in 2011, as compared
to the baseline of 132, under one alternative bound test (10 percent of GDP increase in other
debt creating flows in 2010). This underscores the importance of macroeconomic stability.
V. CONCLUSION
9.
The application of the Joint Fund-Bank LIC DSA indicates that Zambia’s debt
outlook remains strong resulting in a low risk of external debt distress rating. The
external debt indicators remain well below the thresholds in the alternative scenarios and the
bound stress tests. The risks to public debt are also low. In order to preserve debt sustainability
going forward, the authorities will have to continue the practice of constraining external
borrowing on non-concessional terms while being mindful that the room for domestic debt
accumulation is constrained by high domestic interest rates.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (impli
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX.

Safeguards Assessment

An update of the previous safeguards assessment, completed on January 13, 2009, of the
Bank of Zambia (BoZ) is currently underway in conjunction with the augmentation under the
PRGF arrangement approved in June 2009. The previous safeguards assessment found that
aspects of the BoZ safeguards framework have been strengthened since the previous
assessment, completed in 2004. Specifically, the BoZ implemented IFRS in 2005 and
strengthened foreign reserves management and oversight in 2008. Weak statutory
independence, protracted external audit completion, and incomplete publication of audited
information remain safeguards concerns. The assessment recommended specific measures to
address these issues, the implementation of which are being monitored under the program.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The currency of Zambia is the kwacha. The exchange rate arrangement is a “float”, with the
kwacha exchange rate determined in the interbank market. The buying rate of the Bank of
Zambia (BoZ) is a simple average of the primary dealers’ low bid rates and the BoZ’s selling
rate is the simple average of the primary dealers’ high offer rates. On April 19, 2002, Zambia
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
However, the Fund urged the authorities to eliminate the exchange restriction evidenced by
the accumulation of external payments arrears, which is subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, as soon as possible.
XI.

Article IV Consultations

Zambia is on the standard 24-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to the provisions
of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The Executive Board
concluded the last Article IV consultation on December 7, 2007.
XII.

FSAP Participation and ROSC

Zambia has participated in the financial sector assessment program (FSAP); an FSAP
mission from the Fund and the World Bank conducted a comprehensive external assessment
of the financial system April 30-May 15 and July 15–26, 2002. A mission from the Fund and
the World Bank conducted a follow up FSAP in November, 2008.
The fiscal transparency module of a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
assessing compliance with the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency—
Declaration of Principles was issued to the Executive Board on October 31, 2001. A
ROSC-data module was issued to the Executive Board on January 18, 2005.

ANNEX III. ZAMBIA : STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 23, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Issues with source data and compilation affect most datasets, but are particularly problematic
in the national accounts, balance of payments, and consumer prices.
1.
National Accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the
level and growth rate of real GDP, as 1994 is the latest benchmark year for value-added
ratios to estimate GDP under the production approach. For many important industry areas,
such as wholesale and retail trade, construction, business services and many other service
industries, (consisting mainly of small-scale private service providers) there are no
appropriate indicators. Data on total production and intermediate consumption of
establishments are not available. On the expenditure side, there are no reliable indicators of
household consumption and private final consumption expenditure is derived as a residual.
Source data for estimating gross fixed capital formation and changes in stocks are
incomplete. The situation largely reflects resource constraints and organizational weakness
within the CSO that have affected its ability to produce economic statistics on a timely basis.
Price statistics: The CPI broadly adheres to international methodological standards. The
classification system used for compilation closely follows the Classification of Individual
Consumption by Purpose. However, the measurement of inflation is also subject to a high
degree of uncertainty since the weights for Zambia’s CPI are derived from the Household
Budget Survey (HBS) of 1993/94 and thus are out-of-date. STA is providing technical
assistance in this area.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. The transactional coverage of these data is however limited to government
operations and transactions in nonfinancial assets. Data on transactions in financial assets and
liabilities are still unavailable. The authorities report monthly budget data to AFR for
operational use in a timely manner, but the data are often subject to substantial revisions, and
data on extra-budgetary institutions and local governments are not available. STA is
providing technical assistance in this area.
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. As a
result of implementation of a 2005 monetary and financial statistics mission, there has been a
noticeable improvement in the quality of monetary accounts compiled and reported in
accordance with the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the BoZ and other depository
corporations (ODCs). However, the implementation of some recommendations pertaining to

69
the ODCs accounts still has some way to go and in some instances the pace of
implementation could have been accelerated.
Balance of payments statistics: Little progress had been made since the assessment by the
2004 Data ROSC mission. Data sources remain poor (some items are estimated without
reference to current source data) and compilation methods are inadequate. Resources
available for balance of payments compilation have been increased, but are still inadequate,
while coordination between the BoZ and CSO had improved. As a result, significant gaps in
data remain in many areas including reinvested earnings, trade in services, and the financial
account (including export proceeds held abroad by mining and nontraditional exporters).
While the source data are generally adequate in terms of timeliness, they fall short in terms of
coverage. As a result the shortcomings in source data coverage, indirect estimation methods
are used, some of which have remained unchanged for many years and are out of date.
Source data on private sector foreign assets and liabilities are insufficient to compile an
International Investment Position statement.
External and domestic debt statistics: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Recent efforts, facilitated by technical assistance, have led to an improvement in
the consolidation of the debt databases, both in terms of external and domestic debt. Further
work is underway in these areas.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 17, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Zambia
On December 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zambia. 1 The Executive Board also completed the
third review under Zambia’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement.
Background
The Zambian economy has performed well in recent years and showed some resilience to
the recent global recession. Growth in 2009 is now projected at 5.3 percent, in line with the
average for recent years, as the slowdown in the tertiary sector was compensated by a
significant increase in copper production and a bumper crop. Inflation has moderated steadily
from the food and fuel price induced highs of 2008 and stood at 12.3 percent in October 2009.
The current account deficit has narrowed, helped by a recovery of copper prices and import
compression following a sharp depreciation of the Kwacha. Zambia’s reserve position is now
stronger than it has been in almost four decades at about 4½ months of import cover, thanks
in part to the augmentation of access under the PRGF arrangement and the recent
SDR allocation. Progress is being made towards the attainment of the Millennium Development
Goals. Poverty indicators have improved over the past decade, though the issue of rural poverty
and service delivery remains a challenge. Health indicators have been improving, while the
country is on-track towards meeting its goal of universal primary education.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

While the overall performance of the economy has held up well, government revenue
collections, particularly of import-related taxes, have fallen short of expectations. In order to
preserve targets for domestically-financed capital spending, the government has accessed
additional domestic financing, including from the BoZ. Delays in the disbursement of donor
aid have further hampered government’s ability to meet spending targets.
After coming under sustained pressure in late 2008 and early 2009, the Kwacha has more
recently strengthened and stabilized, supported by the recovery in copper prices. During the
period of downward pressure, the Bank of Zambia intervened to maintain orderly conditions
in the foreign exchange market, drawing on its earlier build up of reserves. Foreign
exchange sales also helped the Bank meet its reserve money target for the first half of 2009.
More recently, the Bank has relied to a greater extent on open market operations for liquidity
management. While there has been an increase in non-performing loans, the banking sector
remains adequately capitalized and liquid.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Zambian authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management, observing that the Zambian economy has proven resilient to the global
economic crisis. Growth is expected to be in line with its average for recent years and
inflation is projected to moderate, while international reserves have risen to new highs owing
in part to the PRGF augmentation and to the SDR allocation.
Directors commended the government for their response to spending pressures in 2009, and
noted that the 2010 budget is well balanced. They supported the authorities’ emphasis on
creating fiscal space for pro-poor expenditure and for infrastructure investment to sustain
robust and diversified growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to undertake a
comprehensive review of tax policy and administration, broaden the tax base, and reinforce
tax collection efforts. They underscored the need to reverse the upward trend in the wage
bill in order to free resources for other government priority outlays and social spending, and
encouraged the authorities to make progress in implementing the civil service and pay
reform program in 2010. Further measures to improve government spending efficiency will
be necessary, building on the recent alignment of the budget cycle to the fiscal year and the
ongoing reforms related to the treasury single account and the integrated financial
management and information system.
Directors noted that staff assessed Zambia’s risk of debt distress as low. They concurred
that there is some scope for non-concessional borrowing to finance the government’s share
in essential infrastructure projects, particularly in electricity generation. Nonetheless, a
robust debt management strategy is needed to maintain debt sustainability. The
government’s commitment to improve aid management was welcomed along with closer
coordination with donors, including on governance concerns.
Directors agreed that the floating exchange rate regime and reserve money-based monetary
program have served Zambia well. They noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange

3
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. They encouraged the authorities to continue to limit
foreign exchange interventions to reducing excessive exchange rate volatility. They saw
scope for a gradual shift toward interest rates as the main instrument to anchor inflationary
expectations. They stressed that a transition to an inflation targeting regime should be
premised on further analysis and on ensuring that the necessary preconditions are in place.
Although the banking sector remains adequately capitalized and liquid, deeper financial
intermediation is needed to spur growth. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement
the second phase of the financial sector development plan to enhance financial system
stability and financial intermediation. They welcomed plans to develop a secondary market
in government securities and to enact a lender of last resort policy for the Bank of Zambia. A
few Directors stressed the importance of strengthening efforts to fight money laundering.
Directors welcomed the move to raise electricity tariffs toward cost recovery levels and
emphasized the importance of ensuring full cost recovery to attract private sector
investment. They supported strict adherence to a multiyear program of tariff increases. They
encouraged the authorities to accelerate efforts to strengthen the financial and operational
efficiency of ZESCO. A few Directors underscored the importance of a reliable legal
framework to govern public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment. Directors called
on the authorities to address the weaknesses in the quality and timeliness of economic
statistics, which pose a significant obstacle to economic analysis and policymaking.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under the PRGF Arrangement with
Zambia and Approves US$ 81.2 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third review
of Zambia’s economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. The completion of the review will enable the immediate disbursement of an amount
equivalent to SDR 51.013 million (about US$ 81.2 million), bringing total disbursements to SDR
164.91 million (about US$ 262.5 million).
The PRGF arrangement for Zambia in the amount of SDR 48.91 million (about US$79.2 million)
was originally approved in June 2008 ( see Press Release No. 08/134), and later augmented by
SDR171.185 million (about US$256.4 million) to SDR 220.095 million (about US$329.7
million) in May 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/147).
The Executive Board today also concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with Zambia. A
Public Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Zambian authorities are to be commended for their solid performance under the PRGFsupported program. Their prudent macroeconomic management was demonstrated by the
Zambian economy’s resilience to the global economic crisis.
“The 2010 budget is well balanced. The authorities aim to create fiscal space for poverty reducing
expenditure and for infrastructure investment to sustain robust and diversified growth. The
authorities will review tax policy and administration, with a view to broadening the tax base and
reinforcing tax collection. The upward trend in the wage bill needs to be reversed to free
resources for other priority outlays and social spending. Further reforms to enhance government
spending efficiency are also needed.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Zambia
December 14, 2009
Zambia’s economic performance in 2009 has been affected by the global economic
contraction largely through the trade channels. Mining companies reacted to the sharp drop in
copper prices by cutting back on project development, scaling down operations, and placing
some mines under care and maintenance. The authorities put in place tax and expenditure
measures to safeguard operations and employment in the mining and other sectors. These
measures coupled with a re-bound in copper prices and bumper maize harvest, have led to an
incipient recovery in economic activity. Consequently, economic growth in 2009 has been
revised upwards to 5.3 percent from an earlier forecast of 4 percent. The end-year inflation
target of 12 percent is within reach as a consequence of this favorable development. Progress
has also been recorded in meeting the Millennium Development Goals with respect to health
indicators and universal primary education. Moving forward, the key challenges are to
improve revenue performance and consolidate the fiscal position, enhance the financing of
priority infrastructure projects, address rural poverty and improve service delivery with
increased vigor.
My authorities thank the Fund for helpful policy guidance, financial support and technical
assistance. They also appreciate the candid policy exchange with staff and are in general
agreement with the staff reports.
Program performance
Program performance has been satisfactory, with all the end- June 2009 quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets being met and two of the three structural
benchmarks observed. Delays regarding the third structural benchmark of setting up a
supervisory regime for the secondary market in government securities was because of the
need to widen the consultation process. However, considerable progress has been made and
the benchmark has now been reset for end-March 2010. Two end-September 2009
benchmarks have also been met, although one—introduction of a new standing overnight
lending facility—was delayed by 2 months on account of delay in completing the
consultation process with the market players.
Macro-economic policy framework
The authorities’ economic agenda of the for 2010 and beyond focuses on consolidating
recovery of the domestic economy and accelerating growth through economic diversification
and business-friendly macroeconomic policies, and protecting key social expenditures, such
as education and health. The macroeconomic objectives are to exceed 5 percent in annual
GDP growth, reduce end-year inflation to 8 percent, and limit annual domestic borrowing to
2 percent of GDP.

2
Fiscal policy
Domestic revenue performance has not matched the rebound in growth and is estimated to
have declined by 6.5 percent in 2009, because of lower receipts from trade taxes. The
budgetary impact of the underperformance in revenue has been exacerbated by the
withholding of sector and budget support by development partners, particularly in the health
sector ( because of financial mismanagement allegations). In order to mitigate the adverse
impact of the global contraction and safeguard priority infrastructure programs in the
transport, education and health sectors, the authorities reduced spending in low priority areas
but had to increase domestic borrowing. Consequently, total expenditure in 2009 is projected
to be about 8.3 percent lower than budget provision. However, domestic borrowing is
projected to increase by 2.2 percent of GDP.
The need to restore and accelerate economic growth, and protect social spending will expand
expenditure in 2010. Non-priority spending will be constrained in preference for spending
aimed at stimulating growth, diversifying the economy and better targeting support to
vulnerable groups. Moreover, the authorities will continue contracting debt only on
concessional basis as a first option. However, consideration may be given to limited
non-concessional financing for high return investment projects. In this regard, infrastructure
provision remains a priority with a focus on essential roads, bridges, electricity generation,
education and health facilities.
My authorities consider financial mismanagement in the health sector as unacceptable,
particularly considering the substantial progress made in improving the management of
public resources. The authorities have provided all the support needed to successful conclude
the investigations. In addition, resources to the office of the Auditor General and the
Anti-Corruption Commission are being increased in order to swiftly detect and prevent
financial irregularities, as well as fight corruption. In this connection, the authorities will
establish a Financial Intelligence Unit to further enhance the fight against financial crime. To
resolve the problems in the health sector, the authorities and development partners have a
joint action plan. Progress is on course and the second part of plan to improve system and
procurement audits will trigger further funding in mid-2010.
Monetary policy and exchange rate policy
The monetary policy framework has been underpinned by the objective of attaining single
digit inflation and allowing appropriate private sector credit expansion. The contraction in
domestic credit in 2009 is largely attributed to weaker domestic demand and stricter lending
conditions in the wake of the global financial crisis. Financial conditions remained
satisfactory and all banks remain well capitalized and liquid, despite the global financial
crisis. Even though the quality of loan performance declined, non-performing loans are
adequately provisioned.

3
Monetary policy will continue to focus on maintaining a single digit inflation and
macroeconomic stability. However, the authorities have realized that the current framework
of reserve money targeting provides little room to counter adverse cyclical conditions by
lowering interest rates. In this respect, the monetary policy framework is being reviewed to
shift from the strict use of monetary aggregates to short-term interest rates as a monetary
anchor. The ultimate objective in the medium-term is to gradually shift to inflation targeting
when conditions are right and operational autonomy of the Bank of Zambia is provided by an
Act of parliament.
Structural reform
The authorities are committed to a structural reform agenda that complements the
macroeconomic framework to improve economic diversification and competitiveness. In this
regard, a review of business licensing procedures have been completed; a legal framework
for public-private partnership has been introduced; and a multi-year tariff adjustment
framework has been approved for electricity to enhance investment in the sector while
ensuring improvement in service delivery. In the fiscal area, a new law has been put in place
to enable the budget to be presented and approved before the commencement of the financial
year; and a Treasury Single Account will be established in 2010 to further improve budget
execution and cash management of public finances. To improve access to credit and reduce
the high cost of borrowing, the implementation of the second phase of the financial sector
development program will commence in 2010. My authorities believe that these measures,
together with the unwavering support from development partners would result is the
achievement of their development agenda.
Conclusion
The Zambian authorities consider Fund support as important in helping to address the
developmental challenges the country is facing. The authorities are requesting the completion
of the third review of the PRGF and modification of the performance criteria in line with
recent developments in order to consolidate economic recovery and enhance the country’s
growth momentum.
