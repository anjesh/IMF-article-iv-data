STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Supporting a Recovery: The economy is turning the corner and growth is expected to
resume in 2012. The recovery comes after an extended slowdown lasting three years.
Supportive fiscal and monetary policies and restoring financial confidence are essential.
Implementing Fiscal Stimulus: Notwithstanding an overall balance in 2010/11, the
deterioration in the non-energy balance implied a substantial fiscal stimulus. The nearterm priority is to sustain the stimulus by implementing the investment program in the
2011/12 budget and developing new state enterprise investment plans.
Saving Energy Wealth: In the medium term, a major shift in the fiscal trajectory is
needed to resume net saving for future generations in view of the country’s
diminishing energy reserves while maintaining public investment to support growth.
The adjustment strategy should focus on rolling back transfers and subsidies to preboom levels while better targeting social benefits to vulnerable groups and
strengthening the tax effort.
Containing Financial Vulnerabilities: Given the remaining financial vulnerabilities,
continued intensified surveillance of the financial system is warranted. Although banks
are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, their NPLs have increased moderately. Nonbanks have also come under stress. The authorities’ actions, including support to credit
unions and other non-bank institutions, have reduced vulnerabilities. Completing the
resolution of a failed insurance company, CLICO, will help to improve confidence.
Encouraging Growth: Adapting the investment framework and fiscal regime for the
energy sector to changing circumstances will be crucial, given the prospective
depletion of energy reserves and competition from shale gas. Promoting diversification
will require developing a national consensus on key priorities, fostering a more
vigorous private sector and continuing efforts to improve the business environment. It
will also be important to strengthen public administration and the public service, to
ensure effective and efficient delivery of public goods and services.

2011 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
The economy is turning the corner
and growth is expected to resume in 2012.
A range of indicators point to a broad
turnaround in the non-energy sector
beginning in the second half of 2011.
Commercial bank credit, particularly to the
business sector, has expanded steadily since
mid-2011 (Figure 1), construction activity grew
in September 2011 for the first time since early
2010, and retail sales increased by 6.4 percent
through the third quarter of 2011. The
recovery comes after an extended slowdown
lasting three years in which ample buffers have
provided room for maneuver, accommodating
an expansionary fiscal stance in 2010/11, and
resources to deal with the collapse of a
systemic insurance company (CLICO).

2.
Weaker than anticipated energy
sector activity contributed to a decline in
2011. Real GDP is estimated to have
contracted by 1.3 percent in 2011 mainly
reflecting unscheduled maintenance and
technical disruptions in the energy sector and
a lackluster performance in the non-energy

sector (see chart).1 The latter is the result of
delays in public capital spending, the weak
regional and global economy, and uncertainty
related to CLICO. Inflation has picked up, rising
from a historic low of 0.6 percent in August
2011 to 6.8 percent in January 2012, as food
prices increased by double digits following
adverse weather. However, as discussed in the
2010 Article IV staff report, the CPI
methodology creates a significant upward bias
in food price inflation (Box 1). Core inflation,
which excludes the impact of food prices,
remained low at 1.8 percent in January.
Industrial relations remain divisive, as some
segments of the public workforce with
outstanding wage negotiations demand higher
wage increases in the face of the 5 percent
government offer (2-1-2) covering the
2008–10 period. Unemployment has remained
moderate in part due to government work
programs, falling to 5.8 percent in mid-2011.
3.
In the 2010/11 fiscal year (OctoberSeptember), the central government’s
finances were nearly balanced. The better
than expected outturn reflects strong revenue
performance as a result of higher energy
prices, a tax amnesty, and improved
compliance following the introduction of a
new IT platform, factors which more than
offset VAT refunds. Current and capital
spending was also lower than planned.
Nevertheless, the deterioration in the
structural primary balance (adjusted for the
output gap, energy prices, and a lag in
highway contract implementation) implied a

large fiscal stimulus. The rest of the public
sector improved to a near balance due to a
recovery in revenues and lower capital
spending by energy companies. The debt-toGDP ratio has increased sharply since 2008 as
a result of the large decline in nominal GDP,2
the CLICO bailout, and deficit financing.
However, debt net of the Heritage and
Stabilization Fund (HSF) assets remains low at
14 percent of GDP.

Monetary policy has remained
accommodative in the face of subdued
inflation. The Central Bank of Trinidad and

5.
Strains have emerged in the
financial system as a consequence of the
prolonged slowdown and the collapse of
the CL Financial Group and its insurance
subsidiary CLICO. Commercial banks remain
well capitalized, profitable, and liquid.
Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain, largely
reflecting the still fragile confidence following
the collapse of CL Financial and the financial
system’s remaining exposure to some of its
affiliates. The banking system’s nonperforming loans (NPLs), after peaking at
7.6 percent of total loans in August 2011, have
declined to 6.4 percent in November and
remain low by regional standards. The ratio of
specific provisions to NPLs declined further to
28 percent at end-October 2011, from
30 percent at end-2010 and from 52 percent at
end-2009 (Figure 3).3
6.
Progress has been made in
compensating CLICO claimants although
ongoing legal issues could lead to further
delays. The 2011/12 budget provided for an

The GDP deflator declined by 27 percent in 2009—
and nominal GDP by 29 percent—but did not rebound

there may be some issues with measurement of the
deflator.

following a reduction of 500 basis points from
end-2008. While lending rates generally
declined in line with the policy rate with a lag,
commercial bank credit to businesses only
started to recover mid-2011, reflecting both
commercial banks’ caution—despite
considerable liquidity—and low demand. In
recent months credit to the private sector has
been more dynamic (5.3 percent growth in
November y-o-y), consistent with the nonenergy sector recovery.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The CBTT’s December 2011 Financial Stability Report
indicates that the sharp fall in provisioning is related to
banks writing off several large non-performing loans
which had been provisioned, and loans that have
become non-performing which are backed by
collateral or government guarantees.

enhanced treatment for CLICO claims over the
threshold paid in cash (TT$75,000 or about
US$12,000) that were to be repaid with up-to
20-year zero-coupon bonds. Bonds maturing
in years 1–10 can be sold to banks at a
discount of at most 20 percent, and, under the
enhanced treatment, bonds due in years 11–20
may be swapped for equity in a trust that will
mainly hold shares in Republic Bank taken
from the balance sheet of CLICO. Thus far, only
a small proportion of bonds for years 1–10
have been cashed in. If the share transfer
overcomes legal hurdles and is completed as
envisaged, the gross fiscal cost of the
government’s intervention and the associated
debt burden could be reduced by as much as
3.3 percent of GDP, or about one-quarter of
the total estimated cost of the bailout.
Parliament has passed an amendment to the
Central Bank Act that would prevent CLICO
claimants from suing to enforce their claims,
which has provided some space to proceed
with the workout.

moderate. Medium-term growth is expected to
rise to 2.5 percent, significantly less than in the
years preceding the crisis, in part due to the
weak outlook for the energy sector, while nonenergy growth is expected to reach its
potential of 3.5 percent.

7.
The external accounts rebounded
strongly in 2010. The current account surplus
increased to 20 percent of GDP in 2010 and an
estimated 21 percent in 2011 up from
8 percent in 2009, stemming mainly from the
improvement in energy prices and a recovery
in non-energy exports. Gross official reserves
grew to US$9.8 billion (over 13 months of
imports) at end-2011 from US$9.1 billion at
end-2010.

10.
The governing People’s Partnership
took office in May 2010 with a five-year
term. The key priorities of the coalition
government have been to restore economic
stability, to improve governance, and to
address the high level of crime. A state of
emergency imposed in August 2011 after a
spike in crime expired in December.

8.
The economic outlook has improved
in the short term. Real economic activity is
expected to increase by 1.7 percent in 2012 as
the energy sector resumes normal operations
later in the year, and the non-energy sector
picks up momentum with the acceleration of
public investment and the restructuring of
CLICO liabilities. Inflation is expected to remain

9.
Nevertheless, there are significant
downside risks. Domestically, these stem from
the pace of implementation of public
investment, ongoing legal challenges to the
CLICO restructuring, and continued technical
disruptions in oil and gas production. There is
also the potential for external spillovers from
lower prices for oil and gas and growing
competition from shale gas, and other global
developments, including any further weakness
in demand for the country’s exports, from the
Caribbean. Commercial banks do not depend
on external funding and therefore are less
prone to spillovers on the liability side, and
there are some limited risks from lending to
the rest of the Caribbean.4

11.
The authorities implemented many
of the key policy recommendations in the
2010 Article IV consultation. These include
providing fiscal support for a recovery;
undertaking further policy rate reductions;

implementing the FSSA recommendations; and
finalizing the CLICO restructuring while
providing more favorable treatment to credit
unions. The authorities set forth their mediumterm policy plans in the 2011/12 budget,

without specifying a medium-term fiscal
trajectory and the measures to achieve it. They
are working to extend supervision to the nonbank sector and have acted to reduce
vulnerabilities in the sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Notwithstanding the weak economic performance, ample buffers have provided room for
maneuver. However, a major shift in the fiscal trajectory is needed in the medium term to
put the fiscal framework on a sound footing. Discussions focused on how to support the
recovery in the short term while returning to sustainable fiscal path going forward
consistent with the prospective depletion of energy resources, and on addressing financial
vulnerabilities and promoting diversification.

A. Fiscal Policy
12.
The 2011/12 budget, if implemented
as envisaged, will appropriately provide
stimulus to support the recovery (Box 2). The
central government budget deficit is projected
to be 5 percent of GDP assuming conservative
energy prices (oil price of US$75/barrel). The
staff project a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP
based on WEO prices (oil price of
US$105/barrel) and lower interest payments.

stance while emphasizing the need for timely
execution of capital spending and
development of new investment plans in the
rest of the public sector to replace the ones

that are near completion. At the same time,
staff cautioned against further increases in
recurrent central government spending,
pointing to the growth of transfers and
subsidies from 9 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to
17 percent in 2010/11. The authorities agreed
with staff on the need to address
implementation delays, including by
strengthening the execution unit within the
Ministry of Finance, but noted that filling
vacancies, even in key ministries, is
complicated by the inflexible public service
administration, leading to growing reliance on
contractual staff.

13.
The government is seeking to
improve the efficiency and buoyancy of
revenue collection. The government plans to
undertake its first major review of the tax
system since the 1980s when the VAT was
introduced. Following the tax amnesty in 2011,
which collected TT$2 billion (1.4 percent of
GDP), Inland Revenue is intensifying
enforcement with its improved technology
infrastructure. The staff welcomed this
initiative but also noted that serious staffing
shortages could limit the benefits of the new IT
platform. Broadening the tax authority’s legal
power to better utilize the new technology is
also essential to further increase compliance.
14.
Over the medium-term, a major shift
in the fiscal trajectory is needed to return
the fiscal framework to a sustainable path.
An even larger adjustment will be needed to
resume savings for future generations. The
large 2009 decline in nominal GDP put the

economy on a lower trajectory. However,
central government spending has remained on
the same pre-crisis path (see charts).
Expenditures are significantly higher relative to
GDP, but revenues have not recovered. The
prospective decline in energy output and
related revenues will further undermine public
finances eventually requiring an abrupt
adjustment (Box 3). In a passive scenario, the
overall deficit is projected to drift upward to
over 5 percent of GDP by 2016/17 even if
noninterest expenditure is held constant as a
share of GDP. The fiscal deterioration is driven
by slower-than-GDP energy revenue and
increasing interest payments. Under this
scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise
from 32 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to
48 percent by 2016/17, and as high as
69 percent in case of a growth shock. The
authorities’ medium-term passive fiscal
projection point to a similar deterioration.

The mission recommended setting
forth a credible medium-term framework
that smoothes consumption and
accommodates investment to support
development and diversification. The active
scenario, which illustrates a possible strategy,
would imply a diminishing annual adjustment
from 1 percentage point in 2012/13 to
0.6 percentage points by 2016/17. The strategy
is based on (i) holding transfers and subsidies
constant in nominal terms (thereby rolling
back some of the large increases in the past
decade), (ii) allowing other non-interest
components of current spending to grow in
line with GDP, and (iii) strengthening nonenergy revenues by improving tax
administration and broadening the tax base,
including by reducing exemptions under the
VAT and reforming property taxes. The
negative fiscal impulse implicit in this scenario
could reduce somewhat the real growth of the
non-energy sector, but improved confidence in
the sustainability of the fiscal framework may
largely mitigate this risk.5

related to resilience and buffers rather than
a return of public finance to surpluses. In
particular, they pointed to high international
reserves, savings in the HSF, and moderate
debt which provided space to respond to
exogenous shocks, and they noted that there
was no explicit strategy to return to surpluses,
in the absence of credible signs of a return to a
sustainable growth trajectory. At the same
time, they indicated that planned reforms to
eliminate wasteful expenditure and strengthen
the tax revenue efforts will restore public
finances back to a balance position or even
surpluses while providing room for investment
in infrastructure and other activities to
promote diversification. These reforms include
a Public Offerings Program which will
streamline the state enterprise sector and
reduce subsidies; a review of the social safety
net to improve targeting and increase
efficiency; measures to prevent illegal fuel
exports which will reduce the fuel subsidy; a
planned tax review; and investment in Gasoline
Optimization to produce a higher quality and
quantity of gasoline for export and to augment
energy sector revenues.
17.
The 50 percent increase in pension
benefits announced with the 2011/12
budget could affect the sustainability of the
public pension scheme. The minimum

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

pension from the National Insurance Scheme
(NIS) will increase from TT$2,000 to TT$3,000

service pensions and the Senior Citizens Grant

increase would be broadly offset by a shift
toward contributions based on a
flat percentage rather than on income
brackets, and the incorporation of the selfemployed, while the actuarial assessment due
to be completed in June 2012 will identify any
further adjustments that may be needed to
ensure sustainability of the public pension
scheme.

Since its creation in 2007, the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) has
performed well despite adverse global
economic conditions and financial market
volatility. In view of the broad political and
social consensus to safeguard and to increase
savings in the HSF, there is scope, in the
forthcoming review mandated by the HSF Act,
to clarify the HSF’s objectives by giving greater
emphasis to savings.6 This, together with the
large accumulation since 2007 suggests raising
the minimum balance and tightening
6

withdrawal rules. The existing rules allow
withdrawals of up to 25 percent of the HSF
balance for stabilization purposes when energy
revenue falls below the budget forecast. There
is also scope to clarify the procedure for
setting the budget energy prices and transfers
into the HSF. Staff underscored the importance
of an integrated approach to managing the
sovereign balance sheet taking into account
government borrowing, savings into the HSF,
and reserve accumulation. Sustained
borrowing to save into the HSF would not be
advisable. The authorities agreed that there
was a strong consensus to increase savings
into the HSF and that clarifying the objectives
and operating framework of the HSF is
essential.

The accommodative monetary
policy stance is warranted to support the
revival of private sector activity. Although
the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited
by the de facto stabilized exchange rate
arrangement, the policy rate serves as a
signaling device. In view of the nascent
recovery and the still low core inflation rate,
staff supports maintaining this stance. At the
same time, the CLICO resolution as enhanced
could have a positive wealth effect and
increase demand for foreign exchange as the
frozen claims on CLICO become available to
the policy holders. The CBTT will need to
remain vigilant and address these
developments, including by increasing FX sales
if necessary. The CBTT noted that thus far,
there was no sign of increased demand for
foreign exchange attributing this to the low
interest rates and volatility in foreign markets.

20.
Given financial vulnerabilities,
continued intensified monitoring and
surveillance of the financial system is
warranted. The high level of nonperforming
loans, while moderate compared to the rest of
the region and recently declining, may
nevertheless reflect different positions across
institutions, and the CBTT should continue with
frequent on-site inspections and the stress
testing of individual banks. The CBTT noted
that the level of NPLs was not a major concern
as it related to a few large loans that are well
collateralized or have government guarantees.
Furthermore, some of these were recently
restructured and are now current, but they
remain classified as substandard. They
underscored that full provisions were made for
the unsecured portion of all large nonperforming loans and in cases where the value
of the collateral was subject to volatility, the
value was deeply discounted and provisions
were made for the balance. The mission
welcomed progress with implementing
consolidated supervision and underscored the
urgency of implementing other key
recommendations from the 2011 Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA) (Box 4).
These include improving regional crisis
management, developing an enhanced
resolution framework for failed institutions,
and implementing the new legislative
framework once it is in place. In view of the
regional presence of domestic banks and the
increased financial integration in the
Caribbean, the mission also welcomed the
initial steps to coordinate supervision in the
region.
21.
The non-bank financial system,
particularly mutual funds and credit unions,
has experienced some stress, including
from exposure to CLICO. Credit from this
sector has fallen more steeply than from the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

banking system, and continues to contract, in
part due to more intense competition from
banks. In line with the 2011 FSSA
recommendations, the mission urged the rapid
enactment and implementation of legislation
to strengthen regulation and supervision of
the insurance, credit unions, and securities
industries. The draft Insurance Act before the
Parliament seeks to address the weaknesses
that led to the collapse of CLICO and to
implement risk-based regulation and
supervision, while draft credit unions
legislation would bring them under central
bank supervision. The revised draft Securities
Act, which would improve regulatory
cooperation and provide for on-site
inspections, should also be quickly enacted.
The authorities emphasized that their actions,
including special treatment for credit unions in
the CLICO restructuring and support for other
non-bank institutions, have reduced
vulnerabilities, and they agreed to the staff’s
proposal to bring systemic non-bank
institutions under central bank supervision.
They noted that this would require some
legislative changes to permit the CBTT greater
supervisory powers.
22.
The foreign exchange market would
benefit from added flexibility. Additional
steps are needed to increase the market’s
efficiency and avoid periods of hoarding and
temporary scarcity. The CBTT is a key player in
the market as it intermediates the foreign
exchange paid by energy companies in
royalties and taxes to the government. As
such, the CBTT’s sales are critical to balance
the market. However, uncertainty regarding
these sales, as well as inadequate timing and
volume may lead to temporary scarcity and
queuing. The central bank stopped collecting
data on queues in 2011, given reliability issues.
Discussions with market participants indicate

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

that the scarcity perceived at end-2010 has
substantially diminished—in part reflecting the
increase in frequency of CBTT FX sales—and
on balance, while the staff considers that the
system has drawbacks, it finds no concrete
evidence that would suggest that at present
there are undue delays that would constitute
Article VIII restrictions. Nevertheless there are
structural issues that hamper the market
operations and queues could easily reemerge.
Some greater exchange rate flexibility—
through a wider band for exchange rate
fluctuation—would allow pricing to play a
bigger role in equilibrating the market. A
greater role for the private sector in the market
could also improve its efficiency, but could
require measures to stimulate competition and
limit open FX positions. The authorities
expressed the concern that greater flexibility
could lead to an appreciation of the currency
and undermine diversification efforts. They
also noted that the CBTT has not been
successful in its efforts to create an FX
interbank market, given the one-sided nature
of the demand for foreign exchange. The staff
continues discussion with the authorities on
how to improve the operations of the FX
market. There is also an urgent need to
address AML/CFT deficiencies.
23.
Trinidad and Tobago’s external
position remains strong while the exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
The current account surplus has rebounded
with the increase in energy prices and a
recovery in non-energy exports. International
reserves have continued to rise, and are
significantly more than adequate according to
various measures (Box 5). The REER has
appreciated by 32 percent since 2005, mainly

2011 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

reflecting high inflation,7 and remains broadly
in line with fundamentals according to the
equilibrium real exchange rate and the
macroeconomic balance approaches for
resource-exporting countries (see Appendix I).
However, the external sustainability approach,
which explicitly takes into account the
temporary nature of energy revenue, points to
a tendency for overvaluation, underscoring the
need to intensify structural reforms to improve
the competitiveness of the non-energy sector
over the medium term. The high dependency
on energy exports and exposure to energy
price fluctuations are a source of external
vulnerabilities, compounded by uncertainty in
energy markets.

C. Growth and Diversification
24.
The key challenges in the energy
sector are the projected depletion of oil and
natural gas reserves and the falling gas
prices in the United States. The industry has
been successful in redirecting gas exports from
the United States, where prices have
plummeted as a result of the increase in shale
gas production. However, there has been
limited exploration activity and investment in
recent years. Although this may reflect the
adverse global economic climate, adapting the
sector’s investment framework and the fiscal
regime to ensure its competitiveness will be
essential.
25.
The country has been grappling with
the conundrum of diversification for many
years, with few tangible results other than
the successful move into the downstream
energy sector. These have included a wide
range of programs to develop
7

entrepreneurship, to finance early stage
enterprises, to promote promising sectors, and
to attract investment. An earlier major
initiative, to establish the country as a financial
center, foundered in the face of the financial
crisis. The staff urged a stock taking to identify
which programs have been successful and
then to mold these into a coherent strategy
while phasing out the remainder. They
welcomed measures in the 2011/12 budget to
improve physical and technological
infrastructure, foster downstream
manufacturing, strengthen the business
environment, and invigorate the private sector
including through public offerings and
public/private partnerships.

efficient delivery of public goods and services.
The survey also indicates that the most
problematic factor for doing business is the
high level of crime and theft. The mission
underscored the importance of taking full
advantage of the country’s natural strengths,
for instance, by developing further
downstream energy industries, revitalizing
tourism (Box 6), and using more fully its strong
skills base.
27.
Although data is broadly adequate
for surveillance, it urgently needs to be
improved to provide a firmer basis for
policy making. Progress has been limited in
addressing methodological weaknesses with
the CPI and the GDP deflator. In particular, a
recent STA/CARTAC TA confirms the large
overestimation of the inflation. Plans to create
an independent statistical entity are welcome,
but there is a need in the interim to better
resource and staff the existing entity to
improve the quality and availability of data.
The authorities agreed that better statistics are
urgently needed. They confirmed their
intention to subscribe to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard, which will be an
important step forward.

26.
Notwithstanding progress in
improving competitiveness the country is
lagging in a number of important areas.
Trinidad and Tobago’s relative position in the
Global Competitiveness survey has improved
since 2008 by 11 positions to 81st of 142
countries, but ranks lower in a number of key
areas such as labor market efficiency and
quality of institutions. In particular, it would be
important to strengthen public administration
and the public service to ensure effective and

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Trinidad and Tobago is exiting a
difficult period. The global crisis, sharp
decline in energy prices, and collapse of
CLICO represented significant shocks.
However, policy responses and ample buffers
contributed to maintaining stability and
containing the negative spillovers. The
challenges looking forward will be to support
the nascent recovery through appropriate
fiscal and monetary policies, setting forth a
medium-term framework to resume savings
of energy wealth, taking steps to cement
financial stability and pursue growth and
diversification.
29.
There is concrete evidence that the
economy is turning the corner and that
economic growth will resume in 2012. Real
economic activity is projected to increase
1.7 percent, as private sector credit expansion
gains momentum, the resolution of CLICO
proceeds, and the faster pace of government
investment continues. There are downside
risks stemming from possible delays in public
investment or the CLICO restructuring, further
technical disruptions in the energy sector, and
global developments, including uncertainty
over natural gas prices.
30.
The fiscal stimulus has supported
the economy. The public sector finances
were balanced in 2010/11 as a result of higher
energy prices and improved tax collection, as
well as lower than planned spending.
Nevertheless, a larger non-energy deficit
provided significant stimulus. The focus now
should be on implementing the 2011/12
budget by overcoming execution hurdles and
on developing new investment plans for
public enterprises as the pipeline of existing
projects winds down. The authorities should

take advantage of the actuarial review of the
public pension scheme to identify measures
needed to ensure its sustainability following
the recent substantial increase in benefits.
31.
The key strategic decision facing
the country is to determine the
appropriate balance of consuming, saving,
and investing energy wealth. The staff’s
active scenario emphasizes a gradual return
to surpluses, by containing current spending
and strengthening the tax effort, while
providing for investments to support
diversification. This is broadly consistent with
the authorities’ strategy, which gives greater
emphasis to eliminating wasteful
expenditures, broadening the tax base,
maintaining buffers and accommodating an
ambitious investment program in support of
diversification.
32.
The review being undertaken of the
HSF is timely. Since its creation in 2007, the
HSF has performed well despite adverse
global economic conditions and financial
market volatility. Its growth even during a
difficult period demonstrates a revealed
preference to use the HSF for savings rather
than stabilization and underscores the need
to clarify its objectives and operating
framework.
33.
The authorities have actively
worked to manage financial vulnerabilities.
The financial system has not been immune to
the prolonged economic slowdown. Although
banks remain strong, there has been some
deterioration in asset quality and continued
intensified surveillance and monitoring is
warranted. The staff welcomes efforts to
complete the resolution of CLICO, steps to

bring additional non-banks within the
regulatory perimeter of the Central Bank, and
progress with the implementation of FSSA
recommendations. They urged accelerating
the enactment of legislation on insurance,
credit unions, and securities. The staff concurs
with the accommodative monetary stance to
support the revival of private sector credit.
34.
There remain some concerns with
the operation of the foreign exchange
system. The scarcity of FX evident at end2010 appears to have substantially diminished
but structural issues hamper the market’s
operations and queues could reemerge. The
staff see some scope for a wider band to
allow pricing to play a bigger role in clearing
the foreign exchange market together with an
increase in the participation of the private
sector.
35.
Trinidad and Tobago’s external
position remains strong and the exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals,
but maintaining competitiveness in the
medium term will be important. The current
account surplus has rebounded with the
increase in energy prices and recovery in nonenergy exports. Two of the three CGER
approaches indicate that the real effective
exchange rate is close to its equilibrium level.
However, given that the external sustainability
approach points to a tendency for
overvaluation, the authorities could usefully
intensify structural reforms to improve

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

competitiveness of the non-energy sector in
the medium term.
36.
Depleting energy reserves and
growing shale gas production in the U.S.
represent significant challenges to the
energy sector. The country has been
successful in redirecting its gas exports to new
markets. Looking forward, it will be essential
to ensure that the investment framework and
fiscal regime adapt to the evolving landscape
to facilitate new exploration and development
and finding new markets.
37.
Diversification represents a major
challenge for an economy that has long
benefited from energy rents. The staff
welcome the government’s focus on
improving the regulatory and administrative
framework for private sector activity, and
fostering investment, including the planned
public offerings and public/private
partnership programs. It will also be
important to strengthen public administration
and public service.
38.
The quality of statistics is an
obstacle to informed policy making and
requires urgent attention. The authorities’
commitment to improving and reforming the
statistical infrastructure is welcome.
39.
The next Article IV consultation is
expected to be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Upward Bias in the Inflation Index
The methodology used in Trinidad and Tobago to estimate inflation leads to a substantial
upward bias, primarily in the food component. The cause of this is arithmetic averaging of price
changes for certain sub-components yielding a Carli index, which is not transitive—in other words, a
price increase in one period that is reversed in the next nevertheless increases inflation. The upward
bias is greater when prices are volatile or

Notwithstanding the implied upward bias in historical inflation data, the staff assessment of the
macroeconomic environment and government policies remains broadly unchanged. The staff and
the authorities were aware of issues with the measurement of food inflation, as flagged in the 2010
Article IV Consultation report. As a result, policy discussion and analysis focused on core inflation, which
has been at its historic low in line with the lagging economic activity. Lower inflation would imply that
the real appreciation of the exchange rate has been more modest than estimated.

Box 2. The 2011/12 Budget
The 2011/12 budget, entitled “From Steady Foundation to Economic Transformation,” reflects the shift in
emphasis from addressing legacy issues toward implementing the government’s policy priorities. The key
themes are safety, jobs, and investment.
The focus on safety came in the context of the state of emergency. The budget provides for making law
enforcement more effective through improved technology and training; a stronger legislative framework; and
intensified controls at the borders. These will include measures to address large-scale smuggling of subsidized fuel
out of the country.
The budget also sets forth a strategy for economic transformation, recognizing that despite diversification
efforts, the structure of the economy has not changed beyond the shift from an oil- to a gas-based
economy. Policies will focus on:

16



Changing the structure of the economy. This includes the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank
(with IFC assistance) to leverage long-term private financing, development of a tourism action plan, and
sales of shares in a state-owned bank, two state mortgage entities to be merged, and in the industrial
port.



Modernizing the state. Reforms aim at modernizing the public administration and public financial
management, including improved efficiency of the civil service, creation of a Public Financial
Management Modernization Unit, and better medium-term planning, debt management, public
procurement, statistics, and technology. Customs will be computerized (ASYCUDA), and VAT refunds will
be paid on a timely basis now that arrears have been cleared.



Targeting basic needs. The budget includes measures to promote home ownership, improved health
coverage, and using tuition grants to address skills shortages. It sets the objective of reducing the poverty
rate, now 17 percent, by 2 percentage points per year.

2011 ARTICLE IV STAFF REPORT

Box 3. Fiscal Sustainability
Given depleting energy reserves, a major shift in the fiscal trajectory will be required to achieve an
appropriate balance between current and future consumption.1 The authorities need to choose a path for
savings from energy income in order to avoid an abrupt adjustment in the future and provide some savings for
future generations. The magnitude of savings should also allow for needed investment to promote diversification,
but will ultimately reflect a domestic political decision on how to best promote intergenerational equity.
The deterioration in the fiscal accounts and limited energy exploration activity in recent years pose new
challenges in securing adequate savings. A strategy to save sufficiently to secure a constant real annuity from
total energy wealth2 from 2013 indefinitely (the permanent income approach) or through 2035 may no longer be
achievable given the upfront adjustment required of about 10 to 15 percentage points of GDP. Alternatively, an
approach without any additional savings would require a large adjustment when reserves are depleted.
An intermediate approach would focus on
smoothing consumption. The staff’s active scenario
(see chart) illustrates a path with somewhat more
gradual adjustment at the expense of reduced
savings for future generations. Although these
estimates are sensitive to the underlying
assumptions, particularly on the replenishment of
reserves, the real rate of return, and energy prices,
they underscore the urgency of establishing a
credible medium-term framework that avoids an
abrupt adjustment when energy resources are
depleted and provides some savings for future
generations.

According to the 2011 Ryder Scott report, natural gas reserves will be exhausted in 11 years at current rates of
production, while oil reserves are estimated to last 24 years (weighing proven, probable, and possible reserves at
90 percent, 50 percent, and 10 percent respectively). In practice, the level of reserves is dynamic and depends heavily on
exploration activity and the extent of new finds. These are related to market conditions, technological developments
which affect the cost and efficiency of extraction, and the fiscal regime, i.e., the share of rent collected by the
government.

Energy wealth is calculated as the net present value of future energy revenue, taken as exogenous. The calculations
assume WEO energy prices for 2013–16 increasing at 2 percent thereafter and a real interest and discount rate of
4 percent. Higher energy prices would reduce the amount of initial fiscal adjustment needed to achieve an overall
surplus, and would proportionately increase the non-energy fiscal deficit that could be financed while maintaining an
overall balance (shifting the blue line upward). It would also increase the annuity value of energy wealth (shifting the red
and green lines upwards proportionately). A higher real interest rate and discount rate would also increase the annuity
value of energy wealth while having no net impact on the NPV of energy wealth.

Box 4. Trinidad and Tobago: Implementation of the 2011 FSSA’s Key Recommendations
There has been significant progress in implementing the FSSA’s recommendations.



Banking. The Central Bank is reviewing the regulatory framework for financial institutions (the Financial
Institutions Act 2008, Financial Institutions Regulations 1994, and the Financial Institutions Order) including
measures to strengthen capital (incorporating charges against capital for operational and market risks),
liquidity risk management standards, and information requirements. In 2011, a circular informed the industry
of a new framework that allows bank supervisors to levy administrative fines, although the new powers remain
largely untested. Starting in 2012 supervisors will apply consolidated supervision criteria in assessing banks.



Insurance. A new Insurance Bill has been tabled in Parliament and will be debated shortly. The new law
introduces risk-based capital, overlapping the statutory fund requirements which are intended to be phased
out in three years. Regulations have been prepared for implementation, including on capital adequacy, asset
management, consumer protection (motor liability insurance), and insurance intermediaries. New CBTT
guidelines for valuation of insurance liabilities are also in preparation.



Central Bank. Revision to the Financial Institutions Act are being considered to broaden the regulatory
perimeter of the CBTT (to incorporate credit unions), to enhance compliance and enforcement (including
through fines), and Basel III prudential criteria for the definition of regulatory capital and risk-based capital
requirements. Separately, a draft Credit Union Bill strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework is
also in the consultation stage.



Capacity. The CBTT has moved to strengthen its capacity particularly in the area of insurance.

Looking forward, Trinidad and Tobago should continue to support efforts to improve regional crisis management
under the auspices of the Caribbean Group of Banking Supervisors. There is a need to develop an improved
resolution framework for failed institutions and to consider whether to adopt measures to contain the impact of
the failure of systemically important institutions. Once new legislation on insurance and credit unions is in place,
the challenge will be to implement the new framework.

Box 5. Assessment of Reserve Adequacy
This box assesses reserve adequacy in Trinidad and Tobago, using traditional measures and two newly
proposed risk-weighted measures. Gross reserves in Trinidad and Tobago increased about seven-fold since 2000
to around US$9.8 billion at end-2011. Reserve accumulation accelerated in the mid 2000s with the rapid increases
in energy prices, and declined only modestly in 2009, when energy prices plunged. Reserves recovered in 2010 and
are projected to increase moderately over the medium term.
An adequate level of reserves forms an important element of countries’ defenses against shocks. At the
same time, very large reserve holdings can have significant costs both at the national and global level. The
traditional measures, three months of imports, twenty-percent cover of broad money, and full cover of short-term
debt for a year, are based on simple rules of thumb. Two complementary risk-weighted measures are calculated
for precautionary purposes to quantify the availability and liquidity of resources for potential balance of payments
needs. The first risk-weighted measure is designed to reflect a broader range of sources of risk, such as external
liabilities, external demand collapse, and potential capital flight.1 The second risk-weighted measure is an adjusted
measure for small island developing states (SIDS), which takes into account for their higher income and terms of
2
trade volatility than their larger counterparts.
Country-specific vulnerabilities—such as
high exposure to commodity price
volatility, suggest that the country has
higher precautionary needs. Its high
dependence on energy exports—which
averaged 73 percent of total exports in the
past decade, indicate that the second riskweighted measure is more appropriate. Some
nonrenewable resource exporters may
choose to hold their precautionary savings in
reserves rather than in alternative investment
vehicles. However, the Heritage and
Stabilization Fund’s (HSF) strong record
suggests that Trinidad has the institutional
capacity to manage savings in a sovereign
wealth fund.

The results indicate that Trinidad and Tobago has accumulated more reserves in recent years than needed
by all measures of adequacy considered. Reserves have increased much faster than all the measures of
adequacy including the new metrics (text chart) and are projected to rise to more than one and a half of the riskweighted measure that would seem most appropriate for the economy, the measure for SIDS (Table).

Box 6. Tourism in Tobago: Developments, Prospects and Challenges
Tourism is the major non-governmental economic activity in Tobago. Tobago is the smaller of the two islands,
2
with a population of about 54,000 out of the country’s total of 1.3 million, and a land area of 300 km out of the
2
total of 5,128 km . In 2009, tourism contributed 37 percent of the island’s GDP, generated 48 percent of the
island’s employment, and accounted for 98 percent of its exports. For the country as a whole, tourism contributed
11 percent to the country’s GDP, and 15 percent to total employment.
The island has had the weakest tourism performance in an already badly hit region. Real growth declined by
6 percent in 2009, as the continued fall-off in tourist arrivals was worsened by the global crisis. Arrivals were
already on a downward trajectory before the onset of the crisis, and the drop of about 27 percent between 2005
and 2007 suggests that the island’s tourism sector is grappling with fundamental challenges. Over the medium
term, the outlook for a turnaround is not encouraging.
Nevertheless, Tobago has a rich natural and

appreciated. Europe is the main source market. In
2009, it accounted for over 90 percent of stay-over
arrivals, of which 73 percent came from the UK, while arrivals from the US accounted for 6 percent.
However, critical challenges hinder tourism development on the island. A 2005 study by the World Travel and
Tourism Council highlighted the lack of development planning, inadequate human capital, limited accommodation
stock of international standard, and inadequate airport facilities. These are compounded by a negative perception
of the importance of tourism, low public expenditure per visitor on advertising and promotion, and competition
for skilled labor by the local government authority, which employs about half of the labor force. Regulation and
monitoring of the sector seems weak, which is reflected in inconsistent service delivery. Crime is also a significant
issue. There is not a special security force to deal with tourism-related crime unlike in some other tourismdependent islands, and security personnel are few and not properly equipped. In addition to existing development
plans, the 2011/12 budget proposes initiatives to address these challenges under the umbrella of a 15-month
Tourism Action Plan. A Tourism Development Fund of TT$100 million will provide government guarantees to
support improvement and development in existing and new tourist properties. There are also plans for major
institutional and governance reforms, investment in enhancing human capital and increasing local autonomy. The
authorities would need to move quickly with the implementation of these programs to put Tobago’s tourism
sector on a firm path to recovery.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector debt. Excluding debt issued for sterilization. Does not include arrears on the fuel subsidy in 2011/12.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I. EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT
Trinidad and Tobago’s external position remains strong given a large current account
surplus and a high level of international reserves. The exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals, but the external sustainability approach, which takes into account the
temporary nature of non-renewable energy income, suggests a need for exchange rate
flexibility over the medium term to help rebalance the economy towards the non-energy
sector. The high dependency on energy exports and the high exposure to energy price
fluctuations are external vulnerabilities. Over the longer term, there is uncertainty in
natural gas prices in light of growing competition from shale gas extraction in the United
States and elsewhere.
1.
Trinidad and Tobago’s external
position remains strong given a large
current account surplus and a high level of
international reserves. The current account
surplus is projected to be 21 percent of GDP
in 2011, reflecting strong fuel prices and a
recovery in non-energy sector exports. The
gross official reserves amounted to US$ 9.8
billion at the end of December 2011, which
represents 13 months of imports of goods
and services.

diverge owing to higher inflation.

2.
The real exchange rate has
appreciated reflecting high inflation. The
REER has appreciated by 32 percent since
2005, mainly reflecting the high inflation rates
in 2008 and 2010. The nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) closely followed the
REER trend until 2005, when it began to

The equilibrium real exchange rate
approach suggests that REER lies in the
confidence interval (10 percent) of the
predicted equilibrium rate over the
medium term. The equilibrium rates are
estimated in a regression model tailored to oil
exporting countries.1 Among explanatory
variables, commodity terms of trade
contribute the most to the estimated
equilibrium rate. Over the medium term, the
REER is projected to remain in line with its
fundamentals.

4.
The macroeconomic balance
approach also indicates that the real
exchange rate is in line with the medium
term fundamentals as the projected
current account is close to its estimated
norm in 2016. Current account norms are
estimated based on a set of indicators,
including the oil trade balance and initial net
foreign assets, employing the generalized
method of moments (GMM).2 The estimated
current account norm for Trinidad and
Tobago is a surplus of about 17 percent of
GDP in 2016. The fiscal balance and oil trade
balance are the main determinants of the
estimated current account norms. As shown in
the figure, the projected current account
balance in 2016 is well within the confidence
interval of the estimated norm. This suggests
that there is no evidence of exchange rate
misalignment over the medium term.

the net present value of future wealth. Current
account norms are calculated under three
different policy scenarios: (1) constant real per
capita annuity, (2) constant real annuity, and
(3) constant annuity in percentage of output.
All three scenarios suggest a relatively high
current account surplus over the medium
term in order to offset the projected decline
in energy (non-renewable) income.

companies hold a portion of their export
proceeds overseas (above and beyond the
repatriation of reported profits) bringing
onshore only amounts needed to cover local
expenses and taxes. A STA’s TA mission in Feb
2011 indentified some misclassification of the
financial account and the authorities are
taking actions based on the work program
provided by the mission.
7.
Information from alternative
indicators broadly support the above
assessment. Relative to the other CARICOM
countries, Trinidad and Tobago’s noncommodity exports have grown more rapidly
in the past decade than the other CARICOM
countries (12 percent compared to the an
average of 3 percent for the region). However,
to sustain growth, the country will need to

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

expand to other markets. The share of the
region’s tourism arrival has been in a secular
decline, but this is not related to price
competitiveness, and could be difficult to
correct. As noted above, the country’s ranking
in the Global Competitiveness Index has
improved.
8.
There are downside risks to the
external accounts due to uncertainty in
natural gas prices in light of the increased
shale gas extraction. U.S. gas prices have
fallen as its shale gas production increased,
but Trinidad and Tobago has successfully
been diversifying gas export destinations to
other higher price markets. Nevertheless, in
the longer term, increased supply of shale gas
worldwide could affect global gas prices.

II. ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of January 2012)
The World Bank’s last Country Assistance
Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago was
discussed at the Board in 1999 and covered
the period 1999–2001. The current World Bank
program includes a fee-based services
program with five components and a program
of non-lending technical assistance. The trust
fund supporting the Nariva ecosystem
restoration and carbon sequestration ended in
December 2011.
Fee-based program
Fee-Based Services Program: The fee-based
services agreement with the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago covers five areas: (i)
Performance-Informed Budgeting (PIB); (ii)
Pension Systems Harmonization; (iii) Public
Debt and Cash Management; (iv) Doing
Business Reform; and (v) Investment
Promotion and Special Economic Zones.
Discussions between the Bank and the
Government were initiated during the Annual
Meetings of 2009. Since then, the Government
has also asked the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) to look at improving the
environment for public-private partnerships.
This work to be carried out by the World Bank
Group could serve as a model for other
countries as the areas covered are necessary
for improving government performance and
sustainable and equitable growth.
Technical Assistance
Nariva Ecosystem Restoration and Carbon
Sequestration: The program supported an
ongoing project in Trinidad and Tobago which

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

is funded under the World Bank’s BioCarbon
Fund (BioCF). The development objective was
to contribute to efforts to restore and conserve
the Nariva wetlands on the eastern shore of
Trinidad, through the recognition of the
services it provides as a carbon sink and a
biodiverse ecosystem. This objective was
achieved through actions designed to restore
and conserve about 1160 hectares of its
associated forest stands. The Bank’s support to
this project in Trinidad and Tobago under this
Trust Fund was for US$50,000.
Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes - Accounting and Auditing (ROSC): In
September 2010, the Bank encouraged
Trinidad and Tobago to carry out a ROSC. The
study would be highly beneficial for the
development of accounting and auditing
standards in the private sector, State-Owned
Enterprises and also the financial sector. A
coordinator was appointed in the Ministry of
Finance to liaise with the World Bank’s ROSC
team.
Supporting Economic Management in the
Caribbean (SEMCAR): A CIDA financed
program coordinated by the Bank, focuses on
identifying the key changes in institutional
reforms, improvements in business processes
and actual work practices that need to take
place in tax, customs, and PFM areas. The first
phase (April 2011 – December 2013) covers 3
years at a budget of US$18.3 million. Trinidad
and Tobago is one of the first countries in the
region to benefit from this program.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Entrepreneurship Program for Innovation in
the Caribbean (EPIC): InfoDev in partnership
with CIDA in 2010 launched a regional
program to create and grow MSMEs across the
region amidst persistent market challenges.
Trinidad and Tobago has been selected as one
of the countries to benefit from this initiative,
which will continue through 2018. A total of
US$19 million is being set aside for this
project, which will aid in start up, upgrading
skills and providing seed funding to promising
MSMEs.

2008 through 2013, with the objective being to
increase access to financial services to
undeserved MSMEs, promote regulatory
simplification as an aid to private sector
development and catalyzes PS participation
and investment in transport, power, water, and
communication infrastructure. This is being
financed by CIDA with the IFC as the trustee.

IV. ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Although data is broadly adequate for
surveillance, it urgently needs to be improved to
provide a firmer basis for policy making. Trinidad
and Tobago has indicated its intention to work
towards subscription to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) by 2013. One of
the key issues impeding subscription to the SDDS
is the unavailability of current/constant price
Gross Domestic Product estimates on a quarterly
basis (QGDP). In addition, improvements need to
be made in external sector statistics to meet
SDDS requirements (see section below).
Institutional arrangements also need to be
strengthened to facilitate improved compilation
and reporting as well as collaboration among the
Central Bank, the Central Statistical Office (CSO),
and the Ministry of Finance (MoF).
Real sector statistics
The CSO has revised the GDP base year from
1985 to 2000, improved the methodology for
calculating value added at each sector level, and
switched from valuation at factor cost to market
prices. The upgrading of the national accounts
has involved, in particular, the inclusion of the
large gas sector production (which came on
stream in 2000) in the GDP calculations; and a
review of the value added estimation techniques
for the telecommunications sector (using the
number of call units instead of the number of
callers) and the financial sector (by constructing
individual extrapolators for each sub-industry
and then aggregating them). The central bank
produces quarterly GDP volume indicators.
Following the recommendation of a STA multitopic technical assistance mission in December
2009, the CSO has started compiling but not
publishing quarterly GDP data. The methodology

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

to estimate inflation leads to a significant upward
bias, primarily in the food component. Further
work is also needed to revise the retail and
producer price indices to meet international
standards including by updating the basket and
the averaging and aggregation methods. There is
also a need to review the calculation of the GDP
deflator which also may be subject to
measurement issues.
Government finance statistics
Data on central government operations and debt
are compiled separately by the MoF and the
central bank, and there is a significant statistical
discrepancy. The MoF compiles fiscal data using a
national classification system for government
transactions and debt of the central government.
These data are sufficiently detailed for use in
compiling cash data according to GFSM 1986
methodology. Reporting of these cash-based
data in the GFSM 2001 framework is also being
undertaken by the MoF.
Data on public enterprises and statutory bodies
are compiled by the investment division, the
domestic debt division, and the budget division
of the MoF. The data compiled by these divisions
are subject to differences, particularly with
respect to transfers. Expense data are sometimes
misclassified, as the distinction between
consumption of fixed capital and use of goods
and services is not made.
Monetary and financial statistics
The monthly monetary accounts for other
depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers
only financial institutions that are licensed by the

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

central bank under the 1993 Financial Institutions
Act. ODCs not licensed only report voluntarily on
a quarterly basis. No data are reported by credit
unions. The lack of these data has prevented the
compilation of a more comprehensive Depository
Corporation Survey. The authorities should also
consider developing systems for reporting
balance sheet accounts for the mutual funds, with
a view to compiling a more comprehensive
financial survey in the future. Trinidad and
Tobago has not yet migrated to the standardized
report forms (SRFs) for the submission of
monetary statistics. A mission in the near future
will assist the authorities in producing the SRF for
the central bank.
External sector statistics
Quarterly aggregate balance of payments
estimates and annual balance of payments data
are disseminated by the central bank in its
national publications.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Annual balance of payments data are also sent to
STA, although with considerable delay. The SDDS
assessment mission in December 2009 found that
the financial account does not follow a financial
instrument classification in line with the Balance
of Payments Manual fifth edition. A TA mission in
balance of payments statistics in February 2011
provided assistance on the issue, on the
compilation of the International Investment
Position, and on the other required
improvements for the prospective subscription
on the SDDS and implementation of the Balance
of Payments Manual sixth edition. A follow up
mission on these matters is planned in the near
term. The Central Bank should expand its current
debt reporting system to include comprehensive
coverage of external loans and debt of the entire
public sector, as well as publicly guaranteed debt.
The country could be in a position to meet SDDS
requirements in this area in 2013.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with Trinidad and Tobago

On March 28, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation discussions with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
The economy of Trinidad and Tobago is turning the corner and growth is expected to
resume in 2012 after an extended slowdown lasting three years. A range of indicators point
to a broad turnaround in the non-energy sector beginning in the second half of 2011. Real
GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.3 percent in 2011 mainly reflecting production
disruptions in the energy sector and a lackluster performance in the non-energy sector.
Inflation has picked up, rising from a historic low of 0.6 percent in August 2011 to
6.8 percent in January 2012, as food prices increased. However, core inflation, remained
low at 1.8 percent in January. Unemployment has remained moderate 5.8 percent in mid2011. The current account surplus rebounded strongly to 20 percent of GDP in 2010 and
an estimated 21 percent in 2011 from 8 percent in 2009, stemming mainly from the
improvement in oil prices and a recovery in non-energy exports. Gross official reserves
reached US$9.8 billion (over 13 months of imports) at end-December 2011.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2

In the 2010/11 fiscal year, the central government’s finances were nearly balanced thanks
to a strong revenue performance and lower than planned current and capital spending.
Nevertheless, the deterioration in the non-energy balance implied a large fiscal stimulus.
The debt-to-GDP ratio has significantly risen from 25 percent of GDP in 2008 to 33 percent
in 2011.
In the face of subdued inflation, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) has
maintained an accommodative monetary policy lowering the policy rate by 75 basis points
since end-2010 to 3 percent. After a decline that lasted 20 months, commercial bank credit
to the private sector has been noticeably more dynamic since mid-2011 (5.3 percent
growth in November y-o-y), consistent with the non-energy sector recovery. Commercial
banks remain well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. The banking system’s non-performing
loans (NPLs), after peaking at 7.6 percent of total loans in August 2011, have declined to
6.4 percent in November and remain low by regional standards. Following the collapse of
the CL Financial Group and its insurance subsidiary, CLICO, significant progress has been
made in compensating CLICO claimants. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain.
Real economic activity is expected to increase by 1.7 percent in 2012 as the non-energy
sector picks up momentum with the acceleration of government investment and the
restructuring of CLICO liabilities and as the energy sector resumes normal operations later
in the year. Inflation is expected to remain moderate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the signs of economic recovery following a prolonged
slowdown, and commended the authorities for implementing supportive policies, aided by
ample buffers, which had helped maintain stability. The immediate challenges are to
support the recovery and to address remaining financial vulnerabilities. Enhancing
competitiveness and promoting economic diversification continue to be important
medium-term objectives for Trinidad and Tobago.
Directors supported the 2011/12 budget, which provides stimulus through a timely
execution of the budgeted investment programs, while emphasizing the need to contain
current spending and improve the targeting of social programs.
Directors recommended developing a medium-term fiscal framework that strikes an
appropriate balance between consuming, saving, and investing energy revenue, with a
view to resuming net savings of energy wealth for future generations. Containing real
increases in transfers and subsidies, strengthening tax collection efforts, and broadening
the tax base would facilitate a gradual return to fiscal surpluses and further improve policy
buffers. Directors saw scope for clarifying the objectives and operating framework of the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund to reflect the preference for savings while maintaining the
stabilization component in view of volatile energy prices.

3

Directors supported maintaining the current low interest rate policy to sustain the nascent
economic recovery. They stressed the need for continued strong surveillance of the
financial sector. Directors welcomed the intense monitoring and supervision of banks,
including through credit reviews and stress testing, and progress toward consolidated
supervision. They encouraged further efforts to strengthen the regulatory environment of
non-bank institutions and to implement the recommendations of the Financial System
Stability Assessment. Directors welcomed the progress toward the resolution of the failed
insurance company, and looked forward to its swift completion.
Most Directors supported the staff’s call for further steps to improve the functioning of the
foreign exchange market. A few Directors acknowledged the authorities’ concern about
greater exchange rate flexibility and its potential impact on competitiveness in the short
term. Given depleting energy resources, it will be important to press ahead with structural
reform to support diversification by boosting competitiveness in the non-energy sector,
fostering a more vigorous private sector, and further enhancing the business environment.
Improving the performance of the public administration and delivery of public services will
be essential in this regard.
Directors highlighted the urgency of improving the quality and timeliness of statistics. They
welcomed the authorities’ plans to create an independent statistical agency and to
subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago
and Kevin Finch, Advisor to the Executive Director
March 28, 2012

1.
The authorities of Trinidad and Tobago wish to express their appreciation to
Mrs. Gold and her team for the depth of analysis, the open-minded approach to the national
development agenda and the identification of possible risks. The 2011 Article IV
Consultation noted that the economy of Trinidad and Tobago is at a point of inflexion after
successfully navigating an array of domestic and external challenges. Domestic private sector
confidence is returning and significant foreign direct investment flows are scheduled to
resume in the short run.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
In 2011, real GDP was estimated to have declined by 1.3 percent, with the energy and
non-energy sectors contracting by 2.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. The energy
sector contracted in 2011 on account of an upgrade program undertaken by key producers.
The maintenance and upgrade operations have continued into 2012, but production levels
should normalize by mid-2012. In the non-energy sector, there are signs of incipient growth.
Non-energy sector activity picked up during the second half of 2011 with a revival of the
construction sector, increased agricultural production and buoyant retail sales. The
nationwide State of Emergency declared on August 2011 adversely affected the number of
hours worked in a few industries, but its overall impact on economic activity has not been
fully determined since its termination in December 2011.
3.
Evidence suggests that the labor market withstood the fallout from the global
economic crisis relatively well. The rate of unemployment peaked at 6.7 percent during the
first quarter of 2010 and has since fallen to 5.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2011.
Despite a marginal decline in the labor force participation rate during this period, the number
of persons employed expanded, particularly in the services sector where an additional 19,000
jobs were created.
4.
Inflationary pressures were modest despite a pickup towards the end of 2011 and in
early 2012. After reaching a low of 0.6 per cent in the twelve months to August 2011,
headline inflation rose to 6.8 percent at end-January 2012 on account of a sharp pickup in
food prices in the wake of adverse weather conditions experienced during the fourth quarter
of 2011. Core inflation remained relatively contained at under 2 percent for much of 2011.
5.
The external sector continued its strong performance. The external current account
balance improved to an estimated 21.2 percent of GDP in 2011 on account of buoyant energy

2
prices and improved non-energy exports. Gross official reserves were US$9.8 billion at endDecember 2011, representing just over 13 months of import cover.
Fiscal, Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
6.
The outturn for fiscal 2011 (October 2010 – September 2011) was better an originally
envisaged. The central government deficit (including support for CLICO) declined to 0.7 per
cent of GDP compared with 2.5 percent of GDP the previous fiscal year. This was partly due
to improved tax compliance on account of an upgraded IT tax system, inflows of TT$1.9
billion from a tax amnesty and supplemental tax payments from energy companies as a result
of a more rigorous audit process. On the expenditure side, administrative delays hampered
capital spending while current spending remained mostly in line with the budget. Capital
spending is expected to quicken in 2012 as several government infrastructure projects takeoff. Public sector debt (excluding debt issued for sterilization) was 32.4 percent of GDP at
end-September 2011.
7.
The authorities maintained an accommodative monetary stance for much of 2011.
The repo rate, the main policy rate, was reduced on three occasions during 2011 and stood at
a historic low of 3 percent at the end of 2011. A persistent liquidity overhang caused
Treasury bill and deposit interest rates to fall sharply. Stock market performance excelled as
the Composite Price Index increased by 21.2 percent in 2011. Private sector credit showed
some signs of revival from mid-2011, with business credit growing for the first time in
almost two years.
8.
The operation of the foreign exchange market is a perennial concern of the Mission
which believes that greater flexibility is required in the system. The authorities are of the
view that the exchange rate regime is appropriate in the current economic environment. A
free-float is more than likely to lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, which could run
counter to the government’s efforts to support diversification, including through the
promotion of non-energy exports. It should be noted that the Central Bank, which accounts
for roughly a quarter of total foreign exchange sales, does acknowledge that some
distributional issues exist. However, discussions with authorized dealers aimed at
smoothening flows via the establishment of a foreign exchange inter-bank market have so far
not borne fruit. Nevertheless, the majority of market participants have expressed their
satisfaction with the operation of the existing foreign exchange system. In fact, most
authorized dealers have reduced their short positions, signaling growing confidence in the
market’s ability to meet demand. The market is cognizant that the supply of foreign exchange
is highly dependent on inflows from the energy sector, most of which coincide with energy
tax payments to the government on a quarterly basis.

3
Economic Outlook
9.
After three years of depressed economic activity, the economy is poised for growth in
2012. The positive outlook is buoyed by the onshore discovery of oil and natural gas
resources in March 2012. Production potential from the reservoir was projected at 1,000
barrels of oil per day. Real GDP is projected to expand by 1.7 percent driven by a recovery in
energy output and acceleration in the execution of the Public Sector Investment Program.
The authorities intend to provide appropriate support to economic activity through a fiscal
stimulus of 4.9 percent of GDP in 2012. The authorities are of the view that measures geared
at medium-term fiscal consolidation, as recommended by staff, could only be enacted once
economic growth is sufficiently rekindled.
10.
The authorities acknowledge that there are downside risks. Externally, further delays
in the economic recovery of Trinidad and Tobago’s main trading partners could hamper
export growth. The change in the structure of the natural gas trade could also pose a
challenge if early steps are not taken to solidify marketing arrangements. Domestically,
heightened inflationary pressures are always a concern given the susceptibility of the
agriculture sector to weather-related shocks. However, the authorities are confident that the
introduction of an Agricultural Incentive Program would help build resilience in the
agriculture sector. Going forward, the authorities also plan to comprehensively address an
implementation deficit in the public sector which affects the pace of project execution.
Financial Sector Developments
11.
The rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) in the financial system is not pervasive and
is mainly confined to a small portion of the loan portfolio of a few institutions. NPLs peaked
at 7.6 percent at end-August 2011 before falling to 6.4 percent at end-November 2011
primarily because of a few large real-estate loans, two of which were fully backed by
government guarantees. These loans were also heavily collateralized, with specific provisions
made on the basis of the difference between the outstanding loan amounts and the net present
value of the properties secured. The loans in question have since been restructured.
Commercial banks have adopted a conservative approach (the Canadian banking model) and
have retained the restructured loans in their NPL portfolio. If these large restructured loans
are removed, NPLs would fall to around 5 percent of total loans and the ratio of provisions to
NPLs would increase. The Central Bank continues to perform credit reviews every year and
is assisting commercial banks with the incorporation of stress tests as part of their risk
management toolkit.
12.
The authorities are of the view that the concerns raised about the shrinkage in the
balance sheet of the non-bank financial sector are somewhat exaggerated. Non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) are undergoing a structural change. Some larger NBFIs are shifting
focus away from merchant banking transactions to more trust and capital market activities.

4
As a result, commercial banks assumed a large proportion of the loan portfolios of their
subsidiary-NBFIs.
13.
The lengthy chapter on CL Financial\CLICO is nearing closure. The government’s
new offer to policyholders with investments greater than TT$75,000 will see an upfront cash
payout of TT$75,000 and the issuance of 20-year bonds for the remainder. The 1 to10-year
bonds could be discounted at an average of 80 cents on the dollar at participating financial
institutions. Meanwhile, the 11-20 year bonds could be exchanged for units in an Investment
Trust which will hold suitable assets. CLICO has also repaid all of its outstanding loans to
commercial banks. A new insurance company, focusing on traditional insurance business,
will soon be formed. This new company is projected to become profitable after just one year
of operation. The Government is also seeking to reclaim monies which it provided to
subsidiaries of CL Financial Limited and will do so in a manner consistent with the
Memorandum of Understanding.
14.
Financial sector reforms continue apace. Procedures are now in place to allow the
Central Bank to levy administrative fines and the regulators are contemplating revisions to
the Financial Institutions Act, including the adoption of Basel III prudential criteria. A new
Insurance Bill is currently before Parliament, awaiting a date for debate. Some
recommendations from the 2005 FSAP have been integrated into the Bill. A draft Credit
Union Bill is out for stakeholder comments with a deadline of May 2012. A main element of
the proposed new regulations is the creation of a mandatory credit union insurance protection
fund. Meanwhile, a new Securities Bill will be laid in Parliament in time to meet the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) deadline of January 1, 2013
for compliance by all securities commissions. A key provision of the Bill is the ability to
conduct on-site inspections without a court order. The Central Bank is also spearheading
work on the development of a National Financial Crisis Management Plan for the banking
sector.
Structural Reforms and Statistical Issues
15.
The authorities are aware of the challenges in public service administration and they
are moving to address them comprehensively. A job evaluation exercise for the civil service,
ultimately aimed at improving the delivery efficiency of public services, will commence
during the second quarter of 2012. This exercise is also intended to address the anomaly of a
sizeable contractual workforce co-existing with significant vacancies for permanent positions
on the establishment.
16.
Under the umbrella of public financial management reform, there is a move towards
performance-based budgeting and the automation of the budget process with the assistance of
the World Bank. To complement this exercise, Cabinet approved the establishment of a
special unit in the Ministry of Finance to monitor the implementation of budget measures.

5
With the assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), this unit is also expected
to manage public-private partnership modules and guide the process for the public offering of
some state-owned enterprises.
17.
Measures to augment the tax effort are underway. The passage of the Data Protection
Act and the Electronic Transactions Act in 2011 has enabled the Board of Inland Revenue
(BIR) to advance measures that would facilitate the electronic submission of tax returns. In
addition, the BIR has transitioned to a risk-based auditing approach in order to improve the
efficiency of the auditing process. The European Union is also assisting the BIR with an
electronic tax invoicing system.
18.
Pursuant to the concerns raised by staff about a possible upward bias in the
calculation of the Index of Retail Prices (RPI) in the 2010 Staff Report, a STA/CARTAC TA
report completed in February 2012 identified a flaw in the methodology which led to an
overestimation of changes in the Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages sub-index. The Central
Statistical Office (CSO) has acknowledged the findings and has moved to speedily correct
the deficiencies in the existing RPI ahead of the completion of a more substantive rebasing
exercise. Based on the results of the 2009 Household Budgetary Survey, the consumption
basket underlying the RPI is in the process of being updated and is scheduled for completion
by June 2012.
