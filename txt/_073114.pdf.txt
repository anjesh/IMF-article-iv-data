1/ The status and classification of countries are as of July 31, 2014. There are currently no countries for which mandatory
financial stability assessments have been delayed by more than 18 months.
2/ Excluding three-month grace period, where applicable, for member countries without a Fund arrangement or PSI.
3/ Reasons for delay are explained in the Note below.
4/ The delay measures the lag between the stipulated date of completion of the next Article IV consultation plus the threemonth grace period, where applicable. If the stipulated date for completion of the consultation falls in the first half of a given
month, the calculation of the delay includes this month.
5/ In view of the stabilizing security situation (presidential elections in May 2014 and the formation of a new government in
June) the delay has been reclassified as being due to “government change” rather than “no agreement on mission
dates/modalities.”

REPORT ON DELAYED ARTICLE IV CONSULTATIONS

Note. Taxonomy of the reasons for delays of Article IV consultations
Article IV consultations are delayed for a variety of reasons. For the purpose of monitoring delays,
Fund staff groups the reasons into the following categories though it should be recognized that a
delay may have more than one reason.


Program-related issues: Delayed (i) in order to combine the consultation with a request
for use of Fund resources (UFR) or Policy Support Instrument (PSI), or program review;
or (ii) due to ongoing discussions on UFR or PSI, or continued work on program review.



Further discussions: Delayed due to further discussions with the authorities on economic
developments and policies.



Political/security situation: Delayed due to the unsettled political and/or security
situation.



Government change: Delayed due to forthcoming or recent elections, change of
government, or changes within government.



Staffing constraints.



Authorities’ request.



No agreement on mission dates/modalities: There was no agreement on the modalities
for the mission/the authorities have not communicated dates for the Article IV
consultation mission.



Miscellaneous: Includes reasons not accommodated above.
