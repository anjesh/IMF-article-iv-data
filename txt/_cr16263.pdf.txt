IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Singapore
On July 25, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Singapore.
Singapore’s economy continues to perform well despite being impacted by a combination of
cyclical and structural factors, originating both at home and abroad. Growth moderated from 3.3
percent in 2014 to 2 percent in 2015, and it was 2.2 percent in the first half of 2016.
Unemployment has remained low, but net employment generation slowed rapidly in 2015 and
headline inflation has stayed below zero since late 2014. In response, macroeconomic policies
have become more accommodative, spearheaded by monetary policy easing and an expansionary
budget. Financial sector and macroprudential policies have ensured financial stability. On the
external front, lower global energy prices contributed to a higher current account surplus in 2015,
though the surplus declined in the first quarter of 2016.
Growth is projected to moderate slightly to 1.7 percent in 2016, as the full impact of the global
shocks experienced in 2015 is felt, and is expected to recover to 2.2 percent in 2017. Economic
activity will be supported by accommodative policies, along with low energy prices and the
ongoing global recovery. However, near-term risks are skewed to the downside, including from
slow global and regional growth and spillovers from renewed global financial volatility.
Headline and core inflation are benign, expected to -0.3 and 0.8 percent in 2016, respectively,
before rising to 1.1 and 1.4 percent in 2017 on gradually recovering energy and commodity
prices. The current account surplus is expected to moderate over the medium term amid rapid
population aging and reforms to boost domestic demand, including through better health care,
pensions, and other social insurance arrangements.
Structural policies continue to focus on moving toward an innovation-based economy that relies
less on labor and more on productivity growth, especially in the nontraded sector. Policies focus

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

on targeted support to businesses to promote automation, innovation, and internationalization.
The government is also raising investment in infrastructure and other long-term capital projects
and rolling out policies to improve access to education and health care, particularly for the
elderly.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors observed that Singapore’s highly open economy enjoys strong fundamentals
and continues to perform well, and commended the authorities for their skillful management.
Directors noted that Singapore’s strong external position and ample fiscal space allows the
authorities to adjust policy settings in response to slower growth and external risks stemming
from protracted lower growth in advanced and emerging economies and global financial market
volatility.
Directors considered the authorities’ expansionary fiscal policy stance and further easing of
monetary policy in April as appropriate, in view of the weaker-than-expected inflation and
growth developments. They agreed that the current accommodative fiscal stance is providing
welcome support to activity and applauded the authorities’ willingness to act quickly in response
to evolving conditions. However, a number of Directors saw scope for additional fiscal stimulus
to boost domestic demand, close the output gap, and provide insurance against elevated
downside risks to growth. In this context, a number of Directors underscored that the current
fiscal rule has served the country well for many years, while a number of others saw merit in
considering aligning it to the business cycle. Turning to monetary policy, Directors considered
that current policy settings are appropriate. They agreed that clear monetary communications are
desirable, particularly to avoid short-run instability. While some Directors considered that more
frequent elaboration of inflation prospects would be beneficial, a number of other Directors
recognized merits in the authorities’ current approach, which has served the country well and
should be retained.
Directors observed that Singapore is at the mid-point of a decade long restructuring to a
knowledge-based economy. They welcomed the authorities’ more targeted approach to
supporting automation, innovation and productivity, while expanding social insurance and safety
nets. Directors urged the authorities to increase spending on research and development (R&D),
promote private sector R&D, and support new, creative firms. They looked forward to the
unveiling of initiatives by the Committee on the Future Economy.
Directors observed that Singapore’s financial cycle has turned and that credit growth to residents
has moderated. They noted that macro prudential policies in place made a decisive contribution
to containing household indebtedness and should be retained. Directors considered that high

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

levels of corporate debt warrant caution and close monitoring, although risks are mitigated by
companies’ high debt-servicing capacity.
Directors recognized Singapore’s high regulatory and supervisory standards in the financial
sector. They noted that banks have remained profitable with low non-performing loans and large
capital and liquidity cushions as they adjust to changes in the direction of capital flows and lower
oil prices. Directors welcomed that the regulation and supervision of banks is being further
enhanced, and emphasized the need for banks to remain vigilant. They noted the authorities’
continued efforts to align the AML/CFT framework with international standards, and welcomed
recent steps to strengthen its enforcement.
Directors noted the finding that Singapore’s external position is substantially stronger than
consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals and desirable policies, while acknowledging that
considerable uncertainty surrounds the assessment. The current account surplus increased further
in 2015, as buoyant consumption only partly offset the narrowing of the oil trade deficit. Fiscal
expansion should help reduce the external imbalance in the near term. Rapid population aging
and policies to boost domestic demand and enhance inclusion, including better health care,
pensions, and other social insurance arrangements, should over time lead to a significant
reduction in Singapore’s external imbalance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 8, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and Risks. Singapore’s economy continues to perform well, although growth
has slowed reflecting a combination of structural and cyclical factors: population aging,
restrictions on foreign worker inflows, and slow productivity growth, and a difficult
external environment, including the trade growth deceleration and the negative impact
on domestic manufacturing of lower oil prices. Disinflation in domestic goods and asset
markets and deleveraging continue. Risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside,
including from slow global and regional growth and spillovers from renewed global
financial volatility. Domestic risks are rooted in still elevated household and corporate
leverage and slower-than-expected gains in productivity during the transition to an
innovation-based, labor-lean growth model.
Macroeconomic and Financial Policies. Policies have turned accommodative in recent
years amid slower growth at home and a challenging environment abroad. Faced with
undershooting of its medium-term inflation objective, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) eased monetary policy further in April. Following on the heels of an
expansionary 2015 budget, the 2016 budget raises spending further. While fiscal and
monetary policies are already providing support to activity, more fiscal stimulus than is
envisaged by the authorities would be useful to close the output gap and help narrow
Singapore’s current account gap. In case of a sustained negative shock, fiscal policy
should be the first line of the defense, with monetary policy playing a supporting role.
Consideration should also be given to attune the fiscal rule to the business cycle.
Macroprudential policies have succeeded in arresting the increase in household
leverage. Corporate leverage has stabilized as the financial cycle has turned. The local
banks boast stable and high capital and profitability ratios but have exposures to the oil
and gas sector and to Greater China. They are restructuring some of their loans to the
more affected oil services firms and credit risk on China loans is deemed manageable.
Restructuring and Innovation-Led Growth. Singapore is at the midpoint of an
ambitious, decade-long transition to a labor-lean, innovation-based economy. The shift
to targeted support to businesses while rolling out inclusive policies announced earlier
is welcome. To accelerate efficiency gains from restructuring, Singapore should raise
spending on Research and Development (R&D), promote private sector R&D, and
provide support for new, creative firms. More accommodative macroeconomic policies
should help raise the rate of innovation.
External Sector Assessment. Singapore’s external position continues to be
substantially stronger than consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals and desirable
policies. Fiscal expansion should help narrow the substantial current account imbalance.

BACKGROUND
1.
Robust Fundamentals. Singapore, a city state with a highly open economy, has a strong
growth and development record based on sound macro- and micro-economic management,
including a medium-term policy orientation and a top-ranked business climate. Despite its small
size, the economy is diversified. Manufacturing, trade, logistics, and financial and other services all
make important contributions to activity and exports. Singapore is a global financial center with
large fiscal and financial buffers and a very strong external position. The 2013 FSAP found
Singapore’s regulation and supervision of the financial sector among the best globally.
2.
Domestic Restructuring and Growth. The People’s Action Party consolidated power in
the 2015 election, ensuring continuity at the half-way point of the decade-long restructuring to a
knowledge-based, labor-lean, and more inclusive economy. The restructuring is taking place amid a
marked deceleration of actual and potential growth. At home, growth is constrained by an aging
labor force and by tighter limits on foreign workers. Efficiency gains from restructuring have been
slow to materialize reflecting transition costs. On the external front, Singapore is a net energy
importer and thus benefits from lower energy prices. Nevertheless, the end of the commodities
super cycle is negatively affecting its oil extraction-related industries and private investment and
partly offsets the positive effects of lower energy prices on consumption. The SME sector is being
challenged by higher labor costs, competition from neighbors, and the global trade slowdown.
China’s bumpy transition is also hurting (Figure 7, Appendix I). Direct and indirect effects of the
United Kingdom’s referendum on exit from the European Union (Brexit), through Singapore’s real
and financial linkages, are also important.
3.
Past Fund Advice. Macroeconomic policies in 2015 were broadly in line with Fund advice. In
response to a significant downward adjustment in Singapore’s inflation outlook starting in late 2014,
the MAS began an easing of monetary policy in January 2015. In addition, the 2015/16 budget
raised spending with a view to strengthen Singapore’s infrastructure and social insurance and safety
nets and support medium-term productivity gains. The accommodative policy stance provided
timely support to demand. The authorities have also made good progress implementing the
2013 FSAP recommendations. Consistent with staff advice, the authorities maintain macroprudential
policies aimed at reducing risks from the property market.

RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth Slowdown. Real GDP grew by
1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016 (year-onyear), down from 2 percent in 2015 and 3.3 percent
in 2014, resulting in a small negative output gap.
The annual average growth rate in the six years
(2010–15) since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was
lower by nearly 1.5 percentage points relative to the
six-year period preceding the crisis (2002–07).

Globally, Singapore’s growth slowdown has been more pronounced than the median for advanced
economies.


On the production side, the growth deceleration in 2015 was due to a 5 percent contraction in
the manufacturing sector, on weakness in electronics and marine and offshore engineering. In
the first quarter of 2016, the contraction in the manufacturing sector continued, albeit at a
slower pace relative to 2015, while the construction sector expanded at a faster pace. The
services sector, which accounts for about two-third of GDP, slowed further.



On the expenditure side, in 2015, strong contributions came from both private and public
consumption, in part owing to measures related

Disinflation. Meanwhile, inflation has also
trended lower (Appendix II). Headline inflation has
been negative since November 2014, while the
MAS’ core inflation has trended up since late 2015
and touched one percent in May 2016. Disinflation
reflects the impact of lower energy, food and other
commodity prices, lower premiums for car
certificates of entitlement, and a softening in
residential rental prices. Recent data indicate that
inflation may be bottoming out, despite some
volatility, along with international energy prices.

6.
The Labor Market and Productivity. The labor market is softening. Real wages continued
to rise in 2015, and the overall and resident unemployment rates remained broadly stable around
1.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. However, net employment generation slowed down
rapidly in 2015. Following sharp increases in 2013 and 2014, net employment gains for Singapore
residents were negligible in 2015. The incidence of redundancy has also risen in recent quarters. On
the supply side, the residents’ labor force participation rate has reached a new high, supported
largely by older workers. Post 2011, economy-wide labor productivity has been dragged down by
the rising employment share of domestically-oriented sectors. Staff analysis finds evidence of
growing skill mismatches which may have contributed to the slowdown in labor productivity
(Appendix III). The pass-through of rising labor costs has been smaller than expected amid a
negative output gap and uncertain outlook.

Balance of Payments (BOP). The current account (CA) surplus reached 19.8 percent of GDP
in 2015, up by 2.3 percentage points of GDP from 2014. The decline in global oil prices caused the
oil trade deficit to narrow by 3.7 percentage points of GDP. The overall BOP retreated amid higher
net financial account outflows, but remained narrowly in surplus in 2015. Nonoil domestic export
volumes have remained weak through April 2016 and notwithstanding a further improvement in the
terms of trade of about 4 percent (y/y), the CA surplus narrowed to 17.7 percent of GDP in 2016Q1,
down by 3.7 percentage points of GDP compared to 2015Q1. Moreover, possibly reflecting the
China-related turmoil in 2016Q1, portfolio flows turned negative by about 15 percent of GDP, the
largest since the GFC. Deposit-taking corporations took US$25 billion out of Singapore during the
quarter resulting in the overall BOP recording a deficit of more than US$6 billion.
8.
Linkages with China and the United Kingdom. Singapore’s gross trade in goods and
services exceeded 300 percent of GDP in 2015, significantly higher than other advanced economies
(excluding Hong Kong SAR and Luxembourg). Exposures to China are mainly through direct and
indirect goods trade. Singapore ran a trade surplus with China in 2015. Services trade with China is
much smaller. On the other hand, while services trade with the United Kingdom is of similar
magnitude as with China (Singapore ran a surplus in 2014), goods trade with the United Kingdom is
much smaller.2 Further, in value added terms, Singapore has a stronger linkage with China than with
the United Kingdom. Trade exposures to the EU (excluding the United Kingdom) are broadly

China in inward FDI, for example, with half of FDI from the United Kingdom going to the financial
sector, one-fifth to the wholesale and retail trade sector, and another nearly one-fifth to the
manufacturing sector. China accounted for nearly one-fifth of stock of Singapore’s outward FDI,

The Banks. The three local banks boast stable and high capital and profitability ratios. But
they have come under increased market scrutiny following an uptick in still-low nonperforming
loans (NPLs), given significant exposures to the oil and gas (O&G) sector (4–6 percent of total
nonbank loans) along with other commodities finance, and loans to the Greater China region
(12–34 percent of total loans). The banks are restructuring some of their O&G loans to the more
affected oil services firms. Though domestic banks’ exposure to Greater China declined slightly in
2015, it still remained sizable at close to 25 percent of total loans. Credit risk on Greater China loans
is deemed manageable given exposures are primarily to the main state banks (as short-term, selfliquidating collateralized trade finance loans) and larger, more creditworthy borrowers.

gap estimated at –0.6 percent, as the full impact of the slowdown in global trade and capital

13.
Medium-Term Outlook. Growth is projected at 2.6 percent over 2018–21, as structural
reforms help productivity recover to its long-term trend, large public investment projects related to
infrastructure and age-related facilities continue, and private investment recovers further.4 In
addition to the recovery of overall capital formation, private consumption is also expected to be
supported by an aging population. Singapore’s potential growth has been slowing and is
conservatively estimated in staff’s baseline at about 2.5 percent over 2016–21 (Appendix IV). An
aging population and tight controls on foreign workers will reduce labor force growth. In addition,
uncertainties about global developments and the turning of the credit cycle are expected to
dampen the recovery in private investment compared to earlier upswings. Other key factors are the
gradual recovery in global growth, and the extent to which trade growth and productivity will
rebound over the medium term.
14.
Risks. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside (Appendix V). Weaker-than-expected
global growth is the most important short-term external risk. This could manifest itself through a
significant downshift in China and other large emerging economies as well as weak growth in key
advanced economies, including as a result of the fallout from the Brexit referendum. Tighter or more
volatile global financial conditions, including because of a possibly protracted period of uncertainty
in financial markets related to Brexit, could lead to sharp asset price declines, a rise in credit spreads,
and a surge in the U.S. dollar. Realization of these risks could disrupt a benign correction in property
prices and orderly deleveraging in the household and corporate sectors. Continued delays in
generating productivity gains and higher investment in the domestically-oriented sectors, as well as
the prospect of persistent disinflationary pressures, represent additional domestic risks.
15.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities agreed that risks in the near term are related to the
growth prospects in advanced economies and key emerging markets. Continued recovery in the
United States, Europe, and Japan will provide support for the externally-oriented sectors in 2016.
However, this uplift may be partially offset by other developments, including the slowdown in China
and Brexit-related uncertainties, tighter financial conditions, and potential capital reversals
associated with the normalization of U.S. interest rates, corporate realignments in the global
information technology industry, and lingering weakness in the oil-related transport engineering
sector. On Brexit, the authorities have indicated that they were well prepared for increased market
volatility; markets have continued to function orderly; and they stand ready to provide additional
liquidity. Meanwhile, domestic demand will be bolstered by consumption, both private and public,
and by public investment in transport infrastructure. The authorities noted the dependence of
Singapore’s medium-term growth developments in China, through both direct and indirect links.
They were confident that Singapore can manage the increased volatility associated with monetary
policy normalization in the United States, given their ample policy buffers, including the flexibility
accorded by the exchange rate system.

The shift to a labor-lean growth model has raised wages relative to the cost of capital in Singapore. This is expected
to raise firms’ long-run desired capital stock and hence the rate of investment. See Dale W. Jorgenson, Capital Theory
and Investment Behavior, American Economic Review 53 (2), 1963.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Overview. Over the past year, macroeconomic policies have become more accommodative
amid larger-than-expected spillovers from China’s rebalancing, the slowdown in global trade and
growth, and lower-for-long energy prices. Monetary policy easing was accompanied by an
expansionary budget in early-2016. Financial sector and macroprudential policies have ensured
financial stability following a significant increase in leverage in recent years. Risks to the near-term
outlook continue to be tilted to the downside and more fiscal stimulus would be useful to boost
domestic demand. No further monetary policy action is expected in 2016 under staff’s baseline, but
the MAS should continue to remain vigilant to downside risks to inflation and growth. The
authorities may also consider relaxation of selective macroprudential measures if signs of disorderly
adjustments in the property market emerge. Meanwhile, structural reforms should focus on
supporting medium-term growth through more targeted policies to boost productivity, innovation
and inclusion.

Overview. The primary objective of monetary policy in Singapore as enshrined in the MAS
Act is to maintain price stability that is conducive to sustainable economic growth. Reflecting the
relative preeminence of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor in the context of Singapore’s small
and open economy, the MAS operates a basket, band, crawl (BBC) framework since 1981 in which
the trade-weighted nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), is the policy instrument. Although the
parameters of the system are not disclosed, the width of the band is currently estimated at
2 percent. The position of the band is adjusted to ensure that the NEER is consistent with the
development of prices in the year ahead, taking into account the effect of output growth on prices.
A long-run real appreciation of the effective
exchange rate is built in, sustained by continual

18.
Monetary Easing. In April 2016, the MAS unexpectedly reduced the slope of appreciation of
the NEER slightly, from 0.25 percent to zero while maintaining the 2 percent band, as estimated by
the staff. This move, which was prompted by the MAS’ expectation of medium-term core inflation
falling below 2 percent, is a continuation of an easing cycle that began in January 2015 and was

intended to achieve internal balance by helping to offset domestic weakness that was depressing
prices.
19.
Near-Term Policy. Going forward, staff sees no need for further easing in the near term.
The April move is sufficient to achieve the MAS inflation objective: growth is below 2 percent,
inflationary pressures are not present, and labor market pressures are receding, with unit labor costs
rising by around 3 percent per annum and relative prices, including for oil, stabilizing globally. The
current juncture is a result of a gradual softening of the economy and a slowdown in potential
output growth. Inflation is on track to reach a stable medium-term level of under 2 percent by the
end of 2017. To that end, a downward re-centering of the band will likely not be required in
October.
20.
Responding to Near-term Risks. Singapore’s BBC monetary policy framework is well
adapted to deal with exogenous shocks affecting the city state’s highly open economy. In response
to minor, temporary shocks, movements of the NEER within the band play an important shock
absorbing role. Fiscal policy is the first line of defense in response to more sustained, substantial
shocks given the large fiscal space and the need to rebalance the economy. Monetary policy can
play a supportive role in this case: recalibration of the framework, via a re-centering and widening of
the band, could help to smooth the transition. But, as noted, relying on expansionary monetary
policy alone in the BBC framework would negatively affect interest-sensitive sectors and increase
the already large current account surplus. Appendix VI and the accompanying Selected Issues Paper
16/264 titled “The Singapore Small Monetary Policy Model (SGPMOD)”, provide a quantitative
analysis of monetary policy reactions using a new, forward-looking monetary policy model for
Singapore with global linkages, including responses to a large-scale downward revision in growth
prospects originating from China, with renewed pressures on the renminbi possibly coupled with
capital outflows from the region, and the possible effects of Brexit. The MAS could play a role in
mitigating the negative effects on Singapore and smoothing any transition to a “new normal”. In
view of the skewing of risks on the downside, the MAS should remain vigilant and be prepared to
continue its adjustments.
21.
MAS Communication. The MAS provides a fair degree of detail in its published analysis and
strong justifications at the time of its monetary policy actions. Nonetheless, as laid out in Box 1, staff
sees scope to improve the communication of monetary policy. Actions that the MAS could take may
be summarized as follows:

12



Clarify the Future Monetary Policy Path. To further elucidate the conduct of monetary
policy to the public, the MAS could contrast its past forecasts of the exchange rate path with
actual outcomes and explain how any deviations affect the current monetary policy stance
and the expected path of inflation.



Better Communicate Inflation Prospects. The MAS could consider communicating its
interpretation of inflation developments in the monthly press releases. Such information
could help prime financial market participants for changes in monetary policy.



But Beware of Potential Short-Run Costs of Communication. Staff recognizes that the
introduction of such a change may cause some short-run instability, although this would
dissipate in the long run given that the MAS already has a substantial degree of monetary

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

policy credibility, which would be buttressed by such improved communication. Providing a
more explicit set of statements would serve to better guide market analysts in the current
environment and prevent disruptive surprises to markets.
22.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities appreciated the staff’s assessment of its monetary policy
stance and recognized the need to stay vigilant. The MAS was of the view that inflation is on track to
reach a stable medium-term level of slightly under 2 percent by the end of 2017. Moreover,


On the April Move. The MAS indicated that the circumstances that led to the unexpected
April 2016 move to a zero NEER slope were very different from two previous occasions—the
high-tech bubble burst in 2001 and the GFC—when the move to a zero slope was large and
sudden, in response to rapidly unfolding negative shocks. The MAS is of the view that the
April move was part of a sequence of policy moves whose direction and magnitude was
justified by data over the past 18 months. It was akin to moving the short-term interest rate
to its neutral level in inflation-targeting regimes that use interest-rate reaction functions. The
move was in direct response to internal balance considerations, with growth below 2 percent
and inflationary pressures subdued. It was not meant to increase competitiveness by
depreciating the real exchange rate in the absence of relative productivity gains.



On Communication. The authorities were of the view that their approach, which has been
gradually strengthened over time, is sufficient at this stage. Communicating monetary policy
in a small open economy using an atypical, but sensible, NEER rule to pursue inflation
targeting was exceedingly delicate. If the MAS were to provide forward guidance with
monthly releases of inflation data, for example, markets would likely treat every statement
by the MAS as a “mini monetary policy report”, thus diluting the medium-term orientation of
the MAS’ policy objective. The authorities argued that while they needed to provide rational
forecasts and a clear policy stance, this should not be dictated by a higher frequency of
information releases. They were also concerned that there would be a shift of market focus
to short-term movements in the macroeconomic data, resulting in a lack of understanding
of underlying trends, which the MAS emphasizes in its policy formulation. Another negative
effect of emphasizing the short-term outlook would be excessive volatility in the Singapore
dollar. On balance, the authorities’ assessment was that conducting monetary policy and
providing its forecasts and basis for the policy stance twice a year contributed to mediumterm objectives, even as they retained the flexibility to issue an “off-cycle” policy statement if
conditions warranted it.

B. Fiscal Policy
23.
Background. Singapore’s fiscal policy is prudent and medium-term in orientation, enshrined
in strong constitutional guarantees and striving to deliver efficient services to the public. The
Constitution mandates a balanced budget over the term of each government and protects the use
of “past reserves” by requiring enhanced political support to access them. Sustained over
performance on this conservative fiscal rule has allowed the buildup of large fiscal reserves.

A Rising Government Size. Government
spending as a share of GDP has risen steadily in
recent years. In particular, the last two budgets
made a concerted effort to reduce intra- and intergenerational inequality and invest in infrastructure
and other long-term capital projects. The increase in
operating and development spending effected over
the past two years is large—nearly as big as the
increase in spending in response to the GFC—and
reflects several initiatives:

A variety of means-tested, categorical programs aimed at improving access to healthcare,
providing means-tested retirement support, and increasing the progressivity of the personal
income tax.



Policies to improve access to education and its quality and help raise labor productivity are
also being pursued, notably through SkillsFuture, a program that covers on-the-job
education and training expenses. Other programs aim to facilitate job transitions, by
subsidizing wages and supporting training and job matching.



Expenditure for economic development (transport, manpower, communications, trade and
industry) is also up by 1.1 percentage points of GDP in the last two years. There has been a
modest increase in targeted spending to help businesses raise productivity and innovation
through tax rebates, selected deferrals of hikes in foreign worker levies, and financial
support for working capital and employment.

The increase in the size of government will help meet the authorities’ objectives of addressing
healthcare and other aging needs, boosting productivity, and investing in infrastructure.
25.

Enhancing Inclusion.


Over the past decade, real household income from work rose across all income groups in
Singapore (Figure 8). But income inequality also widened, particularly during the pre-GFC
period and remained elevated for a few years after the GFC.6 However, fiscal policies have
helped soften some of this rise and the last two years witnessed some decline in inequality.

26.
The 2016 Budget and Medium-Term Fiscal Policy. The increase in government spending
is timely, as near-term risks to growth have risen, and also appropriate in view of Singapore’s large
saving-investment imbalance. Staff supports both the existing programs to reduce inequality and
the new, more targeted initiatives to help businesses boost investment and encourage innovation.
The boost to government spending in recent years is having a significant cumulative effect in
supporting the economy at a time of weak external demand. But while the budget injected a
substantial fiscal impulse, estimated by staff at 0.8 percent of GDP (Appendix VII), staff is of the view
that more fiscal stimulus would be useful in order to boost domestic demand, close the output gap,
and provide insurance against downside risks to growth. More expansionary fiscal policy would also
help lower the large external current account imbalance. In light of recent increases in public
investment and the adjustment costs in raising investment, the authorities should aim at closing the
output gap of –0.6 percent gradually, over 3 years, by providing an additional annual impulse of
0.4 percentage points of GDP relative to the baseline scenario, and even more if growth surprises on
the downside. The additional fiscal impulse could be aligned with measures that also promote the
medium-term restructuring effort but in a setting that is more accommodative overall than
envisaged by the authorities. Help could be provided to new and expanding businesses in dynamic
sectors via further tax rebates and wage credits. More public infrastructure investment, including in
health care and transport services, should also be considered as well as higher social spending.

28.
The Fiscal Rule and Stabilization. The fiscal rule requiring a balanced budget over each
term of government is simple to understand, builds a sense of accountability, and instills a
commitment to long-term fiscal sustainability. The rule also provides limited flexibility for fiscal
policy to contribute to macroeconomic stabilization. It contains an escape clause to deal with rare
catastrophic events, such as the GFC, when a drawdown on past reserves is permitted upon request
by the government and approval by the president. Barring such events, the rule restricts
governments to balance the budget over their term. Like with other fiscal rules, it is important to be
mindful of its limitations, including from a stabilization point of view. The requirement to balance
the budget over the political cycle could give rise to a cautionary bias and make fiscal policy tighter
than warranted by the business cycle during the early years of a government’s term (see also
Blöndal, 2006, “Budgeting in Singapore”, OECD Journal of Budgeting). Singapore’s fiscal policy is
countercyclical overall. Nevertheless, the fiscal balance is larger during the first two years after
elections. The exception is 2001 when fiscal policy responded to a recession caused by the bursting
of the dotcom bubble.

Strengthening the Fiscal Rule. The recent amendment to the constitution to include up to
half of the expected long-term real returns of Temasek in the revenue stream provides welcome
scope for fiscal policy action if needed.7 Consideration could be given to strengthen the fiscal rule
by incorporating all of the government’s investment income (to improve transparency) and by
gearing it toward the business cycle, rather than the political cycle, in line with the best practice of
basing fiscal policy on a structural budget balance rule (e.g., Chile). This change, which would require
amending the constitution, would maintain Singapore’s commitment to fiscal prudence and
sustainability while providing the authorities more flexibility to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy.
It would require the government to carefully monitor the level of potential output and the output
gap. This seems well within the capabilities of Singapore’s data collection and analysis framework.

Authorities’ Views. The authorities are committed to fostering fiscal prudence, individual
responsibility, and preparing society for future challenges while also promoting solidarity.

Government Investment Corporation (GIC) and the MAS, and up to half of the net investment income derived from
Temasek, could be used by the budget.

other aging-related spending, and investment in infrastructure. The current fiscal impulse
strikes a balance between medium-term and short-term considerations. A small negative
output gap in the short term has to be referenced against the global context. With many
major economies operating below potential, it would be “heroic” for a small open economy
like Singapore to overcome it entirely. In particular, it could risk creating distortions that
disrupt the ongoing economic restructuring. Furthermore, the government has brought
forward some multi-year infrastructure projects, such as the construction of MRT lines,
although it remains mindful not to spend on infrastructure purely for the sake of providing
short-term stimulus, without due consideration of the need for these lines, as well as the
viability of maintaining and operating them in the future. If necessary, the government
stands ready to act given the risks ahead. However, it is important that any further fiscal
support is applied in a way that supports medium-term restructuring, and also after a careful
diagnosis of the challenges to be addressed, that could be supply- or demand- driven, or
due to credit conditions.


On the Fiscal Rule. The authorities’ fiscal rule is simple and easy to understand and
communicate. It thus encourages accountability and instills commitment to long-term fiscal
sustainability, and a culture of responsibility. The budget rule does not constrain the
government from doing what it deems to be appropriate to manage the macroeconomic
cycle. The use of past reserves is possible, upon approval by the President. They are also
routinely used to fund land-related expenditure such as land reclamation and land
acquisition costs related to projects like the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme.
Moreover, returns from financial reserves can also be used to supplement the budget. Fiscal
deficit spending is allowed in any given year and drawing on past reserves can also be
effected to deal with crises even when there is no fiscal deficit. For instance, in 2009, the
government drew on past reserves to deal with the GFC even though it had sufficient current
reserves.

C. Financial Sector Issues
31.
De-Leveraging. Overall credit growth has turned negative. While loans to residents have
continued to grow at around 3 percent, nonresident loans have contracted. The moderation of
credit growth during the past year has helped contain household and corporate indebtedness. It has
been supported by the active use of macroprudential policies. More recently, the weakening of
external demand for investment and trade credits also played a role. The slowdown in domestic
nonbank loans has been broad based across most industries, except the construction sector. While
the deleveraging cycle is positive for long-term financial stability, it is likely to hold back private
investment. Staff’s regression results suggest that a 1 percentage point change in real credit growth
has on average been associated with a 0.6–0.9 percentage point change in real private fixed
investment growth (Appendix IV).

Banking Sector Resilience. Banking sector profitability, though still healthy, has declined in
recent quarters, as NPLs have ticked up. Banks remain well capitalized and loan loss provisioning for
the entire banking system, at above 100 percent of unsecured NPLs, continue to be adequate. Local
banks’ asset quality remains healthier than that of the overall banking system (Appendix VIII).
However, downside near-term risks persist due to exposure to Greater China and O&G, and also
from the implications of the Brexit referendum.

as appropriate.
33.
Real Estate. Macroprudential policies have aided in the measured ongoing decline in
residential real estate prices that are now broadly in line with the long-term trend. While
transactions have moderated, projects with good location and pricing still enjoy favorable take up.
Cooling measures have moderated resale activity
and prices in the public housing sector, improving
affordability. The large supply of new homes
coming on stream could exert downward pressure
on prices. Structural macroprudential measures
should be maintained to prevent a buildup of
excessive leverage that could lead to systemic risks.
However, relaxation of cyclical measures could be
considered once systemic risks dissipate or if
uncertainties in the financial markets and
headwinds in the external outlook cause sharperthan-warranted price corrections.

Household Leverage. Household balance sheets remain strong in aggregate: Singapore
households are generally prudent, with household cash and deposits exceeding total household
debt. In banks’ outstanding housing loans portfolio, only about 5 to 10 percent of households have
a debt service-to-income ratio exceeding 60 percent. But, although aggregate household
indebtedness has moderated, risks from interest rate increases remain pertinent for selected
households. Stress tests indicate that additional debt service burdens would generally be
manageable even in a scenario of rapid interest rate increases above historical norms. In addition,
banks’ exposures to related risks appear limited given that (i) most properties are owner-occupied;
(ii) tight loan-to-value limits require high down

restructuring and financial education.
35.
Corporate Leverage. Lending to corporates has started to moderate, leading to a decline in
the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio. Nonfinancial corporate leverage in Singapore, as measured by the
debt-to-equity ratio is one of the highest in the region and larger firms tend to rely more on debt
rather than equity. However, firms hold ample cash balances and their net debt profile (debt net of
cash and equivalents) remains relatively benign. Return on assets has weakened, most notably in
trade-related sectors. Business cessations have increased in line with the general economic
slowdown, and NPLs in the SME sector are on the rise. Nevertheless, most publicly-listed companies
maintain high interest coverage ratios and appear able to withstand modest interest rate and
earnings shocks. However, debt-at-risk could rise considerably in a downside tail-risk scenario
(Appendix IX). Furthermore, staff welcomes the MAS’ close monitoring of financial sector risks
related to the corporate sector, including through stress tests of listed companies’ balance sheets
and surveys of banks’ exposure to SMEs. The MAS has put in place regulatory safeguards to ensure
banking system stability and remains watchful of corporate credit by conducting closer supervision
of banks and ensuring underwriting standards are maintained. Continued monitoring of corporate
debt developments is warranted amid weakened earnings and an uncertain outlook.
36.
Regulation and Supervision. Singapore continues to maintain high regulatory and
supervisory standards. Stringent minimum capital requirements, above the Basel III norms, have
been applied since January 2013, two years ahead of the Basel timeline. Other components like the
countercyclical and capital conservation buffers are being phased in as per Basel timelines starting
from January 2016. The MAS will consult with the industry on their proposals for implementing the
local net stable funding ratio requirement by the stipulated January 1, 2018, deadline. This would

The Total Debt Service Ratio (TDSR) framework, introduced in 2013, limits the amount borrowers can spend on debt
repayments to 60 percent of their gross monthly income and is applicable to loans for the purchase of all types of
property, loans secured on property, and the re-financing of all such loans.

complement: (i) the phasing in since January 2015 of Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
requirements for the three local banks, including reporting of LCRs for foreign currencies; and (ii) the
application of LCRs, from 2016, to domestic systemically important foreign banks’ operations in
Singapore. Furthermore, public disclosure of LCRs intended to enhance market discipline and reduce
uncertainty took effect on January 1, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, the average Singapore dollar
and all-currency liquidity ratios were above the regulatory minimum of 100 percent and 70 percent,
respectively, for all three local banks. The Banking (Amendment) Bill, passed in February 2016, aims
at enhancing prudential safeguards, corporate governance and risk management controls in the
banking industry, including by requiring foreign banks deemed systemically important to
subsidiarize their retail operations in Singapore
37.
FSAP Recommendations. Important progress has been made in implementing the
2013 FSAP recommendations. In addition to the steps mentioned in the previous paragraph, the
Singapore Exchange has enhanced its recovery plan. Staff welcomes the planned strengthening of
the recovery and resolution framework and encourages further coordination with other jurisdictions
to facilitate cross-border resolutions of global banks.
38.
AML/CFT Framework. Staff acknowledges continued efforts to align the AML/CFT
framework with international standards and effectively cooperate with foreign counterparts,
particularly on tax matters. The recommendations of the 2016 AML/CFT evaluation by the Financial
Action Task Force provide a good basis for further strengthening the effective implementation of
the framework, including with regard to the transparency of companies and trusts and AML/CFT
supervision. In this regard, staff notes the creation within the MAS of dedicated departments, to
combat money laundering and strengthening enforcement, respectively, effective August 1, 2016.
This would help streamline the existing responsibilities for relevant regulatory policies and monitor
AML-related risks including via onsite supervision of financial institutions.
39.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities assessed that the financial system remains resilient to
the turn in the financial cycle and can withstand risks on the horizon. In light of the downside risks,
particularly from low commodity prices and spillovers from China, they emphasized their
commitment to proactive financial sector surveillance and continued improvements in their
supervision and regulation framework.

20



Banks. The authorities acknowledged the recent rise in credit risks. However, they noted
that the banking system remains well-capitalized with adequate provisions, holds liquid
assets well above the LCR requirement, and is primarily funded by nonbank deposits. The
near-term impact of the Brexit referendum on Singapore’s banking system is assessed to be
contained. Nevertheless, if needed, the MAS stands ready to provide adequate liquidity
support to the banking system. The MAS’ industry-wide stress tests show that the banking
system remains resilient under various severe stress scenarios.



Households. While household balance sheets remain healthy in aggregate, there are
emerging pockets of risks. Macroprudential measures have slowed down the growth of
household leverage and household balance sheets, on aggregate, remain firm. A significant
rise in interest rates could cause vulnerabilities among pockets of overextended households
but with little systemic implications. The MAS would continue to monitor households’

leverage and proactively encourage financial prudence, including through facilitating
assistance measures and ongoing financial education.


Corporates. Earnings have weakened amid an uncertain operating environment although
corporate balance sheets have generally remained resilient, while leverage has started to
stabilize. The MAS has included a countercyclical capital buffer in their macroprudential
policy framework to curb excessive credit growth.



Macroprudential Policies. Comprehensive macroprudential policies have aided a measured
decline in property prices. Macroprudential policy measures in Singapore are targeted to
specific risks and have both structural and cyclical components to ensure effectiveness and
efficiency. The authorities remain vigilant for signs of renewed froth on the back of stillelevated prices in certain market segments. At the same time, uncertainties in financial
markets and the external outlook could add to the risk of a sharper than warranted property
market correction. They are committed to closely monitoring the property market for risks to
financial stability and stand ready to recalibrate macroprudential policies when deemed
appropriate.

Innovation-Based Growth. The restructuring aims to spur knowledge-based growth, raise
productivity, and turn Singapore into a global innovation hub. A high-level Committee on the Future
Economy has been convened and will announce its priorities by end-2016. Policies that promote
innovation, including higher levels of R&D spending, are appropriate for advanced economies such
as Singapore that are at the knowledge frontier.

41.
R&D Spending. R&D spending is central to innovation-based growth and has risen in
Singapore over the past two decades to about 2¼ percent of GDP in 2014.9 As Singapore moves
forward to reinvent itself, further nurturing the R&D ecosystem can be especially helpful in the
discovery and launch of new goods and services, including in the financial sector (Appendix IX).
Cross-country evidence suggests that in countries like Singapore that are close to the global
technology frontier, increased competition, research-oriented education, and targeted support—
particularly aimed at newer firms and not necessarily smaller firms—could help boost long-term

According to OECD data for 2014, Singapore’s R&D expenditure in percent of GDP was lower than in many
advanced economies, but in per capita terms (at current purchasing power parity prices), it was higher than in all of

GDP. Staff welcomes the emphasis on productivity enhancement and the more targeted approach
adopted in the last budget. The authorities should remain cognizant of the importance of social
insurance and redistribution, over and above those needed for an aging society, to mitigate the risks
from transitioning to innovation-based growth. 10
42.
Restructuring and the Stance of Macroeconomic Policies. An accommodative
macroeconomic environment of low real interest rates and fiscal support for new, innovative firms
can help speed up innovation and economic growth. However, care be must be taken not to disrupt
the process of creative destruction through excessive or generalized support that could stand in the
way of dissolution of nonviable firms. An additional, well-targeted boost to R&D spending in
Singapore’s public and private sectors, together with programs to reduce labor market frictions and
improved skills matching, especially in the higher value-added jobs, will be important in the drive to
an innovation-based growth model. Smoothing the business cycle could boost private investment in
R&D and innovation, especially at firms/sectors that are highly reliant on financing that is external to
the firm and/or on intangible capital (see IMF, Fiscal Monitor, Chapter 2, April 2016).
43.
Authorities’ Views. As Singapore restructures to a labor-lean economy, the authorities
adopted a more targeted approach to incentives for productivity improvements aimed at businesses
while maintaining existing social insurance and safety net programs for households. The authorities
expect this approach to continue to facilitate the move towards technological upgrading, including
through inducing firms to restructure. In pursuing this strategy, the authorities are also aware of the
need to continue to promote supportive economic growth conditions.

E. External Sector Assessment

Overall Assessment. Staff assesses
Singapore’s external position to be substantially
stronger than consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies (Appendix X).
Singapore’s large current account surplus reflects a
strong goods balance that is partly offset by
remittance outflows and a negative income and
services balance.

2004–14, alongside steady appreciation of the real

trade deficit by 3.7 percentage points of GDP and buoyant consumption. Staff judges, based on
regression analysis, that the CA balance is substantially stronger, by 3–9 percent of GDP, than
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Singapore’s status as a financial
center and high corporate saving and foreign investment rates are contributing to Singapore’s large
CA balance. Other factors have to do with limited social safety nets and the mandatory, definedcontribution pension system whose assets are about 70 percent of GDP.

46.
Prospects. Lower oil prices will further raise the CA surplus, to about 20 percent of GDP in
2016. Over the medium term, however, the CA is expected to decline as the population ages and
public spending, including on social safety nets, rises. However, in staff’s view, current policies may
not be enough to moderate the CA surplus sufficiently and more action may be required — for
example, fiscal policies to strengthen social insurance and social safety nets, including
unemployment insurance — that would help reduce precautionary saving, boost private
consumption, and reduce inequality. Over the long term, Singapore’s elderly dependency ratio is
expected to increase significantly by 30 percentage points in the next 20 years, and private saving is
expected to decline by 15 percentage points of GDP (Box 2).
47.
Net International Investment Position and International Reserves. The net international
investment position stood at 210 percent of GDP in 2015, up by 13 percentage points of GDP from
2014, driven by capital outflows (Table 8). While Singapore’s position as a financial center warrants
high-reserve buffers, current official reserves at 87 percent of GDP —equivalent to 26 percent of
short-term external debt, reflecting significant short-term external liabilities of its large international
banking system— appear adequate, and there is no clear case for further reserve accumulation.
Singapore also has other official liquid external assets. Potential vulnerabilities posed by crossborder deposit taking by foreign bank branches are mitigated by banks’ large short-term external
assets.
48.
Authorities’ Views. The authorities did not agree with the characterization of Singapore’s
external position as substantially stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. They cautioned against a narrow view that does not fully capture Singapore’s
exceptional structural features. In particular, the large CA surplus reflects the country’s position as a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

global financial center, trading and production hub, and its city-state geography, with high
corporate sector saving and investment abroad. Policies are appropriately formulated with a longerterm perspective in mind. In particular, the exchange rate is the monetary policy instrument and it is
used to achieve internal balance objectives, which would be compromised if it were used to directly
target the external balance. The external sector assessment should focus on longer-term
considerations related to consumption smoothing over a life cycle and preserving intergenerational
equity and sustainability, rather than near- or medium-term notions of equilibrium. The CA surplus
is expected to decline over time as population aging takes hold, lowering the saving rate, and as the
size of government spending rises. The authorities highlighted the spending already committed to
the upgrading and extension of the country’s transport system, and suggested that such large
projects had to be properly planned to ensure effective implementation and sustainability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Outlook. Singapore’s economy continues to perform well, although growth has slowed,
inflation is running below target, and downside risks dominate. Policies have been recalibrated in
response to weaker-than-expected inflation and growth developments.
50.
Monetary Policy. The slight reduction of the NEER slope to zero in April was an appropriate
monetary policy response to inflation continuing to run below target. The move should be sufficient
to restore internal balance, and a shift to a nominal depreciation is not currently envisaged. The
MAS should remain vigilant and respond flexibly to evolving downside risks to inflation and real
activity, including spillovers from possible renewed volatility in China’s currency, financial markets,
and Brexit, and also the effects on the domestic economy of higher U.S. interest rates and U.S. dollar
appreciation. There is also scope for the MAS to improve monetary policy communication.
Singapore’s unique monetary policy framework notwithstanding, the MAS could elaborate more
frequently its views of inflation developments as they relate to its medium-term price stability
objective and do more to explain the reasons behind its policy moves.
51.
Fiscal Policy. The continued implementation, as part of the 2016 budget, of long-term
investment projects and social programs to reduce income inequality is appropriate. The
construction of aging-related infrastructure, expansion of ports and other facilities, and the
extension of the social safety net all provide near-term support to the economy while helping to
prepare Singapore for aging, maintain its infrastructure edge, and make it a more inclusive society.
Also appropriate are the budget’s new measures to boost innovation and strengthen productivity,
including financial support for the new economy and the provision of working capital for small and
medium enterprises. But while fiscal policy is providing welcome support to activity, more fiscal
stimulus than envisaged in the budget would be useful to boost domestic demand, close the output
gap, and provide insurance against downside risks to growth. In this context, consideration should
also be given to attune the fiscal rule to the business cycle rather than the political cycle and include
all the government’s investment income in the budget’s revenue stream. Infrastructure spending
could be accelerated; means-tested, categorical income transfers to families could be further
expanded; and more could be done to help dynamic, innovative businesses, especially credit
constrained ones. In case of a sustained negative shock, fiscal policy should be the first line of
defense, with monetary policy playing a supporting role.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

52.
Financial Sector. Singapore’s financial system has been resilient to the emerging market
turbulence over the last year, including China- and the initial Brexit-related volatility, aided by large
capital and liquidity cushions and by high standards of regulation and supervision. The banks are
adjusting to the China slowdown and the end of the oil super cycle, remain profitable, and are
reorienting their business models. They should also remain vigilant regarding Brexit-related
uncertainties. Regulation and supervision of banks is being further enhanced. The financial sector’s
substantial exposure to China and liquidity management needs continued monitoring. The ongoing
disinflation in real estate prices is welcome as it continues to be moderate and orderly and improves
housing affordability. Macroprudential policies in place made a decisive contribution to containing
household indebtedness and should be retained for prudential reasons. However, selective
measures could be relaxed if signs of disorderly adjustment emerge or if systemic risk dissipates.
Stress tests indicate that households would be resilient to a rapid increase in interest rates and most
corporates would be able to handle a combined shock to interest rates (reflecting tighter financial
conditions) and earnings (reflecting a weaker external environment). However, elevated household
and corporate sector leverage warrants continued monitoring.
53.
Restructuring. The adjustments to the authorities’ approach to restructuring to a laborlean economy are appropriate in view of the small tangible gains in productivity to date, especially
in the domestically-oriented sectors. These adjustments could help generate sharper incentives for
businesses and workers by adopting a more targeted approach to boosting automation and
innovation while maintaining the expansion of social insurance and safety net arrangements. In
staff’s view, maintaining more accommodative macroeconomic policies would facilitate restructuring
by reducing uncertainty and helping to boost private investment, including in R&D and innovation.
A boost to R&D spending in the public and private sector accompanied by programs to reduce
labor market frictions and improve skills matching, especially in the higher value-added jobs, will be
important in the drive to an innovation-based growth model.
54.
External Sector Assessment. Singapore’s external position in 2015 continued to be
substantially stronger than is consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals and desirable policies.
As in previous years, considerable uncertainty surrounds the assessment, owing to Singapore’s
position as a global financial center and its fully-funded pension system, among other factors. Rapid
population aging and reforms to boost domestic demand, including through better health, pension,
and other social insurance arrangements, and public investment, should lead to a significant
reduction in Singapore’s external imbalances over time.

Box 1. Singapore—Transparency, Communication and the Conduct of Monetary Policy
Monetary Policy Framework in Singapore. Conceptually, the MAS’ focus on internal balance makes it
akin to an inflation-targeting (IT) central bank, and the principles governing transparency, accountability
and communication relevant to IT central banks should apply. However, there are unique considerations
that arise as they use an atypical policy instrument, the NEER. Foreign exchange markets are deeper, more
liquid and consequently, often faster moving, than money markets in other IT countries.
Transparency and Communication. Central bank transparency is related to openness about policy
objectives; data, models and forecasts; the way decisions are made and the policy implications of decisions;
as well as openness about implementation. Transparency facilitates smoother market responses to policy
decisions, by reducing the likelihood that policy decisions that come as a surprise, causing sharp
movements in asset prices. (N. Dincer and B. Eichengreen, 2014, “Central Bank Transparency and
Independence: Updates and New Measures,” International Journal of Central Banking, March 2014, page
189–253) A first step is improved communication with the public. The MAS does provide a fair degree of
detail in its published analysis and strong justifications at the time of its monetary policy actions. However,
there is scope to improve the communication of monetary policy. In the context of the April decision, for
example, it proved challenging to communicate that the reasons underlying the move to a zero slope were
very different from those during the GFC.
Clarifying the Monetary Policy Path. The MAS could clarify its future monetary policy path. For example,
the Monetary Policy Statement of October 2015 could have been used to present a high-level synthesis of
the MAS’ monetary policy direction, noting that if domestic and global conditions continued to evolve as
anticipated, the monetary stance would remain unchanged in the near term. The semi-annual
Macroeconomic Review contains forecasts for real GDP and inflation for the next two years – not point
estimates, but ranges and an acknowledgement of where the outcome is likely to fall in that range. Ideally,
a broader set of macroeconomic forecasts could be provided. Moreover, past forecasts could be contrasted
with actual outcomes, explaining their effects on the current monetary policy stance and future expected
path of inflation, to further elucidate the conduct of monetary policy to the public. Other central bank
publications do this, including the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy Review, the European Central Bank’s
Economic Bulletin, and the Czech National Bank’s Inflation Report. A good deal of background material on
Canada and the Czech Republic’s experiences, in particular, can be found in Clinton and others, 2015,
“Inflation-Forecast Targeting: Applying the Principle of Transparency,” IMF Working Paper No. 15/132.
Communicating Inflation Prospects. The MAS could also consider communicating its interpretation of
inflation developments in the monthly press releases. For example, in early-2016 such a statement could
have been used to signal that inflation outcomes were somewhat weaker than expected. While the existing
releases often reaffirm the MAS forecast range announced in the previous Monetary Policy Statement, they
could provide more detail on how the current inflation outcomes compare with the MAS’ earlier
expectations. Such information could help prime market participants for changes in monetary policy.
Potential Short-Run Costs of Communication. The introduction of such a change may cause some shortrun instability, although this would dissipate in the long run, as can be seen from the experience of other
open-economy inflation targeters such as the Czech Republic, New Zealand, or Canada. Moreover, the MAS
already has a substantial degree of monetary policy credibility, which would be buttressed by such
improved communication, thus allowing Singapore to avoid any sustained short-run volatility. There are
also signs that market analysts already do a lot of short-term analysis based on the official data releases,
examining their manner of wording and other hints of policy intentions. Providing a more explicit set of
statements would serve to better guide them in the current environment, and prevent disruptive surprises
to markets.

Box 2. Singapore—Aging, Savings and the Current Account Balance: Illustrative Projections
Rapid Aging. Rising life expectancy alongside persistent low fertility and a policy-induced slowing
of immigration are contributing to rapid aging of Singapore’s population:
 Current United Nations projections indicate more rapid aging than thought earlier. Over the next
20 years, Singapore’s old age dependency ratio is now expected to rise by 30 percentage points
to 47 percent, the current level in Japan. This means that by 2035, for every one hundred persons
between the ages of 20 and 64, there will be 47 persons of 65 years and older, up from

region’s emerging market economies will age at a slower pace.
 The effects of Singapore’s aging population are already clearly visible. Over the past three years,
a key measure of government spending (operating and development spending) rose by
2.1 percent of GDP. A third of this increase was due to health spending, which rose by 73 percent
over this period. Recently-introduced programs (e.g. Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support)
will further raise aging-related spending.

Box 2. Singapore—Aging, Savings and the Current Account Balance: Illustrative Projections
(concluded)
Implications for saving. According to the life cycle hypothesis, saving behavior is age dependent,
with people saving during their working years and running down their savings during retirement.
Accordingly, aging can be expected to reduce Singapore’s high saving rate and the current account:
 Based on panel regression results, the November 2008 Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and
the Pacific projected that, because Singapore’s aging is outpacing that of its trading partners, its
current account balance would decline by about 6 percent of GDP over a 30-year horizon.

A 1997 survey paper concluded that a one percentage point change in the elderly dependency

next two decades.



 The overall effect of aging on the current account also depends on the response of government
saving and investment. If government saving declines owing to higher spending on the elderly,
the decline in private saving in Singapore and hence the current account could be larger than
indicated in the chart. Given Singapore’s large fiscal buffers, the private sector would be unlikely
to raise its own savings in response to a reduction in government savings.

Singapore has large portfolio assets, which would make its
external balance sheet vulnerable to shocks in the U.S and
several regional economies such as China and India.

Major sources of funding for Singapore’s financial center
include East Asian and European banks, followed by
deposits from East Asian nonbanks.

East Asia is the largest user of funds and likely to receive
outward spillovers from Singapore, in the event of a
banking sector stress in Singapore.

Cross-border exposures of domestic banks in Greater China
and other Asian economies increased, leading to higher
spillovers from the region.

1/ The fiscal year runs from April 1 through March 31. The presentation of the table is based on GFSM 2001.
2/ Includes revenue from land sales and investment income.
3/ Overall balance excluding investment income, capital revenue, and interest payments.
4/ Includes development and operating expenditure on education, health, national development, environment and water resources, culture, community and youth, social and
family development, communications and information, and manpower (financial security). Includes spending on social development purposes from endowment
and trust funds set up by the government.
5/ The fiscal impulse is the change in the cyclically adjusted operational balance, excluding top ups to endowments and trust funds.
6/ The authorities’ budgetary accounts are based on Singapore's Constitutional rules governing the protection of Past Reserves. It includes the net investment returns
contribution, which reflects the amount of investment returns that is taken into the Budget. It excludes receipts such as proceeds from land sales and the remaining part of
investment income that accrues to Past Reserves and cannot be used to fund government expenditures without the approval of the President. While such receipts are not
reflected in the Overall Balance, the information is presented annually to Parliament and included in Budget documents.
7/ Gross asset stock figures are as at the end of March for each year as reported in the "Statement of Assets and Liabilities" in the budget document.
8/ Gross debt stock figures are as at the end of the calendar year. Government debt is issued to develop domestic capital markets and to provide an investment vehicle for the
mandatory saving scheme.
9/ The government of Singapore is the sole equity shareholder of Temasek.
10/ The IMF staff projection for GDP is used to calculate the numbers for the 2016/17 budget in the authorities' budgetary accounts in percent of GDP.

Appendix I. Linkages with China1
Singapore is exposed to China through direct and indirect trade and financial links. The bumpy
rebalancing of China’s growth model, including repercussions in global financial markets, will have
important implications for Singapore.

A. Trade Links
Trade Exposure. China is Singapore’s single largest

Among the ASEAN-5 countries, Singapore is the
most exposed to China through goods trade. Goods
exports to China amounted to 16.3 percent of GDP in 2015, much higher than Malaysia
(8.8 percent), the second most exposed ASEAN-5 country. In terms of Singapore’s gross exports,
China accounted for a share of about 14 percent (up from the 2011–14 average of 11.5 percent).
Capital goods account for about three-fifth of exports to China, while intermediate goods represent
another one quarter of the share. This commodity composition makes Singapore vulnerable to a
slowdown in investment demand as China rebalances. In 2014, China accounted for nearly 6 percent
of Singapore’s services exports.

Trade in value-added terms. In value-added terms, Singapore’s exposure is second highest among
the ASEAN-5 countries, after Malaysia. Over the years, Singapore’s shares in value-added in China’s
final domestic demand and exports have increased, making it more vulnerable to developments in
China.

SINGAPORE

Appendix Figure I.1. ASEAN-5: Trade in Value-Added with China

Goods Exports. Goods exports to China went down by 7.4 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) in 2015,
driven by a sharp reduction in domestic exports to China (down by 17.3 percent). Re-exports to
China were up by 2.4 percent. However, exports to other parts of the world, excluding the United
States, were down by nearly thrice as much (exports to the U.S. were flat).2 The large fall in domestic
exports to China was driven by chemicals and manufactured goods. Volume of domestic exports to
China was also down in 2015, first time since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC).
Services Exports. Services exports to China are small, but growing. In 2014, they accounted for a
share of about 6.8 percent of the total (or, nearly 3 percent of GDP). These exports to China were
nearly as big as those to Japan, but about one-third to one-half of those exports to Europe or North
America, respectively.
Indirect Trade Links. Indirect trade link with China, particularly through the other countries in the
region, is also important given that Singapore has the highest exposure to value-added embedded
in other ASEAN-5 domestic demand and exports. In gross value terms, the ASEAN-4 economies
together with Japan and Korea accounted for nearly 34 percent of Singapore’s total goods exports
in 2015. Any impact of a shock originating from China on these countries will also have implications
for Singapore. Services exports to the ASEAN-4 countries and Korea were about twice as high as
those to China in 2014.

Total goods exports were down by 14.5 percent in 2015. In Singapore dollar terms, total good exports were down
by about 7 percent, but those to China were up by 0.5 percent.

B. Financial Linkages
Background. As an international financial center,
Singapore intermediates credit globally. Prior to the
GFC, banks in Singapore channeled surplus savings
from emerging Asia to Europe. Post crisis, the flows
reversed and net lending to nonbank customers in
emerging Asia and bank funding from rest of the
world turned positive. Credit growth was strong
during 2009–2014, driven primarily by demand
from China and other emerging Asia.
Direct Financial Exposure. Singapore’s financial
linkages to China are large in absolute terms and
when compared to those of other ASEAN countries. The stock of China’s FDI from Singapore is over
30 percent of Singapore’s GDP while Singapore’s portfolio investment in China is about 27 percent
of Singapore’s GDP. This is not surprising in view of Singapore’s position as a large international
financial center, although a material fraction of the investment in China via Singapore may originate
in other countries.

Carry Trade. The development of the offshore RMB market (CNH) facilitated a very profitable
interest rate arbitrage from its inception in 2010, wherein investors borrowed short term from
overseas banks at relatively low interest rates and
then invested in high-yielding Chinese assets amid

Banking Sector Exposure. The three big banks in Singapore—DBS, OCBC, and UOB—have
significant lending exposure to the greater China region. Problem loans (as a proportion of gross
loans) arising from greater China have risen mildly in 2015. Credit risk from mainland China is
mitigated as exposure is predominantly trade finance
related—short-term loans, which are traditionally

increasingly challenging domestic and external
operating environment for banks.

Turning Point. More recently, the credit cycle has begun to turn, led by a decline in nonbank loans
to China. Nonbank loans to China started falling in mid-2014, also accompanied by a contraction in
trade bills due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy as well as a moderation in trade flows. The
share of trade bills in nonbank loans fell from a peak of 15 percent in June 2014 to 8 percent in
February 2016. Cross-border exposure of domestic banks in Greater China region, which increased
from 2010 to 2014 and fell slightly in 2015, is still sizable at close to 25 percent.

also put upward pressure on Sibor interest rates to

C. China Spillovers
Recent staff analyses (Dizioli and others, forthcoming, and Cashin and others, 2016) show that a
1 percent one-off slowdown in China’s GDP would have varying impact on the ASEAN-5 economies,
given their trade exposure. This impact is amplified if combined with a China-induced spike in global
financial volatility. The impact on Singapore’s GDP in the first year after of the shock is estimated at
–0.1 to –0.5 percentage points, with the highest impact seen when financial volatility spikes. These
estimates also incorporate the positive spillover from a China slowdown, viz. lower global
commodity prices, which would help Singapore as the country is a net importer of commodities.

Appendix II. Inflation and Unemployment Trends1
Inflation in Singapore has remained on a downward trend since late 2011, declining from a peak of
about 5.5 percent to –0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016, and remained below zero since 2014Q4.
Unemployment, on the other hand, was stable around 2 percent during this time. This study finds that
in Singapore while the conventional inflation-unemployment trade-off holds over the past two
decades, it has weakened in recent years. On the other hand, inflation expectations are better
anchored. Finally, the marginal impact from import prices on headline inflation does not appear to
have increased in recent years.
Headline inflation in Singapore has largely remained below that in other advanced economies over
the past three and a half decades. Like in other advanced economies, Singapore has experienced a
trend disinflation since 2011 and the headline inflation has remained below zero since late 2014.
However, the slowdown in inflation in Singapore has happened at a much faster pace, declining
from a peak of about 5.5 percent in late 2011 to –0.8 percent in the first quarter of 2016. Historically,
Singapore also experienced a much lower overall unemployment rate, particularly since the 1990s,
reflecting in part a lower structural unemployment rate.

1/ For Singapore, data refer to overall unemployment from 1992 and are not
strictly comparable to data prior to 1992.

What is remarkable is that despite a trend decline in inflation for over four years now,
unemployment rate has remained broadly stable around 2 percent. Does it mean that the traditional
Phillips curve relation has weakened in recent years? IMF (2013) and Blanchard and others (2015),
for example, have looked into this issue in the context of other advanced economies. Both these
studies document a flattening of the Phillips curve since the 1970s, with most of this flattening
happening before the 1990s against a rapid decline in inflation. Moreover, these studies find that
inflation expectations are much better anchored now than in the past helping ensure the stability of
inflation witnessed over the last three decades (the Great Moderation).
In this study, we use the New Keynesian Phillips curve framework described in the above studies to
explore how the Phillips curve relationship has evolved over time in Singapore along with the
evolution of importance of inflation expectations in explaining headline inflation. The framework

Applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique, with lagged

relationship between inflation and cyclical unemployment holds. However, the estimates vary
depending on the measure of cyclical unemployment.2 Inflation expectations are found to be
significant in two of the models.

In Singapore, inflation expectations have largely been stable over the last two decades, hovering
predominantly between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent range. The near-term inflation expectation has
also been in line with the survey of professional forecasts conducted by the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS).

We used the average of the 6–10 year-ahead consumer price inflation forecasts from the Consensus Economics as
long-term inflation expectation. For the cyclical unemployment, we used four different measures of long-term or
structural unemployment: average unemployment rate over 1987Q1–2016Q1; a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) measure of
trend unemployment rate; and two measures of nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) derived
from a multivariate Kalman filter (MVF) framework developed by Blagrave and others (2015) and a modified version
of Ali (2015) to account for changes in labor force participation (see Appendix IV for details on these MVF models).

not available for all the quarters for MAS professional surveys.

Stability of inflation expectations could be a testament to the credibility of the MAS’ monetary policy
framework, prudent fiscal policy decisions, a pragmatic approach toward macroeconomic
management, and strong institutions in Singapore. Following Gillitzer and Simon (2015), we
statistically assess the stability of inflation expectations to surprises in actual inflation. We regress
the change in successive semi-annual Consensus Economics surveys of inflation forecasts at various
horizons on the change in actual inflation during the interim period between the relevant surveys.
(2)
Where, h refers to different forecasts horizons.
If expectations are well anchored, surprises in actual inflation in the interim period between the two
surveys should not impact the medium- to long-term expectations. Near-term expectations,
however, may change reflecting unexpected transitory shocks to actual inflation.
Our analysis finds that since the mid-1990s, when the Consensus Economics’ long-term forecast
became available, surprises in actual inflation have had significant positive impact on inflation
expectations up to 2-year ahead (marginally significant impact on the 3-year-ahead expectations),
with insignificant impact beyond the 3-year horizon. Thus, inflation expectations have been well
anchored in the longer term. Further, a breakdown of the estimation period into two decades
reveals that expectations have become better anchored over the last decade. During this period,
inflation surprises have had a larger impact on the current-year inflation forecasts, but the impact on
the future years have been relatively muted, particularly over the medium term.

Having studied the long-run Phillips curve relationship, next we checked whether this relationship
has changed over time (the short-run dynamics). To formally test for the short-run dynamics we use
the following error-correction model.

In which,
is the long-term inflation expectation,
expressed as the average of the 6–10 year-ahead
Consensus Economics inflation forecasts and the
parameter will capture the impact of these
expectations; the parameter will capture the
short-term responses of inflation to cyclical
unemployment, while will capture the
adjustments in short-term deviation from the longterm relationship estimated in (3) above. Following
IMF (2013), import price inflation is also included to
capture the influence of global commodity prices
on domestic inflation, an important channel for
short-term inflation in Singapore. It is estimated as
the year-on-year change in import prices relative to
the GDP deflator and its impact on current inflation
will be captured by the parameter . We allowed
the parameters to vary over time by using a rolling
ten-year window and used the GMM methodology
with robust standard errors for parameter
estimations and lagged cyclical unemployment and
import prices as instruments.



First, the results are sensitive to the measure of cyclical unemployment used. As discussed
above, we estimated four different measures of cyclical unemployment. While these
measures broadly agree over much of the history since the late-1980s, in recent years two of
the measures indicate virtually no cyclical unemployment.



Second, as mentioned above, while the long-term Phillips curve relationship holds, also seen
in the negative 10-year rolling simple correlation, this correlation has weakened somewhat
in recent years for three of the cyclical measures of unemployment. A further analysis shows
that while the volatility of headline inflation has remained more or less similar since the GFC
(standard deviation of 2.4 percent over 2011Q1–2016Q1, compared to 2.7 percent over
2007Q1–2010Q4), that of unemployment has significantly dropped (standard deviation
dropping from 0.5 percent to 0.1 percent over the same period). One possible explanation
could be the supply-driven external shocks, for example, in global energy prices, has led to
higher variability in inflation, while domestic demand conditions were conducive enough to
maintaining a relatively stable level of unemployment rate.

Regression estimates based on the four
different measures of cyclical
unemployment explain the actual inflation
process fairly well, though they differ in
their extent of in-sample forecast accuracy.
The regression that uses the 1987Q1–
2016Q1 average unemployment rate as the
measure of long-term unemployment yields
the best fit against actual inflation, followed
by the one that uses the HP trend of
unemployment for measuring . Of the two
regressions that used the NAIRU estimates
from the multi-variate Kalman filter, the one
without modifications for labor force
participation yielded a relatively better fit. In
the following, we present a weighted
average of the outcomes from these four
regressions, with higher weights attached to
the regression with better fit (adjusted Rsquared) in terms of explaining actual
inflation.
As indicated in the simple correlation analysis
above, the responsiveness of inflation to cyclical
unemployment has been declining in recent
years. While the relationship strengthened
around the GFC, it has been weakening since
2011 and more rapidly so over the last three
years. The large variability of the alternative
estimates indicates a combination of
uncertainty from the GFC period (in a ten-year
rolling window, the GFC still impacts the
parameter estimates for recent years) and also
uncertainty surrounding the measurement of
structural unemployment in recent years as
Singapore is undergoing an economic
transformation.
Moreover, the relevance of past inflation in
explaining current inflation has weakened and
that of inflation expectations has strengthened
steadily over the last one decade, except during
the GFC. Also noteworthy is that the alternative

parameter estimates are now more tightly bound compared to the earlier years.


Finally, while the impact of import price inflation is higher in the post GFC period, there does not
appear to be any particular strengthening of this impact in recent years. However, given the
magnitude of the change in global commodity prices in the last two years, the total impact has
been potentially bigger. Once again, we find that the alternative parameter estimates are more
closely bound in recent years.

To conclude, the inflation-unemployment trade off held in Singapore over a longer period. But in
the short run, this relationship appears to have weakened in recent years. However, inflation
expectations are better anchored relative to the past. The Singaporean authorities must be
commended for the credibility of their macroeconomic policies which could have contributed to the
improvement in anchoring inflation expectation. Finally, despite increased volatility in the global
commodity prices, the marginal impact of import price inflation on the headline inflation does not
appear to have increased in recent years, but its total impact is potentially larger given the large
declines in commodity prices since late 2014.

Appendix III. Labor Market Dynamics1
Summary. This Appendix reviews basic facts of Singapore’s labor market, focusing on the evolution
of labor market frictions as estimated from a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) matching
function. We find that tightness in Singapore’s labor market has eased in recent quarters: though
the unemployment rate has remained broadly stable amid a rising resident labor force participation
rate, vacancies have declined and redundancies have risen. While job matching efficiency in
Singapore has been comparable with the US, it has been declining in recent years, reflecting
growing skill mismatches or changes in search and recruitment efforts. Labor market policies should
actively continue to aim at improving skill matches and reverse the decline in matching efficiency.
Restructuring and Labor Markets. The ongoing restructuring of Singapore’s economy to a laborlean, innovation-based growth model relies on the introduction of more binding restrictions on
inflows of foreign workers (33.7 percent of total employment excluding foreign domestic workers in
end-2015) and the provision of incentives to Singaporean workers and firms. The system of
incentives developed since 2011 encourages Singaporean workers and firms to work, learn and
innovate. It also discourages hiring of foreign workers, including through foreign worker levies and
sectoral quotas.
Labor Market Developments. The restructuring has resulted in a tighter labor market, although the
tightness has eased in recent quarters.


As the labor force aged and restrictions on inflows of foreign workers came into force starting in
2011, labor markets tightened and residents’ labor force participation rate rose to a record level.
Increased participation by persons aged 50 years and above, which comprised a third of the
labor force in 2015, accounted for about 90 percent of the change in the resident labor force
participation since mid-2011. Female participation has also gone up across all age groups. Many
of the new entrants were recruited in part-time and/or low-skilled jobs, resulting in a tepid
change in labor productivity in recent years.



In recent quarters the labor market has become less tight, reflecting the turn of the financial
cycle at home and a difficult external environment. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed
workers has declined from a peak of 1.42 in 2014Q2 to about unity in 2016Q1. The rate of firm
creation has declined and that of firm cessation has picked up. Redundancies in the labor force
have gone up to the post Global Financial Crisis (GFC) highs, led by the manufacturing and
services sectors. The recruitment rate has failed to keep pace with the vacancy rate since
late 2013, indicating a combination of skill mismatches and rising unit business cost. Job vacancy
rates have slowed down amid a deceleration in the formation of businesses and a rise in their
cessation. The Beveridge curve had shifted upward during 2011–15.

Labor Market Matching. As Singapore’s economy becomes more innovation-based, the
Schumpeterian mechanism of creative destruction is expected to lead to more rapid creation of new
goods and services, firms, and jobs in rising sectors. But this process is expected to be disruptive as
workers producing older varieties or vintages get displaced. Operationally, the ease with which
workers are matched to vacancies is measured using the methods of DMP. They incorporate labor
market frictions by assuming that workers who lose their job must spend some time as unemployed.
They are matched to jobs randomly, according to a matching function that relates the number of
successful labor market matches to vacancies posted by firms. Formally, when there are u*L number
of unemployed workers and v*L vacancies, where u is the unemployment rate and v is the vacancy
rate, there are m*L labor market matches. We assume the standard Cobb-Douglas, constant returns
to scale matching function,

m  m0u v1
where m0 is Singapore’s matching efficiency and  is the probability of finding a job. From this, the

Estimates for Singapore. In the case of Singapore, 
is estimated at about 0.52, comparable to the U.S.,
though slightly smaller, and higher than other OECD
countries.2 In 2015, the median duration of
unemployment in Singapore was 8 weeks, resident
workers made redundant had a 54 percent chance of
getting reemployed after three months. Matching
efficiency, as measured by m0 , has declined over time
(chart). If the model had been estimated until the mid2000s, m0 would have been 0.63, which was higher

Appendix IV. Potential Growth and Productivity1
Singapore’s growth rate has slowed down in recent years, driven by both cyclical and structural factors.
While an aging population and tight immigration policies have led to a slower labor force expansion,
despite a record high labor participation rate, a decline in private investment has contributed to a
slower capital formation. Productivity has not helped either. Against this backdrop, potential growth
has slowed rapidly in recent years. Looking forward, potential output is expected to grow at about 2.5–
3 percent rate over the medium term, with productivity improvement backed by human capital
formation, R&D, and innovation-based output.

Singapore’s population is aging and

And, somewhat worryingly, though not
unique to Singapore, productivity growth
has slowed down considerably post GFC,
driven by a weaker manufacturing sector
and higher labor participation in lessproductive, domestically-oriented sectors.
Official statistics show that the total factor
productivity (TFP) contributed negatively to
real GDP growth in every year since 2012
(longest streak of negative contributions,
though cumulatively it is smaller than
negative contributions witnessed during the
past recessions).

Resident labor force participation reached
an all-time high in 2015, but was aided by
older age workers, who likely joined in lowproductivity jobs. Given the negative growth
in population aged below 15 years, a fast
pace of aging, and an already high labor
force participation rate, resident labor force
growth is forecast to about halve over the
medium term, compared to 2009–15 (i.e.,
annual average addition of about 20,000
workers, in line with official forecast,
compared to 46,000 over 2009–15).

The estimated impact is fairly robust across

The results also show that growth in labor force positively impacts private fixed investment,
while a lower share of the manufacturing sector and counter-cyclical fiscal policies (public
fixed investment is weakly correlated with output gap in the sample) drag private investment
down.

Against this backdrop of slower growth in physical inputs, productivity enhancement will be vital for
Singapore’s growth over the medium term. The authorities have announced multi-year plans to raise
R&D; help workers enhance their skills; and provide incentives to firms to promote investment in
automation and robotics. A high level committee, Committee on the Future Economy, is expected to
unveil plans by end-2016 on Singapore’s future economic strategies.

Emphasis on R&D and on labor market reforms (especially lowering labor market frictions) is
appropriate for advanced economies as they strive to raise productivity growth (See Table 1 in IMF,

global effort into R&D at the global level, which
depends on the number of researchers in the world. On this view, total research effort is the sum of
R&D of large, systemically important countries. For example, Jones (2015) uses the G-5 (the U.S.,
Germany, Japan, France and the U.K.). The prospect of China, India and other large developing
countries contributing growing numbers of researchers could, in principle, raise global TFP, which
has become anemic of late.

R&D in Singapore

Research conducted in the private sector account
for 60 percent of the total spending (data as of
2014). However, compared to the G-5 countries and
Korea, industry-financed R&D expenditure appears
to be low per unit of government-financed
expenditure. In terms of sectoral allocations,
engineering and technology has a 59 percent share,
followed by biomedical research (19 percent) and
research in other natural sciences (13 percent).

In Singapore, R&D spending in relation to GDP had
been rising from low levels prior to the GFC but has
leveled off in recent years. Latest cross-country data
as of 2014 show that R&D share of output in
Singapore is lower than in the G-5 and in Korea and
has not changed much from its 2003 level. However,
when expressed in per capita terms (at current
purchasing power parity prices), Singapore’s R&D
expenditure is higher than these economies.

compound annual growth rate of 4.4 percent during 2004–14, faster than growth in overall labor
force (4.2 percent during 2004–14). Total expenditure on R&D and researcher intensity, measured by
full-time equivalent as percentage of total labor force, could be further improved.
Empirical work suggests that R&D spending investment in Singapore has had a significant effect on
total factor productivity and growth, although by less than in other advanced economies.3 As
Singapore’s effort in this area become more pronounced, the productivity of its R&D effort could
rise. The experience of Korea demonstrates that concentrated national efforts in R&D coupled with
the imposition of hard budget constraints and global market orientation of firms can help create
“global stars,” companies that innovate and that help raise productivity and growth.

C. An Alternative Growth Accounting Based on Innovation
Following Jones (2002) and Fernald and Jones (2014), we also conduct an alternative growth
accounting exercise that uses investment in R&D spending to estimate growth in total factor
productivity. While following Jones, who focused on the R&D in the G-5 countries (France, Germany,
Japan, the U.K., and the U.S.), we also add Korea and Singapore. Due to lack of a longer time series
on labor force data, the analysis is only conducted starting in 1991. There were a few updates to the
G-5 data for R&D, particularly the number of researchers in the U.S. were revised down in the OECD
data. We have also included overtime hours in the total hours.
The results for Singapore accord qualitatively with those of Jones. The contribution of R&D to
growth is large, almost 50 percent of growth in per capita output. The contribution of population
growth has been significant as well, about 30 percent. Human capital has added 20 percent while a
decline in the capital/output ratio since the Asian Financial Crisis has led to an insignificant
contribution to growth from physical capital formation.

D. Technical Details on Estimation of Potential Growth
Hodrick-Prescott (HP) Filter
A standard HP filter is applied to quarterly data since 1975. To account for the well-known end-ofperiod estimation problems associated with the HP filter, staff’s forecasts of real GDP growth over
2016Q1–2017Q4 are incorporated.

Augmented HP Filter
The HP filter is augmented to incorporate financial cycle information and the Kalman filter is used to
derive new estimates of potential output, following Borio and others (2013). The motivation is to
incorporate information about financial cycle that contributes to the economic sustainability
(potential output). The experience of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09, for example,
demonstrates that output may be on an unsustainable path even if inflation remains low and stable:
inflation is not a sufficient statistic that captures imbalances, particularly financial imbalances.
The HP filter can be written in state-space form as:

Model:

The output gap is defined as the deviation of real GDP (Y, in log terms) from its potential level, Y,
y=Y–

Y

_

(4)

The stochastic process for output (real GDP) comprises of three equations, and subject to three
types of shocks: shocks to the level of potential output, shock to potential growth rate, and a
demand-side shock. The first shock will cause output to be at permanently different level than its
initial steady-state path, while the second shock to make it deviate from the stead-state path
temporarily. The demand-side shock will make output deviate from its potential temporarily. First,
the level of potential output follows an autoregressive process and evolves according to potential
growth and a level-shock term:
_

Y t  Y t 1  G t   tY

Potential growth itself is also subject to shocks, following which it adjusts to its steady-state rate:
_

Finally, the output gap slowly closes over time and is also subject to demand shocks:

Finally, equations describing the unemployment process, including an Okun’s relation, labor force
participation are added to provide further identifying information.

The unemployment gap is defined as the difference from the NAIRU ( U ). It is related to the output
gap through an Okun’s law equation and it affects the labor force participation (LFP) gap.

Production Function (PF) Approaches
We apply two production function approaches. In both the approaches contributions from the
resident and nonresident labor forces are separately estimated. In the augmented PF approach,
contribution from the resident labor force is augmented by human capital formation.

An Alternative Growth Accounting Based on Innovation
Following Jones (2002) and Fernald and Jones (2015), we also conduct an alternative growth
accounting exercise that uses investment in R&D spending to estimate growth in total factor
productivity.
In the growth accounting exercise, Jones uses the following Cobb-Douglas production function with
human capital formation:

where HYt is expressed similarly to equations 19 and 20 above, but using the total number of labor

where HA is effective world research effort expressed as a weighted sum of the number of

representation for worldwide research activity and we extended this set of countries by including
Korea and Singapore.
Finally, using a resource constraint on the total labor supply in the representative economy, Jones
derives output per worker ( ) as the following:

Appendix VI. SGPMOD: A Small Monetary Policy Model 1
This appendix summarizes some of the key results of the Selected Issues paper which introduces a new
small calibrated model of the Singapore economy, the Singapore Global Policy MODel (SGPMOD)2.
While, in reality, Singapore has multiple policy options to react to shocks, SGPMOD is used to illustrate
the positive role the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) can play in offsetting negative effects from
downside risks, such as a downward revision to China’s future growth path, and the effects of Brexit on
Singapore. We show, unsurprisingly, that monetary policy is expansionary. In the case of China, as
expected, the MAS cannot prevent the long-term fall in output; it can only mitigate the short-term
effects. In the case of Brexit, the MAS can play a strong role in combatting its negative effects after the
initial impact.

A.

The Structure of SGPMOD

The Singapore Global Policy MODel (SGPMOD) is a quarterly, multi-region model, including both
China and the United States, and a small reduced-form block for the other regions. It tracks all the
components of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), although its interest rates come from
the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition vis-à-vis only the U.S., reflecting Singapore’s role as a
global financial center linked to the United States. Based on calibration from other, larger structural
models at the IMF, SGPMOD attempts to link shocks to trends in the long term and the movements
in gap variables in the short term. It has been designed with the sole purpose of examining the
conduct of monetary policy in Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
The MAS uses an inflation-targeting (IT) regime, pursuing a target NEER. This is officially known as
the Basket-Band-Crawl framework, or BBC (see MAS, 2001 and Khor and others, 2004). The MAS
usually announces twice a year (in April and in October) about its intentions for the target nominal
effective exchange rate. It communicates in general terms about the three components:



Basket = the composition of currencies used in the target NEER defended by the MAS to guide
monetary policy. The basket is composed of the currencies of its major trading partners,
weighted by their share in trade – in particular, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, the U.S., and the euro
area, along with other countries, including most south-east Asian countries.



Band = the permitted percentage variation around the MAS’ target NEER.



Crawl = the permitted quarterly change in the MAS’ target NEER. It is usually a rate of
appreciation, although sometimes it is set at zero.

Parrado (2004), McCallum (2006), and MAS (2016a) provide ample evidence that the MAS
determines the target NEER by pursuing some form of price stability, implying the existence of a
MAS core inflation target. It also most likely has weight on the output gap, which, besides
smoothing the path of real GDP, can also serve as another indicator of future inflation.

Monetary Fund, and shares the theoretical underpinnings of Carabenciov and others (2013).

The Singapore Block: A NEER-Based Model for an IT Regime
The Singapore block of SGPMOD is a canonical gap model, focused on four standard building
blocks:



The I-S curve links the output gap (real GDP minus the level of potential output) with the
domestic interest rate gap, the real effective exchange rate (REER) gap (directly affected by the
MAS) and the output gap of the rest of the world.



The Phillips curve links MAS core CPI inflation with expected and lagged inflation, the REER
gap, and the output gap. The MAS’ definition of core inflation excludes from headline inflation
the costs of accommodation and private road transport, but includes food prices and non-roadtransport energy costs.



The UIP condition clears financial markets, by linking the domestic short-term interest rate with
the U.S. short-term interest rate, accounting for expected future movement in the exchange rate
(influenced by the MAS) and any country risk premium.



The monetary policy rule is for an IT regime, constructed as a NEER reaction function, explored
in the next subsection.

The Monetary Policy Reaction Function
The MAS does not explicitly state its monetary policy rule, but econometric work provides us a
guide. Following in the footsteps of Parrado (2004) and McCallum (2006), its composition is similar
to a standard interest rate reaction function, with the deviation of core inflation from its target level,
and the output gap.

Estimates of the Policy Rule
The NEER reaction function is an extension of that estimated by Sheridan and Nadeem (2013) and
Arbatli (2015), based on data from 1991 to 2015. It includes a shadow measure of the U.S. Fed Funds
rate (Wu and Xia, 2015). Singapore cannot actually set its own interest rates, as it is a small economy
with an entirely open capital account that cannot influence the interest rate implied by the UIP
condition. All else equal, a move in the U.S. interest rate moves the Singapore rate, which imparts
extra volatility to the domestic economy. By including the U.S. interest rate in its determination of
the target NEER, the MAS tries to spread the nominal-side adjustment into the NEER as well as the
Singaporean interest rates, somewhat reducing volatility in Singapore’s economy.

Rest of the World
The remainder of the SGPMOD consists of the U.S., China, and the other rest of the world, plus
commodities (oil and food). The U.S. and China have full blocks, similar to Singapore, derived from
the IMF’s Global Projection Model (GPM) framework (Blagrave and others, 2013). Commodities (food
and oil) are based on random walk stochastic processes for prices. For the other countries there are
random walk stochastic process for their real bilateral US$ exchange rate and output gaps. There are
some extra links for emerging Asia, accounting from direct impacts from China. These are important
links to capture, since emerging Asia is Singapore’s largest trading partner. As with Singapore, the
blocks for the U.S. and China are both variants of the canonical gap model. They each have their
own monetary policy frameworks.
Monetary Policy in the United States and China
The U.S. follows an IT regime, so it has an inflation-forecast-based interest rate reaction function,
using core CPI inflation.
China’s monetary policy regime is more complex. It is a dual instrument, dual target system. The
framework uses two reaction functions, one that defines the nominal policy bilateral US$ exchange
rate (where the nominal bilateral US$ exchange rate is chosen by targeting China’s output gap, and
using an explicit nominal bilateral US$ exchange rate target), while the other defines the short-term
policy interest rate (with the same specification as the U.S. interest rate reaction function). The actual
outcomes for the bilateral US$ exchange rate and the short-term interest rate turn out to be linear
combinations of their reaction functions, and their outcomes under the UIP condition.

U.S. and China’s Spillovers to Singapore
The primary direct impacts from the U.S. on Singapore are through the output gap (captured by the
equation’s two proxies for trade – the change in the REER, and the rest-of-the-world output gap)
and inflation (its impact from the REER, which is a proxy for imported goods prices). Another impact
is from the UIP condition, which states that the domestic Singapore short-term interest rates move
one for one with that of the U.S., all else being equal. This motivates the choice of the MAS to allow
for the small impact of the short-term U.S. interest rate gap when determining the target NEER.
Finally, the U.S. has an indirect impact on Singapore because of its direct impacts on China’s interest
rates and output gap.
China’s has the same direct impacts on Singapore through the output gap and inflation as the U.S.
Its indirect impacts on Singapore come through its effects on the U.S. via its output gap and its
direct impact on emerging Asia, captured by linking China’s output gap with theirs.

B.

The Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in SGPMOD

This section considers a negative shock to domestic demand in Singapore, via the output gap, in
order to understand the transmission of monetary policy to the Singaporean economy. In doing so,
we consider the MAS’ NEER reaction function, and contrast it with a standard interest rate reaction
function.

The General Behavior of the Mechanism
Regardless of the form of the policy rule, because the MAS follows an IT regime, a decrease in
domestic demand generates the same behavior:



The output gap enters excess supply, which leads to disinflation, eliciting a monetary policy
response;



Monetary policy takes an expansionary stance, which encourages aggregate demand,
putting upward pressure on the output gap;



As the output gap becomes more positive, inflationary pressures increase, and inflation
begins to return to its target level;



As the inflation gap closes, the MAS withdraws its stimulus; and



Finally, inflation returns to target and the output gap closes.

However, there are distinctions between the actual behavior of monetary policy, and whether the
MAS implements its IT regime using an interest rate reaction function, or a NEER reaction function.
The detailed explanation below focuses on the mechanics under the NEER reaction function, and
contrasts it to the use of an interest rate reaction function, in Figure VI.1.

The Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism on Impact
On the impact of such a shock, the MAS depreciates the NEER immediately. Because inflation is
sticky, the REER will also depreciate on impact. This leads to higher net trade – exports rise as their
goods cost less abroad, while imports fall as their cost to Singaporeans rise, especially since
exchange rate pass-through is relatively fast in an open economy such as Singapore. Higher trade
means that the output gap will begin to close, and the excess demand will decrease. Both this, and
78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

the depreciated REER, adds inflationary pressures to the economy, and MAS core inflation begins to
rise.
The MAS’ depreciation of the NEER also works through the UIP condition. The nominal bilateral US$
exchange rate depreciates in line with NEER, and Singapore’s short-term interest rate increases
relative to that of the U.S.:

Since inflation is somewhat sticky, the real interest rate, RR, will also increase. The increase in the real
interest rate works against the depreciation of the REER in the determination of Singapore’s output
gap. Therefore, without a complete understanding of the weights of those variables in the behavior
of the output gap, the effects of monetary policy may be ambiguous on impact.
In a country using an interest rate reaction function instead, the nominal short-term interest rate
would fall as policy interest rate is lowered, as would the real, while the exchange rate would
depreciate, meaning that the two instruments would both work in the same direction. Therefore,
since Singapore uses a NEER reaction function where the two instruments (the NEER and the shortterm interest rate) work at cross purposes, it experiences more volatility than a country under an
interest rate reaction function, even if both countries are IT regimes.

The Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in the Medium- to Long-Term
After the first year, the temporary nature of the shock dictates that the REER return to its long-term
equilibrium, and starts to appreciate, as will Singapore’s real bilateral US$ exchange rate. As the real
bilateral US$ exchange rate appreciates, so will the nominal, despite rising inflation, because
inflation is still rising more slowly than the rate of appreciation, because of price stickiness. By
uncovered interest parity, Singapore’s short-term interest rate falls relative to that of the United
States:

Monetary policy is now stimulative. Although the change in the NEER (and therefore the US$
bilateral rate) is removing the stimulus from the economy, the real interest rate is working to
reintroduce it. The real interest rate offsets the MAS’ stimulus in the short term, but it slows its
withdrawal in the medium term.

Choosing the Reaction Function
The apparent superiority of the interest rate reaction function in delivering lower volatility and faster
adjustment in SGPMOD is very unlikely to hold, in practice. An interest rate reaction function for
Singapore is a poor choice. As a small, very open economy, with an entirely open capital account,
and a strong role as a regional financial center, Singaporean interest rates are mostly influenced
through its financial markets, which can best be proxied in SGPMOD by the UIP condition.

C.

Downside Risks to Singapore

As the current economic environment unfolds, there are a number of risks to the Singapore
economy, which at this juncture, are skewed to the downside. They are basically complex
combinations of the model properties presented above, with differing time horizons and variable
magnitudes. While we can often untangle the sources of the shocks, it is difficult to determine how
they interact with one another in the Singaporean economy, without the use of a tool such as
SGPMOD. We consider three scenarios – a sudden downward revision in expected potential output
growth in China; another version of the China scenario, but leading to additional turmoil in other
emerging markets; and the effects of Brexit, stemming from disruption to world financial markets
and reduced growth prospects in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
We assume that the risk starts to unfold in 2016Q2 (2016Q3 in the case of the Brexit scenario). The
outcomes are presented relative to a baseline forecast to the end of 2018Q4. We recognize that the
MAS may not be able to offset the effects exclusively. For example, fiscal policy and other structural
policy can also play a role. However, we are only interested here in examining the role monetary
policy can play in modifying the short-term dynamics of the economy. We consider two cases to
describe the new target NEER relative to its baseline path: first, there are ongoing policy adjustments
to the target NEER; second; the MAS stays with the baseline target NEER path. In second case,
movements in the short-term interest rate match that of the U.S. because of its determination by the
UIP condition.

Lower Expected Potential Output Growth in China
Consider a scenario where China’s potential output growth is revised down, permanently, by one
percent (quarter-on-quarter, at annual rates). The reported results, as found in Figure VI.2, are the
outcome on the economy, versus the expected path of real GDP in China under the baseline. We
also assume that the fall in potential output growth leads to a decline in expected stock of wealth
for households, which translates into an additional fall in China’s output gap of roughly
0.25 percentage points. Moreover, there is constant upward pressure on China’s inflation, because of
the higher costs associated with the realization that potential output is not expanding as fast as
originally expected.
The outcomes in China are, of course, significant for Singapore (Figure VI.3), just not with direct
impacts, but indirect as well, primarily through Emerging Asia. As Emerging Asia experience a
decline in its output (primarily from strong trade links with China), they reduce their imports from
Singapore, which manifests itself as a lower Singaporean output gap.
There are also the direct impacts from China. First, the Singaporean output declines along with
import demand from China. Moreover, since China is weakening, the renminbi depreciates against
all currencies, pushing up, in the short term, Singapore’s NEER. Because prices are sticky, the REER
appreciates as well. Of course, the lower output gap and REER appreciation are disinflationary.
80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

At this point, we should draw attention to the types of spillovers from China—they lead to neither a
permanent decline in Singapore or emerging Asia potential growth, nor a crisis of confidence in the
ASEAN economies (with its attendant threat of capital flight). We will consider such extra effects on
top of this “calmer” China scenario in the following scenario.
In this scenario, the MAS can definitely play a key role. Many of the short-term impacts are similar to
those of the negative domestic demand shock. Monetary policy can smooth the transition to a lower
long-term level of real GDP, but it cannot prevent it, as this scenario presents a permanent
contraction in China’s share in the global economy.
We can see the utility of the MAS’ new target NEER path by comparing it with the case where the
MAS simply follows its baseline. We see that, in the medium term, the NEER is too appreciated, and
interest rates are too high, leading to notable negative consequences. The output decline is much
larger, driven by the output gap in the near term, not potential output, thereby illustrating the
importance of monetary policy, which can only act on the demand side of the economy. Inflation
also turns out to be much weaker.

Lower Expected Potential Output Growth in China with Emerging Market Turmoil
Now, reconsider the previous scenario about China’s potential output growth rate. Since China is a
key player in the global economy, it is not unlikely that there may be further effects based on
investors’ confidence in the economies most strongly linked to China, such as emerging Asia, and
Singapore itself. Therefore, relative to the previous, “calmer” China scenario, this scenario amplifies
its negative impacts with two additional assumptions about the riskiness of emerging Asian assets.
First, there is a 1 percentage point increase in Singapore country risk premium in 2016, which
declines to zero by 2017q3. Second, there is additional country risk in emerging Asia, leading to
additional depreciation in their real exchange rate gap vis-à-vis the U.S.
Therefore, in Figure VI.4, Singapore experiences additional negative impacts from the further falls in
emerging Asia’s output gap, and its real exchange rate gap. The additional increase in the
Singaporean risk premium leads to a higher domestic short-term interest rate on impact, through
the UIP condition. Passing through to the real short-term interest rate, it causes an even larger
decline in real GDP, which in turn means inflation falls further than the “calmer” China scenario, in
the short term. However, there is higher inflation in the medium term, and therefore greater relative
cyclicality in Singaporean inflation.
Since future inflation is higher than in the “calmer” China scenario, the MAS does not need to move
the target NEER as much – inflation stabilization is more important than output stabilization in its
policy reaction function. In this case, the MAS is struggling to react properly, because of changes in
the fundamentals of the exchange and interest rates outside of the MAS’ control. First, the trade
weights of Singapore’s trading partners permanently diverge from the composition in the official
NEER basket, as Emerging Asia shrinks in size relative to everyone else. Second, the UIP condition is
broken by the country risk premium shock, which means that the MAS’ policy actions are no longer
the sole determinant of the short-term interest rate vis-à-vis that of the U.S.
Overall, Singapore is worse off in the short term when there is the additional emerging markets
turmoil. Although it is clear that the MAS, even with the limitations it faces in using its NEER reaction
function, is able to improve the outcomes relative to holding steady in its policy decisions over 2016
to 2018.

The Effects of Brexit with Near-Term Global Turmoil
The June 23, 2016, referendum in the UK on EU membership resulted in a majority that favored the
UK leaving the EU. Brexit has a broad array of implications on the future relationships between the
UK and the EU, both of a long-term and a short-term nature. Given their sizes in the global
economy, the effects in those countries will be felt worldwide, and are being examined. We quantify
the effects of Brexit on Singapore based on a scenario similar to that used to develop the IMF’s July
WEO Update, starting in 2016Q3 (not 2016Q2, as in the previous scenarios). The scenario is
concentrated in 2016 and 2017, as negotiations between the UK and the EU could potentially last
more than a year. The scenarios considered here are illustrative only and do not suggest the
eventual outcome of the negotiations.
We represent Brexit using a number of components focusing primarily in the UK and the EU, with
additional effects added for the rest of the world. There is a medium-term contraction of trade
between the UK and the EU, as the free trade links are reduced towards the standards under the
World Trade Organization. This leads to wider output gaps in the near term. Considerable
uncertainty on the part of consumers and firms worsen this. By the end-2018, the EU output gap is
0.4 percent, and that of the UK translates into 0.45 percent for the remaining countries block
(Figure VI.5).
The UK and EU financial sectors also see tighter lending conditions, which increase in magnitude
through 2017. The UK sector tightens more, as its role in mainland Europe is reduced because of
exiting the EU. The peak effects are in 2017, as it takes time for markets to understand and react to
the changes implied by Brexit. This is included in the EU and UK output gaps, and also weakens their
bilateral US$ exchange rate gaps.
There are direct trade spillovers on China from lower foreign demand and their real GDP falls by
0.1 percent as end-2017, while U.S. real GDP troughs around 0.25 percent at end-2016. Therefore
U.S. monetary policy is looser, and its short-term interest rate falls by about 1.1 percent by the start
of 2018 relative to the baseline to combat the resulting disinflationary pressures from the direct
negative spillovers from Europe and the safe-haven flows that appreciate the currency. The other
regions see more negative impacts on their output gaps, falling at a steady pace, reaching –0.4
percent by end-2018.
All the exchange rates realign across the world. Naturally, the regions at the epicenter (EU and UK)
depreciate. The US dollar and the Japanese yen both appreciate, as they are safe haven currencies.
Note that this will be especially stimulative, all else being equal, for Singapore, adding to
depreciation pressures on the Singapore dollar. China and the rest of emerging Asia depreciate,
complicating the behavior of the Singapore dollar, and increasing upward pressure on the
Singapore NEER.
We first consider the case where the MAS does not move the target NEER away from its baseline
case. We can better discern the effects of the foreign shocks buffeting Singapore, without the
mitigating impact of monetary policy (the red lines in Figure VI.6). Given the generally negative
impact of the spillovers and financial market effects, the NEER is depreciating in Singapore until the
end of 2018, by almost one percent.
Real GDP contracts by more than 0.4 percent, led by reduced demand for Singapore’s exports by
emerging Asia, China, and the U.S. (in that order) until the end of 2018. The path of Singapore’s
82

NEER generally works against this, driven by financial markets. Singapore’s bilateral exchange rates
against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen account for most the movement, with only a mild
depreciation against emerging Asia. This is a by-product of the “safe-haven” financial flows to the
U.S. plus Japan, to a lesser degree. Because the UIP condition drives the domestic financial market,
the short-term domestic interest rate rises in 2016, and as U.S. monetary policy loosens in 2017, it
retreats. The broad-based lower foreign demand and generally positive real interest rate is
disinflationary, despite the depreciation of the NEER.
As with other regions, we assume an additional increase in country risk – another reflection of safe
haven effects on financial markets. There is an additional increase in Singapore’s country risk
premium in the second half of 2016 of roughly 25 basis points that unwinds over the course of 2017.
Therefore, the negative interest rate effect is such that real GDP is 0.1 percentage points lower than
it would be otherwise.
The baseline policy case demonstrates the need for the MAS to act. As expected, they ease the
target NEER. In the short term, benefits from the depreciation of around 0.2 percent by end-2016 is
offset by the almost 0.9 percent increase in the short-term real interest rate. However, the MAS
continues to loosen over 2017 and into 2018, which markets anticipate, and the trough of real GDP
is less long lived in the baseline policy case—ending in 2017Q1 at 0.4 percent and quickly rising
above zero by mid-2018, instead of lingering below 0.2 until end-2018. The generalized depreciation
against the U.S. dollar across Singapore’s major trading partners forces the MAS to rely on its
bilateral U.S.$ exchange rate to achieve the target NEER. Therefore, the short-term interest rate is
about 50 basis points higher than under the baseline policy case. However, by mid-2017 the NEER
effect predominates over that of interest rates, with inflation recovering, as is real GDP. And because
households and firms are forward-looking, inflation never falls as far as under the baseline case,
reaching a trough of only –0.2 percent instead of –0.5 percent, in anticipation of the MAS’ defense
of its inflation objective.
In conclusion, monetary policy can do little to prevent the trough in real GDP in late 2016, but it can
definitely contribute to a speedier recovery. In the near term, there is general global turbulence in
exchange rate markets, exacerbating the negative effects from Singapore’s transmission mechanism
and its reliance on the UIP condition. Furthermore, there may be considerable short-term
uncertainty from the hard-to-quantify safe-haven effects, which are very important for a financial
center such as Singapore. Here, we have taken a relatively benign view. There could be further
unexpected volatility, not explored here, starting in late 2017 or 2018, when the exit negotiations for
the UK will presumably be much more advanced.

Appendix VII. Measuring the Fiscal Impulse1
Introduction. The stance of fiscal policy as measured by the fiscal impulse (FI) is central to the
policy discussion in this year’s Article IV consultation. Assessment of the fiscal impulse is
complicated by the presence of four pillars in Singapore’s public finances (the budgetary sector; CPF;
government investment agencies; and various special funds not consolidated into the budget)2, and
the presence of large accumulated reserves, which have reduced fiscal transparency and resulted in
the use of unique budget concepts (See IMF Country Report 15/299, paragraph 35).
Overview. This appendix presents staff’s FI methodology and preliminary estimates. Staff uses a
multiplier of 0.5 in line with the FAD Guidance Note. Also, this appendix explains the construction of
table 5 of the Staff Report (table of fiscal operations) following the Government Finance Statistics
Manual of 2001 (GFSM 2001) using official statistics. As usual, to facilitate comparison, the fiscal
table also reports the figures following the methodology and presentation used by the authorities in
the budget.
Fiscal Impulse. The authorities’ methodology is summarized in Table VII.1.

Staff Adjustments. Staff’s starting point is the methodology used by the authorities. On the
revenue side this is modified by adjusting for the effects of the business cycle on revenues. On the
expenditure side, staff makes adjustments to adhere to GFSM2001. Staff then computes the
modified cyclically adjusted balance as adjusted revenue minus expenditure excluding top ups;
the FI is defined as the change in the modified cyclically adjusted balance.
Operationalizing the FI measure. Staff starts with Table 04, Government Revenue 2016, and Table
05, Government Expenditure 2016. Operating revenue is as defined by the authorities in Table 04 but
excluding investment and interest income and the MAS contribution, account L00, and capital
receipts, account M00. To arrive at cyclically adjusted revenue, staff’s estimate of the output gap and
a unitary elasticity are used. For total expenditure, staff starts with “total outlays” from Table 05 and
subtracts “transfers from the consolidated revenue account” and “loans” (account 5600), which are
treated as financing items in GFSM2001.3 This means that staff also includes “land related
expenditure”, “expenses on land sales” and “expenses on investment” in total expenditure.
Staff Estimates of FI. Table VII.2 presents staff’s estimated FI for the last two fiscal years. The
attachment contains a longer time series of the FI using this methodology.

Comparison of FI 2016 estimates. The FI for
FY 2016/17 computed by staff is about 0.8 percent
of GDP, some 0.3 percentage points less than the
authorities’ 1.1 percent of GDP. Most of the
difference comes from the revenue side, with the
cyclical adjustment contributing about a third and
the rest possibly from different assumptions about
nominal GDP (Table VII.3).

Comparison of FI 2015 estimates. Note that staff’s methodology produces a very large fiscal
impulse of 3 percent of GDP in FY2015. Consequently, the FI for CY2016 ends up at 1.4 percent,
significantly larger than the 0.8 percentage points estimated by the authorities. For FY2015, the
difference of 1.2 percentage points with respect to the authorities’ impulse of 1.8 percent of GDP
comes from a larger increase in expenditure, as recorded by staff. There is some offsetting impact in
revenue, as staff measures a larger negative impulse, that is mostly explained by the cyclical
adjustment.

Appendix VIII. Assessing Banking Sector Resilience1
Background. The funding structure of banks in Singapore, predominantly reliant on nonbank
deposits, is resilient. In March 2016, deposits of nonbank customers accounted for most of the
funding of local banks and more than 75 percent of foreign banks’ funding. However, foreign banks
still continue to rely on wholesale funding, which can often be in foreign currencies. Since the
domestic wholesale-banking market is relatively shallow, most of the wholesale funding is
international. This puts Singapore in an elevated

Maturity Mismatches. The high proportion of long-term assets (> 6 months) funded by short-term
liabilities (< 6 months) in the domestic banking units (DBUs) can expose banking sector to interest
rate and (re)funding risk. While both assets and liabilities of the Asian currency units (ACUs) are
predominantly short term (under 6 months), there is maturity mismatch on the DBUs’ balance
sheets. However, banks remain resilient given their low leverage and large capital buffers.

Assessment. Preliminary analysis based on a broadbased measure of bank soundness suggests that
domestic banks are more robust than some of the foreign banks. A bank health index based on
capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and leverage show that despite fall in profitability
recently, domestic banks are healthier as compared to some of the foreign banks operating in
Singapore2. This is, however, only a relative assessment of banks overall health. More thorough
stress tests would be required to assess vulnerabilities of individual banks and of the overall sector.
Staff encourages the MAS to continue and enhance vigilant monitoring of branches and subsidiaries
of foreign banks.

2 A Bank Health Assessment Tool is used to compare the relative ranking of banks in Singapore. The largest foreign
banks operating as ‘full banks’ in Singapore are included in the sample.

U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization. Tighter liquidity and normalization of U.S. monetary policy
may retreat some of the bank funding from outside Asia (predominantly Europe and the U.S.). Post
the global financial crisis, a global search for yield and stronger growth prospects in emerging Asia
led to an inflow of bank funding from rest of the world to emerging Asia. With the markets heavily
reliant on foreign interbank funding, tightening of liquidity conditions could lead to a continued
reduction in inflow of funds to Singapore, creating liquidity gaps given growth expectations. Steps
should be taken to further develop and enhance the management of domestic wholesale funding
market.
MAS Monitoring. The MAS is closely monitoring the financial system including through an annual
industry-wide stress test as part of its financial stability mandate. The stress test conducted by the
MAS assumes realization of some of the risks under the G-RAM framework including significant
weakening of external economic environment, prolonged slowdown in China and aggressive
monetary policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Their results indicate that even though asset
quality would deteriorate under the stress scenario, banks would remain solvent, with their capital
adequacy ratios remaining above regulatory requirements. Furthermore, banking system is also
resilient to failure in their top Asian bank interbank counterparties amid challenges in the region,
reflecting the shock-absorbing capacity of the interbank market.

Appendix IX. Nonfinancial Corporate Sector Debt1
Nonfinancial corporate (NFC) debt in Singapore, which has risen since the global financial crisis, has
started to stabilize. However, amid an uncertain operating environment, including slowdown in China
and end of the commodity super cycle, corporate earnings have weakened. This appendix provides an
overview of securities issuance and loans in the NFC sector in Singapore and finds that: (i) NFC sector
relies heavily on banking sector loans, which are well diversified; (ii) a large proportion of NFC security
issuance is denominated in foreign currency subjecting them to currency risks; and (iii) a significant
proportion of debt securities, much higher than other advanced economies, are set to mature in the
near term exposing firms to refinancing and interest rate risk. We further analyze firm level data and
find that: (i) leverage in Singapore NFC is one of the highest in the region, with larger firms relying
more heavily on debt rather than equity; (ii) the distribution of leverage has remained broadly stable,
and after firms’ cash and short-term investments are taken into account, remains fairly benign and (iii)
while debt-at-risk rose between 2012–14, most listed firms will be able to service their debt in response
to earnings and interest rate shock, although debt-at-risk can rise substantially in tail-risk scenarios.
Debt. Nonfinancial corporate sector debt increased from under 80 percent of GDP in 2007 to
103 percent in 2015. Bank loans, which includes

GDP in 2015.
Banking Sector Loans. Nonfinancial corporates rely
heavily on bank loans. In March 2016, loans to NFCs
were 77 percent of banks’ total nonbank loans and
advances and was well diversified3. Loans to the
commodities-related sectors (agriculture, mining and
quarrying) constituted 6 percent of loans to NFCs;
building, construction and general commerce
dominate, accounted for about 47 percent, while
manufacturing; and transport, storage and
communications were 14 and 13 percent respectively.
While overall banking sector NPL ratios remain low,
the NPL ratio for the manufacturing sector has
increased against a backdrop of softening global
demand.

The locational banking statistics, published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), computes credit based
on residency principle. Therefore, bank credit to nonfinancial corporations here accounts for corporations registered
in Singapore. While the measure includes credit from both domestic and nonresident banks, it does not include
credit from other (nonbank) financial institutions.

This includes total nonbank loans extended by the banking sector to nonfinancial corporations, irrespective of
whether they are registered in Singapore or abroad. Sectoral breakdown of loans to corporations registered in
Singapore is not available however, we do not expect the decomposition to differ substantially.

Securities Issuance. Figure IX.1 compares securities issuances in Singapore to international NFC
issuance in advanced markets. Bond issuance in Singapore has increased from a low base reaching
about 5 percent of GDP, comparable to the entire group of advanced markets. This is in contrast to
other advanced markets in the Asia-Pacific region, where bond issuance dominates relative to equity
and syndicated loan issuance. Furthermore, unlike other advanced markets where local currency
issuance constitutes above 80 percent of total issuances, foreign currency debt issuances in
Singapore are more than 50 percent of total issuances. This may subject NFCs to currency risks,
particularly in the current uncertain and volatile environment. 12-month ahead maturing debt
securities are at about 23 percent of outstanding securities, nearly double than in other advanced
markets, and poses highest risk for NFCs currently. As the U.S. monetary policy starts tightening, this
may increase the debt burden of NFCs in Singapore.
Vulnerability Indicators
Firm-level balance sheet indicators point to some areas of vulnerability. Balance sheet ratios
and income statements provide valuable insight into the health of the NFC sector. We use the IMF’s
Corporate Vulnerability Utility (CVU) (Brooks and Ueda, 2011), which is based on publicly traded
firms listed in Thomson Reuters Worldscope database to assess NFC sector health and
vulnerabilities in Singapore. Figure IX.2 compares balance sheet indicators of NFC in Singapore to
selected Asian economies as well as sectoral analysis of key balance sheet concepts namely,
leverage, liquidity and profitability.
Leverage has risen. Corporate sector indebtedness and leverage have risen since the global
financial crisis but has started to stabilize, however earnings have weakened amid an uncertain
operating environment.



Leverage. The market-capitalization weighted debt-to-equity ratio in Singapore of about
80 percent is one of the highest in the region, much more than in Hong Kong SAR and
Korea. However, leverage has started to fall at the turn of the credit cycle. In particular,
growth in bank lending to corporates has slowed from a peak of 29 percent year-on-year in
September 2011 to under 5 percent in 2015Q4.



Liquidity. Liquidity is assessed through interest coverage ratio (ICR) that measures
corporates’ capacity to pay interest on outstanding debt. The market-capitalization weighted
ICR in Singapore is the lowest in the region, substantially lower than Hong Kong SAR and
Japan but more comparable to Korea and China. However, in absolute terms, the ICR, even
though declining, has remained healthy at above 25 as of end-2014.



Profitability. Overall corporate profitability has deteriorated due to adverse domestic and
external environment. The market-capitalization weighted return on equity (ROE) has
continued to decline approaching levels last seen in early-2000s after the bursting of the
dotcom bubble. With the exception of Japan, other economies in Asia are experiencing a
similar decline in profitability.

Sectoral View. We further take a closer look at balance sheet indicators on a sectoral level in
Singapore.



The market-capitalization weighted debt-to-equity ratio has been on a rising trend since the
global financial crisis (GFC). Leverage in the transport, communications, and electric gas
sector peaked in 2011, followed by deleveraging in recent years. Between 2013 and 2014,
uptick in leverage was predominantly seen in trade (wholesale and retail), manufacturing,
and mining sectors. These sectors have been directly hit by end of the commodity super
cycle and softening of global demand. Therefore, leverage is expected to fall going forward.



The market-capitalization weighted ICRs in manufacturing and mining industries have seen
biggest decline in recent years against a backdrop of falling commodity prices and
slowdown in global trade. The ICRs in mining industry became negative in 2014. While the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

ICR in the manufacturing sector was still healthy in 2014, it would further decline if interest
rates were to rise or the earnings outlook were to deteriorate.
There has been a broad-based decline in ROE in most sectors in Singapore. Prospects in
retail trade, which saw tremendous growth in profitability after the GFC, have fallen
significantly. In trade-related sectors, notably manufacturing, ROEs have also dipped in light
of slow global growth.



Assessment of NFC Balance Sheet: Stress Test
In the previous section, we assessed the balance sheet in the NFC sector by using the marketcapitalization weighted leverage, returns and the ICR. In this section, we focus on debt-at-risk as the
key indicator measuring total indebtedness of firms with relatively low debt servicing capacity, with
debt servicing capacity measured by the ICR. The IMF’s Corporate Stress-testing Exercise considers
debt to be at risk when the ICR is below 1.5.
Cross-Firm Distribution of Leverage. In addition to evaluating debt-at-risk, here we also focus on
changes in the cross-firm distribution of leverage through time, which is preferable to looking only
at changes in averages. There are signs of increase in leverage overtime. As discussed earlier, the
debt-to-equity ratio in Singapore is high with majority of firms having debt-to-equity ratio greater
than 20. Furthermore, very high levels of leverage (debt-to-equity of above 100) has become more
common since 2010. However, net debt-to-earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is more
reasonable suggesting ample cash reserves and short-term investments for NFCs in Singapore4.

Larger firms, with better access to credit markets, are more leveraged than smaller firms. We
define ‘large firms’ as those in the top 25th percentile of total assets and the remainder as ‘small
firms’. Small firms in Singapore tend to have lower leverage, with more than 50 percent of them
having a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 20. Furthermore, all firms with negative equity are small
firms, which have very low debt levels and are not systemically important. Similarly, negative EBIT is
more common among smaller firms. Big firms, where most of NFC debt is concentrated, tend to
have a higher leverage and thus need to be regularly monitored as they can have systemic
implications.

Net debt is defined as total debt minus cash and equivalents (short term liquid investments).

Approach. In order to quantify corporate sector vulnerabilities, we explore the sensitivity of debt-atrisk to earning and interest rate shocks. The ICR measures the debt capacity for a firm such that
firms with an ICR below 1.5 are classified as distressed and called “firms-at-risk”. Debt-at-risk is then
defined as the share of total corporate debt associated with firms at risk. We explore how the share
of debt-at-risk changes when firms are subject to interest rate or profit shocks. Firm-level data are
used to explore the impact of shocks to interest rates and profits. The sample consists of publiclylisted NFCs as included in the Thomson Reuters Worldscope database for the period 2007–2014.5
Interest rate shock. In scenario 1, interest costs are expected to increase by 25 percent. In scenarios
2 and 3, downside tail-risk is considered whereby interest rates are assumed to increase by 200 and
300 basis points respectively. The baseline interest rate is defined as interest expense relative to
total debt in the current year. We then apply a tail-risk interest rate shock to the baseline rate.
Hence, interest expenses in the shock scenario 2 and 3 are computed as:

Results. Figure IX.3 shows that debt-at-risk and firm-at-risk have risen in recent years. In response
to a stress scenario of a 25 percent increase in interest costs and a 25 percent decline in EBIT, firmsat-risk would increase from 31 to 36 percent of all corporates, and their share of debt-at-risk would
increase from 20 to 35 percent. However, taking cash reserves into account, the total debt-at-risk
would fall to 27 percent and most listed firms would still be able to service their debts. Debt-at-risk
and firms-at-risk rise substantially in the face of tail-risk shocks, increasing from 20 percent, affecting
31 percent of firms, to 61 percent of total debt and 43 percent of firms in the most extreme
scenario.

Appendix X. Developments in FinTech1
The Future Economy. Growth through factor accumulation has reached its limits in Singapore given
physical limitations, an aging population, and limits to immigration. Moreover, as in other advanced
economies, prospects for private investment remain clouded: the recovery from the global financial
crisis (GFC) has been slow, shallow and uneven (the “new mediocre”). Global manufacturing
overcapacity and the drag from the end of the global commodity super cycle add to business
uncertainty. Investment may also be held down by the generally capital-saving nature of recent
technological changes: new information technologies utilize the internet and hand-held devices to
cut time and costs and enable better matching of ultimate sellers with ultimate buyers, including
through e-commerce, ride and apartment sharing, peer-to-peer lending and other emerging
financial technologies. These technologies, FinTech among them, require investments in internetbased information technology platforms but either reduce the usefulness of existing “bricks and
mortar” capital (e.g., retail space in malls) or raise its capacity utilization (cars, apartments). Either
way, they tend to reduce the need for new private investment in traditional capital assets.
Opportunities for Singapore. While potentially disruptive, these new technologies also hold
special promise for Singapore, given the important role of the financial sector in the economy
(Figure 3), the scarcity of land and space in the city state, a high level of human capital and
financialization, and the premium placed on entrepreneurship and innovation. The authorities are
focusing their efforts to turn Singapore into a global innovation hub. Several schemes have been
introduced to foster innovation, including through incentives to businesses to automate, innovate,
and internationalize, and a high-level Committee on the Future Economy has been convened and will
announce its priorities by end-2016. The government is also providing extensive support of
investments in human capital, most notably through SkillsFuture, a program that covers educational
expenses in support of on-the-job education and training.
Financial Technology, also known as FinTech, refers to new solutions, which demonstrate an
incremental or radical and disruptive innovation in development of applications, processes, products
or business models in the financial services industry. Since 2010, more than US$50 billion has been
invested in almost 2,500 companies worldwide as FinTech innovations redefine the way in which we
store, save, borrow, invest, move, spend and protect money.
Scope. FinTech encompasses a wide array of business processes including payments, investments,
lending, insurance, wealth management, digital currency and big-data analytics. This takes the form
of Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Business-to-Business (B2B), or Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
interaction. Citi (2016)2 finds that B2C dominates with over 70 percent of the FinTech investments to
date in the personal/SME business segments. Mobility of technology (e.g., smartphones), ideas (e.g.,
through online platforms) and payments has revolutionized information and content delivery
wherein B2C FinTech solutions can win new clients by providing better and more efficient services.

Disruptive Potential. By business area, payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is most active.
Less capital-intensive activities – such as online payment – are more likely to be disrupted by
FinTech. However, only companies that are innovative (rather than just providing cheaper services)
are likely to have a sustainable competitive advantage. As the FinTech space is maturing, innovators
are seeking to disrupt and enhance elements along the financial services value chain. Insurance, for
example, is rapidly growing with investment into firms with InsurTech propositions more than
tripling from 2014 to 2015 (Accenture, 2016).3 Another area is personal finance management, where
companies like Wealthfront have propelled algorithmic asset management and thus reduced the
need for face-to-face wealth advisors. Other new initiatives include Crowdfunding, which allows
people to raise funds via the internet. A particularly promising area of FinTech is big data and data
collection involving monumental changes in analytics, data storage, data-driven-marketing and
cloud computing. Finally, digital currencies, like Bitcoins, have attracted much interest and the
technology behind it—block chain or the distributed ledger system—can be used elsewhere to
maintain a decentralized record.
Financial Inclusion. FinTech, via limited build-up costs and fast and efficient processing and
delivery of service, can achieve financial inclusion by expanding services to underserved regions.
According to World Bank Global Findex (2014), there are 2 billion unbanked or underbanked people
in the world, mainly, but not solely, in developing countries in Africa and Asia. FinTech solutions
such as mobile money (i.e., monetary transaction executed with a mobile phone), even though in its
nascent stage, is gaining traction in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where consumers have lower
access to traditional bank channels than high-income countries. Furthermore, FinTech solutions, for
example, P2P lending, are also supporting demand of credit constrained SMEs. Due to lower
operating costs, they are able to offer credit at lower rates of interest.

Growing Investment in FinTech. The U.S., China, the U.K. and Sweden lead private investment in
Global FinTech companies. Asia-Pacific is catching up, with Fintech investment in the region more
than quadrupling in 2015 to US$4.3 billion, making it the second biggest region for FinTech after
North America. In the region, China has the lion’s share of investment, accounting for 45 percent in
2015. India makes up 38 percent and is growing fast. Three locations, working to create clusters of
start-up activity, are especially relevant in connection with FinTech. The first, New York City,4 kickedoff the trend in 2010 by focusing on financial services as an opportunity for local start-ups. London
followed suit in 2013 by launching numerous interconnected initiatives aimed at creating a FinTech
ecosystem supported by the U.K. government.5 Finally, Singapore, which started more recently in
2015, has seen a very ambitious support from the government, with the MAS setting up the FinTech
and Innovation Group and a venture fund to support start-ups.6
Prospects for Singaporean FinTech. As one of the gateways of the Asian financial market,
Singapore represents an attractive spot in the region for growth of FinTech. The Asia-Pacific region
has tremendous untapped potential in finance with a very significant underserved market. The MAS
aims at developing a parsimonious ecosystem bringing together key players – the technology
players, finance players, start-ups, and both global and local Singapore players as well as covering
broad range of segments – credit, savings, investing, payments, insurance, big data, block chains
and distributed ledgers etc. The MAS envisions developing a smart financial center through
initiatives such as a Financial Sector Technology and Innovation (FSTI) scheme to provide financial
support (S$225 million over 5 years), aiding the development of efficient digital payment systems,
an interactive technology-enabled regulatory reporting system (RegTech), supporting a FinTech
ecosystem and building skills and competencies in technology through the financial sector’s
SkillsFuture drive.7

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. The average real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by 2 percent between in 2015 with respect
to 2014. This modest depreciation followed a secular appreciation of the exchange rate which amounted to 29 percent
appreciation in REER terms between 2004 and 2013. Since end 2015 the NEER has depreciated by 2 percent.
Assessment. While non-standard factors make a quantitative assessment difficult, staff assesses that the real exchange
rate is around 6 to 18 percent weaker than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. This estimate
is drawn from the CA assessment and relies on a semi-elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER of about 0.5, consistent
with Singapore’s high level of openness. This assessment is subject to a wide range of uncertainty reflecting the
uncertainty in the underlying CA assessment and the semi-elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER.
Background. Singapore has a fully open capital account. The financial account deficit tends to co-move with the global
financial cycle. It reflects in part reinvestment abroad of income from the foreign assets of the official sector. Financial
flows also encompass sizable net inward FDI and smaller but more volatile net bank-related flows. 7/ Inflows on account
of “Other Investment, liabilities,” which averaged US$50 billion per annum during the first five years after the global
financial crisis turned negative in 2015 (–US$4 billion). In all, reflecting international investors’ reassessment of risk across
regions and asset classes and the resulting unwinding of carry trades, the capital and financial accounts in 2015 recorded
the largest net outflow in at least 30 years, both in absolute terms and relative to Singapore’s GDP. As a trade and
financial center in Asia, negative sentiment in emerging and low income countries in the region can affect Singapore
significantly
Assessment. The financial account is likely to remain in deficit as long as the trade surplus is likely to remain large.
Background. With the NEER as the intermediate monetary policy target, intervention is undertaken to achieve inflation
and output targets. Singapore’s official reserves declined by 9 percent (25 billion USD) in 2014 and 2015, reflecting also
valuation changes. As a financial center, prudential motives call for a large NIIP buffer, also in the form of reserves.
Assessment. At end 2015, official reserves covered about 26 percent of non FDI short-term external debt. However,
reserves are far in excess of thresholds for other adequacy metrics. 8/ While non-standard factors warrant generous
reserve buffers, current levels appear adequate and there is no case for further accumulation for precautionary purposes.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:

Appendix XI. External Sector Report

Current
account

Singapore
Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) stood at 210 percent of GDP at the end of 2015, about
13 percent higher than in 2014, driven by outflows in 2015. It stands at the level of 2010, but is significantly lower than the
pre-GFC peak of 256 percent of GDP in 2006. Current account and growth projections imply that the NIIP to GDP ratio is
likely to rise substantially over the medium term. 1/
Assessment. The external balance sheet is not a major source of risk. Potential vulnerabilities posed by the large gross
non-FDI liabilities (438 percent of GDP at the end of 2015)—predominantly cross-border deposit taking by foreign bank
branches—are mitigated by banks’ large short-term external assets and the authorities’ close monitoring of banks’
liquidity risk profiles. Singapore also has large official reserves and other official liquid assets. 2/
Background. The large current account (CA) surplus of 19.8 percent of GDP in 2015, up by 2.3 percent of GDP relative to
2014, reflects a strong goods balance that is somewhat offset by remittance outflows and a negative income balance. 3/
The recent oil price decline caused the oil trade deficit to narrow by 3.7 percentage points of GDP, to 1.7 percent of GDP
in 2015. 4/ Amid a regional trade slowdown, weaker external demand and buoyant private and public consumption
partially offset the resulting CA improvement. The recent easing of monetary policy through a slightly lower trend
appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) band is likely to have had a limited positive effect on the
current account.5/ Structural factors and policies that boost the saving rate such as financial center status, limited social
safety nets, high income inequality and the rapid pace of aging combined with a defined-contribution pension scheme are
the main drivers of Singapore’s strong external position. Fiscal policy in recent years has increased social spending which
should contribute to a lower CA surplus.
Assessment. Singapore is a small, very open economy that has a large positive NIIP, very high per capita income and is
aging at a very high speed. Such non-standard factors make a quantitative assessment of its CA subject to a wide range of
uncertainty. Considering a range of estimates (based on EBA and other models) staff assesses the 2015 CA as substantially
stronger than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, by 3 to 9 percent of GDP. 6/

1/ Valuation changes have been an important driver of changes in the NIIP, given the large gross assets and liabilities.
2/ Singapore’s official reserves amounted to about 87 percent of GDP in 2015.
3/ Singapore has a negative income balance despite its large and positive NIIP position. This reflects the lower rate of return earned on its foreign assets relative
to the return paid on its foreign liabilities. The lower return on foreign assets may reflect the fact that the composition of Singapore’s assets is tilted toward safer
assets which yield lower returns.
4/ Singapore is a net oil importer, with a net oil trade deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2015. The oil trade deficit would be smaller if one takes into account the
high imported petroleum product content in Singapore’s exports of petrochemicals and other oil intensive products and services like water transportation. In
addition, Singapore has some sectors that are closely linked to investment in the oil sectors such as production of oil rigs. The decline in investment in the oil
sector is expected to reduce Singapore’s exports of these products, in particular if the oil price decline is sustained.
5/ The monetary policy easing in 2015 involved two slight declines in the trend appreciation of the NEER band from an estimated 2 percent to less than 1 percent
per annum, and was motivated by the deceleration of inflation amid a closing output gap and weak external demand.
6/ Non-standard factors make quantitative assessment of Singapore’s external position difficult and subject to significant uncertainty. Singapore is not in the
sample used to estimate the EBA models because it is an outlier along several dimensions (e.g. the NFA position, per capita income, fiscal balance and the aging
speed) and nonlinearities in their impacts on the CA would not be captured in the EBA framework. That said, the EBA CA framework, appropriately adjusted for
the special characteristics of Singapore, can still be informative. Applying the EBA coefficients to Singapore suggests that the CA surplus is mainly explained by
the high level of productivity, the large fiscal surplus, a dummy regressor for status as a financial center, and its large NFA position. The EBA-estimated CA gap is
about 6.4 percent of GDP (relative to a cyclically-adjusted level of the CA of about 22 percent of GDP in 2015 and a norm of 15.6). Of that, about 0.75 percentage
points of GDP is identified as policy gaps (driven by the fiscal balance and public spending on health care) and the remaining 5.7 percentage points of GDP are
the residual. However, that estimated CA surplus norm could be overstated, in particular if the high NFA level is interpreted as a byproduct of past excessive
surpluses. The CA gap increased by 1 percentage point with respect to last year’s assessment. The norm increased by 3 percentage points driven mostly by the
contribution of terms of trade (1.5 percentage points) and domestic credit (0.6). The EBA-Lite model gives a very similar assessment.
7/ The latter is the result of considerably larger gross inflows and outflows.
8/ The reserves-to-GDP ratio is also larger than in most other financial centers, but this may reflect in part that most other financial centers are located in reservecurrency countries or currency unions.

Appendix XII. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is used
to assess Singapore’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt structure.
Macro-Fiscal Assumptions. Growth is projected at 1.7 percent in 2016, recovering to 2.2 percent
in 2017. Growth is projected at 2.6 percent in the medium term. In staff’s baseline projections,
central government surplus decreases from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to 1.5 percent in 2021. The
projected fiscal path is consistent with the authorities’ targets and is supported by policy reforms
announced in recent budgets.
Data Coverage. Consistent with the data on government debt reported by the authorities, the fiscal
assumptions in this DSA are based on the general government debt.
Choice of Framework. Singapore’s high level of government assets calls for using the basic
framework. Government’s gross debt increased sharply in 2009, by about 10 percent of GDP,
reflecting sizable discretionary fiscal stimulus, declining real and nominal growth and a large fall in
world trade. Although growth rebounded sharply and the overall fiscal balance recovered, the debt
to GDP ratio remained broadly stable. Staff projections have debt falling, reaching pre-global
financial crisis levels by 2021.
Debt is Projected to Fall. Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease to
below 90 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs (GFN) are expected to remain at about 10 percent
in the medium term.
A high level of financial assets mitigates the risks associated with public debt. The gross government
debt is high at about 100 percent of GDP, but it includes about 65 percent of GDP of debt to the
Central Provident Fund (CPF), a defined contribution fully funded pension scheme that requires
Singaporeans to contribute to individual accounts. CPF invests mostly in public bonds, 95 percent,
and the government invests the proceeds through Temasek and the Government Investment
Corporation (GIC). Most of the investments are held abroad. Although GIC does not report assets,
Temasek has assets of about 70 percent of GDP. Gross financial assets of the government are about
200 percent of GDP.

Exchange Arrangement
Singapore’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” The de jure exchange
rate arrangement is “other managed.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) monitors its
value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to maintain this value
within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Singapore has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange rate system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security,
which have been notified to the Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Executive Board
decision 144-(52/51). Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore dollar credit facilities to, and
bond and equity issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained
by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and hedge
funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance to
finance activities outside Singapore must be swapped or converted into foreign currency upon
draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit facilities in

excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if there is reason to believe that the
Singapore-dollar proceeds may be used for Singapore-dollar currency speculation. In a bid to
contain a real estate price bubble, Singapore imposed additional stamp duties on purchases by
foreigners and corporate entities of residential properties in Singapore.
Article IV Consultation
Singapore is on the 12˗month consultation cycle. The 2015 Article IV consultation discussions were
held during April 29–May 12, 2015; the Executive Board concluded the consultation on July 15, 2015
(IMF Country Report No. 15/199).
FSAP Participation
The FSAP Update involved two missions: May 15−22, 2013 and July 25–August 7, 2013. The findings
were presented in the Financial System Sustainability Assessment (IMF Country Report No. 13/325).
Technical Assistance: None.
Resident Representative: Mr. Geoffrey Heenan has been posted in Singapore since January 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to
expand the range of publicly available data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would
enhance the basis for macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external, monetary and fiscal
areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data
sources and methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted
in 2014, resulting in lower statistical discrepancies. DOS has completed the rebasing of Singapore’s
national accounts to reference year 2010.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base
year 2014. The CPI is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and
composition of goods and services consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published
nor provided to the Fund. The government publishes annually partial information on the interest and
dividends on these assets. Debt service payments on domestic debt made from the extra budgetary
Government Securities Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the
consolidated public sector are not published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report
forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting
data to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: In February 2012, the DOS concluded the migration of the balance of
payments accounts to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6). The main changes relative to the 5th edition include: reclassification of repairs on
goods and processing fees to services (from goods); reclassification of merchanting to goods (from
services); and treating banks’ Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as residents (previously they were regarded
as nonresidents, and hence their transactions were excluded from the balance of payments). Data on
Singapore’s international investment position (IIP) is not provided on a disaggregated sectoral basis
as suggested by the BPM6. The authorities have completed revising the IIP data to include all foreign
assets held by Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation. The associated flows were already
included in the balance of payments data.
Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These
include the coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness of the data; and the dissemination of
advance release calendars; quarterly
certification of the metadata posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board;
and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF team for a constructive 2016
Article IV Consultation.
2

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
The pace of expansion in the global economy has remained subdued, with some
unevenness and hesitancy in growth across regions. Against this external backdrop, the
Singapore economy has proceeded along a modest growth path, expanding on average by
2.2% year-on-year in H1 2016. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised
(SAAR) basis, GDP growth averaged 0.5% over the first two quarters of the year, down from
the 4.3% in the last two quarters of 2015. This downshift in momentum mainly reflected an
easing of activity within financial services and the wholesale trade sector alongside a general
slowdown in regional trade flows. Nonetheless, the drag was partly offset by some pickup in
the manufacturing sector, underpinned by tentative recoveries in the pharmaceuticals and
electronics segments.
2.2
In the coming quarters, global growth is likely to remain lacklustre, given heightened
macroeconomic uncertainty in Europe after Brexit and subdued trade in the Asian region.
This will weigh on the performance of the trade-related industries as well as the sentimentsensitive segments within the financial services sector. Nevertheless, the domestic-oriented
sectors should stay resilient, with support from healthcare and education spending, as well as
public infrastructure construction. At this stage, the Singapore economy should continue to
expand at a modest pace for the rest of the year, with GDP growth projected to come in at 1–
3% for the whole of 2016.
2.3
Underlying inflation has begun to pick up gradually, due to a smaller decline in the
prices of oil-related items, as well as the dissipation of disinflationary impulses from budgetary
and other one-off measures. MAS Core Inflation, which excludes the cost of private road
transport and accommodation, troughed at 0.2% y-o-y in Q4 2015 and has since risen to 1%
in Q2 2016. Notwithstanding the rise in core inflation, CPI-All Items inflation
fell to −0.9% in Q2 compared to −0.7% in Q4 2015, largely reflecting steeper year-on-year
declines in the cost of private road transport due to a higher base in the same period last year.
2.4
External and domestic price pressures are expected to be benign, reflecting weak
global demand and reduced tightness in the domestic labour market. While MAS Core
Inflation is projected to continue on a moderate uptrend for the rest of 2016, this will mostly be
on account of base effects arising from budget-related subsidies and sharp reductions in the
price of oil-related items last year, rather than the outcome of demand-induced price

pressures. For 2016, MAS Core Inflation is projected to average around 1%. Meanwhile,
CPI-All Items inflation has likely troughed in Q2, and is expected to rise in the coming
months. For the year as a whole, it is forecast to come in at -1.0–0.0%.
3

Macroeconomic Policy Mix

3.1
Against this challenging cyclical backdrop and ongoing structural changes, an optimal
and sustainable macropolicy response is called for. Accordingly, Singapore’s approach has
been to rely on a complementary mix of macroeconomic instruments as well as structural reform
measures that are consistent with cyclical developments, and which facilitate the longer-term
restructuring of the economy. In this regard, an over-reliance on any one policy instrument is
avoided.
Monetary Policy
3.2
Singapore’s monetary policy had been eased in a calibrated manner since January
2015, in line with the changing macroeconomic environment. In April 2016, MAS set the
S$NEER policy band to a zero percent rate of appreciation. This was not a policy to
depreciate the domestic currency, but only to remove the modest and gradual appreciation
path of the S$NEER policy band. The latest monetary policy move took into account the
assessment that Singapore’s GDP growth would be more modest than previously envisaged,
and hence MAS Core Inflation would pick up more gradually over the course of 2016 than
earlier anticipated, and likely keep to just below two percent on average over the medium
term.
3.3
The sequence of measured monetary policy shifts over the past 18 months has been
validated by growing evidence of benign underlying inflation pressures for longer.
Cumulatively, these policy calibrations are attuned to internal balance considerations, and
will help to keep the level of real GDP close to its potential in 2016–17 and ensure price
stability over the medium term. Although the shock result of the UK referendum has imparted
greater uncertainty to the global economy, Singapore’s growth and inflation outlook still fall
within expectations at this juncture. MAS’ current policy stance thus remains appropriate, as
acknowledged by Staff, and the exchange rate policy framework is sufficiently flexible to
accommodate heightened financial market volatility arising from Brexit.
3.4
MAS appreciates the importance of timely and clear communication on monetary
policy. MAS will continue to communicate the implications of shocks for inflation and the
policy stance through Monetary Policy Statements, the Macroeconomic Review, and other
timely pronouncements, as needed. The frequency of shocks in the post-GFC years has
certainly increased, and a judicious approach towards policy formulation and communication is
necessary. It is neither feasible nor optimal to pre-emptively shape market expectations in the
face of every shock or to over-commit to a pre-set future path of inflation and monetary policy.
Indeed, Singapore’s experience has been that inflation can be volatile from month to month,
due to various temporary factors. MAS has and will continue to enhance its monetary policy

transparency initiatives over time, including in terms of the information it provides on the
evolving path of key macroeconomic variables. Nonetheless, a robust communication approach
will need to take into account the particular characteristics of our policy framework.
Fiscal Policy
3.5
Budget 2016 was expansionary, providing a fiscal impulse of slightly over one percent
of GDP for the current financial year. This is in addition to the impulse that will be carried
over from the past three years’ Budget measures, including cost-saving measures for firms and
transfers to households, which provide support to overall economic activity. Similarly, Budget
2016 provided targeted near-term relief to households and small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) facing pressures from the economic downturn and restructuring. At the same time, it
built on the longer-term themes of the previous Budgets to restructure the economy in line
with Singapore’s evolving comparative advantage and to foster a more caring and inclusive
society.
3.6
For households, relief was provided in the form of one-off GST vouchers and Service
and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates. Recognising the impact of external economic
weakness and restructuring on businesses and workers, the Budget introduced a suite of
measures aimed at relieving the cash flow of SMEs. For instance, the corporate income tax
rebate was raised from 30% of tax payable to 50%, for Years of Assessment (YA) 2016 and
2017, capped at $20,000 per YA. The scheduled hike in the foreign worker levy for the
Marine and Process sectors was also deferred by another year in view of the challenges
facing the oil-and-gas sector. To mitigate credit constraints amid the turning of the credit
cycle, the new SME Working Capital Loan was introduced to ensure that viable SMEs have
continued access to funding.
3.7
The pre-committed fiscal impulse proposed in the Staff Report assumes a static
output gap projection, which does not appear to fully recognise the rapidly evolving external
and domestic economic conditions, as well as cost developments. Rather than follow a precommitted fiscal (impulse) rule, the government takes an approach that is contingent on
developments as they evolve, providing appropriate support as specific points of vulnerability
emerge. The government is keenly aware of the downside risks to growth and stands ready to
inject further fiscal support as necessary. Singapore has the means to implement targeted budget
measures with minimal lag. For instance, in view of the negative impact of the downturn in oil
and commodity markets on the marine and offshore sector, the authorities were able to provide
swift support to the sector by deferring levy increases for work permit holders. Instead of
broadly aiming to boost the economy with a fixed amount of stimulus, the government is more
concerned about designing a package that is well-suited to evolving economic circumstances.
With respect to Staff’s suggestion to generate more healthcare and transport infrastructure
investments for short-term stimulus, the authorities note that such investments have already
been stepped up, and that any decision to invest should be anchored to the need and
viability of maintaining and operating these infrastructures in the future.

3.8
Singapore’s fiscal rules effectively require the budget to be balanced over a term of
government. It has the merit of introducing fiscal discipline to the decisions of each term of
Government. Such rules do not imply that the medium-term budget stance is by design out of
sync with business cycles, or that the rules constrain the government from acting countercyclically. It has been clearly demonstrated during the Global Financial Crisis that the
government was able to respond swiftly when the need arose.
3.9
Overall, the expansionary fiscal policy stance this year, together with the more
accommodative monetary policy setting, constitute a complementary macroeconomic mix to
ensure medium-term price stability and sustainable growth.

Addressing Medium-term Challenges

4.1
Since 2010, Budget measures have kept in step with the different phases of economic
restructuring. The latest set of measures in Budget 2016 built on these early efforts,
underscoring the labour and land resource constraints confronting business, despite the cyclical
downturn. It also marked a significant milestone in Singapore’s restructuring journey, as the
focus shifted from dealing with economy-wide challenges, towards taking a sector-based
approach to build up firms’ capabilities to leverage on new growth opportunities. The $4.5
billion Industry Transformation Programme (ITP), in particular, was designed to help firms
and industries to move into the next phase of restructuring. ITP encompassed many different
schemes to raise both human and intellectual capital. For instance, the Automation Support
Package and the National Robotics Programme will help companies scale up automation and
support the development and deployment of robots. Various financing and tax incentives
under the ITP will also encourage SMEs to increase scale through mergers and acquisitions,
and to internationalise.
4.2
The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) was set up in October 2015 to develop
economic strategies that will position Singapore well for growth in the future. It will build on
and update the Report of the Economic Strategies Committee of 2010, taking into account
the new challenges and opportunities facing Singapore amid rapid changes in the global
environment, and slower labour force growth. The CFE will address areas crucial to
Singapore’s economic development, including identifying and designing growth strategies for
priority clusters, recommending strategies to create and re-design jobs, and equipping
Singaporeans with the skillsets needed for the future.
4.3
Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise plan over 2016 to 2020 (RIE2020),
Singapore will set aside $19 billion to support research, innovation and enterprise activities to
take the country to the next stage of development. This is an 18% increase in budget as
compared to RIE2015, the preceding 5-year plan. 45% of the RIE2020 budget will be
committed to support four strategic domains where Singapore has competitive advantages
and/or important national needs. These are Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME),
Health and Biomedical Sciences (HBMS), Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS), and
Services and Digital Economy (SDE). The four domains will be supported by cross-cutting

efforts to ensure excellent science, a strong pipeline of skilled power, translation of research
into products and services, and nurturing of high-tech start-ups.

Financial Sector Developments

5.1
The authorities welcome the Staff’s acknowledgement of Singapore’s high regulatory
and supervisory standards. Despite a recent rise in credit risks, Singapore’s banking system
remains well capitalized with adequate provisions. Macro-prudential policies have contributed
to a modest correction in property prices and signs of a soft landing. While household and
corporate leverage rose in the post-GFC period, the recent moderation of credit growth—
aided in part by macroprudential measures—has helped contain household and corporate
indebtedness. Household and corporate balance sheets remain resilient and stress tests
indicate debt servicing remains manageable in the event of adverse shocks. The authorities
will continue to monitor developments in credit and asset markets, and adjust macroprudential tools to maintain financial stability.

Final Remarks

6.1
The external economic environment is fraught with uncertainty and downside risks as
also recognised in the IMF’s July 2016 WEO Update. The authorities will continue to
carefully monitor developments and their impact on the Singapore economy. In the event of a
negative shock, the authorities have the wherewithal to respond in a timely and appropriate
manner to provide the necessary support to the economy and ensure macroeconomic and
financial stability.
6.2
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable to the
publication of the Staff Report associated with the 2016 Article IV Consultation and will be
releasing the Buff Statement at the same time.
