The 2005 Article IV consultation and SMP discussions took place in Yaoundé during
December 3–18, 2004 and January 28–February 12, 2005.

•

Discussions were held with the Ministers of Finance and Planning in early December 2004, and
continued after the cabinet reshuffle and ministerial reorganization of December 8, 2004 with
the new Minister of Economy and Finance and other senior government officials. The mission
also met with the new Prime Minister, the Secretary General at the Presidency, the Governor
and the National Director of the regional Central Bank (BEAC), and representatives of the
business and donor communities. Mr. Menye, advisor to the Executive Director for Cameroon,
participated in the policy meetings.

•

The staff team consisted of Ms. Ross (head), Messrs. Cossé and Weisfeld (all AFR),
Ms. Bronchi (FAD) and Ms. Redifer (PDR). Mr. Nord (AFR), the head of the ex-post
assessment (EPA) team, was in Yaoundé on December 3–5, 2004 for discussions on the draft
EPA report. Mr. Bouley (FAD) joined the team during December 14-18, 2004 to provide
technical advice on the functioning of the treasury.

•

The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was completed on September 18, 2002.
On that occasion, Executive Directors underscored a need for (i) consolidating the fiscal
position by strengthening non-oil revenue, containing non-priority spending, and improving
fiscal management; and (ii) diversifying the economy and promoting private investment by
speeding up structural reform and improving governance. Directors expressed concern about
the slow use of HIPC resources.

•

On December 17, 2003, the Executive Board concluded the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement approved in 2000. As Cameroon’s policy performance had changed only little
over the preceding 15 months, Directors’ comments were similar to those made at the
completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation.

•

No further reviews under the PRGF arrangement could be completed because of a
deterioration of the public finances. The arrangement lapsed in December 2004. The
authorities now plan to build a track record of policy implementation through a staff-monitored
program for 2005.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Growth, inflation, and external sector performance through 2004 has been good.
Cameroon’s nonoil economy is relatively diversified and should continue to strengthen if
helped by infrastructure improvements. Tangible progress has been made in the health and
education sectors, and a number of social indicators have improved significantly.
Prospects for sustainable growth and poverty reduction are, however, hampered by
weak fiscal performance and important impediments to private sector growth. The
deterioration in fiscal performance and related weaknesses in fiscal management could, in the
longer term, threaten macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Moreover, sustainable
private sector growth requires the authorities to address inadequate infrastructure, poor
service delivery from troubled state enterprises, an investment climate overshadowed by poor
governance, and low levels of financial intermediation.
Fiscal performance weakened considerably, particularly nonoil revenue, over the past
two years. Budget pressures have been accommodated by an increase in domestic arrears
and extra-budgetary spending. The financial situation of large public enterprises worsened
considerably, adding to actual and contingent fiscal liabilities. The 2000 PRGF arrangement
could not be completed due to weak fiscal performance.
The authorities intend to build a track record of policy implementation through a staffmonitored program (SMP) for 2005. The design of the SMP (see Letter of Intent and
Memorandum of Policies in Appendix I) reflects the main conclusions of the Ex-Post
Assessment. Initial steps by the government formed in December 2004 have been
encouraging. Successful implementation of the SMP and a successor PRGF arrangement
would allow for the possibility of reaching the HIPC completion point in 2006.
Improving fiscal performance and financial management is a key challenge. To restore
the fiscal position, the authorities have adopted an ambitious 2005 fiscal program in their
SMP. It seeks to mobilize nonoil revenue in the context of the secular decline in oil output,
and to contain noninterest current expenditure. Public investment, especially funded through
HIPC resources, should increase significantly. Key loss-making public enterprises will be
restructured and/or privatized.
Removing impediments for private sector growth is essential to promote sustainable
growth and poverty reduction. Infrastructure improvements and measures to strengthen the
legal system and governance more generally aim to enhance the business climate and
investor confidence. The staff welcomes the authorities’ emphasis in their SMP on
strengthening financial management and enhancing transparency, particularly in the oil
sector. The authorities intend to adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic policy performance deteriorated against the backdrop of a stable
political environment since the last Article IV consultation. Presidential elections were
held in early October 2004, and President Biya, in power since 1982, was reelected for a
seven-year term. A cabinet restructuring in early December merged the Ministries of
Economy and Finance, reversing their separation in 2002/03. The policy recommendations
made during the last Article IV discussions in 2002 remain valid, as little progress has been
made. In particular, due to the lack of fiscal consolidation, the 2000 PRGF arrangement
lapsed a year after the fourth and last review was completed in December 2003. The
authorities now plan to build a track record of policy implementation through a staffmonitored program (SMP) for 2005 (see Appendix I for the Letter of Intent and
Memorandum of Policies). The SMP reflects the main findings of the Ex-Post Assessment
(www.imf.org). Successful policy implementation under the SMP and a successor PRGF
arrangement as well as further progress on the HIPC completion point triggers would allow
for the possibility of reaching the HIPC completion point in 2006.
2.
Growth, inflation and external sector performance through 2004 has been good.
However, prospects for sustainable growth and poverty reduction are hampered by weak
fiscal performance and public financial management, which in the longer term could threaten
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, and by impediments to sustained private
sector growth, including inadequate infrastructure, poor governance and low levels of
intermediation by the financial sector.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Overall, macroeconomic performance through 2004 has been robust except for
the significant weakening of the fiscal performance, particularly on the revenue side.
Overall spending was broadly as planned, but investment fell short of targets while there
were overruns on current spending. The overall fiscal balance deteriorated to a deficit of
0.7 percent of GDP and arrears accumulated. The financial situation of public enterprises
weakened considerably. Some progress was made in structural reforms in public financial
management, transport, forestry, health and education, but there was less apparent progress in
improving governance.
4.
Real GDP growth remained solid. Nonoil growth was maintained at 4½–5 percent
in 2003–04, resulting in per capita income gains of about 1½ percent per year (Figure 1 and
Tables 1-2).1 Growth was spread fairly evenly across Cameroon’s relatively diversified
nonoil economy. In the primary sector, forestry and agriculture were particularly buoyant, in
the secondary sector, electricity generation and distribution picked up, easing an important
constraint on manufacturing; in the tertiary sector, transport, communications (mobile

Progress was made in reducing poverty through 2001; no later data are available.

telephony) and retail trade performed best. In contrast, crude oil production continued on its
long-term downward trend (Box 1). Among the aggregate demand components, exports
performed well, while investment remained relatively weak (Table 3). Signs of a slowing in
economic activity in the course of 2004 include a drop in credit growth to the private sector
from 9 percent in 2003 to 2 percent in 2004 (Figure 2 and Table 4).

-7-

Box 1. Cameroon’s Oil Sector
Cameroon is a small oil producer, but the oil sector contributes significantly to economic activity. Oil
output amounted to 90,000 barrels/day in 2004 (2/5 and one third of the production in Congo and Equatorial
Guinea, respectively). The share of the oil sector in Cameroon’s total value added amounts to 10 percent, and
oil is estimated to account for 40 percent of exports in 2004.
Output is to decline over the medium to long run, but the pace is uncertain. Oil output fell by half over the
last two decades, and the pace of decline accelerated to an average of 5 percent over the last 5 years. However,
thanks to recent discoveries, output is expected to rise by 5 percent in 2006-07 and to remain stable in 2008-10.
Cameroonian crudes are heavy and the differential below the WEO benchmark recently widened.
Existing world refining capacity has recently preferred light crude oil, contributing to a significant rise in lightheavy spreads. In Cameroon, the differential against the WEO benchmark rose to US$5 per barrel in the last
quarter of 2004, against a previous average of US$2 per barrel.
Despite the steady decline in oil output, oil revenue fluctuated with developments in oil prices and
exchange rates. Oil revenue accounted for one quarter of government revenue in 2004.
The national oil company SNH (Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures) is under the aegis of the Secretary
General at the Presidency and represents the authorities in their financial relations with the foreign oil
companies. SNH receives about 70 percent of total output while operating costs are equally split with the oil
companies. SNH is responsible for transferring oil revenue (after deducting costs) to the Treasury.
Further progress is needed to enhance transparency and accountability. The SNH provides quarterly data
to Fund staff on oil production, exports, prices, revenues, and costs, but little is published. Financial audits,
conducted by local accounting firms, are carried out with long delays (the respective audits for 2000-03 are only
now being finalized). SNH makes significant expenditures on behalf of the government.
Given the volatility of oil prices, the SMP has a built-in contingency mechanism, whereby oil revenue
exceeding program targets will be used to reduce domestic debt while net domestic borrowing will be adjusted
upward by half of any revenue shortfall.

5.
Tangible progress has been made in the health and education sectors and a
number of social indicators have improved significantly (school enrollment,
immunization rates, child mortality; see Appendix I, Attachment I, paragraph 7 and Annex I).
However, income levels remain far below those enjoyed in the pre-crisis years before the
devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 and Cameroon continues to rank just above the first
quintile (place 141 out of 177 countries) of UNDP’s Human Development Index.
6.
Average inflation fell to ½ percent in 2003–04. Inflation declined mainly because
import prices declined due to the appreciation of the CFA franc against the U.S. dollar.2
Also, favorable climatic conditions increased agricultural output and lowered food prices.
Cameroon continued to benefit from the stability anchored in the prudent monetary policy of
the regional central bank (BEAC).3 Cameroon’s banking sector has remained sound overall,
with most commercial banks complying with the prudential ratios set by the regional
supervisor (COBAC);4 banks hold significant liquidity above prudential requirements.

2

Cameroon is a member country of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC). The regional currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro.

3

Of the four CEMAC convergence criteria, Cameroon violated two (nonnegative basic balance and
no new arrears) in 2004, but met the inflation criterion (less than 3 percent) and the external debt
criterion (less than 70 percent of GDP).

4

Two small banks are under close watch by COBAC due to their deteriorating financial positions.

-9-

Effective progress at the judiciary level was made in 2003–04 to limit cases of abusive
attachment of bank balances (saisie-attributions).
7.
The external current account deficit improved to about 2 percent of GDP in
2004, due mostly to strong exports of primary goods (Figure 3 and Table 5). The terms of
trade remained broadly unchanged. Despite the nominal appreciation of the CFAF against the
U.S. dollar by 25 percent in 2003–04, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by only
3.3 percent with little effect on competitiveness because about two thirds of Cameroon’s
trade is with the Euro area and inflation remained low.5 Cameroon benefited from higherthan-anticipated debt relief, reflecting mainly significant additional bilateral relief and
exchange rate movements. Intermittent arrears were incurred to external creditors reflecting
tight financing constraints as well as insufficient coordination between the Treasury and the
debt agency (CAA).
8.
The underlying fiscal performance weakened significantly, particularly on the
revenue side. Non-oil revenue fell by 1 percent of non-oil GDP in 2004 instead of increasing
as planned to offset the long-term decline in oil revenue (Figure 4, Tables 6–7). This decline
was due largely to a weak performance of VAT and excises, and larger-than-expected
revenue losses from the January 2004 personal income tax reform. This reflected a
weakening of tax administration, lower tax compliance in an election year, and, according to
the authorities, a shift in activity from the formal to the informal sector following completion
of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline in 2003. Oil revenue continued its secular decline reflecting a
downward trend in output, increasing discounts on Cameroon’s heavy petroleum, and the
dampening effect of the CFA franc appreciation against the U.S. dollar on the impact of the
rise in international oil prices (Box 1 and Table 8). Overall spending was broadly as planned,
but the decline in public investment did not correspond well to the priorities specified in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Domestically-financed investment declined by
0.4 percent of GDP in each 2003 and 2004, while noninterest current expenditure (excluding
HIPC spending) rose by 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004. The latter reflected mostly a weakening
of expenditure control which resulted in off-budget spending and an increase in the float
(accumulation of expenditure committed during past fiscal years but not yet paid). The level
of social spending (health and education) probably increased slightly (the data for the
functional breakdown of expenditure is incomplete), and the use of HIPC relief picked up
slowly.
9.
Reflecting these developments, the overall fiscal balance including grants
deteriorated by 1½ points during 2003-04 to a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. The non-oil
primary deficit deteriorated by over 1 point to 2½ percent of non-oil GDP in 2004. The 2004

Other indicators of competitiveness, such as data on wages and unit labor cost, are not available.
The forthcoming report on the regional CEMAC consultation will discuss monetary and exchange
rate policies formulated at the level of the region.

deficit was financed by foreign
financing/debt relief, a drawdown of
cash resources, and an accumulation
of domestic and external arrears.
Available cash resources dropped
sharply, the government met only
around 30 percent of its non-bank
domestic debt obligations, and
transfers from the Treasury to the
designated HIPC account at the
BEAC lagged behind debt relief
received (Box 2).
10.
The financial situation of
the largest public enterprises
weakened considerably, adding to
actual and contingent fiscal
liabilities. The deterioration
reflected weak management as well
as growing payment arrears of the
government. The national airline
(CAMAIR) was kept afloat with
large budget support, but appears to
be bankrupt. Government arrears to
the fixed-line telephone company
(CAMTEL) undermined its ability to
operate in a highly competitive
market. The water utility (SNEC)
remained unable to pay some of its
suppliers, notably other public
enterprises/utilities. The local
refinery (SONARA) incurred
substantial losses in 2004, due in
part, to the decision to first slow and
then suspend the mechanism for
adjusting domestic fuel prices to

Box 2. Cameroon: HIPC Relief
The cumulative HIPC interim relief and additional bilateral debt relief obtained since the
decision point in 2000 was significant (CFAF 239 billion at end-2004, or 3.1 percent of 2004 GDP).
Part of this is deposited directly by creditors in the HIPC account and part is deposited on behalf of
creditors by the Treasury. The Treasury had arrears of CFAF 77 billion to the account at end-2004.
The authorities plan to transfer all HIPC relief received in 2005 into the account, and to establish a
plan for replenishing the arrears from past years.
The use of HIPC resources to date has been slow. Payments for HIPC projects through end-2004
totaled some CFAF 61 billion. A broad-based HIPC Consultative Committee has approved projects
eligible for HIPC resources totaling over CFAF 300 million, but delays in allocating approved project
budgets to executing ministries and cumbersome administrative procedures have kept the use of HIPC
resources low. The authorities have accelerated execution in 2004 and are streamlining procedures to
speed up the implementation of HIPC projects further.
An audit on the use of HIPC resources was conducted in 2004, and a new audit covering 2004 is
forthcoming. The new audit will report on implementation of the results of the first audit, which
called for better prioritization of projects as well as better integrating HIPC projects into budgetary
and execution processes.

changes in international oil prices.6 The postal savings bank continued to face a liquidity
crisis, even after it was merged with the cash-generating mail operations in April 2004 to
form CAMPOST, and required cash injections from the government to meet some of the
strong demand for cash withdrawals.
11.
Structural reforms in public financial management were continued, but have yet
to yield the desired results. Implementation of the integrated financial management system
(SIGEFI) since 2003 has made good technical progress, but has not yielded the desired

- 13 -

improvement in the accuracy and speed of fiscal reporting due, in part, to insufficient
coordination within the Ministry of Finance. The expenditure classification adopted in 2003
is still to be integrated in all financial reports. Tax reforms included the creation of a large
taxpayer unit, but start-up problems related to a change in the payment mechanism from
check to bank transfer have delayed the expected strengthening of tax revenue. In public
administration, a database of government employees (SIGIPES) was created and matched to
payrolls in four pilot ministries, eliminating “ghost workers” and improving personnel
management practices.
12.
Regarding other structural reforms conducive to economic growth, some
progress was made, including toward meeting HIPC completion point triggers. The
reform of the Douala port made good progress; all commercial activity was transferred to
private operators, and transaction costs and clearance time were reduced substantially. In the
forestry sector, the allocation of logging rights through competitive bidding in the presence
of an independent observer was strengthened. In the financial sector, a stock exchange was
set up albeit its activities are still very limited, and Cameroon’s microfinance institutions are
being licensed. The authorities and the banking sector are collaborating with the BEAC in a
study of how banks could satisfy a higher share of credit demand in the CFA franc area. In
the education sector, gross enrollment rates increased and gender disparity declined, but
repetition and dropout rates remain high. In the health care sector, the price of treatment for
major diseases was reduced and immunization rates increased. Among the results is a decline
in child mortality rates. Progress toward the HIPC completion point triggers is described in
Appendix I (Attachment I, Annex I).
13.
Reforms aimed at improving governance and the business climate have made
limited progress. Some new institutions were set up (constitutional court, audit office and
ministerial anti-corruption units), but not all are operational yet. Also, a new public
procurement code was adopted in September 2004, but follow-up on cases of noncompliance needs strengthening. Despite a broadly designed national governance program,
governance in Cameroon continues to be perceived by most observers as very weak. This
may be due in part to the apparent absence of progress in strengthening the judiciary despite
the existence of a priority action plan.
III. EX-POST ASSESSMENT DISCUSSIONS7
14.
The authorities felt that the draft EPA report draws important lessons for the
future. They agreed that higher investment is needed to lift Cameroon’s growth rate and
make progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs), although they put more
emphasis on public rather than private investment. On program design, they underscored the
tension between conditionality and ownership and concurred that programs should target
outcomes, rather than process, whenever possible. They also were interested in the proposed
7

See Ex-Post Assessment (www.imf.org).

- 14 -

strengthening of the medium-term dimension of program design, including in setting fiscal
targets.
15.
The authorities differed significantly in their assessment of past Fund-supported
programs, particularly the PRGF arrangement of 2000. They felt that the EPA did not
stress sufficiently the successes achieved, notably the robust economic growth. They also felt
that the slippages that occurred in 2002–2003, which led to a long delay in completing the
fourth review, could not be solely attributed to the Cameroonian authorities. They considered
the deviations from the program targets minor and due primarily to the Fund’s changing
definitions of program variables as well as unrealistic expectations regarding what could be
achieved. The authorities did not agree that they had lacked ownership; rather, they felt that
burgeoning conditionality and the threat of program suspension led them to agree to targets
that proved unreachable, notably for non-oil revenue.
IV. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND RISKS
16.
The authorities’ policy strategy seeks to ensure macroeconomic stability,
sustainable growth, debt sustainability, and progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The strategy builds on the conclusion of the last Article IV
consultations and the recommendations of the EPA. The main policy tools will be prudent
fiscal policy consistent with debt sustainability, and further structural reforms that remove
impediments to private sector growth. Fiscal performance as well as public financial
management will need to be strengthened through mobilizing non-oil revenue to offset the
secular decline in oil revenue, strengthening expenditure management, enhancing
transparency of government operations (including in the oil sector), and restructuring of
public enterprises to limit quasi-fiscal losses. Staff suggested that the authorities define a
fiscal path smoothing out the volatility resulting from oil price fluctuations (Box 3). An
increase in public investment will be essential to improve basic infrastructure especially in
transport, communications and electricity supply that have been constraints on growth in the
past. Further structural reforms targeting improvements in the business climate will be key to
increasing private investment, including improvements in the legal system, payment of
government arrears, and increased bank lending for business activities.
17.
Cameroon’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable should the authorities
implement the above strategy. Non-oil real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to
5–5½ percent and non-oil exports are expected to broaden with the easing of energy supply
bottlenecks and other infrastructure improvements following higher public investment. In
2005, however, non-oil real GDP growth is projected to decelerate slightly, reflecting the
temporary impact of the fiscal retrenchment and the effect of a slower, albeit still robust,
performance of traditional agricultural exports. Inflation is targeted to stay below 2 percent
over the medium term consistent with projected inflation in the euro area. The monetary
objectives provide sufficient room for the growth of private sector credit (Table 4). The
external current account deficit is projected to stabilize at 2–2½ percent of GDP, reflecting
price and output developments in the oil sector and robust exports of other primary goods.

- 15 -

Box 3. Cameroon: Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy and Outlook
The medium-term fiscal strategy for Cameroon aims at
● ensuring fiscal and external sustainability over the medium term. Cameroon’s external debt ratios should be
gradually reduced through cautious fiscal targets and HIPC Initiative relief. Public sector external debt ratios are projected to
fall to 20 percent of GDP by 2010 and 89 percent of exports, with a debt service ratio of 10 percent (Appendix II).
● smoothing out spending volatility arising from oil price volatility. Fiscal balance should be established at a long-term
average oil price, and windfall revenues either saved or allocated to one-off spending. The staff proposes to set this average
price conservatively at €21/barrel for Cameroon’s heavy crudes, that is, about €1 above the average of the past 20 years.
Any windfall revenue based on actual prices would be allocated to the restructuring of domestic enterprises, domestic debt
and arrears reduction, and faster replenishment of the HIPC account. Against this background, the staff proposes aiming
gradually at an overall surplus of ½ to 1 percent of GDP at the long-term average oil price to allow some margin for
unforeseen spending needs. The non-oil primary balance would also gradually strengthen to a surplus that should cover
interest costs by the time oil revenue dries up.
● expanding capital expenditure to boost growth and welfare while keeping a tight lid on current spending. Current
noninterest spending (excluding HIPC resources) would rise very gradually as public services are improved, while capital
spending would double over 2004-10.
● offsetting the projected decline in oil revenue by rising non-oil revenue. Non-oil revenue would rise by almost
3 percent of non-oil GDP over 2004-10. Although the effort is expected to be front-loaded, it will need to be maintained
over the medium term.

18.
Public debt appears sustainable over the medium term, however available debt
data is not fully comprehensive. Satisfactory implementation of the 2005 program would
likely allow the authorities to resolve the liquidity constraints in 2005 through another Paris
Club flow rescheduling. External debt sustainability is benefiting from past and prospective
debt relief as well as solid GDP growth, which is projected to strengthen in the future with
the right policy strategy in place. An analysis in the framework for low-income countries
indicates that Cameroon’s debt position is largely sustainable over the medium-term
(Appendix II). Under the baseline scenario, which assumes a Paris Club rescheduling in 2005
but no HIPC completion point, and most of the standardized stress tests, debt-to-GDP ratios
for public and publicly guaranteed debt remain well below 40 percent, the NPV of debt-toexports falls well below 150 percent, and debt service falls steeply. Assuming the HIPC
completion point is achieved in 2006, the results become more pronounced, with the NPV of
debt ratio falling to 21 percent of GDP in 2006, and to 89 percent of exports, and debt service
falling to some 9 percent of exports, and all declining steadily thereafter. These results should
be qualified, however, as no data are available on the external debt of public enterprises that
is not guaranteed by the government; the authorities are currently undertaking an audit to
determine this debt. Recorded domestic debt stood at about 12 percent of GDP at end-2004,
excluding domestic arrears to be established by the audit that is underway.
19.
Nonetheless, there are important risks to Cameroon’s economic outlook. The
economy remains vulnerable to exogenous factors, particularly a deterioration in the terms of
trade. Also, a further appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, combined with
unfavorable developments in commodity prices, could reduce growth. The debt sustainability
analysis above illustrated some of the potential effects on the debt outlook. The authorities’
program for 2005 is ambitious, and thus prospects are open to a number of downside risks:
•

The size of the fiscal adjustment in 2005 is large, reflecting in part tight financing
constraints. Thus, strong political will and determined efforts will be needed to
mobilize revenue and to keep a lid on current expenditure. Slippages would likely
generate new arrears and undermine investor confidence.

•

The financial position of utilities and major public enterprises is fragile. A failure to
strengthen their position would undermine fiscal consolidation and weaken
confidence and growth prospects.

•

Institutional capacity limitations remain. These need to be addressed effectively to
avoid continued delays in the implementation of the public investment program and
structural reforms. In particular, the authorities’ ability to spend the available HIPC
resources on quality programs to improve human and physical capital will be critical
to foster growth.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

20.
The authorities agreed that the primary policy challenges ahead were improving
fiscal performance to maintain macroeconomic stability and removing impediments to

- 17 -

private sector growth. These challenges remain largely unchanged from those identified by
Executive Directors at the time of the 2002 Article IV Consultation as little progress has been
made in the interim.8 The authorities’ economic program for 2005 (see the Letter of Intent for
the SMP and MEFP in Appendix I) constitutes an important step toward meeting these
challenges. Box 4 summarizes the key elements of the 2005 SMP that are discussed below.
The authorities emphasized their determination to build a strong macroeconomic track record
to pave the way for a new PRGF arrangement and subsequently reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative.
A. Strengthening Fiscal Performance and Management
21.
The authorities’ fiscal program for 2005 is ambitious with an improvement in
the non-oil primary deficit of 2.5 percentage points of non-oil GDP. The overall balance
is targeted to improve to a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP. The size of the fiscal adjustment
reflects tight financing constraints. The adjustment is to be achieved in equal parts through a
substantial mobilization of non-oil revenue and strict expenditure restraint.
22.
Financing constraints are important in defining the size of the programmed
fiscal adjustment. Domestic financing is limited due to the government’s low cash operating
balances, the almost full use of advances from the BEAC (the statutory ceiling is 20 percent
of government revenue of the previous year), and little access to voluntary commercial bank
credit as a result of the diminished creditworthiness of the government due to recurrent past
arrears. Regarding external financing, significant donor support is projected through project
and program financing as well as debt relief. The authorities acknowledged that building a
solid policy track record and the prospect of a new PRGF arrangement with the Fund would
strengthen a request they plan to make for a new Paris Club rescheduling.9
23.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to increase non-oil revenue.
Staff welcomed the tax measures of 0.9 percent of non-oil GDP in the 2005 budget. These
aim mostly at broadening the tax base, but also include a ½ point increase in the VAT rate
(MEFP paragraphs 10–12); several tax provisions that were not consistent with the CEMAC
regulations were rescinded.10 Staff expressed concerns about the reintroduction of extensive

8

At that time, Executive Directors underscored a need for (i) consolidating the fiscal position by
strengthening non-oil revenue, containing non-priority spending, and improving fiscal management;
and (ii) diversifying the economy and promoting private investment by speeding up structural reform
and improving governance. Directors also expressed concern about the slow use of HIPC resources.

9

The 2005 program assumes the rescheduling of pre-cutoff date maturities falling due on bilateral
debt (about three fourths of scheduled debt service).
10

The measures include (i) an increase by ½ percentage point in the VAT rate (yield 0.2 percent of
non-oil GDP); (ii) elimination of VAT and excise tax exemptions on specific goods and services
(0.4 percent); (iii) adjusting various stamp taxes (0.1 percent); and (iv) strengthening tax

interruptions of the VAT payment chain at the level of large enterprises; the authorities will
review this with the upcoming FAD technical assistance mission. The authorities indicated
that they would take additional tax measures if needed to meet the 2005 revenue objective,
but cautioned that efforts to raise additional non-oil revenue might reduce the purchasing
power of low-income households, domestic consumption, and thus government revenue.
Staff recommended that the authorities expedite the sale of government assets, particularly

administration (0.2 percent). In addition, half of the VAT surcharge collected on behalf of local
governments will be retained at the central level (0.3 percent of non-oil GDP).

- 19 -

minority shares in profitable companies. The authorities indicated that the national oil
company (SNH) would increase its dividend payments to the government.
24.
Staff urged the authorities to monitor revenue administration closely. The
authorities were confident that strengthening tax audits and other measures would overcome
the difficulties in implementing the new personal income tax and managing the large
taxpayer unit that were encountered in 2004. Also, measures were introduced to limit tax
fraud in the forestry sector. The authorities consider it important to reduce tax evasion and
improve taxation of the informal sector, and requested FAD’s assistance.
25.
In the authorities’ view, noninterest current expenditure would need to bear the
brunt of the expenditure restraint; public investment would be increased. The
authorities explained that they would impose tight limits on commitments under the 2005
budget; cuts would focus on travel expenses, non-priority construction, and vehicle
acquisition. The bulk of the planned increase in investment spending would be funded by an
acceleration of the use of HIPC resources. The staff noted that in previous years capital
expenditure had typically fallen short of budgetary objectives, while non-interest current
spending exceeded them. To prevent a recurrence of these systematic deviations from the
budget, the authorities are strengthening institutional capacities to accelerate investment
spending, and tightening budgetary control, particularly for spending on goods and services.
The 2005 budget also provides for a significant increase in outlays for the
restructuring/privatization of ailing public enterprises.
26.
The authorities concurred with the staff on the need to strengthen Treasury
management. This will enable them to better cope with the tight liquidity constraints in the
short term and better support macroeconomic sustainability in the medium and long term.
•

The authorities will strictly control cash spending (MEFP paragraphs 13–15). In
early 2005, they limited payments for bills incurred in 2004 to small amounts and
commissioned an audit to take stock of domestic arrears at end-2004 and develop a
repayment plan.

•

The authorities will curtail advances from the national oil company (SNH). In the
past, these advances (0.8–0.9 percent of GDP in 2003–04) circumvented normal
budgetary procedures. Since January 2005, SNH can only make advance payments
after authorization by the Minister of Finance and against available budgetary
allocations. The authorities committed to stop all advance payments as of July 2005
except for sovereign spending (MEFP paragraph 14).

- 20 -

•

Extra-budgetary spending, which appears to have been significant in the past, will
be reined in.11 A ceiling was set on SNH’s quasi-fiscal expenditure in 2005 (MEFP
paragraph 14).

•

The authorities will complete the implementation of a single Treasury account
and close the numerous accounts still held by government entities in commercial
banks, which seriously undermine cash management by the Treasury and a
transparent expenditure tracking and payment process (MEFP paragraph 18). The
authorities explained that the central Treasury lacked reliable cash flow programming
and was not always able to respond to the needs of ministries in a timely way. The
authorities will remedy this problem by strengthening Treasury operations.

27.
Debt regularization and payment of arrears will be particularly important to
prevent a further weakening of investor sentiment. Staff noted that the government’s
creditworthiness had been undermined by the non-payment of domestic debt obligations
during the last two years. Based on the new audit, the authorities will formulate a
comprehensive multiyear settlement plan, in consultation with major creditors, for the
outstanding domestic debt and arrears (MEFP paragraph 16). Given the tight financial
constraints, the authorities will not be able to fully replenish the arrears to the HIPC account
in 2005, but will transfer current debt relief received and establish a plan for the full
replenishment of the account. Also, Cameroon will not be able to meet fully its obligations to
external creditors in 2005. The authorities intend to request a new Paris Club rescheduling
once a new PRGF arrangement has been approved. They are also undertaking efforts to
communicate with commercial creditors who did not participate in the commercial debt
buyback of 2003, but one non-participating creditor has successfully sued and effectively
seized official assets of some US$43 million (0.3 percent of GDP) in 2004.
28.
The authorities concurred that improving the quality of fiscal data is essential.
Staff noted that the provision of budgetary data deteriorated in 2004 and encouraged the
authorities to make better use of the Integrated Information and Management System and
consistently apply the 2003 expenditure classification. In response, the authorities have
begun to prepare preliminary fiscal accounts within three weeks of the reporting month; they
have also undertaken to better monitor spending on a cash and a commitment basis, and to
assess the float (MEFP paragraph 19).12
29.
The staff advised the authorities to proceed cautiously in moving toward fiscal
decentralization. The authorities indicated that they intend to entrust local governments with
decentralized responsibilities and related funding before the parliamentary election in early
2007. In the staff’s view, in advance of such a move a clear framework for the allocation of
responsibilities needs to be defined, capacity built at the local level, and proper safeguards

put in place. Furthermore, the staff cautioned that the decision to retain at the central level
half of the local government surcharge on the VAT in 2005 was likely to have negative
implications for local governments. The authorities agreed to reconsider this issue in the
context of the future redefinition of revenue sharing (MEFP paragraph 24).
B. Improving the Performance of Public Enterprises
30.
The authorities agreed that the financial situation of key public enterprises
needs to be improved as well as the services they provide. Decisive action in their
restructuring and privatization will reduce the burden the losses of these enterprises impose
on the budget currently or in the future (MEFP paragraphs 26–28). The authorities will seek
to divest most of the large loss-making enterprises, pay utility bills on a timely basis, and
regularize government debt to enterprises as part of the overall domestic debt settlement
strategy.
31.
The staff welcomed the government’s decision to proceed speedily with
privatization. Regarding CAMAIR, the authorities have hired the International Financial
Corporation (IFC) to advise them; they intend to liquidate the nonperforming assets and to
transfer the viable assets to a new company in which the government would hold only a
minority share. The staff cautioned that the proposed scheme could entail further budgetary
costs if no private investor were found and the company remained active. The authorities
intend to offer CAMTEL for sale by end-2005, and to launch a bid for a public-private
partnership for SNEC. The staff recommended that, in light of the failed attempts to privatize
these companies in 2002–03 and given the less-favorable current market conditions than in
the late 90’s, the authorities consider some measures to facilitate their privatization, such as a
minimum investment program for CAMTEL. For SNEC, the authorities agreed to increase
water tariffs gradually to reach cost recovery levels in the context of finalizing the publicprivate partnership.13
32.
The downstream activities in the oil sector need to be further liberalized to
reduce fuel costs over the medium term (MEFP paragraph 39), including fuel storage and
distribution. In the short term, the authorities agreed to reinstate fully the fuel pricing formula
and add a margin to allow SONARA to recoup the losses incurred in 2004. Furthermore, the
authorities argued that fuel prices will continue to be set above international market prices to
provide protection for SONARA in view of its strategic importance. They plan, however, to
reduce over time the degree of protection provided to SONARA. Staff expressed concern
about the extent of the losses and about the costs that high fuel prices impose on the
economy, and recommended to strengthen SONARA’s management and efficiency, and
possibly seek a public-private partnership.

13

Water tariffs have not been adjusted since 1994 following the devaluation of the CFA franc. SNEC
covers water supply only for a limited number of users in urban areas.

- 22 -

33.
The staff stressed the need for decisive measures to restructure governmentowned financial institutions (MEFP paragraphs 29–30). While CAMPOST is thought to be
bankrupt, the size of the government’s liabilities (due to a full guarantee of all savings
deposits) remains to be fully ascertained. The authorities agreed to establish a preliminary
balance sheet and to progress gradually toward a split-up of postal and banking activities that
would allow prudential and regulatory supervision of the banking activities by COBAC. The
staff expressed concerns about the viability of a postal savings bank in light of Cameroon’s
well-developed microfinance sector, but the authorities consider the nationwide postal
network essential in providing financial services to remote areas. The authorities agreed to
review the role of the housing financing institution (CFC) in light of its high non-performing
loan recovery ratio notwithstanding subsidized loan rates. They also undertook to improve
the operations of the loan recovery agency (SRC) to accelerate recoveries on the remaining
loan portfolio.
34.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen transparency and accountability
in public enterprises. The authorities agreed to update the database that was established to
assess the overall financial situation of the 20 largest public enterprises. Also, the monitoring
of poorly performing companies that are under performance contracts with the government
should be strengthened. Regarding oil sector operations, very little information is
disseminated. The authorities recently indicated their interest in adhering to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Staff suggested a number of specific steps the
authorities could take in publishing information following the example of the Republic of
Congo (MEFP paragraph 21).
C. Removing Impediments to Private Sector Growth
35.
The government agreed that improvements in infrastructure will be important
for growth and poverty reduction (MEFP paragraphs 42–43):
•

Additional electric power generation capacity will be needed by 2006–07 to avoid
power supply shortages. The government committed to working closely with the
World Bank to accelerate preparations for a gas-fired plant, and to develop a strategy
for strengthening power supply in the medium and long term.

•

The road network needs to be better maintained and expanded. The government
is committed to improving the administration of the Road Fund and stepping up road
maintenance, with a view to securing grants offered by the European Union.

•

Port reform will be continued, including by upgrading information technology used
at the port of Douala.

•

Rail transport needs strengthening. The government agreed to meet its obligations
toward the private operator (CAMRAIL) in accordance with the concession contract.

- 23 -

36.
The authorities see a number of constraints to increasing external trade. Exports
of goods and services amount to about 25 percent of GDP, but constraints to further growth
include poor infrastructure and inadequate services to support international trade and meet
international quality standards. A number of improvements have been made in trade
facilitation (port facilities and customs administration) in recent years, and these efforts
should continue. Staff agreed with the authorities’ near term focus on seeking a reduction in
the CEMAC common external tariff and the number of tariff headings. Cameroon’s simple
average tariff is 18 percent, with 4 basic tariff categories of 5, 10, 20, and 30 percent in line
with CEMAC regulations. It has no significant non-tariff barriers, although there is an export
ban on certain exotic timber varieties and an export tax on timber and logs.
37.
To contribute to a stable business environment, the authorities will continue to
support the BEAC’s monetary policy aimed at maintaining the peg of the CFA franc to
the euro and containing inflation (MEFP paragraph 29). This should allow an increase in
credit to the private sector consistent with economic growth projections. The authorities will
also seek to address the financial difficulties of government-owned financial institutions, and
cooperate with COBAC in the supervision of microfinance institutions.
38.
The authorities agreed with the staff that decisive action is needed to improve
transparency and governance (MEFP paragraphs 34–35). Beyond the adherence to the
EITI mentioned above, the government plans to update its National Governance Program. In
particular, it will accelerate implementation of its priority action plan for judicial reform;
prepare legislation allowing the application of the UN convention against corruption; make
the Audit Office (Chambre des comptes) and the Constitutional Council operational; and
further improve governance in the forestry sector (MEFP paragraph 41).
D. PRSP and Social Sector Policies
39.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the need to review key elements of the
PRSP and improve the monitoring of and reporting on PRSP implementation (MEFP
paragraphs 36–38). Among the elements to be reviewed are the medium-term
macroeconomic framework, poverty projections, and sectoral strategies. The review will be
important for the preparation of the next annual PRSP progress report (expected in mid2005), the 2006 budget, and medium-term projections. There is a need to monitor outcomes
in relation to actual spending as well as to tighten the linkage between the PRSP and the
medium-term sectoral strategies, the annual budgeting of expenditure, and the outcomes
sought. Finally, the authorities will also enhance the monitoring of demographic and poverty
trends, including by strengthening the National Statistics Institute and initiating a new
census.
40.
In education and health care, recent efforts have led to improvements in key
indicators, but more needs to be done to improve outcomes. The authorities are working
closely with the World Bank and are implementing medium-term sectoral strategies that aim
to improve the efficiency of public spending and to make further progress towards reaching
the MDGs.

- 24 -

VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Cameroon maintained solid growth and low inflation in recent years, but weak
fiscal performance and public financial management could threaten macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability in the longer term as noted in past Article IV
consultations and the EPA report. Particularly in light of the recent slowdown of economic
growth, there is an urgent need to address fiscal issues and remove impediments to private
sector growth. Growth would be enhanced by increasing investment in basic infrastructure
(electricity, transport and communications) and improving the overall investment climate for
the private sector, including by tackling corruption. The new government of December 2004
has committed to an ambitious program for 2005 and has indicated its determination to
strengthen policy performance so as to reach the completion point under the HIPC Initiative
as early as possible. The reorganization of ministries sought to facilitate this by focusing
economic decision making in the new Ministry of Economy and Finance.
42.
A key challenge for the authorities is to improve fiscal performance and
management. The slippages in revenue performance in 2003–04 were large, and the strong
actions in the government’s program for 2005 to remedy this are essential. Nonetheless, the
proposed scale of adjustment, necessitated by financing constraints, is ambitious. Thus, the
program is subject to a number of risks, including external shocks, a weakening of the
political will to fully implement the program, including the fiscal adjustment and
strengthening of enterprise performance, and institutional capacity limitations.
43.
Raising revenue collections will be crucial for improving fiscal performance.
Planned technical assistance in tax policy as well as tax and customs administration should
help. The authorities have undertaken important tax reforms in 2004, and need to focus on
making these effective by overcoming the implementation problems. Tax rates, in particular
for the VAT, are already high and efforts should focus on broadening the tax base through
reducing exemptions and improving tax incidence in the informal sector.
44.
Prioritizing public expenditure in the context of overall expenditure restraint
will be important. While a sharp compression in non-interest spending is essential in 2005,
improving the composition of expenditure will be crucial in enhancing its effectiveness. The
new public procurement reform should contribute to expenditure that is more effective.
Public investment remains very low, despite the increase planned for 2005. As a result, basic
infrastructure is lacking and limiting business opportunities for the private sector, particularly
away from the coastal areas. The channeling of spending toward the social sectors will also
be essential in making progress toward the PRSP priorities and the MDGs.
45.
While some improvements in fiscal management have been made, further
progress is needed to support macroeconomic stability. The authorities have made
significant investment in setting up a financial management system, but they are not yet
reaping the full benefits of the systems installed in terms of speed, accuracy and
comprehensiveness of fiscal reporting. Early progress in this area will be crucial and initial
signs are encouraging. Similarly, reporting on the receipt and use of HIPC relief has lacked

- 25 -

transparency, and efforts are under way to address this. Civil service reform is progressing
including through streamlining the payroll of some ministries and implementing other
improvements in personnel management. Plans to expand these measures to all ministries are
much welcome.
46.
Debt management needs to be improved. Past domestic debt restructurings were
not fully implemented and new arrears have been incurred; this has undermined the
government’s credibility. The audit of domestic debt as of end-2004 is an important step
toward the regularization of government obligations; it will be crucial that the government
develop a realistic debt-servicing plan and implement it fully. Similarly, external payments
arrears on non-reschedulable debt should be avoided.
47.
Poor management of public enterprises has resulted in large actual and potential
fiscal costs. Privatization in a transparent manner remains a priority to limit the ongoing
quasi-fiscal losses of public enterprises and improve service quality. The authorities are
pursuing steps in this direction. Prompt action, especially with respect to CAMAIR,
CAMTEL, SNEC, and CAMPOST, is essential. Progress will also be important in improving
domestic fuel pricing and the financial performance of SONARA.
48.
Another key challenge for the authorities is to lay the foundation for sustained
growth and further progress toward the MDGs. In the social sectors, tangible progress
has been made in health and education. A number of social indicators have improved
significantly, though more progress is urgently needed. The authorities should persist in their
efforts to further enhance the efficiency of spending in these areas and implement the
medium-term sectoral strategies elaborated together with the World Bank. The staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to review the key elements of the PRSP as well as to
strengthen implementation and monitoring.
49.
Low inflation is conducive to improvements in the business climate. The regional
currency union has served Cameroon well in maintaining low inflation and macroeconomic
stability. The authorities need to improve basic infrastructure and continue structural reforms,
including in public enterprises that will enhance competitiveness and overall economic
efficiency.
50.
Staff urged the authorities to renew their efforts to improve governance as
concerns about corruption undermine public and investor confidence. While the
authorities adopted a broad-based National Governance Program in 1999, there is relatively
little evidence of tangible improvements. For example, the Audit Office and the
Constitutional Council were set up in a formal sense, but neither has become operational.
Also, while the Douala port reform has been successful in reducing port clearance costs and
time, the public reportedly continues to consider customs services as highly corrupt. The
authorities intend to improve Cameroon’s reputation among potential investors, both
domestically and abroad. They have enhanced their contacts with the business community as
well as donors in order to better understand their concerns and work jointly on resolving
problems. The staff urges the authorities to focus less on general policy intentions and more

- 26 -

on generating results. Enforcing penalties against proven cases of corruption will be an
important step in this direction.
51.
The staff welcomes the government’s intention to enhance transparency in the
oil sector and adhere to the EITI. It encouraged the authorities to demonstrate early
evidence of this resolve through the publication of detailed information on oil sector
operations and the national oil company.
52.
Data provision to the Fund remains adequate for surveillance purposes, but
there is significant room for improvement. The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to
enhance national accounts and fiscal data, as well as the plans to improve data on poverty
and social indicators with donor assistance. Other real sector indicators remain weak,
however, and BOP statistics are compiled with long delays.
53.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Cameroon take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington D.C. 20431
USA
March 30, 2005
Dear Mr. de Rato:
Cameroon’s economy continues to progress on a path of sustained economic growth
averaging over 4 percent yearly, with an inflation rate of less than 1 percent. Yet, in the last
two years, difficulties emerged in the execution of the State budget, reflected in a substantial
backlog of payment arrears at end-December 2004.
After his re-election to the helm of State in October 2004, the President of the Republic,
His Excellency Paul Biya, formed a new Government whose main priorities were to address
the fiscal situation, consolidate economic growth and deepen the implementation of the
national poverty reduction strategy. In this regard, major changes were introduced in order to
boost the effectiveness of the action of the Government, vigorously committed since
December 2004.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) presents the key
elements of Government’s program for 2005. This program seeks to consolidate the
country’s fiscal situation in order to preserve macro-economic stability, to strengthen
investments and improve social conditions.
In particular, fiscal policy will rely on a voluntary effort to mobilize non-oil revenue to offset
the secular decline in oil output, as well as on an enhanced mastery of budgetary expenditure,
with priority to securing more and better public investments. In this context, the further
restructuring and privatization of public corporations will also be strengthened in order to
reduce the burden that they impose on public finances.
Budgetary management will be enhanced, notably as far as transparency and accountability
are concerned. With particular regard to the management of oil revenue, the Government
intends to adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and will make
every effort to enhance transparency in Cameroon’s oil sector.
The program set out in the MEFP also includes measures to enhance governance and fight
corruption. The implementation of these measures should especially improve the
performances of public services, and enhance private sector activity and business climate.
Our efforts to strengthen the supply of health and education services and the people’s access
to these services have brought about significant improvements and we will continue our
efforts in line with the priorities of Cameroon’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.

- 36 -

APPENDIX I

The Government requests that IMF staff monitor and follow up the execution of this program
over 2005. And, after a sustained period of implementation, it intends to agree on a threeyear economic program that could be supported by the IMF with an arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The Government will communicate to the
IMF the information needed to monitor progress in implementing the program. We intend to
review with the IMF staff the progress made during the first three months of the program
(January-March 2005) in late April/early May 2005.
The Government will strive to achieve the HIPC Initiative completion point triggers as
quickly as possible.
Sincerely yours,

Inoni Ephraim
Prime Minister
Head of Government

CAMEROON
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2005
I. ECONOMIC SITUATION
1.
In recent years, Cameroon’s growth and inflation performance was solid. Real GDP
growth averaged 4½ percent during 2000-2004, resulting in per capita GDP income gains of
1.7 percent per year. The electricity shortages that constrained growth through 2003 eased
somewhat in 2004, but there are signs of a slowdown in growth late in the year, including a
decline in the rate of growth of bank credit to the private sector to 2 percent from some
10 percent in 2003. Consumer price inflation fell below 1 percent in 2003-04, and the current
account deficit narrowed to below 2 percent of GDP on account of strong exports of primary
goods. External debt fell below 50 percent of GDP, mostly as a result of debt relief.
Fiscal performance and public enterprises
2.
Fiscal performance weakened considerably in 2004. As a result, the non-oil primary
deficit widened from 0.6 percent of GDP in 2003 to 2.4 percent in 2004.
•

Non-oil revenue declined by 1 percentage points of non-oil GDP despite the start-up of
revenue from the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. Revenue from personal income taxes,
VAT and other taxes on goods and services declined, and a one-time liquidation of
checks in 2003 could not be repeated in 2004. Income taxes reflected a higher-thanexpected loss from the personal income tax reform introduced in 2004, and the loss of
some formal employment in mid-2003 associated with the construction of the
Cameroon-Chad pipeline. The decline of VAT and licensing fee revenue appears to
reflect some slowdown of activity in the formal sector and shortcomings in revenue
administration due in particular to the various reforms introduced in 2004.

•

Oil revenue declined slightly due to lower production volumes and increasing discounts
on Cameroon’s heavy petroleum. Moreover, the appreciation of the CFA franc against
the US dollar limited the effect of the increase in international oil prices on oil revenue.

•

Combined with lower grant receipts, this left total revenue almost 1.2 percentage point
of GDP below its 2003 level.

•

Cash expenditure increased by 0.3 percentage point of GDP, despite a decline in budget
allocations by 0.4 percentage point. This indicates substantial expenditure executed in
2004 related to previous budget years and extra-budgetary spending. Spending priorities
in the budget shifted away from the social sectors and infrastructure to sovereign
spending. In the event, current spending (excluding interest) increased by 1 percent of
GDP, while investment was stable at a low level, and interest charges fell.

•

The overall budget balance (including grants) weakened by 2 percentage points of GDP
to a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. This was financed by higher foreign financing

- 38 -

ATTACHMENT I

(project loans and debt relief), an accumulation of external arrears, and low payments
on domestic arrears and debt.
3.
The financial situation of some public enterprises, particularly CAMAIR and
CAMPOST, continued to be very worrisome. Their difficulties reflect a number of factors,
including weak management, inadequate monitoring, and growing payment arrears of the
Government.
Structural reforms
4.
Major structural reforms in public finances that began in 2002 were continued. The
implementation of the new integrated financial management system (SIGEFI) since 2003 has
made good progress at the technical level, but has yet to yield the desired improvements in the
accuracy and speed of fiscal reporting. In addition, the new expenditure classification adopted
in 2003 is still to be integrated in all financial reports. Tax reforms have been implemented in
2004 (i.e., personal income tax reform and setting up of a large taxpayer unit (DGE)), but their
full effect remains to be seen.
5.

The Government also continued to implement structural reforms in other areas.

•

It achieved very good progress in port reform: at the port of Douala, the continued
improved operations of the single window for imports and exports clearance (GUCE)
reduced transaction costs and clearance time; all commercial and industrial activity was
transferred to private operators, including the management of the container terminal.

•

The Government also made good progress in forestry sector reform: the mandate of the
forestry agency (ANAFOR) was redefined and a social plan was implemented.
Furthermore, the allocation of logging rights through competitive bidding in the
presence of an independent observer was strengthened.

•

In the financial sector, the Douala Stock Exchange was set up and Cameroon’s
microfinance institutions are being licensed.

•

Regarding public enterprise reform, following failed earlier attempts, the Government
updated the action plans for the privatization of the telecommunication provider
CAMTEL and the water supplier SNEC.

Progress in improving governance
6.
A number of measures have been implemented to improve governance, but the
Government recognizes that further progress is needed.
•

The new public procurement code was adopted in September 2004. It aims notably at
strengthening transparency and independent oversight of procurement procedures.

- 39 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

A priority action plan to reform the judiciary system was approved at the end of 2003
and is in its initial stages of implementation. Also, laws specifying the responsibilities,
organization and functioning of the Audit Office for state finances (Chambre des
Comptes) and the Constitutional Court were passed in April 2003 and April 2004,
respectively.

•

Anti-corruption units have been established in all ministries and other government
bodies, financial resources allocated for their operations, and an action plan approved
for each unit.

•

The President of the Republic ratified the UN convention against corruption in
May 2004, making it possible to consider as corruption the misappropriation of public
property, money laundering, influence peddling, abuse of power, and diversion of
private sector assets.

Developments in the social sectors
7.
The Government has continued to implement its poverty reduction strategy (PRSP) and
its education and health sector strategies in 2004.
•

In education, school districting maps were updated, part-time primary school teachers
recruited, and classrooms for primary and secondary schools constructed. Substantial
improvements have been made in gross enrollment rates and reducing gender disparity,
however, repetition and dropout rates remain high. A medium-term expenditure plan for
the education sector was updated in 2004.

•

In health care, sector programs (malaria, HIV/AIDS, medication and immunization)
were implemented in parallel with an awareness-raising program. Actions include:
(i) reducing the price of treated mosquito nets; (ii) reducing the cost of HIV/AIDS
treatment, (iii) providing free treatment of tuberculosis; and (iv) stepping up vaccination
campaigns. The 2004 Demographic and Health Survey showed improved health
indicators: from 1998 to 2004, the infant mortality rate fell by three percentage points to
74 per 1000, the child mortality rate declined by 8.7 points to 142 per 1000, and
immunization rates increased substantially. The HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is currently
estimated at 5.5 percent of the adult population.

•

The 2003 survey on the monitoring of Government expenditure and the satisfaction of
health sector beneficiaries revealed: (i) the lack of exhaustiveness in data provided by
fund managers especially with regard to the public investment budget; (ii) the
malfunctioning of local public procurement boards; and (iii) the discrepancy between
service quality and the credit amounts committed. The main constraints cited by the
beneficiaries were: poor quality and insufficient staffing, limited patient intake capacity
and low staff salaries. A priority action plan was adopted in April 2004 on the basis of
these findings, which focused on enhancing budget information tracking (production,

- 40 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

dissemination and archiving), improving budget execution and increasing the supply of
health services.
HIPC Completion point triggers
8.
Good progress has been made on the HIPC completion point triggers pertaining to the
social sectors, forestry and transport, but results in terms of improvements in governance were
less satisfactory despite the Government’s efforts (see Annex). Furthermore, the Government
could not implement fully the economic program supported by a PRGF arrangement with the
IMF, which further delayed reaching the HIPC completion point.
II. PROGRAM FOR 2005
9.
The Government’s key objectives for 2005 are consistent with the priorities set in the
PRSP of 2003. The Government is determined to pursue fiscal consolidation to preserve
macroeconomic stability, strengthen investment and economic growth, and improve social
conditions. This will require:
•

strong fiscal policies to ensure medium-term debt sustainability by mobilizing non-oil
revenue to offset the secular decline in oil output; strengthening public expenditure
management and public investment (to improve energy supply and basic infrastructure,
thus inducing private sector growth); and enhancing transparency in Government
operations (including in the oil sector) in order to increase confidence;

•

the further restructuring and privatization of public enterprises to reduce the burden they
impose on public finances; and

•

improvements in governance and the business climate to enhance private sector activity
and growth.

The key policy tools the Government intends to use are set out below.
A. Fiscal Policy
10.
The Government intends to undertake strong efforts in 2005 to improve substantially
the fiscal position through mobilizing additional non-oil revenues and strengthening
expenditure control. The fiscal program takes into account performance up to endDecember 2004. Based on this program, the non-oil primary deficit is expected to improve by
2.5 percentage points of non-oil GDP in 2005, and the overall balance (including grants) is
projected at a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP.
11.
The Government intends to mobilize additional non-oil revenues through the tax policy
measures in the 2005 budget law. The Government expects these measures to increase non-oil
revenue by 1.2 percentage point of non-oil GDP (or 0.9 percent excluding one-time effects) to a
level of 14.7 percent of non-oil GDP.

- 41 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

•

The tax policy measures broaden the tax base and will also strengthen further
compliance with CEMAC tax regulations. The 2005 budget law (i) increased the VAT
rate by 0.5 percentage point from 17 to 17.5 percent; (ii) abolished VAT exemptions on
computer equipment and some food items (meat, frozen fish and sugar); (iii) abolished
the partial excise tax exemption for locally-produced alcoholic beverages and tobacco;
(iv) increased taxation of gambling; (v) imposed a 5 percent registration fee on
Government orders below CFAF5 million; and (vi) increased stamp duties and
automobile registration fees (vignettes).

•

The central government will temporarily retain at the central level half of the VAT
surcharge for local governments (centimes additionels).

•

As regards tax and customs administration, the implementation of the two ambitious
reforms introduced in 2004, i.e., the global income tax and the establishment of the
Large Taxpayer Unit (DGE), will be completed and the remaining difficulties
addressed. The DGE, whose material and human resources will be increased, will
enhance its efforts to increase tax compliance to 100 percent and reduce substantially
the tax arrears accumulated by large companies. Tax audits will be better organized and
made more systematic in order to enhance taxpayer sincerity in the filing of tax returns,
including for personal income taxes, VAT and excises. The Government will improve
forestry taxation through new provisions in the budget law to combat tax evasion
through fraudulent exports and the informal processing of timber. Customs
administration will be strengthened, including through further elimination of
discretionary exemptions and the shift from the PAGODE customs data system to the
automated ASYCUDA system, which was developed by UNCTAD and includes a
value record (fichier de la valeur).

•

If the measures mentioned above should not be sufficient to meet its revenue targets, the
Government stands ready to take further revenue measures. Possible measures will be
discussed with the planned FAD technical assistance mission on tax policy and
administration in April/May 2005. The Government notes the IMF staff’s concern about
the reintroduction of the withholding at source (retenue à la source) on VAT for the
largest companies and will discuss this with the FAD experts during their visit. Finally,
the Government is also considering to introduce a stamp tax (vignette) on imported
tobacco in order to prevent revenue losses due to smuggling.

12.
The Government will also strive to maximize oil revenue. Oil revenue is projected to
decline by 0.8 percentage points of GDP (notwithstanding higher international oil prices) due to
a decline in production volumes, an increase in the discount for Cameroonian petroleum, and
an appreciation of the CFA franc against the US dollar. The Government will ensure the timely
transfer to the Treasury of the surplus of the national oil company (SNH), in accordance with
current arrangements, while ascertaining that the SNH establishes the required provisions for
the decommissioning of oil fields.

- 42 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

13.
As concerns budget expenditure, the Government is determined to keep expenditure
within the 2005 budget limits, and to respect the priority given to expenditures in sectors that
contribute to poverty reduction as identified in the PRSP. Program projections show that noninterest current expenditure will decline by 1.6 percentage points of GDP, while public
investment will be increased by 1.1 percentage point of GDP to attain 3 percent of GDP.
Current expenditure will be restrained through containing non-priority spending, in particular
travel expenses, construction in non-priority sectors, and the acquisition of transport equipment.
The acceleration of public investment will be funded essentially through the use of HIPC
resources, which is expected to increase by 0.7 percent of GDP due to a streamlining of public
investment expenditure procedures.
14.
Expenditure control will be a key priority in 2005, particularly as regards goods and
services spending. In particular, the Government will not resort to payments for spending that
have not yet been committed within the 2005 budget law or within earlier budget laws (except
for judicial costs (frais de justice) that will be strictly monitored). Expenditure commitments
will only be made against budget allocations corresponding to the nature of the actual spending
at the level of the relevant ministry. SNH’s “direct interventions” (interventions directes) are
direct payments made by SNH on behalf of the Government. These payments are retroactively
registered in fiscal operations. Since early 2005 all interventions directes, whether for
sovereign or other spending, require the prior authorization of the Minister of Economy and
Finance, and can be authorized only against remaining budget allocations in the relevant
ministerial budget consistent with the nature of the spending. With the exception of sovereign
spending, these interventions will be discontinued as soon as possible, but no later than by
July 1, 2005 to strengthen expenditure control through the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Other SNH spending (autres charges) of a quasi-fiscal nature will be limited to
CFAF 32 billion in 2005.
15.
During 2005, the Government will implement budgetary regulation measures aimed at
ensuring that the level of expenditures corresponds to the Government’s cash position. For this,
quarterly commitment limits shall be set for the Ministries. For the first and the second quarter
of the year, the ceilings have been set at CFAF 190 billion and CFAF 222 billion, respectively.
16.
Despite the Government’s renewed efforts to mobilize non-oil revenue and to restrain
expenditure, it will face tight financing constraints in 2005. The Government will not be able to
meet in full its external obligations, but intends to clear the technical arrears accumulated at
end-2004, and will request a new rescheduling of Cameroon’s bilateral and commercial debt
obligations later in 2005 (see paragraph 32). Regarding domestic debt obligations, the
Government will prepare by end-February 2005 a draft payment plan for the medium-term for
domestic arrears/debt identified in previous audits and not yet paid, consistent with the
quarterly fiscal program. Negotiations with some of the Government’s nonbank creditors,
including the social security system (CNPS), will be initiated by end-February 2005. In
addition, an audit of domestic debt of the Government is under way and will be finalized by
end-March 2005 to establish the level of arrears/debt accumulated since the previous audits; a
settlement plan for 2005 will be formulated by end-April 2005 for the arrears not yet settled at

- 43 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

that time, consistent with the quarterly budgetary programming. A multi-year settlement plan
for all domestic debt beyond 2005 will be prepared by end-June 2005.
17.
To ease the Government’s financial situation in 2005, the Government intends to raise
additional resources by maximizing the payment of dividends by profitable public enterprises,
and by selling a part of the Government’s minority shares in certain companies, including
through the Douala Stock Exchange. To this end, an initial list of five companies comprising
SEMC (mineral water production and distribution), SOSUCAM (production and marketing of
cane sugar), SOCATRAL (production of corrugated aluminum sheets), ALUBASSA
(production of aluminum household articles), and SAFACAM (oil palm, rubber, forestry) has
been drawn up.
18.
The Government intends to improve Treasury management in 2005. The Treasury’s
resources will be consolidated in a single Treasury account at the BEAC before end-June 2005.
To this effect, the accounts maintained by government entities in commercial banks (except for
those accounts listed in paragraph 23 of the TMU) will be closed and the balance transferred to
the single Treasury account at the BEAC. No new accounts will be opened in commercial
banks after March 31 (except for those accounts listed in paragraph 23 of the TMU). Only the
Treasury will be entitled to open sub-accounts if necessary, and only the Treasury will make
transactions in these accounts at the BEAC in order to facilitate internal Treasury operations. A
government entity could open a deposit account within the single Treasury account as long as
this is operationally necessary.
B. Transparency in Fiscal Management
Financial management and control
19.
Strengthening data management will greatly contribute to improvements in the
monitoring of budgetary execution. The Government intends to use more efficiently the
integrated information and management system (SIGEFI) that became operational in 2003; the
missing computerized links, particularly as regards investment spending, will be established in
2005. In line with the recommendations of the December 2004 FAD technical assistance
mission on fiscal data management and building on SIGEFI, the Government will accelerate
the preparation of fiscal reports by compiling a preliminary version of the Treasury balances no
later than 3 weeks after the reporting month. Beginning with the end-February 2005 data, a
government operations table (TABORD) on a cash basis will be prepared that is consistent with
the Treasury balances, as well as a preliminary expenditure table (using the same format as the
TABORD on cash basis) that shows spending committed (ordonnancements) or paid but not
yet attributed to a budget allocation. Based on the final Treasury balances, starting with the
end-February data, an updated version of the TABORD on a cash basis and a TABORD on a
commitment basis will be prepared within two months after the reporting month. Finally, in the
interest of heightened transparency, the Government will begin publishing monthly budget
execution monitoring documents by end-June.

- 44 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

20.
The civil service payroll will be further streamlined. The Government intends to
provide the results of the implementation of the civil service employment register (SIGIPES:
Système Informatique de Gestion Intégrés des Personnels de l’Etat et de la Solde) in the four
pilot ministries (public administration, economy and finance, health, and education) by endMarch 2005. It intends to stabilize the system in the pilot sites and assure its full functioning by
end-2005.
Oil sector
21.
As regards the oil sector, which contributes significantly to economic activity and
budgetary revenues, the Government intends to continue its efforts toward promoting
transparency.
•

The Government has announced its intention to adhere to the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI).

•

In this context, the Government intends to give more importance to the publication of
information about exploration, production and sales of crude oil in Cameroon, handled
by SNH and other oil companies, as well as the revenue generated and transferred to the
Treasury. The Government will publish before end-June 2005 on the website of SNH
and that of the Prime Minister’s Office, quarterly information on total oil production,
prices, and revenue of the Government for the year 2004, and the first quarter of 2005,
and will update the information on a quarterly basis thereafter.

•

The Government and SNH will publish on their web sites, no later than in June 2005,
the main elements of the audit reports of SNH for both its own activities and those on
behalf of the Government (mandat), the related accounts and the opinion of the
financial auditor for 2000/01, 2001/02, Transitional 2002, and 2003.

•

The Government will strive to obtain the agreement of the oil companies operating in
Cameroon to on the publication of the main elements of the production sharing
agreements.

HIPC resources
22.
The Government is determined to improve the use of HIPC debt relief resources and its
transparency. Consistent with plans to speed up the use of HIPC resources for approved
projects, the Government intends to follow up on the 2004 audit results that covered activities
in 2001-03, by end-March 2005, and the Government will clarify and prioritize the list of
projects approved by the HIPC Consultative Committee (CCS). Moreover, to enhance
transparency, HIPC funds will remain in treasury accounts and will no longer transit through
the government debt agency (CAA), except for counterpart funds governed by bilateral
agreements with external donors. All existing accounts handled by the CAA for the execution
of HIPC projects except for counterpart funds will be closed and their balances transferred to
the Treasury. There will be no payment of expenditure that has not been effectively committed.

- 45 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

The reorganization of the Government of December 8, 2004 strengthens interministerial
coordination on the use of HIPC resources, and will give a new impulse to the interministerial
HIPC Project Implementation Committee (CSR). Consistent with the requirement of the HIPC
completion point triggers, the Government will launch an audit of the use of HIPC relief in
2004 by end-May 2005.
23.
The Government will deposit into the HIPC account opened in the Bank of Central
African States (BEAC) all HIPC interim assistance and related additional debt relief obtained
in 2005. It will, by end-June 2005, in consultation with the staff of the IMF, establish a plan for
making late payments into the HIPC account of amounts owed for earlier interim assistance;
these arrears amounted to CFAF 76 billion at end-2004.
Fiscal decentralization
24.
A cautious approach will be followed throughout the envisaged fiscal decentralization
process. The Government will consult with the IMF staff before making any major change in
the current fiscal framework. To ensure that macro-fiscal stability can be preserved in the
medium-term, the Government will prepare the basis for a solid decentralization framework,
assessing the financial impact of alternative decentralization schemes before adopting a specific
scheme and proceeding with its implementation. The central government’s ability to guide the
overall fiscal policy should be preserved, and adequate controls over local borrowing
introduced. Administrative capacity at the local level would also need to be built up to enable
local governments properly to ensure the timely preparation, implementation, and auditing of
their budgets.
25.
In 2005, the Government will temporarily retain at the central level half of the
surcharge on VAT for local governments; it will reconsider this as soon as the future revenue
sharing to be applied to local governments is specified.
C. Public Enterprises
26.
The Government is determined to reduce the public enterprises losses, which have
affected budgetary resources in recent years. It will demonstrate the importance given to
restoring financial discipline in the public enterprise and utilities sector through timely
payments of all its utility and transport bills to the enterprises concerned (including CAMAIR,
SNEC, CAMRAIL, AES-SONEL, CAMTEL).
27.
For some of the largest companies (CAMAIR, CAMTEL, SNEC, CDC), the
Government intends to make significant progress toward their divestiture. An amount of
CFAF 45 billion has been allocated in the 2005 budget for the privatization of these companies
and for the restructuring of CAMPOST. These resources will be used only when a privatization
strategy and/or an action plan has been adopted, after consultation with the staffs of the IMF
and the World Bank.
•

As concerns CAMAIR, the Government decided in December 2004 to proceed with a
privatization strategy (scission/liquidation/privatisation). Accordingly, it has designated

- 46 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

IFC as the main consultant to advise the Government on the implementation of this
strategy. A detailed strategy and time-bound action plan will be prepared by endJune 2005 with the IFC, approved by the Government by end-July 2005, and
implementation will start from August 2005. In this context, an interim administrator
was appointed in February 2005, whose main task is the implementation of the
privatization process in close collaboration with the advisor to the Government and
under the supervision of the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of
Transport.
•

The Government, in cooperation with the World Bank, has continued to implement the
action plans adopted for privatization of public telecommunications and water
companies (CAMTEL, SNEC). Earlier attempts to privatize these companies failed
because agreement could not be reached with successful bidders in 2003/2004. To
implement successfully the privatization process, the Government intends to take
measures to accelerate the privatization of CAMTEL and a public/private partnership
for SNEC, notably by contributing to their investment plans, which had previously been
approved by the interministerial committee.

•

For CAMTEL, the Government will implement the action plan, developed in
cooperation with the World Bank, as follows: the privatization advisor will be hired
before end-March 2005, the privatization strategy will be adopted by end-July 2005 and
the search for a private majority investor will begin by December 2005 in a manner
agreed with the World Bank.

•

For SNEC, the Government also intends to adopt a privatization plan in May 2005 and
to launch an invitation to bid for a public/private partnership (PPP) in December 2005.
Furthermore, water tariffs, which have been unchanged since 1994, will be increased
gradually to allow the company to reach cost recovery levels, while improving
operational performance. To this effect, the Government plans to finalize the modalities
to increase in the second half of 2005 the charges for water distributed by SNEC on the
basis of simulations using the financial model to be prepared in the context of the
bidding process for the PPP.

•

The Government will implement the privatization strategy for the three remaining
branches of the agro-industrial complex CDC (palm oil, rubber, and banana). To this
end, (i) the privatization strategy will be validated before end-May 2005, (ii) an
investment bank will be hired and complementary studies launched before endAugust 2005, and (iii) the bidding documents will be approved and launched in
December 2005.

•

As for the Cotton Development Corporation (SODECOTON), the Government intends
to recruit an independent internationally renowned firm to review the organization of
the sector and international market constraints, and conduct a diagnostic study of the
corporation to identify options for privatization, by end-2005.

- 47 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

28.
More broadly, the monitoring of the overall situation of public enterprises will be
enhanced. As a component of the ongoing audit on domestic debt mentioned above, the
Government plans to identify by end-June 2005 the cross-liabilities between the Government
and public enterprises. In this context, in the perspective of the HIPC completion point and
updates of the debt sustainability analysis, the Government will establish a detailed record of
external debt of public enterprises. The government will then ensure a monitoring of the
external debt of public enterprises on an annual basis. Furthermore, an assessment of the
consolidated position of the 20 largest public companies, on the basis of their financial
accounts for 2004, will be carried out by end-June 2005 and updated regularly.
D. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
29.
Monetary policy will continue to be directed toward ensuring low inflation and securing
the peg of the CFA franc to the euro. The monetary program for 2005 foresees (i) an increase in
net bank claims on the central government of CFAF 35 billion at the end of 2005, reflecting
mostly a large drawdown from the HIPC account partly offset by the repayment of securitized
debt to the BEAC and commercial banks and of net liabilities to the IMF; (ii) an expansion of
credit to the private sector by 6.1 percent; and (iii) a contribution by Cameroon to the net
foreign assets of the BEAC by CFAF 15 billion by end-December 2005. Reflecting this
program, money supply is expected to increase by 7.6 percent in 2005.
30.
To strengthen the financial sector, the Government will step up its efforts to address the
financial difficulties of government-owned financial institutions.
•

For CAMPOST, the Government is aware that it holds a specific financial responsibility
as the deposits are government-guaranteed. In the short term, the Government has
decided to pay all the new deposits received as of January 2005 into a special account at
the BEAC. The following measures will be implemented in the coming months: (i) an
audit will be completed by end-June 2005 to assess the actual level of CAMPOST’s
liabilities and, a preliminary balance sheet will be established by end-August 2005 that
presents separately the postal and financial activities; (ii) a consultant team will be hired
to help the management with the restructuring of the company by end-September 2005;
(iii) a social plan will be elaborated by end-July 2005 and implemented in the course of
2005; and (iv) the Government will initiate a process aimed at separating the financial
and the postal activities in August 2005. Moreover, the Government has requested the
COBAC to prepare an analysis of the conditions that will be required for CAMPOST to
obtain a license as a financial institution. CAMPOST will initiate the process of
obtaining this license from September 2005.

•

As regards the housing credit organization (Credit Foncier), the restructuring plan
formulated in 2003 under the supervision of the COBAC will be strictly implemented;
the COBAC will continue to monitor its implementation on a quarterly basis. In
particular, renewed efforts will be launched to recover nonperforming loans. The
Government will also launch in 2005 a study on (i) the participation of the banking
sector in the financing of private housing, a role that is now mostly played by the Credit

- 48 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

Foncier, and (ii) how the subsidy now allocated to the Credit Foncier and funded from
an earmarked income tax surcharge could be directed toward the financing of social
housing.
31.
The Government will continue to implement at the national level the ongoing regional
initiatives to reform the financial sector and promote transparency. Regarding the microfinance
sector, all the microfinance institutions will be registered by the Ministry of the Economy and
Finance under the supervision of COBAC by end-March 2005 latest. Licensed microfinance
institutions will be subject to a basic financial and accounting supervision by COBAC in
collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and Finance until an appropriate accounting
framework is put in place. The Government will see to the effective closure of those
microfinance institutions that are denied a license. Cooperation with the national association of
Microfinance institutions (ANEMCAM) will be strengthened. Moreover, the authorities have
undertaken to create a national Financial Intelligence Unit (ANIF) by end-May 2005 in
accordance with CEMAC’s regulation on combating money laundering and the financing of
terrorism.
E. External Sector
Strengthening external debt management
32.
In light of the tight budgetary constraints, the Government will not be able to fully meet
the obligations due to bilateral and commercial creditors in the near future. The Government
intends to request a new Paris Club rescheduling later in 2005 once a 3-year economic program
that can be supported by the IMF under a new PRGF arrangement has been approved by the
IMF Board. In order to reduce the stock of arrears on external debt to commercial creditors, the
Government will continue to seek agreement on comparable terms with commercial creditors
who did not participate in the buyback operation of August 2003.
Trade policies
33.
Cameroon intends to promote the strengthening of regional integration in the CEMAC,
and seek a reduction in the common external tariff and the number of tariff headings. Similarly,
the Government will establish in 2005 the practical and operational modalities of the
investment charter it adopted in line with the common CEMAC charter.
F. Governance and Other Structural Reforms
Governance
34.
The Government plans to take decisive steps in the frame work of its program to
improve transparency and governance. By end-June 2005, the Government will, with donor
assistance, complete a comprehensive update of its National Governance Program. The
Government will continue implementing its priority action plan for judicial reform, which is
designed to fight corruption through improving the enforcement of laws, ensuring the

- 49 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

independence of the judiciary and improving the working conditions of judiciary employees. It
will also prepare enabling legislation to apply the UN convention against corruption in
Cameroon.
35.
The Government intends to make the Audit Office (Chambre des comptes) operational
by end-December 2005 and continue implementing the action plan for setting up the
Constitutional Council. The 2005 budget contains allocations for the purchase and adaptation
of appropriate premises for the Audit Office, staff training and the drafting of procedure
manuals.
Social Policies and Poverty Reduction Strategy Follow-up and Update
36.
Progress has been made in the implementation of the strategy spelled out in the PRSP of
2003. This was reviewed in the first annual progress report (covering April 2003-March 2004),
which was submitted to the Fund and World Bank in July 2004. The Government will continue
to prepare annual progress reports to review progress in implementation, consistent with the
recommendations of the Technical Committee for the Monitoring and Evaluation of PRSP
Implementation Activities, the analytical quality of the reports will be enhanced. The
Government is undertaking a study to improve participatory monitoring. The terms of reference
have been prepared and submitted to development partners and civil society for comments and
will be finalized by end-March 2005.
37.
The next annual PRSP progress report will be finalized by end-September 2005. In the
meantime, the Government will revise, by end-June 2005, some of the main elements of the
PRSP, in preparation, among other things, for the 2006 budget and a 3-year economic program
for which the government intends to request a new PRGF arrangement with the IMF. These
elements include: (i) an update of the medium-term macroeconomic framework and poverty
rate projections; (ii) an update of the PRSP section on the sources of growth and the role of the
private sector; (iii) outlines of the medium-term sectoral strategies (e.g., industrial and trade
development; tourism; mines; energy; post and telecommunications; and decentralization); and
(iv) the development of a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework drawing on
new sectoral components that will underpin the overall PRSP and budget strategy. It is
currently finalizing a social development strategy paper that focuses on employment, social
security and national solidarity, promotion of gender equity and equality, satisfaction of basic
needs, social education and specific urban development problems.
38.
To improve PRSP impact monitoring and the analysis of poverty trends, the
Government is gradually putting into place a statistical framework capable of producing
indicators for the monitoring of progress towards the PRSP and the Millennium Development
Goals (MDG). This framework is created with the support of development partners. To ensure
quick progress in the production of statistical information, the Government will make the
National Statistics Institute fully functional by putting into place its governing bodies. The
Government has started preparations for a new census; the data collection will be completed by
end-2005.

- 50 -

ATTACHMENT I

Reform of the downstream petroleum sector
39.
The Government intends to further liberalize downstream activities in the oil sector.
Despite the lack of competitiveness of the national refinery SONARA (partly due to incomplete
technology and limited size), the Government considers the refinery as essential for domestic
energy security. To this effect, it provides market protection for SONARA’s products by
limiting imports to 20 percent of domestic demand and by applying a surcharge above world
market prices. The Government is aware of the substantial costs that this imposes on the
economy, and is determined to reduce them. One option might be to find a strategic partner
willing to invest in upgrading the refinery’s technology (hydrocracking) and operate the
refinery on a competitive basis. In the meantime, the Government will allow SONARA to
recoup the sizeable losses it incurred in 2004 as a result of the slowing and later suspension of
the mechanism that adjusted domestic petroleum product prices on a monthly basis in line with
international market prices. Fuel prices were raised in December 2004 and January 2005, and
the adjustment mechanism will be reinstated fully as of February 2005 and a loss-recovery
element will be added during 2005 to fully recoup the losses incurred in 2004. Furthermore, the
Government will continue to monitor the performance contract with SONARA.
40.
With respect to the national petroleum storage company (SCDP), the Government will
pursue an action plan that was elaborated together with the World Bank and adopt it by
May 2005 with the objective of privatizing SCDP.
Forestry Sector
41.
The Government will continue to implement and deepen the reforms in the areas of
forestry and protection of the environment that were introduced under the Third Structural
Adjustment Credit (SACIII). In particular, by end-June 2005, the Government will (i) sign (or
issue a motivated rejection of) acts that provide clarity of land ownership status in a total of
38 forest management units (décrets de classement), (ii) sign final concession contracts with
companies that have been found in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and
(iii) sign a new three-year contract with an Independent Observer while making uninterrupted
and effective use in the field of the support provided by the present Independent Observer, until
the new Independent Observer has become operational.
Energy Sector
42.
Energy problems are a major concern for the Government as insufficient electricity
supply has restrained economic growth. After having privatized the National Electricity
Corporation (SONEL) with IFC assistance, and in view of the insufficient energy supply,
which constitutes a major handicap for industrial activities, the Government is gradually
putting in place, in collaboration with the World Bank and the AFD, the components of its
strategy for strengthening supply in the medium and long term. In this context, the Government
will work closely with the World Bank to accelerate preparations for the possible construction
of a natural gas-fired plant at Kribi, and to develop a comprehensive energy sector study to
determine the best strategy for ensuring Cameroon’s longer-term energy security; this study

- 51 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

will identify the optimal sequencing of further generation plants based on such criteria as cost
and environmental impact.
Transport Sector
43.
The Government has made substantial progress with the implementation of the port
sector, particularly regarding the port of Douala, and is committed to completing the reform in
2005, including by upgrading capacities through the introduction of information technology in
port operations. In the rail transport sector, the Government will meet its obligations toward the
private operator (CAMRAIL) in accordance with the concession contract, and pay on a timely
basis the annual subsidy of CFAF 2.5 billion as agreed for traveler service on the basis of the
audit report prepared for this purpose; it will also ensure the payment of related arrears. In
return, it will require that the private concession holder equally meet commitments taken in
particular with respect to investment and quality of service. As regards road transport, the
Government is determined to rehabilitate the road network, which has significantly deteriorated
as a result of poor maintenance. It is therefore committed to (i) applying the memorandum of
understanding agreed with the European Union in May 2004; (ii) securing increase of
maintenance funding; and (iii) implementing institutional reforms, including that of the Road
Fund. Given the very high cost of rehabilitating and maintaining roads, the Government will do
its utmost to secure available external funding, including the grants offered by the European
Union.
G. Program Monitoring
44.
A prior action (Table 1) that is critical for ensuring the timely implementation of the
Staff Monitored Program (SMP) for 2005 will need to be in place prior to a discussion of the
program by the Executive Board of the IMF.
45.
In order to monitor program implementation, the Government has established a number
of reform measures as structural benchmarks (Table 1) and quantitative benchmarks (Table 2).
The Government will review the implementation of the program together with the staff of the
IMF on a quarterly basis.
46.
In view of the uncertainties surrounding oil prices, external budget support, external
debt relief and privatization receipts, the program includes built-in contingency mechanisms
explained in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
47.
Program implementation will be regularly reviewed in the context of interministerial
cabinet meetings (Conseils de Cabinet), chaired by the Prime Minister, Head of Government.
The Minister of Economy and Finance will supervise the implementation of the program, with
the assistance of the Technical Committee for the Monitoring of Economic Programs (CTS).
The CTS will provide the staff of the IMF, within the time limits indicated in the TMU, with all
the data necessary to monitor the supported program effectively and on a timely basis.
48.
The authorities will continue their efforts to expand the coverage of data and improve
data quality and timeliness, particularly in the context of the General Data Dissemination

- 52 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

System (GDDS). With regard to national accounts, the Government compiled a new official
data series on national accounts in accordance with the new National Accounts System adopted
in 1993 (SNA93). In this context, the government and the staff of the IMF will adopt the new
series, after revision of some data, as soon as possible. This new series will be critical for
formulating, monitoring and assessing economic policies.

The Enhanced HIPC Initiative Completion Point Triggers—Progress Through 2004
This interim note takes stock of developments through end-2004 towards the HIPC
completion point triggers. It provides a factual update without passing judgment on the
attainment of specific triggers. Good progress has been made on the HIPC completion point
triggers pertaining to the social sectors and combating HIV/AIDS, but improvements in
governance have been less satisfactory and the government was unable to implement fully
the PRGF arrangement that expired in December 2004. Enhancements in public expenditure
management have been achieved through the establishment of an integrated financial
management system, but to improve fiscal transparency these should be integrated into
normal government operations and fiscal reporting. PRSP implementation since it was
completed in April 2003 has been less than comprehensive.
The government has established a number of committees to oversee progress on the
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy, the attainment of the HIPC completion
point triggers, and use of HIPC relief for social expenditures, but the operations of these
committees have suffered from inadequate coordination with normal government operations.
The progress in implementing the HIPC completion point triggers as of end-2004 was the
following:
1. The full PRSP has been prepared and satisfactorily implemented for at least one year.
The full PRSP was completed in April 2003, and in July 2003, the Executive Boards of the
IMF and the World Bank concluded it provided a satisfactory framework for the
implementation of the authorities’ poverty reduction strategy. The first Annual Progress
Report on the implementation of the PRSP, examining implementation of the strategy from
April 2003 to March 2004, was submitted to the IMF and the World Bank in July 2004.
Overall, the progress report provides a relatively non-critical evaluation of progress, which
has been good in some areas but modest elsewhere. One area of particular concern has been
capital expenditure falling consistently short of that needed to achieve the objectives of the
PRSP. This seriously undermines Cameroon’s medium-term growth prospects given the
country’s strong infrastructure needs, particularly in the areas of energy and water provision
and roads.
2. There is continued maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment and
satisfactory implementation of a new three-year PRGF arrangement.
In recent years, Cameroon’s growth and inflation performance has been solid, but fiscal
performance weakened considerably in 2004. Non-oil revenue fell from 14½ percent of nonoil GDP in 2003 to 13½ percent in 2004, and the non-oil primary deficit deteriorated by
almost 2 percentage points of GDP to reach 2.4 percent of GDP. Also, payments on domestic
public debt and utility bills continued to fall behind, and the financial situation of some large
public enterprises deteriorated. As a result of these developments, the PRGF arrangement
went off-track.

- 56 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX I

3. The budgetary savings from the debt relief have been used in accordance with the
criteria set forth at the decision point.
The decision point document stipulates that programs and projects specifically related to
poverty-reduction should be identified as such to allow a separation from other budgetary
spending. While this was done, overall of poverty-related expenditure cannot be easily
extracted as the breakdown of expenditure by function is not comprehensive, making a
determination of the additionality of the HIPC spending difficult.
The document also calls for the establishment of a special Treasury account where the
budgetary savings from HIPC relief would be deposited, and for regular auditing of the
account with public dissemination of the audit results. The account has been established and
the mechanisms for using it have been operating. However, the government has fallen behind
in transferring realized HIPC relief to it. An audit on the use of the HIPC resources from
July 2001-December 2003 was conducted and presented to the HIPC Consultative
Committee in September 2004. Another audit is being contracted for the use of HIPC
resources in 2004.
Further, the document demands the establishment of a monitoring committee consisting of
representatives of the donor community and civil society. Such a committee was established
in October 2002. The committee’s work in 2002-03 focused on the selection of projects
eligible for the use of HIPC resources, but their actual implementation was hampered by
inadequate integration of HIPC spending in the budget execution cycle, resulting in slow
disbursement of project funds. This process was, however, improved substantially in 2004.
The document further requires that an inter-ministerial committee coordinate quarterly
financial and technical reports on the use of HIPC relief, to be discussed with the monitoring
committee and made public through the media. In addition, the reports are to be discussed in
semi-annual regional seminars. Voluminous reports have been published by the interministerial committee and discussed at the monitoring committee, but they remain largely
descriptive and do not offer much analysis of progress made towards the poverty reduction
goals. Also, the regional seminars have not been held.
Finally, the criteria require that the involvement of donors and all relevant stakeholders in the
use and monitoring of the debt resources be detailed in the full PRSP. This is the case.
4. SAC III has been concluded and reforms have been implemented in a satisfactory
manner.
The third structural adjustment credit, which was concluded in March 2004, supported a set
of politically complex and ambitious reforms in the areas of transport, financial and forestry
reforms and privatization. The time it took (since 1998) to implement this broad ranging
agenda has in effect led to a stronger ownership of the reforms envisioned in the program.

- 57 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX I

4.1. Financial Sector
All financial sector conditions linked to SACIII were satisfactorily implemented. The
banking and insurance systems were successfully restructured, which led to an improvement
in the quality and availability of financial services.
4.2. Privatization
Overall, tangible progress has been made under the privatization program under the World
Bank’s SACII and SACIII. Mixed progress was recorded since the decision point.
Regarding telecommunications, the government has opened the sector to competition by
issuing two cellular licenses, leading to improved service and lower costs. Also, some agroindustrial units such as SOCAPALM, CAMSUCO and the tea component of CDC were
privatized, which led to an increase in planted surface and production.
However, the electricity company (SONEL) was privatized, but encountered severe
difficulties, largely due to lack of managerial competence and financial resources. No bids
were received for the sale of the three remaining crops of the agro-industrial complex CDC.
Also, negotiations with the bidders for the fixed telecoms (CAMTEL) and water (SNEC)
companies fell through. Despite these setbacks, the Government has remained committed to
the privatization of the telecoms, water and agroindustrial complex and with the assistance of
IDA, has reviewed its approach to privatization and has relaunched the process.
4.3. Transport Sector
Road sector: an autonomous Road Fund was established in 1998 to secure adequate funding
and timely disbursement of road maintenance activities by the private sector. The amount and
quality of road maintenance financed by the Road Fund have steadily increased over the last
three years of its operations, although services provided continue to lag far behind needs.
Port reform: Ambitious and far-ranging institutional reforms have been completed resulting
in reduced costs and clearance times, and streamlined operations significantly.
4.4. Forestry Sector
Cameroon was a pioneer in the implementation of politically very complex and ambitious
reforms in the forestry sector in order to improve governance. The reforms supported by
SAC III have created a policy and regulatory environment and an incentive framework
conducive to environmentally sustainable development for the sector.
5. The priority strategy and action plan for improving governance and combating
corruption attached to the I-PRSP have been satisfactorily implemented, in particular:
•

In the area of judicial reform, (i) the Chambre des Comptes (audit office)
and (ii) the Conseil Constitutionnel have been created.

- 58 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I
ANNEX I

•

The public procurement system has been reformed and, in particular, audits
for the preceding fiscal year have been completed and appropriate follow-up
actions implemented, in accordance with the law.

•

In the area of budgetary execution and service delivery, the results of the
budget tracking exercises and beneficiary assessments for education and
health have been published and the relevant recommendations have been
implemented.

In June 2000, the Government approved the National Governance Program (PNG) that was
prepared through a participatory process involving all active forces within the Cameroonian
Society. To ensure effective implementation of the PNG, the Government adopted a Priority
Action Plan in August 2000, to improve governance and fight corruption.
In the area of the judicial sector reform, the government has conducted a technical diagnostic
study to identify the obstacles explaining the poor performance of Cameroon Justice system
and recommended institutional measures to improve the quality of the judicial system. The
study serves as the basis for the operational action plan that was developed and adopted in
December 2003 during a seminar involving all main stakeholders. The Government has
tackled the problem of abusive attachment of bank accounts (saisie attribution), which was
threatening the financial sector and business confidence in 2001/02.
The law specifying the responsibilities, organization, and functioning of the audit office for
State Finances (Chambre des Comptes) of Cameroon’s Supreme Court was adopted in 2003.
The president and 2 members of the audit office were nominated in April 2004; the
nomination of the remaining financial magistrates is necessary for the office to become
operational.
The laws specifying the responsibilities, organization, and functioning of the Constitutional
Council were adopted by the National Assembly in March 2004. A revised action plan,
specifying next steps for making the council operational while taking into account financial
constraints, is to be prepared.
The public procurement system has been satisfactorily reformed, with a new public
procurement code, fully operational oversight agency and special oversight committees, and
regular ex-post audits for public contracts. The focus should now be on taking sanctions
against identified cases of misconduct.
The Government carried out a budget tracking and beneficiary assessment in the health and
education sectors in 2004 in order to evaluate the quality of public expenditure and identify
bottlenecks that hamper its effectiveness. The health report has been produced and an action
plan adopted, while the education is being finalized.

6. Regulatory agencies for key sectors (including water, electricity, and
telecommunications) are autonomous and are operating in an efficient and professional
manner.
Regulatory agencies have been set up in the telecoms and electricity sector. In the telecoms
sector, an independent regulatory authority has been established which is separate, in a legal
and functional sense, from the postal ministry and has its own sources of finance; this
regulator is functioning effectively.
7. Education sector. The sector strategy has been satisfactorily implemented in a timely
manner, and in particular: (i) 2500 new classrooms have been built; and (ii) teacher
management has been effectively decentralized and new teacher statutes have been
adopted and implemented.
The Government has continued to implement the Education Sector Strategy of 2000. School
enrollment rates have increased significantly as school fees in public primary schools were
abolished, and instruction materials were allocated to schools. However, repetition and dropout rates remain very high and only 60 percent of children complete primary education. A
law aiming at promoting private education institutions was approved by Parliament. The
government rehabilitated and constructed classrooms in public primary and secondary
schools with focus on priority education zones; as of March 2004, over 2800 classrooms had
been built and resources for further construction have been budgeted.
In an attempt to reduce the excessive centralization, the Government has started to take
measures decentralize resource management, and this process is continuing according to a
timetable agreed with IDA. School councils, including beneficiaries, local communities,
parents, students and teachers, have responsibility for budget supervision, and general control
and evaluation of school operations. The Education sector governance watchdog
(Observatoire de la Gouvernance) has been created and has reported on several cases
involving corruption, which led to sanctions.
8. Health sector. The sector strategy has been satisfactorily implemented in a timely
manner, and in particular: (i) child immunization rates for DPT have been increased to
70 percent; and (ii) knowledge about protection and prevention measures against malaria
will have substantially increased, i.e., 50 percent of pregnant women are using
impregnated bed-nets.
Implementation of the Government’s Health Sector Strategy since October 2001 yielded a
number of results. All health district teams have been put in place and provided with
operating budgets; the decentralization of health services to the provincial and peripheral
levels is very advanced. The Government has started sub-contracting NGOs, which often
work in remote areas not served by the public sector.
A number of major public health programs (e.g., immunization, malaria, HIV/AIDS) have
been revamped during the past few years with good initial results. The vigorous
implementation of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) increased immunization
rates (for example, for DPCT3 from 43 percent in 2001 to 72 percent in 2003). Similar

- 60 -

efforts have been made to restructure and reinforce the malaria program. HIPC resources
were instrumental in the distribution of free impregnated bed nets to pregnant women, and
the government has taken a number of measures to improve their availability and use.
9. Concrete progress has been made to prioritize the fight against HIV/AIDS in the
government’s overall development agenda and to curb infection rates among the
population, with particular emphasis on education to promote the use of condoms by truck
drivers, port workers, and soldiers to 50 percent, and by commercial sex workers to
70 percent.
The government adopted a strategic plan for the 2000-05 period to combat HIV/AIDS, which
has mobilized and funded over 3,000 communities through public-private-religious
partnerships. Key accomplishments include: (i) expanded voluntary counseling and testing;
(ii) reduced mother to child HIV transmission; (iii) promotion of ARV therapy through
18 designated centers nationwide and cost reduction of ARV treatment by 70 percent. Some
7,500 patients have been placed under ARV treatment, including 700 low-income patients.
Communication activities to induce behavior changes have focused on a massive
communication campaign through public and private media and the distribution of condoms.
The HIV/AIDS infection rate estimate was revised downward to 5.5 percent of the adult
population in 2004.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding
on the Definitions of the Targets of the Staff-Monitored Program for 2005
and the Modalities of Their Adjustment
A. Introduction
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Cameroonian authorities
and the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the
targets of the staff monitored program (SMP) and the contingency mechanism related
thereto. It also specifies the program’s exchange rate projection and the data-reporting
requirements.
B. Definitions
External debt
2.
“Debt” shall have the meaning set out in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements (Decision No. 12274–00/85,
dated August 24, 2000).
Concessionality of external debt
3.
Debt is considered to be concessional if it includes a grant element equivalent to
35 percent or more, calculated on the basis of the commercial interest reference rate (CIRR)
and following the methodology set out in staff paper on “Limits on External Debt or
Borrowing in Fund Arrangement – Proposed Change in Implementation of the Revised
Guidelines” approved by the IMF Executive Board on April 15, 1996.
Cash relief from external debt rescheduling
4.
For the purpose of the program, the only form of debt relief that will be subject to the
contingency mechanism described below is the one that leads to an effective reduction in
programmed debt service. This excludes any relief given on debt that has been in drawn-out
rescheduling/restructuring negotiations with non-Paris Club creditors and for which no debt
service has been paid in the past year—for example, debts to be considered under the debtand debt-service reduction operations with commercial creditors, and for which no provision
for debt service has been made in the fiscal program (except for up-front costs).
Domestic debt
Structured debt
5.
Structured debt is defined as the stock of debt as of end-December 2004 resulting
from the multiyear settlement plan for public domestic arrears as recorded by the Caisse
Autonome d’Amortissement (CAA). At end-December 2004, the stock of this debt (excluding
BEAC’s advances) amounted to CFAF590.1 billion. Such debt comprises two categories:

- 62 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

securitized debt and nonsecuritized debt. Securitized debt comprises consolidated BEAC
debt and bank debt, cross debt that is supported by a formal agreement, insurance company
debt, securitized public works (BTP) debt and securitized wage arrears. Nonsecuritized debt
includes, nonsecuritized public works (BTP) debt, debt to the public, semipublic and private
enterprises; and wage arrears (Rompus). Structured debt service consists of principal and
interest.
Nonstructured debt
6.
Nonstructured domestic debt was contracted by the state of Cameroon and specified
in the multiyear settlement plan for public domestic arrears as recorded by the Caisse
Autonome d’Amortissement (CAA). As of end-December 2004, this debt amounted to
CFAF179.8 billion. Nonstructured debt is defined as debt not yet subject to a formal
agreement (convention), cash payment, or securitization. Nonstructured debt service consists
of principal and interest.
Arrears identified in early 2005 debt audit
7.
All payments that are made for expenses incurred in 2004 or earlier, including the
payments of arrears that will be established in the early 2005 audit of domestic debt of the
State of Cameroon, are included as budgetary expenditures and recorded within the
expenditure items as described below, with the exception of the payments made under
CAA’s multiyear settlement plan described above.
Government financial operations table (TOFE)
8.
The Treasury balance (Balance des comptes du Trésor) shows Government revenue
and expenditure posted in Class 6 accounts (current expenditure), Class 7 accounts (current
revenue), and Class 2 accounts (investment operations). Debt-related operations are recorded
in Class 1 accounts (debt operations) and partly in Class 5 (financial operations).The
financial operations data must be consistent with the data in the treasury account at the
BEAC. Data on provisional revenue and expenditure operations and deposits of the
correspondents of the treasury are recorded in Class 4 accounts of the Government's chart of
accounts (plan comptable). Government operations that are not carried out through the
treasury need to be added to the data on operations that are directly carried out through the
treasury. Revenue and expenditure operations are recorded on a cash basis. Carryover
operations (opérations de journée complémentaire), if any, are recorded in the final month of
the fiscal year.
Non-oil revenue
9.
Non-oil revenue comprises all central Government (tax and non-tax) revenue,
excluding revenue from oil companies and the redevance pétrolière. VAT is recorded net of
VAT refunds. The pipeline fee is recorded as part of non-tax revenue.

- 63 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Privatization proceeds
10.
For the purpose of this memorandum, privatization proceeds will be understood to
mean all funds received by the central Government from the sale or concessioning of the
operation of a public company or organization or publicly owned facilities to one or more
private company(ies) (including companies that are fully controlled by foreign
Government(s), private organization(s), or individual(s)). Privatization receipts also include
all funds received from the sale of shares owned by the Government in private companies or
public enterprises. All privatization proceeds should be recorded on a gross basis; if any costs
are incurred in connection with the sale or concessioning, these must be recorded separately
as expenditure. Privatization proceeds are recorded as a financing item in the fiscal
operations table.
Non-oil primary budget balance
11.
The non-oil primary budget balance (on a cash basis) is calculated as central
Government non-oil revenue, excluding external grants, less all expenditure other than
interest payments, foreign-financed investment expenditure, restructuring expenses, and
separation grants.
Net bank credit to the Government
12.
Net claims on the central Government by the banking system comprise the stock of
all outstanding claims on the central Government (loans, advances, and any Government debt
instruments, such as long-term Government securities) by the banking system, less all
deposits held by the central Government with the banking system, excluding the HIPC
account.
Replenishment of the HIPC account
13.
The target relating to “replenishment of the HIPC account” will be considered
observed if the HIPC account at the Bank of Central Africa States (BEAC) receives the
quarterly transfers indicated in Table 2 of the MEFP, and transfers from this account are
made solely for the purposes of paying for HIPC projects.
Payments to utility companies
14.
The target relating to “payment to utility companies” will be considered observed if
payments to the utility companies (water, electricity, fixed-line telephones, and railway
company) are made in quarterly amounts, as indicated in Table 2 of the MEFP. These
payments are understood to exclude fiscal compensation, and they are assessed on the basis
of cash disbursements. They are to be registered as current expenditures in the TOFE.

- 64 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Budgetary spending advances (interventions directes) by SNH
15.
Budgetary spending advances (interventions directes) are defined as advance
payments by the SNH on behalf of its Government mandate in oil operations (mandat). They
are deducted from the monthly cash revenue that are transferred by the SNH to the
Government. Such advance payments will be strictly limited to sovereign expenditure from
July 2005 on. Interventions directes will continue to be imputed in the table on financial
operations of the government (TOFE) on a monthly basis on the revenue and expenditure
side.
Quasi-fiscal spending by SNH (autres charges)
16.
SNH’s spending to cover costs that are not shared with the other oil companies as part
of the production-sharing agreements are called autres charges (other spending). Some of
this is related to SNH’s Government mandate in oil operations (mandat), e.g.,
decommissioning costs. Other elements of this spending are not related to SNH’s oil sector
activities and quasi-fiscal in nature (e.g., the cost of operating the Chad-Cameroon oil
pipeline).
C. Modalities of the Contingency Mechanism for the Adjustment of Targets
17.

The ceiling on net bank credit to the Government will be adjusted

•

upward by half the amount of lower-than-programmed oil revenue;

•

upward/downward by half the amount of lower/higher-than-programmed external
budget support including debt relief;

•

downward by the full amount of lower-than-programmed restructuring expenditure;

•

downward by the full amount of lower-than-programmed payments of domestic debt
(as defined above);

18.
Higher-than-programmed oil revenue and all privatization proceeds will be allocated
to repayments of domestic debt (as defined above) and/or the replenishment of the HIPC
account above the program targets.
19.
In case the shortfall/excess in oil revenue, external budget support (including debt
relief), privatization revenue, and/or adjustments in the ceiling on net bank credit to the
Government exceed a cumulative 0.2 percent of GDP, the Government will consult with the
staff of the IMF to formulate corrective policies and to adjust the targets of the program.
D. Program Exchange Rates
20.
Exchange rates to be applied for the conversion of amounts in SDR or U.S. dollars
are US$1.5403 per SDR and CFAF 488.46 per U.S. dollar for the first quarter 2005,

- 65 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

US$1.5403 per SDR and CFAF 488.38 per U.S. dollar for the second quarter 2005,
US$1.5404 per SDR and CFAF 488.34 per U.S. dollar for the third quarter 2005, and
US$1.5407 per SDR and CFAF 488.34 per U.S. dollar for the fourth quarter 2005. IMF
liabilities, which are included in the definition of net claims on the central Government by
the banking system, will be valued at the same exchange rates. Any deviation from the
exchange rate will lead to a full upward or downward adjustment, as appropriate, of the value
of the stock of IMF liabilities at the central bank, and to a similar adjustment of the ceiling on
net bank claims on the Government by the banking system.
E. Prior Action
21.
The prior action on the signing of a contract on privatization (scission-liquidationprivatisation) of CAMAIR will be considered observed when the contract between the
Government and the advisor will be formally signed by both relevant parties. The contract
will include the terms of reference of the advisor and the length of the mandate (which will
not exceed 18 months altogether). The terms of reference will indicate that the advisor will
be guided by the following principles: (i) the existing company CAMAIR will be liquidated;
(ii) if a new airline company is established with the viable assets of CAMAIR, the
Government will hold a minority share in this company; and (iii) the Government will not
inject in 2005 any other budgetary support beyond (a) covering the costs related to
liquidation of the existing company, and (b) transferring the viable assets to the new airline
company if it is established. The terms of reference will be submitted for consideration to the
staffs of the IMF and the World Bank prior to the signing of the contract.
F. Structural Benchmarks
Suspension of budgetary spending advances by SNH (interventions directes) except for
sovereign spending
22.
The structural benchmark (continuous basis) on the suspension of budgetary spending
advances by SNH except for sovereign spending will be considered to be observed if, as of
July 1, 2005, SNH no longer makes advance payments on behalf of the Government
(interventions directes), other than sovereign spending, on account of its Government
mandate in oil operations (mandat). From July 2005, the monthly cash transfer to the
Treasury by SNH on account of its Government oil operations during the month should be
equal to the transferable balance less sovereign expenditure as calculated by the SNH and
agreed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Consolidation of Government accounts in commercial banks into single Treasury
account at the BEAC
23.
The structural benchmark (continuous basis) on the consolidation of all Government
accounts into the single Treasury account at the BEAC will be considered met if no new
government accounts at commercial banks are opened from March 31, 2005 and if all
government accounts are closed by end-June 2005. This excludes accounts managed by a

- 66 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

public legal management committee (e.g., management committee of schools), and those
required to manage externally-funded projects. A report prepared by the Treasury that
documents the effective closure of the government accounts and the transfer of the remaining
balances to the single Treasury account of the BEAC will be submitted to the staff of the
IMF.
Domestic arrears payment plan
24.
The structural benchmark on the preparation of a plan to repay domestic arrears will
be considered observed upon receipt by the staff of the IMF of a detailed plan specifying the
arrears repayment schedule over time. The plan will be based on the audit undertaken in early
2005 of domestic debt, which will compile all Government arrears and debt as of end-2004
that have not yet been established by previous audits. The plan will specify the repayment
schedule by main categories of creditors, including public enterprises and autonomous
Government agencies. The schedule will be specified on a quarterly basis in 2005, consistent
with the Government’s quarterly financial program, and on an annual basis beyond 2005.
Preparation of consistent fiscal reports
25.
The structural benchmark on the preparation by end-March 2005 of a fiscal
operations table (TABORD) consistent with the Treasury balances (Balance des Comptes du
Trésor) and the data provided by the information and financial management system (SIGEFI)
will be considered observed following the receipt by the staff of the IMF of a table tracking
the consistency of data provided by the SIGEFI. In particular, this refers to the consistency
between (i) the data of the preliminary Treasury balances, from the end-February 2005 data,
and the TABORD on a cash basis using the new chart of accounts; (ii) the preliminary data
reported by the Budget Directorate, which will include budgetary commitments
(ordonnancement)—using the same presentation as in the TABORD—and operations outside
normal budgetary procedures, and the payments on account of fiscal year 2005 only as
reported by the preliminary Treasury balances; (iii) the data reported by the Budget
Directorate on budgetary commitments (ordonnancement) in the fiscal year 2005 and the
payments on account of fiscal year 2005 only as reported by the preliminary Treasury
balances; and (iv) the data from the CAA and the preliminary Treasury balances.
Replenishment of HIPC account
26.
The structural benchmark on a plan to replenish the HIPC account by end-June 2005
will be considered observed following completion of a plan specifying the repayment
schedule of the counterpart of the debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative that has not
been transferred to the HIPC account at the BEAC at end-December 2004; this amounted to
CFAF76 billion. The repayment schedule will take into account the quarterly financial
programming of the budget for 2005, including the quantitative targets on the replenishment
of the HIPC account at the BEAC (as indicated above), and medium-term budget projections.

- 67 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Action plan on privatization (scission-liquidation-privatisation) of CAMAIR
27.
The structural benchmark on the preparation and adoption by end-June 2005 of a
detailed time-bound action plan for the privatization (scission-liquidation-privatisation) of
CAMAIR will be considered observed upon receipt by the staff of the IMF of a detailed
action plan formally adopted by the Government, drawn up in coordination with the advisor,
and that specifies a timeline allowing for the completion of the privatization (scissionliquidation-privatisation). The action plan will comply with the guiding principles described
in the prior action above. It will be submitted to the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank for
their consideration prior to its approval by the Government.
Separation of postal and financial activities of CAMPOST
28.
The structural benchmark on the separation of the financial and postal activities of
CAMPOST by end-August 2005 will be considered observed following (i) the establishment
of two separate preliminary balance sheets for the postal and the financial activities, which
will be based on the results of the audit of the savings accounts of CAMPOST undertaken by
June 2005 that ascertains the level of savings deposits held at CAMPOST; (ii) a government
decision instructing the Board of CAMPOST to initiate the separation of CAMPOST’s
financial and postal services into two legally and financially autonomous agencies. The
World Bank will be consulted in preparing the actions mentioned above.
Publication of SNH audits and production sharing agreements
29.
The structural benchmark on the publication of SNH’s audit reports and the
production sharing agreements by end-June 2005 will be considered observed following the
publication by the Government or the SNH on a website of: (i) the main elements of existing
audits covering SNH’s activities, both for the operations on behalf of the Government
(mandat) and its own activities (operations), including the respective audits covering fiscal
years 2000/01, 2001/02, transitory 2002, and 2003 (the main elements include the financial
and management accounts, including the related attachments); and (ii) after having sought
and obtained the agreement of the oil companies concerned, of the main elements of all
production sharing and similar contracts concluded between SNH and other oil companies
that are currently in place in Cameroon (the main elements include the provisions on
production, cost sharing, and the tax regime).
Update National Governance Action Plan
30.
The structural benchmark on the update of the national action plan to improve
governance by end-June 2005 will be considered observed upon receipt by the staff of the
IMF of an updated national action plan on governance that will be prepared in collaboration
with the UNDP under its new governance project with Cameroon.

APPENDIX II

Cameroon: Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis14
A preliminary debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Cameroon’s debt situation is
manageable, and is not highly vulnerable to shocks. However, the available debt data is not
fully comprehensive as external debt data for public enterprises is not available and data on
domestic arrears are incomplete. Efforts are underway to develop a comprehensive debt
data.
A. Introduction
32.
The Cameroonian authorities felt the low-income debt sustainability framework
would be a useful tool for their debt management efforts because of its capability for
stress testing and for cross-country comparisons.15 However, this debt sustainability
framework can produce different results from the calculations under the HIPC Initiative
because the methodologies used for computing net present values (NPV) differ. Thus,
caution is needed in interpreting the results from this framework for HIPCs in their interim
period between the decision and completion points.
33.
The DSA involved four steps, using separate templates to analyze external debt
and total public sector debt. First, a medium- and long-term baseline scenario for the
balance of payments and fiscal positions was developed. Debt ratios were computed for the
baseline scenarios, assuming no HIPC completion point relief.16 Then, standardized stress
tests were applied to assess the country’s vulnerability to alternative macroeconomic
assumptions and exogenous shocks. Finally, alternative scenarios assuming slightly different
underlying assumptions were devised, including one where Cameroon reaches the HIPC
completion point in early 2006. There were three important missing pieces of data for
carrying out the analysis: the external debt of public enterprises, data on private sector
external debt, and complete data on domestic arrears. The analysis therefore only reflects
government and government-guaranteed external and domestic debt.
B. Size and Origins of the Public Sector Debt
External debt
34.
External debt increased sharply between 1985 and 2004, mainly reflecting severe
terms of trade shocks in the mid-1980s, a long economic depression and a fiscal crisis in
the early 1990s. As a result, the country had six rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club
14

For an earlier detailed analysis of debt sustainability, see Country Report No. 03/401, Appendix II.

15

That framework is described in “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries – Further
Considerations on an Operational Framwork and Policy Implications”(www.imf.org).
16

All projections of debt service from existing debt were provided by the Cameroonian debt
management agency (Caisse Autonome d’Amortissement).

- 73 -

APPENDIX II

between 1989 and 2001. The Paris Club treatments were on debt service flows only.
Cameroon’s debt stock exceeded the relevant enhanced HIPC Initiative thresholds and in
December 2000, Cameroon reached its HIPC decision point. At end-1999, the nominal stock
of public external debt was US$7.6 billion (about 85 percent of GDP) and has remained
around the same nominal level through end-2004, though it dropped to around 52 percent of
GDP owing to strong GDP growth and valuation changes. Average relief provided on debt
service payments has been substantial, averaging about 4.2 percent of GDP in 2003-2004.
This includes provision of interim debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and additional debt
relief by key bilateral creditors (together some US$49 million in 2004). As a result of its
extremely tight fiscal position in 2005, Cameroon is expected to accrue arrears on all debt
service resulting from pre-cut off date debt. Assuming a PRGF arrangement could be agreed
in 2005, the authorities intend to seek a seventh Paris Club rescheduling, which could render
around 2.7 percent of GDP in debt relief for 2005.
35.
The country’s main creditors are Paris Club members, accounting for
70 percent of the stock of nominal debt. Multilaterals account for around 30 percent, and
commercial creditors account for around 3 percent. All debt to commercial creditors (about
US$200 million) is in arrears and owed to creditors who did not participate in the 2003
London Club agreement. The Cameroonian authorities are still seeking agreements with the
remaining creditors, but one creditor successfully sued and seized some US$43 million in
2004.
Domestic debt
36.
The total domestic debt is estimated at 12.2 percent of GDP at end-2004
(Table 9). Similarly to external debt, a large part of domestic debt was accumulated prior to
and during the crisis of the early 1990s. An estimated 60–65 percent of this debt was
contracted prior to 1994. The total domestic debt includes arrears of CFAF 179.8 billion
(2.3 percent of GDP) identified in previous audits. About 41 percent of the total debt was
securitized, all prior to 2000. Securitized debt includes debt to commercial banks, a part of
the debt to insurance companies, and a large part of civil service wage debt. The nonsecuritized debt of the non-bank sector comprises major public creditors like the social
security fund (Caisse nationale de prévoyance sociale, CNPS) and the national office for the
sale of basic goods (Office national de commercialisation des produits de base, ONCPB).
37.
The government is undertaking a new audit to improve the transparency and
effective management of domestic debt. Based on the audit results, the authorities will
prepare a payment plan to clear domestic arrears. In a second step, the audit will identify the
cross liabilities between public enterprises and the government, as well as public enterprises’
external debt obligations.

C. Underlying DSA Assumptions
38.

The baseline scenario (Figure 5, Tables 10–11) for the analysis assumes:

•

Real annual growth of 3.9 percent in 2005, gradually accelerating to just over
5 percent through 2020, and inflation (GDP deflator) of around 1.5 percent and a
current account deficit of around 2 percent of GDP.

•

A gradual strengthening of the fiscal position, with the non-oil primary balance17
increasing from a surplus of 0.1 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005 to 1.0 percent in
2020. A decline in oil revenue from 3.5 percent of GDP to 0.6 percent is partially
offset by an increase in non-oil revenue from 13.5 to 17.4 percent of GDP from 2005
to 2020. Non-interest expenditure is projected to increase gradually from 13.4 percent
to 16.4 percent of GDP.

•

Scheduled debt service on existing external debt decreases from around
US$860 million in 2005 to US$275 million in 2020. New financing is assumed to
remain just under 1 percent of GDP per year through 2025, with a grant element of
35 percent.

39.
The HIPC completion point scenario is based on the same assumptions for the
balance of payments and fiscal frameworks and the level of new financing. The key
17

APPENDIX II

difference is that projected debt service from existing debt is reduced sharply from 2006
onward due to HIPC completion point relief, with scheduled debt service payments declining
to US$315 million in 2006 and to US$150 million in 2020. The other alternative scenarios
assume key variables at historical averages, rather than using projections, and less favorable
terms for new financing. The alternative scenarios and stress testing for total public sector
debt were slightly different, but were based on the same basic assumptions.
D. Results
External Debt
40.
Based on the baseline scenario of the DSA, the external debt situation appears
manageable. The NPV of debt to exports18 falls from 165 percent in 2004 to 130 percent in
2006, continuing down to 89 percent by 2010 (Table 10). The table shows the change in
external debt each year, disaggregated by a variety of net debt-creating flows: strong GDP
growth, for example, is relatively significant in reducing net debt-creating flows. Exceptional
financing, which includes debt relief and arrears, is also shown as a strong factor in reducing
external debt. The debt service-to-exports ratio is 22.5 percent in 2005 and is reduced to
around 10 percent in 2010. The debt service ratio reflects scheduled debt service rather than
expected actual payments, that is, it does not reflect debt relief received as a result of Paris
Club flow rescheduling or HIPC interim assistance. The debt service ratio payable after debt
relief is in the single digits in all years.
41.
The stress testing on the baseline suggests that Cameroon’s external debt
situation should remain sustainable through 2010, even under a variety of shocks.19
Table 11 and Figure 5 summarize the results of the stress testing and the alternative
scenarios. The tests assume a shock of one standard deviation below the average in 2004200520 in terms of GDP growth, export value growth, the GDP deflator, other balance of
payments inflows, and a combination of these effects. It also assumes a one-time 30 percent
nominal depreciation of the currency in 2004. Under virtually all of the tests, the debt ratios
remain manageable through the medium-term. The NPV of debt to exports does exceed
150 percent very slightly two years after the end of the export shock. This particular stress
test is significant in the sense that it simulates a drop in oil prices or production in any given
year, which would also affect government revenues. Similarly, the alternative scenarios
18

Using current year exports, not a backward-looking three year average as under HIPC Initiative
calculations.

19

The actual analysis was carried out through 2025 and all ratios continue to improve from 2010
through 2025.
20

The simulated shock happens in 2004, a year that is already past, but this is not relevant from the
perspective of evaluating the medium-term impact of the shock.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

suggest that the analysis is not highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions of the
macroeconomic framework and the terms of new financing. As mentioned, however, the
threshold calculations are very sensitive to assumptions in the discount rate, which is a
uniform 5 percent in this analysis.
42.
The alternative scenario assuming the HIPC completion point is reached in 2006
suggests a more robust result still. In this case, already in 2006, the NPV of debt-to-GDP
drops to 21 percent, the NPV of debt-to-exports drops to 89 percent, and debt service ratio
drops to well below 10 percent.
Total debt
43.
An analysis of total debt yields results very similar to that to external debt given
the relatively modest size of domestic debt. (Figure 6 and Table 12) Under the baseline
scenario, Cameroon’s total debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline from 56 percent of GDP
in 2004 to 33 percent of GDP in 2010. Stress tests on the baseline indicate that an exploding
debt path is not expected to emerge under a variety of shocks and the analysis is not strongly
sensitive to underlying assumptions. The stress tests simulate: a shock to real GDP growth
and the fiscal primary balance, by applying historical averages minus one standard deviation;
a combination of these; and a real exchange rate depreciation of 30 percent. The largest
impact is felt with the exchange rate depreciation, simulation, where debt to GDP and debt to
revenues are affected. Similarly, altering the assumptions underlying the baseline to reflect
GDP and primary balance historical averages over the medium term (rather than policyinfluenced projections) renders ratios that are almost identical to the baseline. Debt serviceto-revenue ratios are not significantly affected by alternative assumptions, but are strongly
affected in a single year by a sharp increase in debt-creating flows.
44.
Based on this preliminary debt sustainability exercise, the debt profile of
Cameroon appears manageable and relatively robust to a variety of shocks. However,
debt coverage is not comprehensive and a combination of negative shocks, if sustained, could
have a more serious impact.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of Central
African States, of which Cameroon is a member. A safeguard assessment of the BEAC
completed on August 30, 2004 found that BEAC has implemented a number of measures to
strengthen its safeguards framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment, but further
progress needs to be made in key areas.
The main recommendations of the assessment, applicable to the BEAC as an institution,
include: (i) preparation of financial statements in full accordance with an internationally
recognized accounting framework, initially the ECB guidelines; (ii) publication of its full
financial statements, together with the auditor’s report, starting with the 2003 financial
statements; (iii) formulation of Board-approved formal guidelines under which the BEAC
Governor is authorized to make exceptional advances to BEAC member countries;

- 84 -

APPENDIX III

(iv) annual review by the BEAC internal audit department of the process of program data
reporting of member countries to the IMF; (v) implementation of a risk-based audit approach,
and finalization of a charter, for the internal audit function; and (vi) systematic follow-up of
all recommendations pertaining to the BEAC’s system of internal controls to be coordinated
by the internal audit department, with regular reporting to the Audit Committee and the
BEAC Governor.
Other priority recommendations of the assessment, but of a country specific nature, were:
(i) the BEAC should clarify with its member countries that hold foreign reserves outside the
BEAC the statutory basis and circumstances for doing so, to avoid an apparent conflict with
the BEAC statutes and to ensure full transparency of reporting of reserves by the member
country; (ii) the BEAC and its member states should establish a mechanism to prevent arrears
to the IMF through advance acquisitions of SDRs and an authorization to debit an SDR
account of the member; and (iii) the BEAC should cooperate with its members to reconcile
and confirm their Treasury balances to ensure that the balances reported by the BEAC in
respect of credit to government as reflected in the accounts of the Treasuries are in agreement
with the BEAC.
IX.

Exchange Arrangements:

Cameroon's currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 per euro.

APPENDIX IV

Cameroon: Relations with the World Bank
(As of March 2005)
Government’s strategy supported by the World Bank
1.
The government’s strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction, as described
in the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) communicated to the World Bank and the
IMF in April 2003, is articulated along seven pillars, as detailed in IDA/SecM2003–0434.
World Bank lending and strategy
2.
The joint IDA-IFC Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to the Board on
September 11, 2003. The strategy, which covers the period fiscal year (FY) 04–06, has two
main axes: (i) strengthen the institutional framework for improved pro-poor economic
management and service delivery; and (ii) support private sector development, leading to the
diversification of the economy and growth. The proposed strategy will follow a “resultsbased” framework. In this context, the following outcomes are expected to be achieved
during the next CAS period: (i) improvement in the transparency and accountability in the
mobilization and use of public resources; (ii) improvement in the use of public resources in
education, health, and forestry; (iii) improvement in service delivery in key sectors;
(iv) enhancement of the response of vulnerable groups in over 300 communities to the threat
of HIV/AIDS through preventative, curative, or mitigating measures, while the national
capacity to respond to the epidemic is strengthened; and (v) reduced burden (cost, time, etc.)
on private sector companies arising from regulatory, administrative, and infrastructure
constraints. Specific indicators (such as an increase in the percentage of rural communities in
targeted provinces with access to basic socioeconomic services, or a decrease in the
percentage of private firms rating the specific constraints as major or severe) are being
identified to measure progress toward achieving these outcomes.
3.
SACIII, which supported a set of politically complex and ambitious reforms in the
areas of transport, financial and forestry reforms and privatization, was closed by end
March 2004. Following Board approval on a no objection basis on March 16, 2004, the two
remaining privatization and transport tranches were released. The outcome of SACIII was
rated satisfactory as part of an ex-post assessment, which was confirmed by an independent
evaluation of the Operations Evaluation Department of the World Bank (OED).
4.
The World Bank is planning to further support the government with analytical work
and policy dialogue in several areas, focusing, inter alia, on (i) monitoring socioeconomic
developments, including through the HIPC Initiative process and the PRSP implementation,
reviews of trade prospects (especially with the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC) countries and Nigeria), and action plans developed for the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health and education; (ii) conducting a climate
investment survey to support the PRSP pillar aimed at diversifying the economy;
(iii) strengthening dialogue and action on the governance agenda by undertaking institutional
governance reviews and public expenditure reviews (PERs) in key sectors (health, education,

- 88 -

APPENDIX IV

infrastructure, and agriculture); and (iv) supporting key reforms in public procurement and
public finance through a Country Procurement Assessment Review and the monitoring of the
action plan defined during the recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Finally,
a Poverty Assessment will serve to measure progress.
5.
The Bank’s portfolio consists of 7 projects with total commitments of around
US$228 million, of which about US$53.4 million is the IBRD’s. A total amount of
US$125 million was disbursed as of March 4, 2005. Implementation of all projects but one
was rated satisfactory. The World Bank Country Office organizes regular meetings with the
authorities to review progress made on portfolio implementation, in order to improve the
execution rate of current projects.

Areas where the Fund takes the lead role relate to policy advice and reforms with
respect to (i) overall macroeconomic policy and short- and medium-term financial
programming; (ii) tax policy and administration; (iii) information and financial management
systems for government revenue and expenditure; (iv) budgetary accounting; and (v) treasury
procedures. Bank staff participate in some meetings of Fund missions with the authorities in
these areas.
8.
Areas in which the World Bank takes the lead are related to (i) institutional and
human capacity building for economic management, including the formulation of sectoral
strategies and medium-term expenditure frameworks, the analysis of poverty and the sources
of growth to support the PRSP process, and the development of a macroeconomic model for
the preparation of the short- and medium-term macroeconomic framework; (ii) specific
sector advice in the areas in which the Bank has active lending operations (especially in the
social sectors, infrastructure, agriculture, and forestry); and (iii) support and monitoring of
the implementation of the privatization program. The Bank has jointly produced with the
GOC and the AFD an Education Status Report. The World Bank has produced an Urban
Sector Review and a Development Policy Review in June 2004 and plan to hold discussion
on the latter document with the Government in the fourth quarter of 2004. Furthermore, in

- 90 -

APPENDIX IV

FY04, the Bank has started work on a Poverty Assessment, and a Public Expenditure
Review.
9.
Both Bank and Fund have responsibility for policy advice on (i) budgetary
procedures, government expenditure management systems, and expenditure execution,
including tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures; (ii) the functioning of internal and
external budget control institutions; (iii) reform of the customs; (iv) trade policy; (v) financial
system reform; and (vi) governance issues. The two institutions jointly support and monitor
the HIPC Initiative and PRSP process.

- 91 -

APPENDIX V

Cameroon: Statistical Issues
In recent years, the Cameroonian authorities took a number of initiatives to improve their
statistical data, particularly on national accounts. Data provision to the Fund remains
adequate for surveillance purposes, but there is significant room for improvement in data
quality, coverage, and timeliness.
Cameroon participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The metadata,
which include a description of the current statistical practices and an action plan to improve
statistical systems, are available on the Internet at the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB).
The National Institute of Statistics (INS), an autonomous institution under the aegis of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, Programming, and Regional Development, is the most
important data provider. A lack of clarity concerning the role and coordinating function of
the INS, however, has hampered the implementation of statistical standards and
classifications across government departments and agencies. Also, in recent years the
production of standard economic statistics may have suffered from a focus on social
statistics.
National accounts
The INS has been compiling and publishing the national accounts using the concepts and
definitions of the 1968 System of National Accounts (1968 SNA). In recent years, the INS
has also compiled a revised and updated set of national accounts estimates based on the
1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). (The GDDS metadata submitted in 2001/02
pertain to the revised estimates, not to the data currently in the public domain.)
STA missions visited Cameroon in October 2003 and December 2004 to assist the
authorities in compiling the new series of national accounts and to assess the result. The
missions judged the general methodology, the analytical tools used, and the adjustments
made to be generally appropriate and in accordance with the 1993 SNA methodology. The
missions also found the national accounts staff to be of high caliber. However, the STA
expert and the recent article IV mission identified some remaining weaknesses in some
national accounts series, particularly for oil GDP. The staff decided to not switch to the new
series before these weaknesses have been addressed.
The STA missions also reviewed the data sources and found shortcomings concerning
coverage, quality and timeliness. In particular, the framework for the production and
collection of statistics originating from enterprises was found to be weak. This creates
difficulties for gauging the current industrial and the activity structure of the economy. Data
problems are also serious in major sectors of the economy, such as agriculture,
manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, local government, and services. In addition, the
Production Index needs to be thoroughly overhauled, updated and integrated with the

- 92 -

APPENDIX V

corresponding components of the annual national accounts. Further major concerns are a
lack of information on employment and representative price indices for deflation.
In light of the remaining deficiencies in the national economic and social data system,
technical assistance will remain essential in the coming years.
Consumer prices
The authorities intend to revise the monthly consumer price index (CPI) by extending the
underlying survey to rural areas. So far, the CPI has been calculated on the basis of surveys
carried out in the five main cities of the country (Yaoundé, Douala, Bafoussam, Bamenda
and Garoua). In addition, the authorities intend to contribute to the production of a regional
CPI in the CEMAC area. The basket used in this context will be larger than the one
currently used for the compilation of the national CPI, but will be geographically limited to
the two larger cities, Yaoundé and Douala.
Sociodemographic indicators
Some progress has been made in recent years in the production of sociodemographic
statistics. The most recent household survey (ECAM II) carried out in 2001 provides
comprehensive data that have been used to update Cameroon’s poverty profile. In the
education and health sectors, the authorities have begun an update of two main social
indicators, the education map (carte scolaire) and the healthcare map (carte sanitaire) that
had been elaborated in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Preparatory work for a new household
survey has been initiated, and data will be collected in 2005.
Public finances
Despite some efforts to address deficiencies, data on the public finances are still in critical
need of improvements in quality, coverage and timeliness. Weaknesses in the fiscal data
include: (i) incomplete compilation of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to
some extent, on a cash basis; (ii) a lack of information on the financial information of local
governments; (iii) poor monitoring of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public
enterprise debt; (iv) a lack of transparency of financial operations by the national oil
company; and (v) a lack of information on the financial information of public enterprises
more generally.
Key reforms have been introduced in 2003-04 to address some of these deficiencies, but
have not yet been drawn upon fully. The introduction of a new accounting system should
allow to identify expenditures by function (i.e., not only by spending ministries), and to
evaluate the “float” (i.e., spending committed but not yet paid). The integrated financial
management system (SIGEFI) should substantially improve the accuracy and timeliness of
fiscal data both on a commitment and on a cash basis.

- 93 -

APPENDIX V

In 2005, the authorities intend to further address the existing weaknesses. Based on the
SIGEFI, the authorities have started in January 2005 to prepare preliminary fiscal accounts
3 weeks after the end of the reported month (they prepared only final data after 2 months in
2004). They plan to elaborate comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment basis and
will strive to monitor the float. Moreover, the ongoing audit of government domestic debt,
which will cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public enterprise external debt, is
expected to strengthen debt data. Efforts to enhance transparency of financial operations in
the oil sector should also improve overall fiscal reporting. Finally, some efforts are
underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public enterprises.
Monetary accounts
Monetary statistics for Cameroon are reported to the Fund by the BEAC on a monthly
basis. The lag in data reporting varies and can reach two months. Although the coverage of
the date is comprehensive, the quality of the data may be affected by large cross-border
movements of currency among member countries in the CEMAC. About three quarters of
the currency circulating in Cameroon is issued nationally) and almost 90 percent of the
currency issued by Cameroon remain within the national territory.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments statistics produced by the Cameroonian authorities are so weak
that they have been used only very little by Fund staff. The services charged with the
production of these statistics (a unit in the Ministry of the Economy and of Finance) has
been unable to improve the quality of their output in recent years, due in part to a lack of
qualified staff and equipment. The authorities should consider having the balance of
payments statistics prepared by the BEAC, as is the case in the other CEMAC countries.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 22, 2005
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the staff
report for the 2005 Article IV consultation and staff monitored program on March 31, 2005.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

The authorities have observed the prior action for the Staff Monitored Program
(SMP) by hiring an advisor (the International Finance Corporation) for the
restructuring/privatization of the national airline (CAMAIR).

•

The authorities have met the two structural benchmarks for end-March 2005
(page 53 of the staff report for the 2005 Article IV consultation and SMP). (i) They
have provided preliminary budget execution tables (TABORD) for end-February
2005 on a cash and a commitment basis. (ii) The authorities have notified commercial
banks that no new government accounts should be opened.

•

The authorities have also provided final data for budget execution in 2004 that
are broadly in line with the preliminary data received earlier. Staff will discuss
these data with the authorities during a forthcoming staff visit.

•

Oil prices projected for the remainder of the year have increased relative to the
program, pushing up oil exports earnings and fiscal revenue from oil. It is estimated
that fiscal revenue in 2005 would be at least 0.7 percentage points of GDP higher than
previously envisaged.

•

The adjustment of domestic fuel prices in line with world market developments
has not been fully reinstated. Fuel prices were adjusted marginally from the
beginning of March and prices for some products are below import cost. Also, the
authorities have suspended the additional fuel price component introduced in
January 2005 that was to allow the domestic refinery to recoup the losses it incurred
in 2004.

•

Early indications present a mixed picture on budgetary execution in JanuaryFebruary. Nonoil revenue grew somewhat but remained weaker than programmed,
while expenditure was strongly compressed. The end-March quantitative benchmark
on non-oil revenue may be missed unless annual corporate profit tax payments (due
in March and April) perform particularly well. All other quantitative benchmarks
seem to be within reach.

•

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Cameroon
On April 22, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cameroon.1 The Executive Board also approved the monitoring by
Fund staff of Cameroon’s economic program for 2005.
Background
In recent years, Cameroon has continued to enjoy political stability and solid economic growth,
resulting in gradual per capita income gains. However, income levels remain far below those
enjoyed prior to the economic crisis that led to the devaluation of 1994, and Cameroon continues
to rank just above the first quintile (place 141 out of 177 countries) of the U.N.’s Human
Development Index, an assessment combining life expectancy, adult literacy, primary school
enrollment, and per capita income.
Despite its solid GDP growth performance, Cameroon has seen a deterioration of its fiscal
position in 2003-04 that, if continued, could undermine prospects for macroeconomic stability,
growth and poverty reduction. Also, the authorities have made only limited progress in recent
years in removing long-standing impediments to private sector growth, such as inadequate
investment into infrastructure and human capital, poor service delivery from troubled state
enterprises, and an investment climate overshadowed by weak governance. As a result of these
developments, the PRGF-arrangement with Cameroon of 2000 went off-track in early 2004 and
lapsed later that year.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2The authorities intend to build a track record of policy implementation through a staff-monitored
program (SMP) for 2005. Initial steps by the government formed in December 2004 have been
encouraging. Successful implementation of the SMP and a successor PRGF arrangement would
strengthen prospects for growth and poverty reduction, and allow for the possibility of reaching
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion point in 2006. A track-record
SMP is an informal monitoring arrangement that does not entail Executive Board endorsement of
Cameroon’s policy program.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Cameroon’s good economic performance, with solid growth, low inflation,
and a narrowing external current account deficit, as well as the progress achieved on structural
reforms. Tangible progress has been made in health and education sector reforms, which—along
with increased per capita income—helped improve social indicators. At the same time, Directors
observed that serious challenges remain, in particular in strengthening fiscal performance to
ensure debt sustainability, and removing impediments to private sector growth, which will be key
to strong growth and poverty reduction over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to embark on an ambitious reform program that
would be monitored by Fund staff. A track record of convincing performance under the program
would help maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and pave the way for a medium-term
reform program that could be supported by the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
Directors strongly supported the authorities’ intention to redouble their reform efforts to allow
them to reach the completion point under the HIPC Initiative.
Directors noted that fiscal performance had weakened considerably in 2003-04, particularly with
respect to non-oil revenue, and that only limited progress had been made in strengthening
financial management. They also expressed concern that the financial situation of large public
enterprises had worsened considerably, adding to actual and contingent fiscal liabilities of the
central government. Given these developments, Directors were encouraged by the authorities’
commitment to improve fiscal performance and financial management, in particular through the
ambitious fiscal program for 2005 that seeks to mobilize non-oil revenue and contain non-priority
expenditure while increasing investment spending.
Directors emphasized that increased revenue mobilization will require continued tax reforms
aimed at broadening the tax base by reducing exemptions and enhancing tax collection in the
informal sector. Technical assistance, if effectively used, will provide useful support to these
efforts. In addition, Directors urged the establishment of a transparent fiscal rule for the use of
windfall oil revenue.
On the expenditure side, Directors noted that restraining non-interest expenditures and improving
their composition, by focusing on infrastructure and social sectors, will be critical for improving the
business climate and poverty reduction. They called for prompt actions on restructuring and
privatization of state-owned enterprises, which would help limit the quasi-fiscal losses and
improve service delivery. In this regard, Directors expressed concern about the suspension of the
adjustment of fuel prices in line with world market prices. They also highlighted the importance of
continued progress on the streamlining of payrolls and improving personnel management.
Directors encouraged the authorities to build on the progress achieved in operationalizing the
financial management system. They stressed the need to improve further the timeliness,
comprehensiveness and accuracy of fiscal reporting, including in the receipt and use of the HIPC
relief. Directors also stressed the importance of strengthening debt management, avoiding

-3domestic arrears and external arrears on non-reschedulable debt, settling arrears to the HIPCaccount, and developing and fully implementing a realistic debt-servicing plan. They urged the
authorities to clarify the external debt position of public enterprises to allow for a comprehensive
debt sustainability assessment.
Directors observed that reaching most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be a
challenge for the authorities. They emphasized the importance of strictly prioritizing expenditures,
enhancing their efficiency, and implementing the medium-term sectoral strategies developed in
cooperation with the World Bank. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to review key
elements of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), to start working on a comprehensive
medium-term framework, and to strengthen the implementation and monitoring of poverty
reducing projects, including those funded from HIPC-debt relief.
Directors underscored the high priority that the authorities should accord to removing
impediments to private sector growth. In particular, infrastructure investments and a
strengthening of the legal system, and governance more generally, will be key to enhancing the
business climate and investor confidence. Directors urged the authorities to redouble their efforts
to improve governance and fight corruption. They underscored the need to pursue decisively the
implementation of the National Governance Program, by focusing on results rather than broad
policy intentions. Welcoming the adoption of laws for the Audit Office and Constitutional Council,
they stressed the importance of making these institutions operational and intensifying efforts to
achieve tangible results. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen financial
management and enhance transparency, particularly in the oil sector by phasing out extrabudgetary spending and adhering to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
While welcoming the assessment that the commercial banking sector is sound, they urged the
authorities to address weaknesses in state-owned financial institutions.
Directors considered that the regional currency union has served Cameroon well in helping
maintain low inflation and macroeconomic stability. They called on the authorities to monitor
competitiveness closely and accelerate structural reforms to improve overall economic efficiency.
Directors welcomed the progress made in enhancing national accounts and fiscal data, and the
plans for improving data on poverty and social indicators. They underscored the importance of
strengthening other real sector data and, in particular, the production of balance of payments
data.
Directors welcomed the ex-post assessment (EPA) report and generally agreed with its main
findings. Among lessons to be learned for future program design, they highlighted the importance
of structuring conditionality so as to reinforce ownership, of focusing—where possible—on
outcomes rather than process, and of effective Fund-Bank coordination and collaboration.
Several Directors supported the view that, beyond the near term, a close non-financial
engagement would be the most effective way for the Fund to continue to assist Cameroon in
meeting its economic challenges.

I.

Introduction

My Cameroonian authorities are grateful to Management and staff for the continued fruitful
discussions on the ongoing reform efforts to improve economic conditions and fight poverty.
In this regard, they are determined to enhance their dialogue with Cameroon’s development
partners, including the IMF.
After the presidential election that took place early October last year, a new cabinet was
appointed in December 2004 with the mandate to address the challenges the country faces,
including weak fiscal performance, high level of public debt, inadequate infrastructure, low
competitiveness of the economy, and governance issues. As a first step, my authorities are
determined to reestablish Cameroon’s macroeconomic fundamentals and to deepen structural
reforms including governance, as demonstrated by measures already taken during the last
months. Maintaining this concerted effort, they are strongly implementing the SMP with the
aim of rapidly reaching a new PRGF agreement.
II.

Recent developments

Cameroon’s growth and inflation performance was solid in 2003 and 2004. This growth was
broadly distributed across different sectors. Real GDP growth remained strong as non-oil
growth averaged more than 4½ percent, consumer price inflation was reduced to about
½ percent, and the current account deficit narrowed to below 2 percent of GDP owing to
strong exports of primary goods. Moreover, there was an improvement in electricity
production and distribution, transport and communication, thus easing infrastructure
constraints on private sector activity. My authorities have also made progress in
implementing the PRSP and in completing HIPC Initiative completion point triggers, and
they have prepared the first annual report on the implementation of the full PRSP. Although
the use of HIPC resources was low, social sector indicators improved. In the education
sector, more than 2800 classrooms for primary and secondary schools were constructed and
part-time primary school teachers recruited. In the health sector, vaccination campaigns were
intensified; the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment was reduced significantly while treatment of
tuberculosis became free of charge.
My Cameroonian authorities have continued the implementation of major structural reforms
in public finances, including the integrated financial management system (SIGEFI), the
reform of the personal income tax and the large taxpayer unit (DGE). On civil service
reform, the pilot phase of the implementation of the civil service employment register
(SIGIPES) proved to be conclusive. A recent assessment of the implementation of SIGIPES
indicates that the system is efficient, and ghost-employees were identified and removed from
the payroll.
Structural reforms in other areas have also been made. In the transportation sector, the reform
of the Douala Port was implemented successfully, including the management of the container
terminal and computerization of the single window for imports and exports clearance

-2(GUCE). Hence, transaction costs and clearance time were reduced significantly. In the
forestry sector, the redefinition of the mandate of the forestry agency (ANAFOR), and the
allocation of logging rights through competitive bidding in the presence of an independent
observer were completed.
On governance, measures implemented include the adoption of the new public procurement
code aimed at strengthening the transparency of procedures, and the action plan for the
reform of the judiciary system. Moreover, laws establishing the Audit Office for state
finances (Chambre des Comptes) and the Constitutional Court were enacted, and the anticorruption units were established in all ministries and other government bodies.
III. Program for 2005
The Government’s key objectives for 2005 are in line with priorities set forth in the PRSP
endorsed by the Board in July 2003. My authorities have asked staff to monitor their 2005
program and they are determined to pursue fiscal consolidation to preserve macroeconomic
stability, strengthen investment and economic growth, and improve social conditions of the
population. This will include improving fiscal revenue and enhancing transparency in
government operations, further restructuring and privatization of public enterprises, and
improving governance and the business climate to enhance private sector activity and
growth.
Fiscal Policy
The 2005 budget framework aims at reestablishing macroeconomic stability through a
stricter adherence to fiscal discipline. In this context, my authorities are committed to
undertake strong efforts in 2005 to improve substantially the fiscal position by strengthening
tax administration, enhancing revenue performance, curtailing and controlling expenditure.
My authorities will address contingent fiscal liabilities, including domestic public debt. The
non-oil primary deficit is expected to improve by 2.5 percentage points of non-oil GDP, and
the overall balance, including grants is projected at a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP.
As regards tax and customs administration, my authorities will continue to enhance the
functioning of the Large Taxpayer Unit (DGE). They will increase material and human
resources to the DGE in order to enlarge tax compliance, VAT and excises. Also, the taxation
of the forestry sector will be improved by combating fraudulent exports and the informal
processing of timber. Furthermore, customs administration will be enhanced, including
through the installation of the new automated custom data system (ASYCUD).
My authorities intend to boost the mobilization of additional non-oil revenues through new
tax policy measures. The 2005 tax measures include increasing the VAT rate from 17 to
17.5 percent; abolishing further VAT exemptions, and the excise tax exemption for locally
produced alcoholic beverages and tobacco; increasing taxation on gambling and increasing
stamp duties and automobile registration fees. Concerning the monthly adjustment
mechanism of domestic fuel prices in line with the international oil market prices, my
Cameroonian authorities are aware of the budgetary implications of any partial cost recovery.

-3However, they intend to implement this mechanism with caution, in order to avoid igniting
social pressure that might undermine the public consensus on the program.
On expenditure, the authorities have adopted a cash-basis management of the budget, thus
ensuring that the level of expenditures corresponds to the Government’s cash position.
Hence, expenditure control will be a key priority in 2005. It is also important to note that all
SNH’s interventions directes will now require the prior authorization of the Minister of
Finance, and only against available budget allocations in the relevant ministerial budget. The
authorities are committed to discontinue these interventions by July 1, 2005.
Structural reforms
My authorities intend to deepen structural reforms envisioned in the PRSP while focusing on
tasks critical to macroeconomic stability. They are strongly determined to implement the
ambitious fiscal and structural reforms outlined in the SMP. In this regard, actions already
taken include firmly establishing fiscal discipline through strengthening public expenditure
management and revenue collection, auditing domestic debt with the aim of establishing a
settlement plan, speeding up the privatization of publicly owned enterprises, and improving
the production and distribution of electricity.
On fiscal management and control, my authorities will pursue the streamlining of the civil
service payroll. They intend to expand progressively the use of SIGIPES to other government
entities and they are determined to use SIGEFI more efficiently, thus enhancing the accuracy
and the timeliness of fiscal data. Moreover, they will begin publishing monthly budget
execution monitoring documents by end-June 2005. Another key component of the fiscal
program is the consolidation of the single Treasury account at the regional central bank
(BEAC). To this effect, most accounts maintained by government entities in commercial
banks will be closed to improve the management of public finances. No new account will be
opened in commercial banks as of March 31, 2005.
Regarding the oil sector, which contributes significantly to economic activity and budgetary
revenues, the authorities will continue to take steps to improve transparency. They will
ensure the timely transfer to the Treasury of the surplus of the national oil company (SNH).
However, Cameroon remains a modest oil producer and the production is projected to decline
further.
My authorities are determined to take vigorous measures aimed at restoring financial
discipline in the public enterprise and utilities sector. Therefore, the government’s utility
and transport bills will be paid on time. Moreover, the ongoing audit on domestic debt will be
used to identify by end-June 2005 the cross-liabilities between the government and public
enterprises. On the privatization process, although past negotiations with the bidders for the
fixed telecoms (CAMTEL) and water (SNEC) companies fell through, the authorities are
committed to make significant progress toward the restructuring and the divestiture of most
of the largest companies. In this connection, they have reviewed their approach to
privatization and have reinitiated the process with the support of the World Bank.
Concerning the airline company (CAMAIR), the authorities will expedite the privatization
process. Measures already taken include the selection of the International Financial

-4Corporation (IFC) - a prior action of the SMP- as the main consultant to advise the
government.
Financial sector
While efforts will be made to deepen financial intermediation, the authorities will complete
the licensing of microfinance institutions. Although the banking sector is in good health, the
authorities intend to further strengthen the financial sector. They will step up their efforts to
address the financial situation of government-owned financial institutions including the
postal savings bank (CAMPOST) and the housing credit organization (Crédit Foncier).
Regarding the microfinance sector, the registration of microfinance institutions will be
completed under the supervision of the regional banking commission, COBAC.
Governance and transparency
The Government is committed to adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI). In this context, priority will be to publish information about exploration, production
and sales of crude oil in Cameroon, as well as the revenue generated and transferred to the
Treasury, the main elements of the audit reports of SNH. Moreover, quarterly information on
total oil production, prices, and revenue of the Government will be published on the website
of SNH and that of the Prime Minister’s Office. In addition, the authorities will make every
effort to obtain the agreement of the oil companies operating in Cameroon for the publication
of the main elements of the production sharing agreements. In order to enhance
accountability in the management of public resources, my authorities will make the Audit
Office (Chambre des comptes) operational by end-December 2005 while pressing ahead with
the implementation of the action plan of the judicial reform.
Debt issue
Although the DSA exercise suggests that Cameroon’s external debt should be manageable in
the medium-term after the completion point, the authorities believe that the tight budgetary
situation will limit their ability to fully meet the financial obligations due to bilateral and
commercial creditors in 2005. They see the negotiation of a new PRGF arrangement as a
decisive step towards a new Paris Club debt rescheduling. Turning to the domestic public
debt, which is hampering the development of the private sector, the authorities will establish
a settlement plan with its creditors as soon as the ongoing audit is completed.
Ex Post Assessment (EPA)
My Cameroonian authorities welcome the EPA discussions and broadly concur with the
assessment of Cameroon’s relationship with the Fund and the implementation of Fundsupported policies. The report acknowledges significant progress that the authorities have
made during the period 1997 to 2004 in the area of fiscal and structural reforms. These
reforms have contributed to the stabilization of the macroeconomic environment and to the
improvement of the external debt profile, thus laying the ground for enhanced growth and
poverty reduction. Moreover, my authorities agree that higher investment is needed to lift
Cameroon’s growth rate and make substantial progress toward the MDGs. In this regard,

-5they will promote an environment conducive to the private sector-led growth through
streamlining administrative regulations, enhancing the rule of law, and improving
infrastructure, including electricity and roads.
My authorities recognize that the slippages that occurred in 2003 and 2004 were partly due to
weaknesses in program coordination and fiscal management. However, they do not agree that
it lacked ownership; instead, burgeoning conditionality and the threat of program suspension
caused the authorities to agree to targets that proved to be above the capacity of Cameroon’s
economy.
PRSP
My authorities are preparing the second annual report. They are aware of the importance of
improving the implementation, and the monitoring and evaluation of PRSP activities. In this
connection, they will ensure that HIPC resources are adequately disbursed, that the analytical
quality of the reports is enhanced, and the participatory monitoring improved. My authorities
are committed to replenishing the HIPC account. Additionally, they recognize the need to
improve the linkage between the PRSP, the medium-term strategy and the annual budget
process. Thus, key elements of the PRSP will be revised, including the medium-term
macroeconomic framework in the context of the 2006 budget preparation, and a 3-year
economic program for which they intend top request a new PRGF arrangement as soon as
possible.
IV.

Conclusion

My Cameroonian authorities concur with the assessment that program conditionality should
target outcomes, rather than process as this reinforces program ownership. The staff report
underscores successful implementation of Fund supported programs during the period under
review by the Cameroonian authorities. Besides, Cameroon has already completed most of
completion point triggers. My authorities are fully determined to implementing the current
SMP and satisfying the conditions. In this context, they appreciate the consideration by
Management that a satisfactory implementation of the SMP during the first 6 months could
pave the way for reaching rapidly an agreement with the Fund on a new PRGF supported
program, and proceeding to the completion point.
It is noteworthy that the newly appointed government has brought management changes and
has confirmed over the last few months its strong determination to address immediate
challenges, including further diversifying the economy. My Cameroonian authorities are
committed to improve further the business climate and competitiveness, and all necessary
measures contributing to lay the ground for a sustainable growth, which is paramount for
accelerating progress towards the MDGs. They see the SMP as a starting point in the setting
up of an ambitious economic program that will help realize the large potentialities of
Cameroon’s economy.
Finally, I would appreciate my colleagues’ support for the authorities’ program, as well as for
an early transition to a program supported by a PRGF arrangement.
