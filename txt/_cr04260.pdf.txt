REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with the
Republic of Latvia
Approved by Susan Schadler and Matthew Fisher
July 15, 2004
• The consultation discussions were held in Riga during April 19–30, 2004, on the eve of
Latvia’s accession to the EU. Staff representatives met with Prime Minister Emsis, Finance
Minister Spurdzinš, Bank of Latvia Governor Rimsevic, other senior officials,
parliamentarians, and representatives of the business, financial, academic, and diplomatic
communities.
• The mission comprised Messrs. Samiei (head), Luna, Xiao (EUR), and Worrell (MFD).
Ms. Zunda of the resident representative office assisted the mission. Mr. Solheim, Executive
Director for Latvia, and Ms. Zubkova from the Executive Director’s office participated in some
of the meetings. Messrs. Samiei and Luna visited Frankfurt and Brussels to discuss ERM2
entry issues with ECB and EU officials. The authorities released the mission’s concluding
statement and agreed to the publication of the staff report.
• A new government led by Mr. Emsis of the Green and Farmer Union Party took office in
March 2004. The government, supported by a four-party minority coalition, has expressed its
commitment to European integration and combating corruption.
• In concluding the 2003 Article IV consultation discussions, Executive Directors focused their
recommendations on fiscal discipline and the fight against corruption. In particular, they
regretted the end-2002 fiscal loosening and underscored the importance of taking decisive
steps toward a medium-term structural balanced budget. To this end, they urged that further tax
rate reductions be delayed until fiscal performance had improved. In addition, Directors
stressed that progress against corruption would be critical to improving Latvia’s business
climate.
• Latvia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains no
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for those imposed in compliance with applicable UN Security Council resolutions. All
such restrictions have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision 144(52/51).
• Latvia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness of the data are adequate for surveillance.

I. BACKGROUND
A. A Glance at the Past
1.
Latvia’s transition, culminating in EU accession in May 2004, has been a success
story, but achieving real convergence with European standards of living remains a
long-term objective. With an average annual rate of about 6 percent since 1996, GDP
growth has been the highest among the new EU member countries (see chart). The narrow

the EU and the NATO. These
developments also helped attract large inflows of foreign direct investments (FDI), which, in
turn, contributed to the financing of Latvia’s large current account deficit. However, per
capita income is still below that of other acceding countries and stands at only one-third of
the EU-15 average in PPP terms, suggesting that it may take several decades for Latvia to
catch up with its richer neighbors.

The consistency between the Fund’s recommendations and the authorities’ views
has been high. Following 7 Standby arrangements—with the last one expiring in December
2002—Latvia has been cited as an example of highly effective prolonged assistance by the
Fund.1 Consultations have been constructive, and the quality of the policy dialogue with the
Fund has been high. The authorities have, in particular, appreciated the Fund’s contribution
to capacity building in the early transition years and its role in managing the banking crisis of
1995. The Fund’s advice has been followed in most instances, in particular in the
development of a stable exchange rate regime and an effective banking supervisory
framework, which led to the creation of the Financial and Capital Market Commission
(FCMC) in 2000. Fiscal policy has also mostly been in line with the Fund’s
recommendations, although recently, in the context of repeated political changes, the
authorities on occasion have favored a looser stance than recommended by staff.

B. Recent Developments
3.
Strong economic activity is
maintaining its momentum. Led by
robust domestic demand, real growth
reached 7½ percent in 2003 and
8¾ percent (year-on-year) in the first
quarter of 2004. Despite sluggish
activity in its European trading
partners, Latvia’s exports boomed in
2003. Leading indicators such as
industrial production, retail trade,
and investment spending suggest that
strong growth has continued into the
second quarter of 2004.

lower than two years ago, it has recently increased somewhat—albeit largely owing to an
increase in labor force participation; accordingly real wage growth, which exceeded growth
in labor productivity in much of 2002 and 2003, has slowed down in 2004 (see chart). House
prices have increased rapidly, with apartment prices in Riga more than doubling in the past

Box 1. Recent Developments in Inflation
Inflation in Latvia has been on the rise in recent months, surging to 6.2 percent at end-May from an
average of about 3 percent in previous years. This box suggests that the acceleration of inflation is
largely accounted for by one-off events and the depreciation of the Lats vis-à-vis the euro, rather than the
rapid credit growth. Furthermore, similar price movements have recently been observed in other new EU
member countries.

Changes in regulated rent and utility prices
accounted for slightly more than one percentage point in the overall inflation.
To meet EU requirements certain taxes were introduced, including excise taxes on fuel, and VAT
on pharmaceutical products.
The surge in world oil prices in the first half of 2004 caused fuel prices to rise.
The depreciation against the euro contributed to inflation over the past year. This is supported by
the fact that annual inflation in the other Baltic countries, which maintain currency board
arrangements vis-à-vis the euro, is lower, despite facing similar shocks otherwise.

For now credit growth does not appear to be contributing to higher inflation
•
•

The aforementioned exogenous factors likely contributed about 4 percentage points to inflation in
May (see table), which leaves little room for credit growth in explaining recent inflation.
Credit growth, while increasing vulnerability, is largely the result of catching up and reflects the
response to rising demand for credit in the economy. The ratio of credit to the private sector to
GDP, and the ratios of household debt to GDP and to disposable income, are all significantly below
European comparators and the equilibrium levels suggested by Latvia’s per capital income, the
degree of financial liberalization and the level of legal/regulatory/corporate culture (see Cottarelli,
Carlo, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia and Ivanna Vladkova-Hollar, “Early birds, late risers, and sleeping
beauties: bank credit growth to the private sector in Central and eastern Europe and the Balkans,”
IMF Working Paper/03/213).

The main risk to the inflation outlook is that price increases could become persistent if strong demand
continues to drive output above potential and causes credit growth to feed into inflation.

three years, but they seem to have stabilized recently and, adjusted for per capita income, are
not high by international standards. In addition, the surge in housing construction could
herald price weakening.
5.
The rapid credit growth has increased risks, but at present it appears consistent
with Latvia’s stage of development. Credit growth, by increasing private sector’s—and in
particular households’—indebtedness, has made the economy more vulnerable to exogenous
shocks. Furthermore, while it does not appear to have been responsible for the recent rise in
inflation, credit growth has likely accommodated the increase in the current account deficit.
Nevertheless, credit growth is largely a reflection of strong economic activity (rather than
irresponsible monetary policy or inappropriate lending practices) and appears justified by the
very low starting point and developmental/ institutional factors (see Box 1).2 In addition, the
increase in credit has been funded by sustainable sources—deposit growth, bond flotation on
the euro market, and internal funding arrangements by foreign banks with subsidiaries in
Latvia.
6.
In addition, there are no signs of deterioration in overall credit quality. The
banking system’s financial soundness indicators remain favorable (see table below).3
7.
Although the external current account deficit widened further in 2003 (to
8.6 percent of GDP), competitiveness does not appear to be a problem (Box 2 and
Selected Issues papers). At end-2003, the real effective exchange rate was below the
early-1999 levels. Latvia’s export penetration ratio has grown steadily since 1999, despite
unfavorable market conditions for its main export (wood and wood products), and has
surpassed the level reached before the Russia crisis in 1998. Furthermore, export growth over
the last 5 years has been accompanied by increasing profit margins. Latvia’s competitiveness
ranking by the World Economic Forum has also improved.

2

The ratio of household debt to GDP is about 20 percent, compared with the European
average of 57 percent and a level above 100 percent for most industrial countries (Austrian
National Bank, Financial Stability Report 6, Nov. 6, 2003).
3

The decline in commercial banks’ reserves-to-deposits ratio and liquidity ratio in 2003
reflects the reduction in reserve requirements.

Despite a significant reduction in net FDI, external debt has increased only
moderately and poses no immediate concern. Net FDI coverage of the current account
deficit, at 34 percent in 2003 was well below the average observed in the last three years—
nearly 60 percent. But this reflected two specific factors. First, Lattelekom’s capital was
reduced and in part returned to Teliasonera—the Finnish partner company. Second, a
significant part of the loans extended by parent companies to Latvian enterprises matured in
2003 and were repaid rather than rolled over. Net FDI is expected to increase in 2004 and

Box 2. Equilibrium Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness
For Latvia, the imminent ERM2 accession requires abandoning the current SDR peg and fixing a new euro peg.
Such a peg could serve as the basis for the eventual adoption of the euro. Assessing how close the current
exchange rate is to its equilibrium level is a daunting task in an economy undergoing rapid growth and structural
change. Some competitiveness indicators can nonetheless guide the analysis.

Latvia’s large external current account deficit
may suggest an underlying exchange rate
misalignment. However, as argued in IMF
Country Report No. 03/331, structural factors,
such as an increase in expected income and
investment explain most of the deficit during the
last decade. Indeed at end-2003, the Unit Labor
Cost (ULC-based) Real Effective Exchange
Rate (REER), the CPI-based REER and the PPIbased REER were all at or below early 1999
levels. In addition, the market-to-PPP exchange
rate ratio—well below unity—is about
10 percent lower than for Lithuania after
adjusting for per capita income.

Sources: Latvia authorities and Fund staff estimates.

A comprehensive study of the competitiveness in the Baltic states (Special Issues Paper: The Baltics:
Competitiveness on the Eve of EU Accession) concluded that the equilibrium exchange rate in Latvia appreciated
significantly in the early years of transition prompted by strong productivity growth and large capital inflows. The
REER has followed similar dynamics and, since 1999, has remained quite stable. Based on a broad range of
indicators, the analysis suggests no clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment in Latvia.
An exchange rate overvaluation could also
manifest itself in weak export performance.
Latvia’s export penetration, however, has grown
steadily since 1999. Market shares in EU and
world markets have grown about 25 percent
since 1999 and exports to the EU now accounts
for nearly 85 percent including the new
accession countries. Furthermore, export growth
and the successful penetration of international
markets have been accompanied by increasing
profit margins over the last 5 years. Despite the
limitations of the indicator employed—the ratio
of wage costs to value added—the figure is at
least indicative of a trend.

The BoL has been involved in foreign currency interventions and swaps with commercial banks to provide them
with needed liquidity. This could suggest that the parity is maintained artificially. The null hypothesis that total
interventions do not Granger cause the lats-SDR exchange rate cannot be rejected for all considered lag
structures. This suggests that the parity is likely sustained by fundamentals and the potential ability of the BoL to
intervene (with net international reserves equivalent to about 100 percent of reserve money) rather than by actual
interventions.

beyond. Gross external debt is about 80 percent of GDP, but more than half of this is due to
non-resident deposits (see Table 6). These deposits are in large part dollar denominated and
officially come from the USA, even though, according to the BoL, they include funds
repatriated by Latvian citizens and funds that originate in CIS countries. The latter are mostly
for import-export operations or for safe keeping—as in the case of deposits from Ukraine and
Russia. Non-resident deposits are largely redeposited in foreign banks or placed in other
liquid foreign assets in OECD countries, closely matching the currencies of the deposits.4 In
light of these features and in line with the Board paper on Debt-and-Reserve-Related
Indicators of External Vulnerability (www.imf.org), the notion of net external debt appears to
be a more appropriate measure to assess Latvia’s external vulnerability. Net debt is only
25 percent of GDP.
9.
Fiscal performance has improved appreciably, and public debt remains very low
(13½ percent of GDP in 2003). The general government budget deficit, at 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2003,5 narrowed by nearly 1 percentage point from 2002. This outcome reflected
lower-than-budgeted expenditures, unexpectedly high tax revenues, and lower net lending.
Subsidies, transfers, and capital spending were lower than budgeted, and, owing to the
recently established restraining mechanisms on advance payments, a repeat of the end-2002
spending spree did not materialize. On the revenue side, the collection of personal income
tax, social tax, VAT, and excise tax was especially good due to buoyant growth, as well as to
the implementation of several tax administration measures. The strong revenue performance
has continued in 2004, resulting in a small surplus as of May, despite interruptions to VAT
and excise collection following EU accession.
10.
Further steps have been taken to fight corruption; while AML/CFT enforcement
has remained weak. The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) established
a National Program for Preventing and Combating Corruption and began investigating cases
of corruption involving high officials in 2003. In May, Parliament elected a new director for
the bureau after a prolonged process complicated by political interference. Recent
amendments to the AML/CFT legislation put the Latvian law in line with the international
standards and procedures required by the EU. Enforcement, however, remains weak and
Latvia was recently put on the list of countries—compiled by the U.S. Treasury—deeply
involved in money laundering.
11.
Latvia’s statistical system has been evaluated with a Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module, published on July 1, 2004. The ROSC

Despite the redepositing, commercial banks have negative net foreign assets, reflecting
long-term financing of domestic branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks and more
recently the floating of euro-denominated bonds by commercial banks.

indicates a well-functioning statistical system with good interagency coordination, a
commitment to quality, and generally strong data series. However, in some areas the ROSC
team recommended improvements, in particular concerning the compilation of the CPI,
government financial statistics, and some monetary statistics. The Central Statistical Bureau
recently revised the calculation of fixed asset depreciation and imputed rent in national
accounts in compliance with ESA 95, resulting in higher nominal GDP.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions focused on two main areas: the authorities’ ERM2 accession strategy
and the potential risks of overheating and the associated role of fiscal policy. The
authorities are moving ahead with their plans to enter ERM2 in January 2005. Staff agreed
with the authorities that a more rapid path would not be necessary or desirable, given the
adjustments needed in the interim. They described the measures they were undertaking to
make the transition smooth. The discussion centered on the feasibility of the authorities’
strategy and the vulnerabilities that may endanger the success of Latvia’s participation in
ERM2. On overheating, the authorities generally argued that the risks were limited. Staff
stressed the need to forestall the potential risks of overheating and to address the large
external deficit. It urged a stronger emphasis on strengthening the flexibility of fiscal policy
in dealing with shocks—in view of the increasingly limited role of monetary policy—and
adopting a tighter fiscal stance. While the BoL favored an immediate fiscal tightening, the
MoF regarded it as not feasible. The authorities and the mission also jointly performed stress
tests—in the context of an updated analysis of FSAP-related issues—to assess potential
financial sector vulnerabilities stemming from rapid credit growth and other developments.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
13.
The outlook remains favorable, with real GDP expected to grow 6½ percent in
2004, driven by strong domestic demand and ongoing recovery in Europe. The

reforms.6 Regarding recent price developments, the BoL and the Ministry of Economy
attributed the pickup in inflation to EU accession and expected it to come down by year’s
end; the BoL’s latest projection for end-2004 is 4.5 percent, compared with staff’s projection
of 5 percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 9¼ percent of GDP in 2004,
a view shared by the authorities, and to remain quite large in the next few years, reflecting
large one-off effects triggered by EU accession and the adoption of EU standards on
environmental protection.7 However, the ongoing economic recovery in the euro area could
boost Latvian exports more than currently expected and in part curb the trend. In view of the
large current account deficit and the various risks to inflation, staff stressed the need for a
prudent fiscal path. In the scenario projected by staff, the current account will improve
gradually beyond 2004. The trend reflects the assumptions of continued fiscal consolidation
and some improvements in private saving (as the effect of one-off imports wears out and as
catch-up continues and the propensity to consume gradually declines).
14.
While inflation was broadly consistent with the Maastricht criterion at end-2003,
there are some upside risks in the period ahead. In the absence of fiscal adjustments, high
inflation could become persistent, because of the spillover effects of one-off factors (in
particular oil prices) and/or if continuing rapid credit growth causes capacity constraints and
starts to feed into inflation. In addition, the authorities recognized that the risks of
overheating would increase in the run-up to euro adoption. In particular, the economy could
face a demand boom as capital inflows increase and as interest rates converge to European
levels. The risks are intensified by Latvia’s geographic position, which makes it an ideal base
for Russian firms trying to enter the EU market and for EU companies targeting the CIS
markets. Other upside risks to inflation over the medium term include those that arise from
the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effect and further tariff harmonization required by EU accession.
The BoL argues in a recent study that the BS effect is probably small in Latvia. Staff noted
the difficulties in measuring this effect with any precision in a transition economy and that
estimated effects in many other countries were generally positive. The harmonization of
tariffs will put additional upward pressure through higher administered prices. The direct
impact on CPI inflation should peak in 2004 at about one percentage point and then subside
gradually with the last adjustment scheduled for end-2007.
15.
Assuming gradual fiscal consolidation and efforts to tackle other potential
vulnerabilities, medium-term fiscal and external sustainability would be maintained.
With real GDP expected to grow by about 6 percent per annum as the catch-up process

continues, external debt would remain sustainable in the staff’s scenario, despite the large
current account deficit. Assuming a conservative path for FDI, gross external debt could
reach almost 100 percent of GDP by 2008 (Table 6). However, net external debt would
increase to 40 percent of GDP and in most of the stress test scenarios envisaged would
remain under 60 percent of GDP. The risks emanating from the short term nature of nonresident deposits (which constitute over 50 percent of gross external debt) or from their
possible dubious origins are relatively limited (see Box 6 on dollarization and the “Uruguay
effect” in the Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation—IMF Country Report
No. 03/113). Leakages from these deposits to the domestic market are small and effected only
by two banks, which are not systemically important. Assessing public debt sustainability,
however, is made difficult by the absence of an official medium-term budgetary framework
(see ¶25). Given the low level of public debt, it is unlikely that a looser fiscal deficit path
than envisaged by staff could in itself cause fiscal sustainability problems. But such a path,
together with continuing rapid credit growth, could jeopardize external sustainability and
make the economy more vulnerable to external shocks. It could also generate financing
problems—although FDI could well be higher than projected by staff. Staff also noted that
the import cover of foreign reserves had declined to 2.5 months and was expected to decrease
further this year. The authorities pointed out that this was due to the impressive import
growth rate driven by one-off capital goods purchases; in real terms reserves had continued to
grow. Also, the new

Reserves remain over 120 percent of short-term external debt, excluding non-resident

B. ERM2 Entry and Monetary Policy
16.
The authorities plan to enter ERM2 in January 2005 and introduce the euro in
January 2008—following the EU assessment in mid-2007. The BoL and various
commercial banks noted that this schedule should allow all stakeholders sufficient time to
prepare. The authorities did not consider that speeding up the process by repegging the lats to
the euro before entering ERM2 would be desirable, since a January repegging had already
been incorporated in private agents’ plans. In addition, the switch from the SDR to the euro
would require adjustments in the financial system (see below). For these reasons, staff
supported the proposed entry path, which is slower than Latvia’s Baltic neighbors. The
authorities intend to adopt the lats-euro market exchange rate immediately prior to entry as
the ERM2 parity and to continue to use a narrow band (plus/minus1 percent) during the
ERM2 period. They noted that using a different parity, after the lats-SDR peg had been
successfully maintained for 10 years, could diminish the BOL’s credibility. Moreover, there
were no signs of a misalignment—notwithstanding the large current account deficit. Staff
agreed with this assessment, but felt that as a precaution against any risk of misalignment, the
parity choice should be revisited again prior to ERM2 entry.
17.
The authorities described the supporting measures they would take to guarantee
a successful ERM2 entry. Regarding the special reserve management procedures involved
in the repegging, the BoL noted that, to reequilibrate its portfolio, it had contacted the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS) and other counterparts to conclude a series of forward
contracts and swaps to hedge about 60 percent of its reserves. The currency composition of
reserves is being adjusted to reflect the reduction in risk of euro fluctuations, and the
corresponding increase in risk of other currencies. The process should be completed before
the end of the year. Staff stressed that similar adjustments would have to be undertaken by
commercial banks, enterprises, and, especially, individuals to avoid serious currency
mismatches. In particular, given the widespread financial dollarization, the adjustment may
involve the refinancing of mortgages and long-term loans, amendments to outstanding
contracts, and the preparation of new templates for future contracts. The authorities pointed
to their extensive information campaign directed at commercial banks and the public.
18.
The mission stressed the need to further improve monetary management in
preparing to join the EMU. In particular, to familiarize commercial banks with standard
instruments, open market operations should be developed further and substitute the
widespread use of foreign exchange rate swaps. The BoL noted that commercial banks found
swaps to be the cheapest way to manage liquidity and that there was no problem with
confidence in BoL policies or currency stability. The mission agreed with this interpretation,
but pointed out that existing liquidity provision procedures available to euro-area countries

- 14 -

were mainly based on open market operations. For this reason, the ERM2 period should be
used to train banks and streamline the procedures for open market operations.
C. Financial Sector
19.
The financial system’s stability was the object of an updated analysis of FSAPrelated issues. The banking system is well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, but the
authorities agreed that the rapid credit growth, the high proportion of nonresident deposits,
and the volatility of the dollar-euro exchange rate were a major concern. The BoL and FCMC
prepared, with staff assistance, specific stress tests. These revealed that the banking system
was highly resilient to the first-round effects of possible shocks, including severe
deterioration of overall credit quality or of the mortgage portfolio, and large changes in
interest rates or the exchange rate. Nevertheless, to minimize financial institutions’ risk
exposure and to reduce vulnerabilities generated by rapid credit growth—for example
possible balance sheet problems for borrowers-the mission supported the authorities’ cautious
initiatives to tighten prudential guidelines, in particular in relation to mortgage loans. The
authorities agreed that such measures should be applied judiciously because they had the
potential to distort the financial market, create perverse incentives, and their effect on overall
credit growth would likely be limited.

Box 3. Banking System Strengths and Vulnerabilities, and Prudential Responses
There has been no deterioration of credit quality, and banks are resilient to a decline in credit quality:
•
NPLs are 1.4 percent of total loans;
•

If a collapse of real estate values forced banks to write off 30 percent of their exposure, no bank
would be at risk of bankruptcy unless there are significant second round effects.

Exposure to exchange rate, liquidity, interest rate and real sector risks are contained, and no bank is at
risk of insolvency under stress test scenarios. In particular:
•
Banks are subject to a maximum on their total NOP exposure, equivalent to 20 percent of capital;
•

Liquid asset holding by banks exceeds their foreign currency deposits;

•

Interest rate risk is limited by the fact that marketable securities comprise almost 40 percent of
bank assets, and most loans are priced in relation to a variable reference rate;

•

Real sector risks are diversified, because, apart from households, bank lending is not
concentrated in any one economic sector.

Intensified surveillance of banks is advisable, but the use of prudential controls as a credit rationing
measure is likely to have limited effects.
•
The FCMC should encourage banks to maintain conservative risk guidelines, including
tightening loan-to-value guidelines, and should carefully monitor systems and guidelines for
asset valuation, documentation and certification;

•

Banks should be encouraged, as far as possible, to match the currency of the denomination of
loans to the currency of the borrower’s earnings.

D. Fiscal Policy
20.
The authorities’ 2004 budget envisages a deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP,
1 percentage point lower than the original 2003 budget—but higher than the actual 2003
outcome. The budget makes an effort to cut discretionary expenditure (in real terms) to allow
for EU and NATO related spending. Higher-than-expected GDP resulted in significant
overperformance in 2003 and continues to do so in 2004. Revenues in May did not appear to
suffer as much as expected from EU accession, although some risks remain, because of
procedural changes associated with the introduction of new EU borders.
21.
Given the potential risks of overheating for inflation and the current account,
and the strong revenue performance so far in 2004, staff urged the authorities to
explore the possibility of restraining expenditure below budget in 2004 and, at a
minimum, use any additional revenues to lower the deficit. Staff projects that revenues for
the year as a whole could be higher than originally budgeted by ½ percent of GDP, given the
larger-than-projected tax base, and recent performance. While the authorities are receptive to
this outlook, they are reluctant to revise revenue projections before the fall of 2004, when the
impact of EU accession will become clearer.
22.
A supplementary budget will be prepared in the fall. The amendments will
incorporate increased spending for the second biannual adjustment of pensions to inflation
and for cofinancing of EU funds. Staff urged the authorities to find savings elsewhere to
make room for these changes—for example by reducing expenditure on goods and services in
the main budget. The BoL expressed its open support for an immediate fiscal tightening,
noting the limited power of monetary policy in controlling inflationary pressure, and the
delay between taking fiscal measures and their effect on inflation. Some members of the
cabinet, however, voiced their outspoken opposition to this proposal.
23.
For 2005, the authorities are considering a tentative fiscal deficit target of about
2 percent of GDP. In the absence of detailed information during the mission on the
authorities’ expenditure and revenue projections, a full discussion of the budget was
postponed. Staff argued that, given the favorable macroeconomic environment and the need
to pre-empt increased risk of excess demand, a budget deficit target of around 1¼ percent of
GDP would be both desirable and feasible. The authorities pointed out that their deficit target
took account of the large cofinancing need, the lag in receiving EU funds, and the need for
infrastructural spending to sustain growth. The mission acknowledged the importance of
these factors, but urged the authorities to make efforts to free resources by limiting
discretionary spending. Staff also stressed that the planning of cofinancing related to the
disbursement of EU funds and the budget formulation process should be coordinated in a
multiyear context. In the absence of such a framework, for example, the bulk of an advance
payment by the EU of LVL 100 million for the period 2004–06, was included in the 2004
budget.

- 16 -

24.
In the medium term, a balanced budget remains the authorities’ objective, but
their plans do not appear to support it. The authorities agreed with the mission that fiscal
consolidation was crucial to curb the large current account deficit and to ensure a fiscal
balance consistent with successful membership in the euro area. However, they noted that too
rapid an adjustment could hamper the objective of catching up. The absence of a mediumterm budgetary framework makes it difficult to assess the authorities’ plans. However, based
on the mission discussions and the authorities’ Convergence Programme finalized after the
mission, they appear to be willing to maintain a deficit of about 2 percent for the next few
years. The mission urged the authorities to speed up fiscal consolidation, given the large
current account deficit and the risks of overheating. According to staff’s projections,
assuming trend GDP growth, the deficit could be lowered by about 0.2 percentage points
annually, without hampering EU-related and social expenditure. This would require
expenditures on wages, goods and services, and transfers to grow below nominal GDP.

25.
The authorities agreed that developing a medium-term budget framework would
greatly enhance fiscal policy. Such a framework is crucial for strengthening the budgeting
of resources, including EU funds. However, they argued that Latvia lacked the capacity and
preparedness to implement a multiyear budget. The strategic planning process piloted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, which aims to link budgetary resources to policy objectives, has been
successful; however, it has had little impact on actual budget formulation because other line
ministries are lagging behind. Nevertheless, this approach will be extended progressively to
other line ministries. By 2006 all line ministries are expected to develop strategic plans,
which will be used to formulate a multiyear budget.
E. Structural and Other Issues
26.
Strengthening the flexibility of the Latvian economy is key to a successful
integration with the European community. Reforms are under way in four key areas.
Corruption and money laundering
•

After its successful enforcement efforts, KNAB will now focus on prevention and
education. The mission commended the bureau for the impressive results, but noted
that enforcement should remain strong. In view of the proposed transfer of
supervisory function from the PM office to Parliament, staff reiterated the need to
maintain the bureau’s independence from political pressure.

•

The authorities noted that the recent inclusion of Latvia in the list—compiled by the
U.S. Treasury—of countries deeply involved in money laundering was the result of
indirect inference, based mainly on aggregate indicators rather than explicit evidence.
The list, for example, also includes the United States and Germany. The mission
agreed that after the latest legislative amendments more time was needed to see the
results of ongoing investigations.

Business environment and privatization
•

Improvements in the business environment are noticeable. The World Economic
Forum on Competitiveness has lately assigned Latvia a very high ranking, just after
Estonia. As recommended by the Fund and the World Bank, business surveys are now
conducted and the results published on a regular basis on the website:
www.lda.gov.lv. Staff commended the authorities for their constructive dialogue with
the Foreign Investors’ Council and the practice of elaborating annual action plans.
However, it noted that further improvements are necessary to attract foreign
investments. In particular, amendments to the law on insolvency are needed to better
guarantee creditors’ rights; and public procurement procedures, especially at the
regional and municipal level, should be streamlined and made more transparent.

- 18 -

•

New public utility and telecommunication tariffs were established in 2003, aimed at
promoting competition. The separation of the production, transmission, and
distribution functions was completed from an accounting perspective for the large
energy providers. However, the authorities felt that the privatization of the remaining
public concerns should follow an appropriate restructuring. More recently, the Prime
Minister has publicly stated that Lattelekom should not be privatized.

•

Latvia has adopted EU’s trade policy and agreements. While acknowledging that
several glitches on the eastern border had obstructed imports and exports for several
days, the authorities noted that these had been rapidly corrected.

Public sector reforms
•

The public administration is being reformed after the needed legislation took force at
the beginning of 2003. Under this law, by 2006 all state agencies will have to operate
as nonprofit institutions.

•

The authorities stated that although the civil servant pay reform initiated in 2002 had
stalled for lack of resources, it would be pursued next year.

Data issues
•

The authorities found the data ROSC very useful, and confirmed their intention to
implement all the remaining recommendations.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

27.
Following the successes of the past decade, Latvia is in a strong position to
maintain high growth and benefit from the opportunities offered by EU accession and
the forthcoming euro adoption. Overall, prospects are favorable. Given the success with the
hard peg during the last ten years, Latvia is generally well-placed for ERM2 entry and euro
adoption. EU accession should over time create positive synergies, thus supporting structural
reforms and fiscal consolidation, and reduce risk premium and interest rates, thus fostering
financial integration. Risks, however, need to be recognized. The current account deficit
(albeit in good part financed by FDI) is large and feeds into external debt; a credit-fed boom
could create an overheating episode or a weakening of bank balance sheets; and a recent spurt
in inflation could become entrenched. The burden of preempting any of these risks will fall
mainly on fiscal policy and bank supervision. Over the longer term, real convergence will
require attention to maintaining a flexible labor market, an appropriate level of
competitiveness and structural conditions aimed at boosting Latvia’s growth potential.
28.
The immediate challenge is to secure a smooth ERM2 entry. The authorities’
overall strategy for repegging and ERM2 accession appears appropriate. The announced entry
path, which is slower than Latvia’s Baltic neighbors, is justified. The exchange rate does not

- 19 -

appear to be misaligned and the market lats-euro exchange rate at the time of entry will likely
be the appropriate entry rate. It would be wise, however, to reassess the risks of misalignment
prior to entry.
29.
Fiscal policy will increasingly be the principal tool of demand management and
will need to curb any emerging excesses in demand growth or the current account
deficit. Further tightening in 2004–05 would reduce the risks of overheating and increase the
flexibility of fiscal policy over the course of the business cycle. It is paramount that the
supplementary budget in the fall not include new spending, and that savings in discretionary
spending be found to accommodate the necessary adjustments caused by the inflation
indexation of pensions and increased cofinancing needs. In addition, any revenues in excess
of the budgeted amount should be used to lower the deficit. For 2005, these considerations
suggest that a deficit target of around 1¼ percent of GDP would be optimal. Such a target,
together with the need to make room for recent tax rate reductions raise the urgency for
discretionary spending cuts. Over the medium term, favorable revenues developments should
be used to tackle the risks of excess demand and improve Latvia’s external position.
30.
In order to enhance the quality of fiscal policy and the credibility of mediumterm objectives, the development of a medium-term budgetary framework should be
accelerated. Such a framework would help plan expenditure out of EU funds and facilitate
the medium-term stabilizing role of fiscal policy. In the absence of such a framework, the
authorities’ medium-term plans cannot be satisfactorily assessed.
31.
Strengthening fiscal policy and fiscal flexibility is also needed in order to tackle
increased risks resulting from rapid credit growth. While credit growth is largely a
reflection of Latvia’s developmental needs and does not appear to have contributed to the
recent rise in inflation, it has increased vulnerabilities to shocks. A more flexible fiscal policy
would enable the authorities to address such shocks in a more effective and speedy manner.
32.
While the financial system is sound, tighter prudential guidelines could also help
reduce risks that rapid credit growth will lead to worsening portfolio quality. The
banking system appears resilient to the impact of a wide range of shocks. However, because
continued rapid credit growth carries the danger of deterioration in loan quality as well as
potential balance sheet problems for borrowers, the authorities could judiciously tighten
prudential guidelines, while bearing in mind their likely limited impact on overall credit
growth. Furthermore, while leakages from non-resident deposits to the domestic credit
market are at present very small, given the large magnitude of these deposits, careful
monitoring is called for. In particular, the rather strict rules on open positions may not be
sufficient to forestall the risks associated with a sudden withdrawal of these deposits; and the
FCMC should make sure that banks maintain matching and high-quality liquid assets.
33.
Progress against corruption and the fight against AML need to be accelerated.
KNAB’s enforcement efforts have been successful. However, the announced shift of
emphasis toward prevention should not translate into lax enforcement. It is also crucial that

- 20 -

KNAB remain independent from political pressure. Recent amendments to the AML
legislation should bear fruit soon after the ongoing investigations are completed.
34.
The quality and timeliness of statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes
and the statistical system is functioning well. The authorities should proceed with
implementing the recommendations of the data ROSC, in particular concerning the
compilation of the CPI, government financial statistics, and some monetary statistics.
35.
The staff welcomes Latvia’s decision to publish this Article IV staff report and
recommends that Latvia remain on a standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Sources: Latvian authorities and staff estimates.
1/ Estimates of private transfers received were increased substantially following the introduction of a new survey methodology in 2002.
2/ The large swings in portfolio investment reflect to a large extent a planned Eurobond issue of 400 million and related amortization of 225 million
in 2004.
3/ Methodological changes in the recording of textile exports in 2002 account for 2.6 percentage points of total export growth.
4/ Without LASCO's import of three ships in 2001, the FDI coverage of the current account deficit would be 28 percent, and 51 percent
if a loan repayment from a leasing subsidiary to its foreign parent (resulting from a restructuring of the concern) in December 2001 is also excluded.

II. Stress Tests for External Gross Debt
1. GDP growth, interest rate, deflator, non-interest curr.acc., and non-debt inflows are at historical average in 2003-2008
2. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus 4 percentage points in 2004 and 2005
3. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
4. Change in US dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
5. Non-interest current-account deficit is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2004 and 2005
6. One time 15 percent nominal depreciation in 2004
7. FDI drops to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005 with 30 percent offsetting decline in imports

1/ One third of total projected FDI is assumed to be debt creating (loans from parent companies).
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real
GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ This term includes exchange-rate valuation effects, which in 2000 and 2001 may explain 1 - 2 percentage points of the debt increase. The large debt increase in these years does also reflect methodological
changes.
5/ Defined as non-interest current account deficit, plus interest and amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Data consistency problems, including methodological changes, prevent use of a longer historic sample. It should be noted, nonetheless, that earlier years did include negative growth and financial instability.

APPENDIX II

STATISTICAL APPENDIX
1.
The authorities have a very open and well-articulated data dissemination and
publication policy. Most economic and financial statistics are reported to the Fund on a
regular and timely basis, and many additional economic and financial aggregates are readily
available on the websites of the Bank of Latvia (BoL) and Latvian government institutions
and agencies. The authorities are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial
Statistics, Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Latvia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and meets SDDS specifications for the coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars,
and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB,
http://dsbb.imf.org). There is increased cooperation on data issues between the Central
Statistical Bureau (CSB), the BoL, the Ministry of Finance, and the customs authorities.
2.
During the period December 1996–December 1998, a Fund Resident Statistical
Advisor for the Baltic States assisted the Latvian authorities in improving the database on
macroeconomic statistics, and a Fund Resident Statistical Advisor for balance-of-payments
issues assisted the authorities from October 1999-October 2000. Advice on statistical matters
is also provided by EUROSTAT as a part of the EU accession process.
National accounts
3.
The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts statistics using the
production and expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis, largely following the
1993 SNA and ESA-95. However, there are significant discrepancies between the GDP
estimates based on production and those based on expenditure. The underlying data for the
production approach are obtained primarily through a comprehensive survey of businesses
and individuals, and are supplemented by data from labor force surveys and from
administrative sources. The CSB believes that the basic data understate economic activity,
particularly in the private sector, and there is an ongoing effort to increase coverage. Official
national accounts data include an adjustment for under-recording, which the CSB currently
estimates as 16 percent of total GDP. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are
obtained from household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and
ministries.
Prices
4.
The CSB compiles a nationwide consumer price index. With Fund technical
assistance, it has developed appropriate methodologies to deal with most of the technical
problems resulting from the major structural shifts that have occurred in the economy.
Reporting improved markedly during 1998, in part due to the implementation of a new
household budget survey, based on World Bank technical assistance, enabling the CSB to

- 32 -

APPENDIX II

compile indices for different types of households. Following advice from EUROSTAT, the
weights in the CPI basket are now revised annually. The weights in the producer price index
are updated annually and the index covers almost three quarters of total industrial activity.
The CSB also publishes export and import unit value and volume indices.
Government finance statistics
5.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations,
the available information permits the compilation of the consolidated accounts of the general
government.
Monetary statistics
6.
Monetary data are comprehensive, timely, and comply with international standards.
Specifically, data on the balance sheets of the BoL, commercial banks, and other financial
institutions, as well as the banking survey, are compiled with a very short time lag,
i.e., within two weeks of the end of the reporting period. Fund staff is also weekly provided
with data on foreign exchange transactions, including outright interventions and foreign
currency swaps. The institutional coverage, classification, and sectorization of accounts
comply with Fund standards. Interest rate data are compiled and published with equally short
time lags. The BoL also reports comprehensive data on banking supervision and prudential
regulations.
Balance of payments statistics
7.
The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics
from the CSB in early 2000, and since 2001 has published monthly statistics derived from an
international transactions reporting system (ITRS). This source is to be supplemented with
the results of three quarterly surveys that were launched in 2000: non-financial enterprises,
foreign direct investment and related income flows, and transportation services. An annual
survey of other services was launched beginning with data for 2002.
8.
The trade account is affected by recording problems and compilation of financial
account transactions is hampered by inadequate sources. Merchandise trade data, based
largely on customs data, underestimate imports and exports of about 140 Custom-bonded
warehouses and three free trade zones. There is a need to improve procedures to ensure that
goods passing through customs warehouses are properly valued. Coverage of exports to
Russia and CIS countries is incomplete; and re-exports of cars and shuttle trade items are
particularly difficult to capture. Estimates of travel credits and debits have been improved
through a revised survey. In general, surveys techniques need to be further improved. The
BoL made methodological improvements in compiling statistics on private transfers and
textile exports in 2002. The improvements in survey techniques related to private transfers

- 33 -

APPENDIX II

better capture income that sailors and other Latvians repatriate to Latvia. Regarding textile
exports, the authorities found that many companies declared only the value added part of
their processed textile exports, although they reported the full value added of imported
inputs. While these methodological improvements are welcome, no attempt has been made to
revise earlier data. The resulting break in the data series hampers their usefulness for analysis.
Debt data from Latvia’s International Investment Position (IIP) show a more rapid buildup of
debt than is indicated by the BOP statistics, and efforts are needed to explain and address this
and other divergences between IIP and BOP data. These were among the issues addressed in
a Data ROSC mission from the Fund in September 2003.
9.
The authorities have taken stock of the Resident Advisor’s recommendations and
adopted in October 2001 an action plan to improve balance of payments statistics coverage
for merchandise trade and travel data. However, they have not reported any improvement in
their compilation techniques for financial transaction items nor identified whether the survey
on foreign bank accounts of enterprises programmed for 2001 has been implemented.
Data dissemination standards
10.
Latvia has subscribed to the Fund’s SDDS since November 1996 and has been
posting metadata on the DSBB since December 1997. Latvia has disseminated data on the
reserves template since May 2000.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Latvia
On August 4, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Latvia.1
Background
Latvia’s successful transition culminated in EU accession on May 1. Impressive economic
performance—an average real GDP growth of 6 per cent per annum since 1998, the highest
among accession countries—has been fostered by responsible fiscal and monetary policies and
bold structural reforms. However, per capita income is still below that of the other acceding
countries and stands at a little more than one third of the EU-15 average, suggesting that real
convergence remains a long-term objective.
Since the last Article IV consultation discussions, economic activity has maintained its
momentum, as GDP grew 7½ percent in 2003 and 8¾ percent year-on-year in the first quarter
of 2004; however, inflation climbed to 6.1 percent at end-June from 3.6 percent at end-2003.
Exogenous factors (in particular the hike in oil prices and tax rate increases resulting from EU
tax harmonization) were largely responsible for this bout of inflation. Several elements suggest
that overheating could be a potential concern in the run-up to euro adoption, but the evidence is
at present mixed. In particular, while above-trend growth may have created a positive output
gap, capacity utilization in manufacturing has remained unchanged over the past 12 months.
In addition, unemployment, which is significantly lower than two years ago, has recently
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2increased somewhat (in large part owing to increased participation), and real wage growth has
slowed in 2004. House price inflation also appears to have decelerated.
Latvia’s external position has worsened: the current account deficit reached 8.6 percent of GDP
in 2003, as consumption spilled over into imports, and foreign direct investment coverage of the
deficit declined (to 34 percent from an average of about 60 percent in the last few years).
However, the latter development is likely temporary, and, furthermore, competitiveness does not
appear to have weakened. Latvia’s export penetration continues to expand despite unfavorable
market conditions for its main export and has been accompanied by increasing profit margins.
Credit continues to grow rapidly (about 40 percent per annum in the last three years), driven by
mortgage and consumption loans, although it does not appear to have contributed to higher
inflation. The credit growth is, however, increasing the vulnerability of the economy to external
shocks that may feed into inflation or weaken household balance sheets.
Fiscal performance has improved appreciably, and public debt remains low. The general budget
deficit, at 1.6 percent of GDP in 2003, narrowed by nearly 1 percentage point from 2002,
reflecting lower-than-budgeted expenditures, unexpectedly high tax revenues, and lower net
lending. Lower expenditures were helped by the adoption of restraining mechanisms on
advance payments. On the revenue side, the collection of personal income tax, social tax, VAT,
and excise tax was particularly good due to buoyant growth and the implementation of several
tax administration measures. The strong revenue performance has continued in 2004, resulting
in a small surplus as of May, despite interruptions to VAT and excise collections following EU
accession.
The fight against corruption and state capture continues. The Corruption Prevention and
Combating Bureau (KNAB) established a National Program for Combating and Preventing
Corruption and began investigating cases of corruption involving high officials in 2003.
The Parliament (Saeima) elected a new director for the bureau after a long process,
complicated by political interference. The recently approved amendments to the law on
AML/CFT put legislation in line with international standards, but enforcement needs to be
strengthened.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Latvia’s accession to the European Union and agreed that,
following the successful transition of the past decade, Latvia is now in a strong position to reap
the maximum benefits of EU membership and the prospect of euro adoption. Directors
commended the authorities for the impressive growth performance in 2003, which continued to
be among the best in the EU accession countries, and for the better-than-expected fiscal
outcome—a result of both revenue and expenditure efforts.
Directors observed that the growth outlook remains favorable, driven by strong domestic
demand and ongoing recovery in Europe. The widening external current account deficit and
rapid credit growth—though consistent with Latvia’s development needs—will, however, require
a prudent fiscal path and vigilant bank supervision. Over the longer term, Directors stressed

-3that, to achieve real convergence with European standards of living, Latvia will need to maintain
macroeconomic stability and a flexible labor market, and pursue further structural reforms aimed
at boosting the country’s growth potential and safeguarding its competitiveness.
Directors agreed that Latvia’s immediate challenge is to secure a smooth ERM2 entry.
They supported the authorities’ overall strategy for repegging the currency from the SDR to the
euro, and pursuing an entry path that is slower than Latvia’s Baltic neighbors. While the market
exchange rate does not appear misaligned, Directors recommended that the authorities
reassess the ERM2 parity choice prior to entry. They also suggested that the ERM2 period
should be used to further improve monetary management and develop instruments for liquidity
management based on open market operations.
Directors considered that the recent rise in inflation—though largely due to one-off factors—
together with the rapid credit growth, could increase the vulnerability to external shocks.
They underscored the increased role that fiscal policy should play as the principal tool of
demand management, including by increasing the flexibility of fiscal policy over the course of
the business cycle. To ward off potential overheating risks in a timely manner, Directors urged
the authorities to use the opportunity of the favorable macroeconomic environment to aim for a
tighter fiscal policy stance than currently envisaged, even though they recognized Latvia’s
significant infrastructure needs. In this context, they expressed concern that the supplementary
budget for 2004 could result in an overall increase in expenditure, and urged the authorities to
use revenues in excess of the original budget to lower the deficit. Efforts to broaden the tax
base should also be sustained.
Looking ahead, Directors underscored the importance of moving toward fiscal balance over the
medium term, consistent with EU membership. While Latvia’s low level of public debt and fiscal
deficit path do not pose direct fiscal sustainability problems, Directors saw a further
strengthening of fiscal policy as key to addressing external sustainability concerns that could
arise from continuing rapid credit growth. In this context, they urged the authorities to work
toward developing a medium-term budgetary framework to improve the quality of fiscal policy
and the credibility of medium-term objectives. Such a framework would also help plan
expenditure out of EU funds and enhance the role of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy.
Directors noted that Latvia’s banking system is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid, and
appears resilient to a wide range of shocks. Nevertheless, the rapid expansion of credit, the
potential volatility of nonresident deposits, and the possibility of increased short-term capital
inflows following Latvia’s integration into the EU all require close monitoring. Directors therefore
welcomed the steps being taken to tighten liquidity, and strengthen bank supervision and
prudential guidelines, although it was recognized that the impact of prudential tightening on
overall credit growth may be limited. They stressed that particular attention should be given to
preventing balance sheet problems for borrowers, and minimizing possible leakages to the
domestic market from the sizeable nonresident deposits. In addition to strict rules on banks’
open positions, it will be important to ensure that banks maintain matching and high-quality
liquid assets.

-4Directors looked forward to continuing progress on promoting private sector activity, attracting
foreign direct investment, and reducing the still high unemployment level. They welcomed the
authorities’ resolute commitment to improve the business environment, and encouraged them to
sustain their efforts to enhance export diversification, raise labor productivity, and remove
remaining administrative barriers and other obstacles to business. In particular, Directors
highlighted the importance of amendments to the insolvency law to improve creditors’ rights and
making public procurement procedures more transparent. They encouraged the authorities to
press ahead with the reorganization and eventual privatization of the remaining public concerns.
Directors commended the authorities’ progress on fighting corruption, while underscoring the
importance of ensuring that the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau remains
independent from political pressure and maintains its strong enforcement efforts. They
welcomed the recent amendments to the AML/CFT legislation in line with international
standards, and urged the authorities to ensure its strict enforcement.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Republic of Latvia
and Jelena Zubkova, Assistant to Executive Director
August 4, 2004
On behalf of our Latvian authorities, we would like to thank Mr. Samiei and his team for
their well-balanced appraisal of Latvia’s economic performance. Our authorities broadly
agree with their analysis and recommendations, and they appreciate the constructive dialogue
and advice of the staff. The fruitful cooperation with the Fund has been very useful in
helping Latvia to make progress on its way of economic transformation and towards the EU
entry.
The EU accession on May 1, 2004 marks an important milestone for Latvia, testifying the
success of the authorities’ efforts in transforming the economy over the last decade. The
work towards this goal has facilitated and strengthened the authorities’ focus on
macroeconomic stability, placing major emphasis on fiscal discipline, price and exchange
rate stability, and determined structural reforms. This should make Latvia well-placed to
meet the challenges of the integration within the EU.
Economic Developments and Outlook
In recent years, Latvia has taken a leading position among the new EU member states in
terms of average GDP growth. Supported by a strong domestic demand and a resilient
merchandise export, real GDP grew by 7.5 percent in 2003, and reached 8.8 percent in the
first quarter of this year. For 2004, the authorities project a GDP growth of about 7.0 percent,
or some 0.5 percentage points higher than staff's projection. Domestic demand is expected to
remain the driving force of the economic upturn. However, export performance is also
anticipated to strengthen in line with global recovery and improved access to the EU market.
Inflation is expected to reach about 4.5 percent in 2004 (annual, average basis) and come
down to around 3 percent in the next few years. The current account deficit is expected to
remain at a relatively high level in the next few years due to the large one-off effects
triggered by the EU accession and several large investment projects (e.g., improvement in the
energy infrastructure by the Latvenergo, renewal of the fleet by the Latvian Shipping
Company and others).
In the staff paper, concern is expressed regarding a possible overheating of the Latvian
economy. However, as outlined by staff, the evidence is not conclusive. On the one hand,
GDP growth is at present above the potential, the current account deficit is widening further,
private consumption is expanding at a fast pace and in June inflation picked up to 6.1 percent
(on an annual basis) . Moreover, the unemployment rate is falling, the real wage growth is
increasing, and credit growth to the private sector remains buoyant.
On the other hand, a number of factors are mitigating these concerns. The pick-up of
inflation is largely driven by supply side factors and temporary effects linked to the EU
accession, including a rise in administered prices, tax adjustments, surge in world oil prices,

-2adjustment of food prices and price speculations in the run-up to the EU accession. In
addition, the decentralized wage-setting mechanism is likely to bring wage growth in line
with or below productivity growth, and a stable lats/euro exchange rate will reduce external
price impulses. Moreover, the unemployment rate remains at a high level. The weakening of
the trade balance – the main factor behind the current account deficit – is still largely a result
of strong investment growth. Capital and intermediate goods constitute about two-thirds of
total merchandise imports. Export competitiveness remains strong, which is reflected in a
growing foreign market penetration and increasing export profit margins. The banking sector
remains healthy and well capitalized to sustain the ongoing high lending growth. The growth
in real estate prices has slowed down and is currently broadly in line with the income growth
(which is not substantially higher than the growth in consumer prices).
While our authorities share staff’s concerns about the potential risks of overheating, they
consider the development of major economic indicators as mixed and that the risks of
overheating are relatively limited. They will, however, monitor developments closely, and
take the appropriate measures if clear signs of overheating are emerging. Overall, our
authorities’ plans to enter ERM2 in January 2005, and to introduce the euro in January 2008,
should ensure continued consistency and credibility of the authorities’ macroeconomic and
structural policies.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are fully aware that fiscal policy will have to play a key role in ensuring that
domestic demand does not add to inflationary pressures and lead to a deterioration in external
balances. Over the past years, Latvia has achieved good performance in fiscal consolidation,
reducing the 2003 general government budget deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP. This was a
strengthening of 0.8 percentage points from the previous year and the lowest deficit during
the last five years. Major improvements from the previous year were recorded in social
security (showed a surplus) and local government budgets. In general, the budgetary
outcome in 2003 was determined by both lower expenditures and higher tax revenues than
expected. The strong revenue performance was largely attributed to the robust economic
activity and the implementation of a number of tax administration measures. At the same
time, strict expenditure controls combined with restraints on advance payments at the end of
2003 helped restrain budget expenditures.
For 2004, the Parliament adopted a budget with a 2.2 percent deficit of GDP. The authorities
expect that the actual deficit in 2004 will be lower than budgeted. So far in 2004, revenues
have been higher than projected, making room for channeling additional revenues to reduce
the budget deficit. However, future revenue performance is somewhat uncertain due to
procedural changes associated with the EU accession. Moreover, additional expenditures (the
second biannual pension adjustment in line with the new inflation indexation procedure, and
compensation increase for school teachers) scheduled for budget amendments this fall will
reduce the net budget impact.
The authorities agree with staff's recommendations to move towards a medium-term
budgetary framework. However, they acknowledge the potential problems to achieve

-3substantial progress during the next few years due to the significant budget expenditures that
will come from payments related to the NATO and the EU as well as required social reforms.
In the next few years, these additional expenditures will restrict the government's capacity to
decrease the budget deficit. Given the delicate balance between future expenditure
commitments and securing a sustainable macroeconomic performance, the authorities will in
the coming years aim at a budget deficit of about 2 percent of GDP. However, the long-term
aim of the government's medium term budgetary framework is a gradual reduction of the
budget deficit towards a balanced budget.
Monetary-Financial Policies and the Run-Up to the ERM II and the Euro
The authorities are pleased to note the recognition by staff of the credibility of the ERM II
entry and the euro adoption strategy. The authorities aim at repegging the lats from the SDR
to the euro and a subsequent entry in the ERM II at the beginning of 2005, in accordance
with multilateral procedures and within the adopted framework. The adoption of the euro is
tentatively scheduled for the beginning of 2008 and is dependent upon a successful
convergence assessment and sufficient time to handle the necessary technical matters to
guarantee a smooth entry into the EMU.
In order to reduce the macroeconomic risks associated with the rapid increase of private
consumption, the Bank of Latvia (BoL) has tightened its policies in 2004 by raising its
refinancing rate from 3.0 to 3.5 percent in March and the reserve requirements from 3 to 4
percent in July. In addition, the BoL has reduced the banking system liquidity by placing the
bulk of government deposits in the central bank.
As stated in the staff report, the Latvian banking sector is healthy: banks remain well
capitalized, profitable, with good credit quality and well-established modern risk
management systems and techniques. Stress test results reveal that the banking system is
likely to be resilient to major sources of vulnerability. Financial soundness indicators are
positive and bank credit to the private sector relative to GDP remains low, or less than half of
the average in the Euro area countries. However, notwithstanding the current low level of
credit to the private sector, the rapid lending growth carries with it the risks of deteriorating
credit quality in the future. The authorities will therefore closely monitor the situation.
Recently, the Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) has sent a letter to the
banks to increase the banks' awareness of potential effects of the strong household lending
expansion on borrowers' financial position and banks' asset quality. Moreover, the banks
have been advised to pay special attention to the expected interest rate hikes during the
second half of the year, and encouraged to warn their clients of potential exchange rate and
interest rate risks. Likewise, the FCMC plans to tighten the guidelines for mortgage lending
and ensure better monitoring of banks' loan portfolio quality. In June 2003, the Register of
Debtors was introduced under the management of the BoL. It contains information on
borrowers with late payments and serves as an additional tool to evaluate the
creditworthiness of borrowers.
The authorities agree that Latvia's accession to the EU may result in increased capital inflows
and intensify the credit growth. Against this backdrop, the possibilities for using a

-4combination of monetary and prudential instruments are being explored to limit the risks of
overheating. However, the authorities recognize that the mentioned measures may be
insufficient and, therefore, the stance of fiscal policy remains of paramount importance.
Structural Reforms
The staff paper outlines several areas of structural reforms where progress needs to be
accelerated, including the process of restructuring and privatizing the remaining public
concerns, and fight against corruption and money laundering. The authorities affirm that
necessary legal procedures are being elaborated to enable the shift from a mass to a case-bycase privatization with the objective to sell the assets that are not associated with the direct
performance of state functions. The creation of a market system in the electricity sector is a
priority of the government, and the opening of a Latvian electricity market is gradually
taking place.
The fight against corruption is one of the key priorities of the authorities and the work on
enforcement and prevention will continue. The recent AML/CFT law amendments came into
force in February 2004, and they include more detailed specific requirements for customer
identification, explaining the responsibilities of different supervisory authorities. The
financial sector is steadily improving its internal control system of the AML/CFT regime and
applying the best international practice of AML/CFT to everyday activities. However, our
authorities are somewhat concerned by some of the staff’s comments on Latvia’s AML/CFT
performance. Latvia has traditionally had a relatively competitive financial sector with a high
share of non-resident deposits. It is, however, no reason to believe that these deposits are of a
more dubious origin than similar deposits in other European countries with a high share of
non-resident deposits.
