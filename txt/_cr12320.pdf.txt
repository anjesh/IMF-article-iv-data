STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
THIRD POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context: Mongolia has made impressive progress in developing its economy over the past
ten years. Medium-term prospects are promising as mining output is projected to expand by
more than 20 percent per annum, on average, over the next five years. However, the
prospects for sustained, rapid and inclusive non-mineral growth depend on the
implementation of the stability-oriented fiscal framework that has been adopted in the
aftermath of the 2008/09 balance of payments (BOP) crisis. This framework was designed to
dampen volatility, mitigate risks to economic and financial stability, and strengthen long-term
natural resource management. The expansionary fiscal policy of the past year is causing
double-digit inflation and BOP pressures. Public spending needs to be reined in, in order not
to risk undermining stability and growth prospects, and in view of Mongolia’s vulnerability to
a downturn in commodities exports.
Focus: The discussions centered on the following:








Fiscal policy: Expenditure restraint is critical to address overheating pressures. Unrealistic
revenue projections in the 2012 Supplementary Budget and the draft 2013 Budget
incorrectly suggest that there is ample room to expand spending while still observing the
Fiscal Stability Law’s (FSL) 2-percent-of-GDP structural deficit ceiling.
Fiscal policy framework: Off-budget spending by the Development Bank of Mongolia
(DBM) on public investment projects should be taken into account when determining the
macro-economically sustainable level of government spending.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Inflation is considerably in excess of the Bank of
Mongolia (BOM)’s stated target, notwithstanding the tightening of monetary policy
effected over the past year. There is no room for monetary loosening at this stage and
future policy should be contingent on inflationary pressures abating and prudent fiscal
policy. The floating exchange rate regime should be maintained and intervention be
limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility.
Financial sector stability: Efforts to strengthen the soundness and resilience of the
financial sector should continue, building on the recommendations of the 2010/2011
FSAP. Development of a government bond market is a priority.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Introduction
1.
Mongolia has made impressive progress in developing its economy. Spearheaded by
the foreign direct investment (FDI)-financed development of the mining sector, growth averaged 8
percent per annum over the past 10 years, among the highest in the region. As a result, per capita
GDP increased five-fold, to about US$3,000, and Mongolia gained market access and has become
eligible for non-concessional borrowing from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
2.
But there is scope to improve the track record on poverty reduction and
macrostability. Inflation has been higher and more volatile than in regional peers. Despite strong
growth and a substantial decline in poverty in 2011, about 30 percent of the population still lives in
poverty, unemployment remains high, and inequality is rising (Figure 4).
3.
An 18-months Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was completed in October 2010. The
program, which was supported by a SBA with access of 300 percent of quota (SDR 153.3 million),
aimed to smooth adjustment to the large terms of trade shock triggered by the onset of the global
financial crisis, restore health to the country’s fiscal finances, allow for exchange rate flexibility in line
with market conditions, address weaknesses in the banking system, and protect the most vulnerable
from the burden of the needed adjustment. In addition, the program outlined a macroeconomic
framework to provide the basis for the authorities to approach the broader international community
for financial support.
4.
Since the end of the program, fiscal discipline has steadily eroded, jeopardizing the
stability gains. Government spending has been ramped up—similar to what was observed in the
two years leading up to the SBA—contravening recommendations in the 2011 Article IV consultation
and the authorities’ own efforts to put in place a new fiscal framework. In line with staff advice, this
framework was designed to address the key challenge of medium-term natural resource
management, anchored by the 2010 Fiscal Stability Law (FSL), the 2011 Integrated Budget Law (IBL),
and the 2012 Social Welfare Law (SWL).1 The direction of the authorities’ other macroeconomic
policies during the past year has been broadly in line with staff advice. Monetary policy has been
tightened markedly and the authorities have continued to operate a flexible exchange rate regime,
albeit with intermittent interventions to limit the togrog’s depreciation.

1

The design of Mongolia’s new fiscal framework is discussed in more detail in Chapter III. D. of the recent Board
Paper, Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries, Background Paper I (www.imf.org).
The chapter highlights that Mongolia’s fiscal policy framework is supported by a stabilization fund for mineral
revenue which is envisaged to function as a savings account to build wealth for future generations. The chapter
concludes that the Mongolian fiscal policy framework anchored by the Fiscal Stability Law constitutes a relevant
example for other lower-income countries with large revenue from nonrenewable resources.

5.
The June Parliamentary elections led to a change in government. The elections were
won by the Democratic Party which had been a minority in the previous coalition government with
the Mongolia People’s Party until it broke away in January to focus on its campaign. The Democratic
Party has formed a coalition government with three smaller parties. Local and presidential elections
will be held in November 2012 and June 2013, respectively. A new Bank of Mongolia (BOM)
governor was appointed in mid-September.

B. Overheating Pressures Continue amid Decelerating Growth
6.
Growth is decelerating from the very rapid pace in 2011. The expansion of the economy
slowed to 10 percent during the first nine months of 2012 (y/y), down from 17 percent in 2011.
Growth has been buoyed by expanding coal and copper production, the ongoing development of
new large mining projects, a relatively mild winter boosting agriculture, and highly expansionary
fiscal policy (Table 1, Figure 1).
7.
However, inflation remains high and the BOP is under pressure. Inflation in other Asian
countries has decelerated owing to slowing demand and moderating energy and food prices. By
contrast, inflation in Mongolia is still around 15 percent, primarily due to rapidly rising government
spending. Strong domestic demand is driving up imports of consumption goods, and the resulting
BOP pressures are compounded by slowing FDI inflows and decelerating export growth. In recent
months, coal exports to China slumped amid China’s overall decelerating imports.
8.
Monetary policy has been tightened. Over the past year, in response to inflation rising
substantially above the official target of less than 10 percent, the central bank increased its policy
rate—by 225 basis points, to 13.25 percent—and reserve requirements—by 700 basis points, to 12
percent. These tightening measures, which coincided with a deceleration of deposit inflows into the
banking system, contributed to a marked slowdown in credit growth, from 72 percent in 2011 to 36
percent in September 2012 (year-on-year, Figure 2).
9.

But fiscal policy has remained excessively expansionary.



The overall fiscal balance worsened by 5⅓ percentage points of GDP in 2011, to a deficit
of 4¾ percent of GDP (Table 2). Revenue surged, thanks to VAT and customs duties collected
on imports of capital goods for mining sector development. But this was more than offset by a
62 percent increase in government spending.



Government spending continued to soar during the first half of 2012. In the six months
leading up to the end-June elections, government spending rose by 57 percent (year-on-year)
as civil servants’ wages were raised by more than 50 percent, cash handouts were stepped up,
and capital expenditures were brought forward. As revenue collection fell short of the ambitious
targets, a large domestic financing need arose which was met in part by borrowing about
1½ percent of GDP from the BOM.

10.
BOP pressures have mostly been reflected in a decline in Mongolia’s Net International
Reserves (NIR). The BOM has intervened intermittently to limit the togrog’s depreciation. Over the
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

past year, the togrog/U.S. dollar exchange rate has depreciated by 7 percent while NIR have
declined by a third (US$0.7 billion) to a two-year low of US$1.5 billion. The effect of the BOP
pressures on gross international reserves (GIR) has been offset by BOM drawings on the swap line
with the central bank of China (US$0.2 billion) and BOM deposit taking from the Development Bank
of Mongolia (US$0.4 billion) and commercial banks (US$0.2 billion). Thus, while gross international
reserves remains near an all-time high of US$2.6 billion (6.7 months of prospective non-mining
imports), the share of borrowed reserves has risen to 43 percent, from 15 percent a year ago.

C. Outlook and Risks
11.

The near-term outlook for growth is favorable, but inflation is projected to remain
elevated:



Notwithstanding a deceleration from last year, growth is projected to remain in double
digits in 2012. Rising coal production is expected to boost mineral GDP by 6.8 percent.
Non-mineral GDP growth is projected at 12.8 percent, thanks to the ongoing development of
the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper mine and Tavan Tolgoi (TT) coal mine (Box 1), alongside
expansionary fiscal policy.



Growth is projected to accelerate in 2013. Mining GDP is set to increase by over half as the
massive Oyu Tolgoi copper mining project starts to produce and coal production from the Tavan
Tolgoi mine expands further. Non-mining GDP growth is projected at 5½ percent in 2013,
supported by government and DBM capital spending.



Inflation is projected to remain in double digits throughout 2013. Meat prices, which have a
large weight in Mongolia’s CPI basket, are projected to moderate in the coming months.
However, the continued strong growth of domestic demand is expected to prevent a rapid
decline in inflation (Box 2).

12.
The external position is projected to remain under pressure in 2013. Mongolia’s coal
export capacity will expand further in 2013, and the start of operations at the Oyu Tolgoi mine
should boost copper exports. However, imports will also rise, owing to the DBM’s public investment
projects, and the net BOP effect of the start of Oyu Tolgoi operations will be limited in 2013 as the
gross export proceeds will mostly be used for repayment of investment costs.
13.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects are promising. The ramp-up of coal and copper
production is projected to keep the growth of mineral GDP at over 20 percent per annum, on
average, during 2013–17. Activity outside the mining sector is also projected to remain buoyant,
although this would need to be supported by continued reforms to strengthen the business climate.
14.
However, a number of challenges need to be addressed as the new government
embarks on implementing its Action Plan for 2012–16. Importantly, policies need to be set
against the continued uncertainties in the global economic outlook. While growth in China appears
to have bottomed out, the near-term outlook for global growth offers only a very gradual pickup in
activity amid considerable downside risks, in particular with regard to euro-area developments.

Projection

Export earnings and fiscal revenue will rise considerably thanks to exports from these
mines. Staff projects that export proceeds from these mines could total US$2 billion in 2013,
rising to US$7 billion by 2020. Fiscal revenue is projected to grow in tandem, though with some
delay, as much of the initial export proceeds from the Oyu Tolgoi mine will be used to repay
advance tax payments and a loan used to finance the government’s equity stake. However, by
2018 fiscal mineral revenue is projected to quintuple compared with 2011, and U.S. dollar GDP per
capita could triple.

Box 2. Inflation Dynamics in Mongolia 1/
Inflation in Mongolia is more volatile but less persistent than in other copper-producing countries.
The higher volatility may be related to food price volatility and procyclicality in government
spending. The relatively low persistence of inflation suggests that a tightening of macroeconomic
policies may translate quickly in a deceleration of inflation.


Food price volatility is a key driver of inflation volatility. Supply shocks to agriculture, such
as the severe winter in 2010–11, can have an important effect on overall inflation. Food
items represent about 30 percent of the CPI basket.



Underlying inflation, which excludes food
prices and administered prices, is more
responsive to domestic demand
conditions. For instance, there is clear
evidence that government wage hikes
push up underlying inflation. In addition
to the direct impact from the increase in
government employees’ income, there is
an indirect effect through higher private
sector wage demands. Empirical evidence
also confirms the role of the output gap,
in line with a Phillips-curve relationship.

Potential spillovers are significant, affecting export volumes, commodity prices, and FDI inflows. A
significant fall in non-oil commodity prices and volumes would have an important impact on the
fiscal and external accounts (see the Risk Assessment Matrix). Other key risks refer to a continuation
of the overly loose fiscal policy and the possibility of renewed problems in the banking sector, for
instance triggered by declining real estate prices.
15.
Against this background, it is important to adopt policies that ensure macroeconomic
and financial stability and that harness the country’s long-term growth potential. In particular:


The laws that have been enacted in recent years to strengthen the fiscal policy framework—
Fiscal Stability Law, Integrated Budget Law, and Social Welfare Law—now need to be
implemented to ensure that Mongolia’s resource wealth sustains the pace of economic
development, and that this results in a generalized improvement in living standards and
reduction in poverty.



Achievement of the government’s economic objectives will require: (i) an improvement in the
efficiency of public investment, to ensure that Mongolia can fund its critical economic and social
investments within the existing resource constraints; and (ii) the continued implementation of
structural reforms aimed at improving the business climate and private sector productivity (see
paragraph 47).

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the economic outlook.
However, they noted that the recently adopted Government Action Plan 2012–16 (see paragraph 50)
aims to reduce inflation to single digits and contain the budget deficit to 2 percent of GDP. They
were confident that a seasonal decline in meat prices would bring inflation to single digits going
into next year. The authorities emphasized the need to increase investment in infrastructure. They
viewed this as essential to facilitate exports, reduce the economy’s reliance on the mining sector,
and ease supply-side inflationary pressures, by improving the connections of traders and farmers to
markets.
17.
The authorities also expressed concern about the elevated downside risks. In view of
the uncertain outlook for exports, a working group has recently been established to initiate
contingency planning. The group includes senior officials from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the
Ministry of Economic Development (MOED), and the BOM.

MACROECONOMIC POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
While the economy’s prospects are promising as mining output is set to expand
considerably over the next five years, macroeconomic policies need to be strengthened to
mitigate risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. Against this background, discussions
centered on: (i) the need to tighten fiscal policy in the near-term to address pressures on the
external position and put inflation on a sustained downward trajectory; and (ii) the agenda to

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

upgrade the broader framework for managing macroeconomic policies, the financial system, and
long-term natural resource management.

A.

Fiscal Policy

19.
On current policies, including spending by the DBM, the overall fiscal deficit in 2012
could exceed 9 percent of GDP, up from 4¾ percent of GDP in 2011:


The general government budget is projected to record a deficit of more than 5 percent of GDP.
Steps announced in the context of the Supplementary 2012 Budget, including hikes in excises on
diesel, alcohol and tobacco effected in September and a scaling down of capital spending, will
not be enough to offset shortfalls in VAT and customs duties which were due to the 2012
Budget’s extrapolation of favorable revenue trends in 2010 and 2011, which overlooked the
deceleration in FDI-financed imports of capital goods in 2012.



Off-budget spending by the DBM will add to demand pressures. The international bond
issuance earlier in the year has put the bank in a position to spend up to 6 percent of GDP.
Some two-thirds of this amount (US$400 million) is expected to be spent by end-2012, including
on roads construction in Ulaanbaatar and other cities (US$150 million), railways construction
(US$100 million), utility projects (heating, and power and water supplies, US$50 million), urban
housing (US$60 million), and industrialization (US$30 million).

20.
Unrealistic revenue projections in the 2013 budget and off-budget DBM operations
risk undermining stability and growth prospects (Box 3). The 2013 budget sent to Parliament
targets a general government deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2013. This is consistent with the FSL’s
structural deficit ceiling of 2 percent of GDP. However, revenues are overestimated by as much as
6¾ percent of GDP. In addition, considerable capital spending will be channeled through the DBM.
This spending is not included in the budget. It is also not covered by the FSL’s limits on the
structural deficit or expenditure growth.
21.
Revenue shortfalls will likely force the authorities to compress on-budget spending
but off-budget DBM spending could still cause the overheating pressures to persist. In the
staff’s baseline projections, revenue shortfalls and limited availability of domestic financing would in
the end restrict the growth of on-budget spending to 13 percent in 2013. As a result, the FSL’s
structural deficit ceiling would be breached by about 1 percent of GDP. Moreover, overheating
pressures could still persist depending on the magnitude of off-budget foreign financed capital
spending by the DBM, which is currently projected at 4 percent of GDP. In any case, the integrity and
meaningfulness of the FSL would be undermined.

The 2012 and 2013 budgets include overly optimistic revenue projections:




The Supplementary 2012 budget was approved in mid-September. It did not take into account the
full extent of the ongoing deceleration of revenue growth. The collection of VAT and customs duties
has been particularly weak, in part owing to base effects related to the deceleration of capital goods
imports for the OT mining project.
The draft 2013 budget was sent to Parliament at end-September. While the budget is based on

1/ IMF staff projections.

Overly optimistic revenue projections give the incorrect impression that there is ample room to
expand government spending, while still observing the FSL with its 2-percent-of-GDP structural deficit
ceiling (see text chart).
The staff’s baseline projections assume that the bulk of the expected revenue shortfalls will be offset
by compressing expenditure compared to the budget, particularly in 2013. This is consistent with the
government’s intentions (see paragraph 29). The government is looking to borrow from the social security
fund through the sale of treasury bonds in the last quarter of 2012 and the modalities for the issuance of
treasury bonds in the open market are being finalized. However, financing from domestic treasury bonds will
likely prove very expensive, making it likely that the government will instead opt for spending cuts.
Nevertheless, the overall fiscal stance in 2013 could still be more expansionary than in recent years,
depending on the magnitude of off-budget foreign financed capital spending by the DBM, which is currently
projected at 4 percent of GDP.

22.
Recently announced plans for DBM borrowing of up to US$5 billion (50 percent of
GDP) over the next few years also raise efficiency concerns. A recent World Bank report notes
three key concerns. First, capacity constraints in the construction sector raise doubts about the
extent to which the government’s ambitious infrastructure plans can be realized without
compromising project quality, appraisal and implementation. Second, because of supply
bottlenecks, the price of building materials (e.g., cement) has been rising rapidly. Third, considering
the size of the population and the contribution to economic growth, the capital and other growth
centers have been receiving a disproportionately low share of infrastructure spending.
23.
A clear policy needs to be drawn up to ensure that the DBM can help meet the
long-term infrastructure needs of Mongolia in a macro-economically sustainable manner. It is
imperative that the government clarify that: (i) there are limits on the aggregate lending of the DBM
to ensure alignment with the principles of the FSL, in particular the expenditure growth limit; (ii) the
DBM only funds revenue-generating projects; or (iii) if it were to fund social benefit projects, the
amount of lending for such projects would be reflected in the state budget and thus be fully
covered by the FSL. Experience in other countries shows that without a clear policy there is a risk
that the DBM will be used as a non-transparent way to finance non-priority or non-viable
infrastructure projects, or to bypass fiscal limits, which ultimately requires costly budget-funded
bailouts.
24.
Also, the Law on the DBM should be amended to bring it in line with international best
practice. Accordingly, the law should clarify that the DBM can only finance viable projects that
would generate revenue and achieve cost recovery. The independence and supervision of the DBM
and its Board members should be strengthened and the MOF should have a more prominent role in
the Board of the DBM. Finally, the DBM’s authority to lend should be constricted by lowering the
maximum loan-to-equity ratio to what is common internationally among the better performing
development banks.
25.
In view of the uncertain external outlook there may be a need for additional measures
to safeguard macroeconomic stability over the coming year. Contingency planning could be
facilitated by the preparation of a prioritized list of all capital expenditure items in the 2013 budget.
The initiation and funding of lower-priority items could be deferred until later in the year, provided
revenues are on track and external pressures have eased. The uncertain outlook makes it all the
more important to strengthen policy coordination between the MOF and the newly created MOED.
26.
Implementation of the SWL should be a priority. The SWL, which was adopted earlier this
year, represents a significant step forward in efficiently fighting poverty. It introduces a meanstested benefit that would reach the poorest households and replace the existing costly universal
cash transfers. Multilateral donors have provided considerable support to help set up the meanstested benefit system. The government should now move forward and roll out this system.
27.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that Mongolia’s risk of debt distress
remains low. To take into account the likely extent of external borrowing by the DBM, the staff’s
baseline macroeconomic projections assume the issuance of US$500 million in new governmentguaranteed international bonds each year for the next five years (Appendix I). Because of the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MONGOLIA

projected strong growth of the economy over this period the ratio of public and publicly guaranteed
external debt to GDP would decline by 2 percent of GDP to 24 percent of GDP in 2017. However, the
increased rate of debt accumulation would increase Mongolia’s vulnerability to shocks. To limit
vulnerability, recourse to non-concessional foreign financing should be limited to commercially
viable projects.
28.
The establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) would be an important
complement to the FSL’s fiscal policy framework. Staff welcomes the efforts underway to
determine the modalities of a SWF that would best fit Mongolia.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities indicated that they remained committed to the FSL while
acknowledging that revenue targets were ambitious. They noted that revenue shortfalls would
be largely offset by lower-than-budgeted spending, particularly capital spending. They advised that
government wages would not be raised in 2013 following the large increases in 2012. The
authorities concurred with the need to prioritize on-budget public investment projects. In this
regard, they noted that with the IBL now fully operational, the 2013 budget would only include
public investment projects for which feasibility studies have been completed and which are aligned
with national development priorities.
30.
The authorities confirmed that the main purpose of the DBM is to finance bankable
projects. However, the work to identify and develop efficient and bankable projects is mostly still
ongoing. In the meantime, the authorities would like to proceed with disbursements for projects
even if it is not assured that these will generate an adequate cash flow to service the debt. Over
time, DBM funding for non-bankable social benefit projects would decrease.
31.
The authorities agreed that the progress made in setting up a system to identify the
poorest household should not be lost. At the same time, they indicated that a review would be
undertaken of the existing multitude of social welfare programs as well as the Social Welfare Law
itself. Subsequently, the government publicly announced the reintroduction of universal child
allowances, effective October 20, 2012. The authorities noted that local governments would be
responsible for administering social programs from January 1, 2013, using central government
funding.

B.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

32.
While monetary policy has been tightened, inflation remains high and the future
course of monetary policy should be set depending on how inflation and fiscal policy evolve.
Inflation remains considerably in excess of the BOM’s stated target for 2012 (“inflation in single
digits”). Monetary policy has been tightened substantially over the past year, togrog liquidity
remains tight, in part owing to ongoing sales of foreign exchange, and meat prices are expected to
ease in the coming months. Going forward, there is no scope to loosen monetary policy unless fiscal
policy adjusts to conform with the FSL and inflationary pressures abate. Conversely, the monetary
authorities will have no choice but to tighten further in case fiscal policy remains expansionary.
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

33.
The BOM’s intention to move to an inflation targeting framework is appropriate
(Box 4). In conjunction with a floating exchange rate regime (see below), this would complement
and support the countercyclical fiscal policy implied by the FSL. The next steps to strengthen the
monetary policy framework would involve the development of the government bond market and an
interbank money market.
Box 4. Strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework1
The authorities’ intention to move to an inflation-targeting regime is appropriate. A cross-country
study of commodity-exporting countries in the April 2012 WEO concluded that an inflation-targeting regime
with a flexible exchange rate renders a countercyclical fiscal policy such as implied by Mongolia’s FSL more
effective. In such a framework, countercyclical fiscal policy would aim to dampen macroeconomic volatility
arising from commodity price fluctuations and monetary policy would aim to reduce inflation volatility.
Good progress has been made to facilitate the adoption of inflation targeting:
 The BOM communicates to the public through its annual Monetary Policy Guideline that the aim of
monetary policy is to achieve low and stable inflation. The 2012 Guideline states that inflation will
be kept at a single-digit level in 2012 and below 8 percent in 2013–14. Since 2007, the BOM targets
the policy rate of seven-day central bank bills (CBBs) which is set at monthly meetings of the
monetary policy board whose policy decisions are announced to the public. The BOM has been
making good use of IMF technical assistance to strengthen monetary policy operations. As a result,
the seven-day CBB rate increasingly converges around the announced policy rate, improving the
BOM’s credibility. And the CBB rates are affecting short-term money market rates.


A floating exchange rate regime was adopted in the context of the 2008/09 crisis to help absorb
external shocks and safeguard international reserves.



The FSL provides for a countercyclical fiscal policy. The recent adoption of the IBL and the SWL
should serve to reinforce the fiscal policy framework.

But important challenges remain:
 Government spending in 2012 is set to nearly double from the level in 2010, pushing inflation
above the BOM’s target. Much depends on whether the FSL will be effectively adhered to once it
becomes fully operational in 2013. For instance, non-revenue generating DBM operations should be
fit within the FSL framework (see paragraph 23).


The monetary transmission mechanism remains weak and unreliable, as in many other countries at
an early stage of financial development (see e.g., WP/10/223 and WP/12/143). Policies and reforms
conducive to financial deepening should remedy this over time, including the development of the
government bond market (paragraph 46). Meanwhile, macro-prudential policies could be used in
part to complement the weak transmission from policy rates to bank credit (paragraph 39).



Dollarization, which undermines monetary policy autonomy, remains significant and should be
actively discouraged (paragraphs 40–41).



The foreign exchange market remains thin and needs to be developed further (paragraph 42).
Appropriately tight macroeconomic policies and a deeper foreign exchange market would allow a
larger share of the balance of payments pressures to be absorbed through adjustment of the
exchange rate (paragraph 34).

The floating exchange rate regime and auction system should be maintained.
Intervention should be limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility without changing the
underlying trend in the exchange rate. In the staff’s view, a disproportionate share of the balance of
payments pressures over the past year has been absorbed through sales of official reserves. If
external pressures continue, this may not be sustainable. To support the external position and
exchange rate regime, it is critical to pursue appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, along the lines
recommended above, while efforts to deepen the foreign exchange market should continue.

International reserves are still adequate for precautionary purposes, even though they
are on a downward trajectory. Mongolia’s reserves are adequate for the near term and its
obligations to the IMF coming due in the next two years (about SDR 100 million in total or about 6

36.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals (Box 5).
However, the exchange rate assessment critically depends on FSL implementation. Mongolia’s
recent experience shows that looser fiscal policy would quickly lead to considerable overvaluation.
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities shared the staff’s views regarding monetary policy and reaffirmed
their commitment to the floating exchange rate regime. They noted that Mongolia’s foreign
exchange market remains shallow and that smoothing operations, around the prevailing trend, are
regularly required to prevent lumpy transactions from causing jumps in the exchange rate and
disorderly market conditions. The authorities expressed broad satisfaction with the level of gross
and net international reserves. They expected the DBM and a commercial bank, which recently
raised funds abroad, to sell some of their foreign exchange to the BOM, which would raise the net
international reserves (NIR).

C.

Financial Sector Issues

38.
The BOM has continued to take steps to improve banks’ resilience, amid tightening
liquidity (Table 7, Figure 3). The liquidity ratio was raised from 18 to 25 percent, effective January
1, 2012. The five systemically important banks were required to raise their capital adequacy ratios to
14 percent from 12 percent (to be phased in by end-2013).

Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment1
Mongolia’s real exchange rate appreciation has outpaced that of its peers, but exports have risen
considerably faster than on average in Asia. Thanks to rising copper and coal prices and coal export volumes,
exports nearly quadrupled from the early 2009 trough. The outlook for exports is favorable (see Box 1).

Current Account Balance

An updated CGER-like assessment suggests that the
level of the real effective exchange rate (REER) is not
out of line with medium-term macroeconomic
fundamentals. Over the medium term, the CA is
projected to be broadly in line with the CA norm implied
by the Macroeconomic Balance approach. The
Equilibrium Exchange Rate approach indicates that the
level of the REER is also broadly in line with longer-term
2
fundamentals.

Current account (CA) outlook. The CA balance is
projected to swing back to a surplus over the
medium-term. Imports of capital goods for the
development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine pushed the CA in
deficit, especially in 2011 and 2012. As the mine starts
operations, copper and gold exports are projected to
turn the CA around. The development of the Tavan
Tolgoi mine will produce similar CA dynamics, with the
magnitude of the improvement also depending on future
mineral prices.

Application of the external sustainability approach, which compares the projected CA balance with the CA balance needed to
stabilize Mongolia’s International Investment Position (IIP), does not appear to be meaningful at this juncture. As a result of large
FDI-financed investments in the mining sector, Mongolia’s IIP is currently highly negative and it seems unlikely that Mongolia
would be looking to stabilize its IIP at the current level.

39.
Efforts to strengthen the soundness of the financial sector should continue. IMF
technical assistance advice has put forward options to better reflect banks’ credit risk in their pricing
and credit decisions. Accordingly, the BOM should consider the gradual introduction of dynamic
provisioning by phasing in provisioning for standard assets.
40.
Lending dollarization represents a continuing risk. The use of the togrog in domestic
transactions is now firmly entrenched. However, more than one-third of bank loans and bank
deposits are still denominated in U.S. dollars. Currency mismatches resulting from borrowers in U.S.
dollars without U.S. dollar income increase the risk of default in case of a depreciation of the togrog
vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar.
41.
Consideration should be given to prohibit foreign currency lending to unhedged
borrowers. This is consistent with an earlier FSAP recommendation and would help reduce banks’
vulnerability to exchange rate fluctuations. This could be phased in gradually with assets and
liabilities currently on banks’ balance sheets initially grandfathered. In any case, the authorities
should start to collect comprehensive data on foreign currency lending.
42.
A prohibition of foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers would also
contribute to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism and develop the foreign
exchange market. If enforced consistently across all banks, a larger share of new loans would be
denominated in domestic currency. Given the existing limits on banks’ Net Open Foreign Currency
Position, this would also encourage banks to compete more for domestic currency deposits. In turn,
this would help deepen the foreign exchange market as banks would reduce interest rates on U.S.
dollar deposits and would instead offer to buy the U.S. dollars from their depositors and sell them in
the foreign exchange market. It would also strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism as
increased competition among banks to provide loans and mobilize deposits in domestic currency
would lead to narrower togrog interest rate spreads and would make interest rates more sensitive to
changes in policy interest rates.
43.
Three years after the crisis, it is time to replace the blanket deposit guarantee scheme
by a limited deposit insurance scheme. Technical work on the legal and institutional
underpinnings for such a limited scheme should be completed as a matter of priority. Meanwhile, as
the expiration date for the existing scheme (November 2012) draws near, transitional arrangements
should be communicated soonest to reduce uncertainty.
44.
The anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework needs to be strengthened further. Mongolia has taken steps toward an effective
AML/CFT framework by enacting the AML law and establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) in
the BOM. However, the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has only been
partially implemented and key deficiencies remain. These deficiencies should be addressed as a
matter of priority, including by properly criminalizing money laundering and terrorism financing,
improving suspicious transaction reporting requirements, and putting in place effective confiscation
and freezing measures. In this context, an October 2012 IMF technical assistance mission supported
the authorities’ efforts to enhance preventive measures, and to strengthen AML/CFT supervision.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

Authorities’ views
45.
The authorities first plan to take stock of the impact of changes in banking regulations
effected over the past year. While expressing broad agreement with the staff’s recommendations
at a conceptual level, they indicated that present conditions were not suitable to make major
regulatory changes. The government was in the process of establishing its near-and medium-term
policy priorities, taking into account the uncertain external outlook. Moreover, the BOM considered
that banks and their customers had learned to manage prevailing risks in a broadly satisfactory
manner.
46.
Developing the government bond market was seen as a key priority. It would help
establish a yield curve which was viewed as a necessary condition to establish reasonably priced
hedging instruments. The BOM noted that it would not consider constricting foreign exchange
lending until such hedging instruments are available. The authorities also noted that pushing back
deposit dollarization could encourage capital flight which Mongolia could ill afford.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND STATISTICS
47.
Efforts to improve the business climate and trade integration should be intensified.
Mongolia ranks relatively high in the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey. However, there is ample
scope to further streamline procedures and strengthen policy frameworks to boost private sectorled non-mineral growth. For instance, trading across borders, starting a business, and dealing with
construction permits remain cumbersome.
48.
The government’s ambitious plans to establish an industrial park to process mining
products should avoid risks to medium-term macroeconomic and external stability.
Accordingly, the plans should involve reputable private sector companies which mobilize their own
financing and bear a fair share of risk. The plans should be made consistent with Mongolia’s
absorptive and implementation capacity and they should not lead to an excessive accumulation of
external debt.
49.
The new government should quickly clarify the foreign investment regime. The efficient
development of Mongolia’s natural resources requires foreign financing and expertise. The
perceived uncertainty regarding the foreign investment regime, particularly with regard to the
mining sector, that has arisen in recent months and the debate about possible renegotiation of the
OT contract should be resolved as soon as possible.
50.
Efforts to strengthen macroeconomic statistics should continue. Technical assistance is
being provided to improve national accounts statistics. There is also scope to upgrade balance of
payments statistics.
Authorities’ views
51.
The authorities concurred with the need to enhance the economy’s productivity
through structural reforms. They noted that the recently adopted Government Action Plan 2012–
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MONGOLIA

16 seeks greater transparency in the issuance of new mining licenses and increased value added of
exports. The plan also aims to reduce the dependency on the mining sector and create a
competitive and diversified economy. The economic diversification policy is focused on several key
areas, including industrialization policy, and efforts to develop policies with regard to wool,
cashmere, raw leather, livestock, tourism, business services, and information technology.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
Mongolia continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Growth in 2011
and the first half of 2012 was buoyed by expanding coal and copper production, the ongoing
development of new large mining projects, a relatively mild winter boosting agriculture, and highly
expansionary fiscal policy. While poverty declined substantially in 2011, there is scope to make
growth more inclusive.
53.
However, inflation remains stubbornly high and the rapid expansion of domestic
demand is putting pressure on the BOP. Monetary policy was tightened over the past year but
fiscal policy has remained very expansionary. The resulting BOP pressures have been reflected in a
decline in the BOM’s NIR, even though the BOM’s gross international reserves (GIR) remain near a
record thanks to the BOM drawing on the swap line with the central bank of China and receiving
deposits in foreign currency from commercial banks and the DBM.
54.
The outlook for growth is favorable but domestic demand pressures, unless reined in,
risk undermining stability and growth prospects. Fiscal policy needs to be tightened in order to
put inflation on a downward path and address pressures on the external position. DBM-financed
public investment projects are not included in the budget and they should be taken into account
when setting the path of fiscal policy.
55.
The 2013 budget will be a critical tool to safeguard domestic and external stability and
uphold the credibility of the government’s efforts to observe the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL).
The FSL should be observed in the budget law as well as actual implementation of the budget. The
persistent revenue shortfalls in 2012 underscore the importance of basing the 2013 budget on
realistic revenue projections. However, the 2013 budget that was submitted to Parliament at endSeptember is again based on overly optimistic revenue projections, implying incorrectly that there is
ample room to expand government spending while still observing the FSL’s 2-percent-of-GDP
structural deficit ceiling. In view of the expected revenue shortfall, government spending will have to
be compressed to contain the deficit to honor the FSL and limit the government’s domestic
financing needs. In light of this, and in view of the uncertain external outlook, the initiation and
funding of lower-priority capital expenditures should be deferred.
56.
A clear policy needs to be drawn up to ensure that the DBM can help meet the
long-term infrastructure needs of Mongolia in a macro-economically sustainable manner. As it
stands, there is considerable risk that DBM operations will undermine the achievement of the goals
of the FSL. Large-scale off-budget financing of non-revenue generating public infrastructure
projects would exacerbate overheating pressures and undermine the integrity and meaningfulness
of the FSL. The DSA suggests that Mongolia’s risk of debt distress remains low.
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONGOLIA

57.
The reform of the fiscal policy framework should continue. Implementation of the SWL
should be a priority and the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund would be an important
complement to the FSL’s countercyclical fiscal policy framework.
58.
There is no room for monetary loosening, and the future course of monetary policy
should be set depending on how inflation and fiscal policy evolve. Monetary policy has been
tightened substantially over the past year and togrog liquidity remains tight. However, inflation
remains considerably in excess of the BOM’s stated target for 2012 (“inflation in single digits”).
Going forward, there is no scope to loosen monetary policy unless fiscal policy adjusts to conform
with the FSL and inflationary pressures abate. Conversely, the monetary authorities will have no
choice but to tighten further in case fiscal policy remains expansionary.
59.
The floating exchange rate regime and auction system should be maintained.
Interventions should be limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility without targeting a
particular exchange rate level. Net international reserves are on a downward trajectory that is not
sustainable, even though gross reserves are still near a record high and adequate for precautionary
purposes. The real exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals.
60.
Efforts to develop and strengthen the financial sector should continue. Consideration
should be given to the gradual introduction of dynamic provisioning, and foreign currency lending
to unhedged borrowers should be prohibited. In addition to reducing banking sector risks, this
would help deepen the foreign exchange market and strengthen the monetary transmission
channel. The latter would also benefit from the development of a government bond market which
would represent an important next step toward further financial deepening in Mongolia.
Deficiencies in the AML/CFT framework need to be addressed as a matter of priority.
61.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects are promising. Mineral GDP is projected to expand
rapidly during the next five years thanks to large mining projects coming on stream. Activity outside
the mining sector is also projected to remain buoyant, although this would need to be supported by
appropriate macroeconomic policies and continued reforms to strengthen the business climate, as
well as a clarification of the foreign investment regime. Efforts to strengthen macroeconomic
statistics should continue.
62.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Figure 2. Mongolia: Monetary Developments
Main Message: Credit has slowed in response to monetary policy tightening and slowing deposit growth.
Interest rates on 7-day central bank bills (CBBs) have been
raised. Yet the outstanding stock of CBBs has remained flat
since Q4 2011.

Therefore, CBBs are making a positive contribution to reserve
money growth from late-2011.

APPENDIX I. Mongolia: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood of Realization in the
Next Three Years
(high, medium, or low)

Expected Impact on Economy if
Risk is Realized
(high, medium, or low)

1. Overly expansionary fiscal
policy raising inflation and BOP
pressures
Overly optimistic revenue
projections imply that spending can
be expanded without breaching the
FSL’s deficit ceiling. DBM spending
circumvents the FSL.
2. Significant fall in non-oil
commodity prices
A global downturn could depress
commodity prices which would
have an important impact
(commodity exports account for
90 percent of exports and
30 percent of government revenue).

Medium to High
Fiscal policy has historically been
volatile and pro-cyclical.

High
Overly loose fiscal policy would raise
inflation, undermine
competitiveness, drag down
non-mining growth and have a
significant negative impact on the
poor.

Medium
The relatively strong growth
performance of China could cushion—
but not offset—the impact of a
renewed global recession.

High
The deterioration in the fiscal and
external accounts would have
far-reaching effects. Government
spending would have to be cut
sharply and mining FDI would slow.
The resulting recession would put
pressure on household and
corporate balance sheets,
undermining banking sector stability
through rapidly rising NPLs.

3. A worsening of global liquidity
and financing conditions

Medium
Continued stress in the euro zone is
being felt intermittently in
international funding markets.

Medium
Low external exposure of the
financial system limits the risk to
Mongolia’s economy. Still, global
financial volatility could cause delays
to major mining projects, negatively
impacting growth.

4. Financial stability risk
The surge in bank credit has
pushed up real estate prices,
increased leverage, and heightened
financial sector risk.

Medium to High
Lower growth or declining real estate
prices could raise NPLs and, as in the
past, create financial instability.

Medium to High
Renewed problems in the banking
sector would be costly to resolve
and would be a setback for growth.

5. Socio-economic and political
risks
Amid rising inequality, social
tensions could increase if inclusive
growth is not realized. Political
instability is an additional risk
factor.

Medium
The mining sector boom, exacerbated
by macroeconomic mismanagement,
could raise income inequality.
However, recent wage increases, and
the implementation of a targeted
social safety net could limit discontent.

Medium
The booming mining sector in
conjunction with pro-cyclical
macroeconomic policy could
exacerbate inequalities and impede
progress on economic diversification
and inclusive growth.

Safeguards Arrangements
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) finalized in June, 2009 found that
the BOM has continued to improve its safeguards framework since the previous assessment. The
BOM’s financial reporting and audit practices generally comply with international standards. The
assessment made recommendations to (i) strengthen certain aspects of the BOM’s oversight
mechanism, (ii) remove external audit qualifications caused by lack of access to central bank’s vaults,
and (iii) improve the timeliness of audit completion and publication of the bank’s financial
statements. The authorities have since confirmed that the auditors were granted access to its vaults
at end-2009 to end-2011, and the timing of audit completion has improved.
Exchange Arrangement
On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the determination of
the exchange rate mainly by market forces. The de facto and de jure exchange rate arrangements
are currently both classified as floating.
Mongolia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 1, 1996. Mongolia
maintains two multiple currency practices (MCPs) subject to Fund jurisdiction. First, the modalities of
the multi-price auction system give rise to an MCP since there is no mechanism in place that ensures
that exchange rates of accepted bids at the multi-price auction do not deviate by more than
2 percent. The Executive Board approved the multi-price auction MCP until June 22, 2010 (Decision
No. 14365 of June 23, 2009), and its further extension until March 15, 2012 or the next Article IV
consultation whichever is earlier (Decision No. 14669 of June 23, 2010 and Decision No. 14365 of
March 16, 2011). The MCP, however, could not be resolved by March 15, 2012, and would be
continued as long as the multiple price foreign exchange auction mechanism remains in place.
Therefore the MCP is unapproved, and since the criteria for approval of this MCP are not in place,
staff does not recommend Executive Board approval of said measure. In addition, Mongolia has an
official exchange rate (reference rate) that is mandatorily used for government transactions (as
opposed to the commercial market rate). Therefore, by way of official action, the authorities have
created a market segmentation. While Order #699 of the BOM issued on December 3, 2010, sets
forth that the reference rate is determined based on the weighted average of market rates used
from 4 PM of the previous day to 4 PM of the current day, staff is of the view that this Order does
not eliminate the market segmentation and the multiplicity of effective rates arising from it.
Accordingly, in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that the commercial rates and the reference
rate do not deviate by more than 2 percent, the way the reference rate is used in government
transaction gives rise to an MCP subject to Fund approval. Since the criteria for approval of this MCP
are not in place, it remains unapproved. Mongolia imposes exchange restrictions for security
reasons in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 92/757 concerning
certain transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) that have
been notified to the Fund under Decision 144 (11/4/94).

Article IV Consultation
The 2011 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 11/76) was concluded by the Executive
Board on March 16, 2011. Mongolia is on a 12–month cycle.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Bank and the Fund country teams maintain a close working relationship. The
teams, led by Ms. Chorching Goh (Lead Economist, EASPR) and Mr. Gerard Almekinders (Mission
Chief) collaborate on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
2.

Cooperation and coordination is exemplary. It pertains to the following:

•
Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) and post-program monitoring. The World Bank
participated in virtually all the negotiating missions’ meetings with the authorities. This facilitated
the discussions, especially as regards policies in areas of mutual interest such as bank restructuring,
social welfare reform, and fiscal policy. The teams have also jointly participated in media events.
After the completion of the SBA, Bank staff has continued to actively participate in post-program
monitoring missions.
•
Development Policy Credits (DPC) and Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In turn,
Fund staff participated in the design and review of the Bank’s DPCs and was kept informed about
the development of the Bank’s new CPS for FY13-17.
•
Banking system issues. Both country teams have been active in this area, including fielding
numerous technical assistance missions. The teams coordinate closely to provide the authorities with
consistent advice while avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts. The two teams also continue to
educate the public and parliamentarians on banking sector issues to build support for reforms.
•
Structural fiscal reforms. Fund staff and the World Bank team have worked together
successfully to provide technical assistance in expenditure management, the recently adopted fiscal
responsibility law, the integrated budget law, the social welfare law, and mineral sector taxation.
3.
Based on the intensive collaboration, the Bank and the Fund share a common view
about Mongolia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:
•
Promoting long-term growth. Managing the mineral wealth to ensure strong, sustainable,
and equitable growth with low inflation. This includes the importance of avoiding the “resource
curse” and minimizing “Dutch disease” effects.
•
Macro-economic stability. This includes ensuring that the boom-bust policies of the past
are not repeated. The recently adopted fiscal responsibility law is a key step, and it is critical that it
be strictly adhered to. At the same time, fiscal policy also has to be mindful of the macroeconomic
policy mix and not over-burden monetary policy.
•
Monetary policy. The central bank should continue to gear monetary policy to controlling
inflation. The flexible exchange rate regime is working well and should be maintained. Monetary and
exchange rate policy could be strengthened by giving the central bank more independence.
•
Protecting the poor. The imminent introduction of a targeted poverty benefit under the
recently adopted Social Welfare Law represents a big step forward in strengthening the social safety
net and increasing fiscal flexibility.

•
Strengthening the banking system. Key steps include continued improvement in bank
regulation and supervision, and eventual introduction of deposit insurance to replace the blanket
guarantee.
4.
The teams agreed to continue the close cooperation going forward. Table 1 details the
specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period September 2012 – August 2013
along with their expected deliveries. It was also agreed that further details on collaboration, as
necessary, would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

MONGOLIA

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

1

Mongolia became a member of the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in February 1991. AsDB has
been Mongolia’s largest source of official development assistance, playing a key role in the country’s
transformation to a market based economy. Going forward, AsDB’s assistance will be scaled-up to
meet urgent and large-scale financing needs, particularly in infrastructure, and will support
innovative financing mechanisms including public-private partnerships.
Between 1991 and 2011, Mongolia received loans from AsDB for 46 projects totaling $825.17 million
in agriculture and natural resources, education, energy, financial, health and social protection,
industry and trade, public sector management, transport, information and communication
technology, water, other municipal infrastructure and services sectors. In addition, 12 Asian
Development Fund (ADF) grant projects totaling $172.2 million were approved from 2007, when
Mongolia became eligible for ADF grant financing. Including other trust fund sources, Mongolia
received 33 grants amounting to $210.7 million. Current assistance to Mongolia is guided by the
Country Operations Business Plan for 2012-14.
With enhanced creditworthiness and significant progress in economic development, Mongolia was
reclassified as a Group B country in August 2011, making it eligible for funding from AsDB’s ordinary
capital resources, while maintaining access to concessional financing from the ADF.
The Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy 2012-16 was approved by AsDB management in March
2012. During this period, assistance will focus on transport, energy, and water; education and health
services; and regional economic cooperation.
Subject to regional ADF allocation and country performance-based allocation, a total indicative
sovereign lending program of $138.0 million for 2013–2014 is envisaged, of which $75.0 million
would be provided from ADF country allocation, $63.0 million provided from OCR financing, and
some $30.0 million is envisaged to be financed through AsDB’s ADF regional program of assistance.
An average of $4.7 million in TA resources is to be provided annually. Private sector operations are
expected to play a growing financial and catalytic role as progress is made in fostering PPPs. Larger
interventions, especially in power, heating, and other municipal infrastructure, will improve service
delivery and create opportunities for private sector participation
AsDB’s operations will concentrate on the following sectors in next 5 years:
Transport. Under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program, Mongolia is
harmonizing cross-border transport procedures, and developing key economic corridors, including

the Western Regional Road Corridor, which will link the relatively isolated western region to its
neighboring economies. AsDB is also developing a public transport system for Ulaanbaatar, and will
construct logistics infrastructure and systems—initially in Zamyn Uud at the People’s Republic of
China border and thereafter in Ulaanbaatar.
Energy. Insufficient and unreliable power and heating are becoming bottlenecks to growth and
threaten livelihoods. AsDB is improving energy efficiency and capacity in Ulaanbaatar, through the
country’s first major public–private partnership in constructing a new energy efficient combined
heating and power plant in Ulaanbaatar with proper emission reduction equipment. AsDB has been
piloting the application of renewable energies, and is supporting Mongolia to access multilateral
climate change funds.
Urban Development. AsDB is helping to meet basic infrastructure needs in small towns, including
those playing a central role in the mineral-rich Gobi area, where communities are coping with a
large population influx in response to new mining operations. At the same time, AsDB is preparing a
program to develop services and economic opportunities in poor areas of Ulaanbaatar.
Education. Since the mid-1990s AsDB has supported the Government of Mongolia in strengthening
basic and secondary education, which succeeded in maintaining Mongolia’s high levels of access
and education achievements. To meet pressing labor market demands, AsDB is also supporting
reform of higher education and will help modernize vocational training.
Health. AsDB has made major investments to improve primary health services and health insurance,
and is supporting policy reforms and investments in the hospital sector and in drug safety.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 31, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance. The priority areas for
improvement are national accounts and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: The national accounts statistics compiled by the National Statistics Office (NSO)
are broadly in line with the guidelines of the 1993 system of national accounts (SNA). They have
improved the quality of national accounts data, but weaknesses remain, including in the estimation of
capital formation, estimation of GDP price deflators, and coverage of the informal sector and smallscale activity (especially in the services sector). The compilation of constant price expenditure-based
national accounts, in line with the pilot done in 2008, would serve as a useful check for the production
side estimates. NSO disseminates annual expenditure-based GDP series both in value terms and in real
terms, and to pilot quarterly estimates of GDP by expenditure currently while not yet disseminated.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) was rebased in January 2008 with expenditure-derived
weights from the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. NSO has published a national CPI
for Ulaanbaatar and 21 aimags (provinces) since January 2008, and a housing price index since October
2008. Priority areas for improvement are data on wages and earnings. NSO plans to disseminate a
producer price index and a retail price index in early 2013.
External Sector Statistics: The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) follows the concepts and methods in the
Balance of Payment Manual fifth edition and is expected to begin implementing the recommendations
of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in
2012. The BOM disseminates the data according to the IMF standard presentation table. The coverage
of the balance of payments statistics has been broadened by extending the International Transaction
Reporting System (ITRS) to nonbank financial institutions and by increasing the number of direct
reporting private enterprises. Priorities for improvement are in the analysis of balance of payments and
the quarterly survey of foreign investment enterprises. The BOM compiled an experimental International
Investment Position (IIP) for 2007, and started to publish IIP in 2011 covering data from 2010.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: BOM’s monetary and financial statistics conform to the concepts
and definitions of the MFSM methodology as the authorities implemented majority of
recommendations of the latest MFS missions. In particular, the monetary data were improved by the
proper classification of repurchase agreements, accrued interest, and financial derivatives. The coverage
of monetary statistics was expanded beginning in February 2010 to include data of Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (SCCs) that collect deposits and since May 2010 data for some other financial institutions
(OFIs) have been disseminated in the BOM monthly statistical bulletin. Monetary data based on the
standardized report forms are disseminated in International Financial Statistics beginning in November
2009. The July/August 2011 mission discussed the quality of data of the nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs), insurance companies, and securities companies that are reported to the Financial Regulatory
Commission (FRC) and recommended their use in the compilation of monetary statistics. However, due
to a pure cooperation received from the FRC, this recommendation has not been implemented yet. The
BOM is taking steps to improve the quality of its monetary data with respect to the proper sectorization
of other depository corporations’ accounts. Such improved data will be available towards the end of
2012.

Government Finance Statistics: Currently, the concepts, classifications, and definitions used to compile
sub-annual and annual fiscal statistics reported to the Fund fiscal statistics generally follow the
guidelines of the GFSM 1986. While no formal decision has yet been taken on adopting a migration
path to the GFSM 2001 methodology, Mongolia also compiles annual GFSM 2001-based Statement of
government Operations, Statement of Sources and Uses of cash, and a complete Balance Sheet for the
consolidated general government.
II. Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC mission visited Mongolia in September
Mongolia participates in the General Data
2007 to update the May 2000 assessment of the
Dissemination System (GDDS), and
maintains its efforts to subscribe the Special macroeconomic statistics, complemented by an
assessment of data quality based on the IMF’s Data
Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
Quality Assessment Framework. The report was
published in April 2008.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND THIRD POST-PROGRAM
MONITORING—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

November 1, 2012

Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and
Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
and Jeffrey Lewis and
Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
Asian Development Bank (AsDB), using the debt
sustainability framework for low-income countries approved
by the Boards of both institutions.

The results of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are similar to those of the previous
DSA.1 Mongolia’s risk of debt distress remains low based on indicators of external and
public debt. The successful Eurobond issuance by the Development Bank of Mongolia
(DBM) earlier this year pushed up the country’s public and publicly-guaranteed external
debt. However, under the baseline scenario, with the economy expanding and large
mining projects coming on stream, Mongolia’s external and public debt ratios are
projected to improve substantially over the medium term and external debt burden
indicators remain below the relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds.2

1

The 2011 DSA (see IMF Country Report No. 11/76) was based on end-2009 debt data. The current DSA is
based on end-2011 debt data. The fiscal year for Mongolia is January–December.
2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policydependent. Mongolia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer,” with an average rating of 3.41 during
2009-11. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio,
150 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio,
20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These
thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

MONGOLIA

BACKGROUND
1.
This DSA incorporates an updated baseline macroeconomic outlook, including revised
assumptions on the public sector’s external and domestic borrowing plans. The economy is
experiencing a structural shift as the development of the Oyu Tolgoi (OT) copper-gold mining complex
nears completion. The assumptions and projections regarding the development of the OT and Tavan
Tolgoi (TT) mining projects in this DSA are broadly in line with those in the previous DSA (Box 1 ). At the
same time, expansionary fiscal policy has been causing double-digit inflation and balance of payments
(BOP) pressures. Moreover, to address the country’s large infrastructure needs, the DBM raised
US$600 million through the issuance of five-year government-guaranteed Eurobonds (Box 2). Compared
to the previous DSA, public and publicly guaranteed external debt is on a higher path, reflecting for the
most part DBM borrowing:


The face value of public external debt is now projected to amount to 29.4 percent of GDP in
2012, up from 19.8 percent of GDP in the previous DSA. The higher public external debt ratio is
mostly accounted for by DBM borrowing (6 percent of GDP) and the U.S. dollar value of GDP
being 6 percent lower than projected in the previous DSA.



Reflecting the likely extent of DBM borrowing, the face value of public external debt is now
projected to decline by 5½ percentage points of GDP over the next five years, compared to a
17½ percentage points of GDP decline projected in the previous DSA.
Box 1. Mongolia: Two Large Mining Projects
Exports of copper and coal are set to rise significantly over the medium term:



The Oyu Tolgoi mine, located in the south near the border with China, will be one of the largest copper and
gold mines in the world. The government owns 34 percent of the mine, and the rest is owned by Turquoise Hills
Resources (Canada), in which Rio Tinto (UK) has a 51 percent stake. Production is expected to start in early
2013.



Tavan Tolgoi, also located in southern Mongolia, is one of the world’s largest untapped coal deposits with
estimated reserves of about 6.4 billion tons. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC, a subsidiary of a 100 percent
state-owned enterprise, has the mining license for what is called the eastern bloc (East Tsankhi) as well as the
western bloc (West Tsankhi). An operating contract with foreign companies for the eastern bloc was concluded
in October 2011. An initial public offering of 20 percent of Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi shares is expected to take
place in the first half of 2013. The modalities for developing the western bloc are under discussion.

Box 2: The Development Bank of Mongolia
The DBM was set up in May 2011 with the mandate to finance Mongolia’s large infrastructure needs to
develop the country’s mineral wealth and associated transportation networks. The project portfolio of the
DBM includes railroads, roads and infrastructure for housing projects, energy, and industrial development. A
large number of mostly road projects were also shifted to the DBM’s portfolio from the budget in 2011. The
government signed a four-year management contract in 2011 with the Korean Development Bank. And a
recent World Bank technical assistance mission provided specific recommendations to amend the Law on
the DBM to bring it in line with international best practice.
Wholly-owned by the government, DBM borrowing carries a sovereign guarantee. The risk of contingent
liabilities could be mitigated somewhat by the recently passed IBL which requires that all guarantees
provided by the state, including for the DBM, be fully reflected in the budget (Box 4).
The DBM debuted its first foreign currency bond offering on international financial markets in March. The
five-year US$580 million bond offering drew orders of US$6.25 billion, with a yield of 5.75 percent, much
lower than the initial guidance of 6–6.25 percent. The bonds are rated B1 by Moody's and BB- by S&P, which
is the same rating as the Mongolian sovereign. Along with an earlierUS$20 million in a private placement at
the end of 2011, the offering completes its US$600 million program of issuance during 2012 to fund several
infrastructure projects including roads and railway projects. The DBM is expected to continue issuing
similarly large amounts of debt on international markets over the next few years, a scenario which is
incorporated into the DSA.
Sources: World Bank and IMF.

2.
The macroeconomic outlook, summarized in Box 3, assumes that the government budget
will observe the Fiscal Stability Law’s ( FSL) ceiling for the structural deficit of 2 percent of GDP from
2014 onwards. The macro-economic outlook also takes into account the likely extent of off-budget
spending by the DBM on public investment projects.


The 2013 draft budget sent to Parliament targets a general government deficit of
1.2 percent of GDP in 2013. This is consistent with the FSL’s structural deficit ceiling of
2 percent of GDP. However, revenues may be overestimated by as much as 6¾ percent of
GDP. As a result, revenue shortfalls will likely cause the FSL’s structural deficit ceiling to be
breached in 2013. Meanwhile, any potential delay in the start of full commercial production
at Oyu Tolgoi would also delay net revenue inflows into the budget, constraining fiscal space
and growth prospects in the near term.

MONGOLIA

Box 3. Mongolia—Macroeconomic Outlook and Assumptions
The baseline macroeconomic framework assumes that growth will be driven by completion of the OT
copper and gold mine and rising output from the eastern bloc of the TT coal mine, with the economy
experiencing significant structural changes in the process.



The medium-term outlook for real GDP growth is dominated by OT and TT. Production from the
OT mine is expected to start in early 2013, with the mine expected to produce at full capacity by
around 2016. Total mining output is projected to expand by more than 20 percent per annum, on
average, over the next five years. As the mineral sector expands in size, there will also be significant
spillovers to other sectors through changes in relative factor prices and factor movements. Overall
growth is projected to average 12 percent per annum during 2012–17. Long-run growth is
projected to average about 5½ percent, unchanged from the previous DSA. This could be higher,
depending on the development of new mining projects. With progress on the development of the
western part of the TT coal mine currently stalled, the macroeconomic framework only
incorporates output projections from the eastern part of TT over the next few years.



The baseline assumes that structural fiscal reforms including on pensions, civil service, social
transfers will contribute to an improved business climate and overall competitiveness of the
economy, while public investment management reforms should help to mitigate risks of
contingent liabilities.



The copper and coal price projections through 2017 are based on the WEO projections as of
August 2012 and are assumed constant in real terms afterwards, but take into account
transportation costs which reduced the price received by Mongolia.



The continued strong growth of domestic demand is expected to prevent a rapid decline in
inflation and the increase in consumer prices is projected to remain in double digits throughout
2013. Over the long term, with fiscal policy anchored by the FSL, inflation will decelerate to about
5 percent.



The BOP will go through large swings. The current account is expected to gradually shift into
surplus by 2015 as imports of mining-related investment goods ease and a larger share of the
gross export proceeds from the OT mine accrue to the government in the form of tax and dividend
payments. However, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows are also expected to fall back.



A restrained fiscal policy is projected over the medium to long term, supported by the FSL and
Integrated Budget Law (IBL). The structural fiscal balance is expected to gradually converge to the
numerical targets specified in the FSL starting from 2013 (when the structural deficit and spending
growth rules take effect). Rising commodity exports will boost fiscal revenue. Implementation of
the FSL is expected to reduce pro-cyclicality by restraining expenditure growth during periods of
high mineral revenues and enable the authorities to save a substantial fraction of mineral revenues
in a Stabilization Fund that was established in 2011. As a result, the primary deficit would average
less than 1 percent of GDP during 2012–17.



To take into account the likely extent of external borrowing by the DBM, the baseline
macroeconomic projections assume the issuance of US$500 million in new governmentguaranteed international bonds each year for the next five years.



Considerable capital spending will be channeled through the DBM. This spending is not included
in the budget. It is also not covered by the FSL’s limits on the structural deficit or expenditure
growth, even though, for the most part, it will not generate revenues and eventually require
funding from the budget to repay principal and interest on the DBM’s external loans. Off-budget
DBM spending will add to overheating pressures and will undermine the FSL’s integrity and
meaningfulness. DBM borrowing is guaranteed by the government and projected DBM
borrowing is included in the DSA.



The enactment of the IBL in late-2011
should support the observance of the
FSL in 2014 and beyond (Box 4). At the
same time, for the next few years, there
will also be off-budget capital spending
by the DBM which will add to external
debt accumulation and put pressure on
inflation.

Box 4: Key provisions of the Integrated Budget Law


The IBL (passed December 2011) is a comprehensive law which reforms the entire budget process,
from public investment planning to budget execution and auditing, secures the implementation of
the FSL, and fully accounts for contingent liabilities. Its key provisions are:



On fiscal stability, the IBL mandates that budgets observe the 2 percent structural deficit ceiling
and expenditure and debt rules set in the FSL and the expenditure limits set out in Medium-Term
Budget Frameworks. The deficit and spending rules become binding in 2013.



The law also explicitly states that the budget includes the state (central government) budget, the
Human Development Fund, and the Social Insurance Fund; that the budget should list projects to
be executed through concessions contracts, and include information on government guarantees
and contingent liabilities, including those made to the newly formed DBM, thereby improving the
budget’s comprehensiveness. It therefore makes clear that any investments and debts by the DBM
are public investments and debts, and that the safeguards of the FSL and IBL apply.



It significantly strengthens capital budgeting, mandating that only projects that have gone through
a proper appraisal process be considered for financing, and introduces the concept of a rolling
four-year public investment program for large projects (greater than 30 billion MNT) as a stock of
potentially financeable projects that have passed a pre-feasibility study. All financing decisions—
whether to fund projects from the budget, loans, concessions, or the DBM—are then made by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), abiding by the good principle of the MOF as a single point of control on
such matters.

Reflecting Mongolia’s rapid economic development, strong growth prospects and improved
credit-worthiness, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (AsDB) confirmed its eligibility for
non-concessional borrowing,3 while still retaining access to concessional funding.4 With non-concessional
borrowing from the two institutions expected to increase over the next few years alongside borrowing by
the DBM through international bond issuances, the grant element of new external borrowing—as reflected
by the grant-equivalent financing component—is projected to fall over the medium term. Meanwhile,
however, an increase in concessional lending from multilateral and bilateral development partners in 2013
and 2014 is expected to cause the grant element of new borrowing to rise in those years. Interest rates in
the medium term reflect International Development Association (IDA) blend terms and AsDB terms for
concessional borrowing and market conditions for commercial loans.

3

The process of graduation from IDA begins when a country exceeds its operational per capita income guidelines for
a few years in a row. Mongolia’s GNI per capita has nearly quadrupled since 2004, from $480 to $1,890 in 2010, a
level well above the 2010 cut-off mark set for low-income countries of $1,005 per capita.
4

Mongolia has been granted “Blend” status (in August 2011 by the AsDB, and in March 2012 by the World Bank,
taking full effect in May 2012), which allows it to access both concessional and non-concessional (IBRD funding from
the World Bank, and OCR funding from the AsDB) resources. Non-concessional funding from the World Bank is
expected to be phased in over the next few years, while Mongolia will tap such funding from the AsDB from 2012
onwards.

A comprehensive assessment of debt management operations using the Debt Management
Performance Assessment tool was undertaken by a World Bank mission in December 2010. The
mission found that relative strengths of Mongolia’s debt management are in governance and strategy
development. The mission noted room for improvement in the areas of cash flow forecasting and cash
management as well as operational risk management and reporting.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External DSA
7.
All external debt indicators remain well below the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds
under the baseline scenario. There would be a one-off breach of a threshold under one of the
standardized stress tests. The main results of the external DSA are as follows:


All debt indicators in the baseline scenario are expected to decline over the 20-year
projection period (Table 1). During the projection period, the present value (PV) of the
external debt-to-GDP ratio decreases from 20 percent in 2011 to about 8 percent in 2032
(compared to an indicative threshold of 40 percent), while the PV of the debt-to-exports
ratio is projected to hover around 45 percent over the medium term and decrease to around
20 percent in 2032 (compared to an indicative threshold of 150 percent).



The standard stress tests do reveal some vulnerabilities (Table 3 and Figure 1). The
standard exports shock causes a one-off breach of the threshold by the PV of the debt-toexports ratio. This underscores that, to limit vulnerability, recourse to non-concessional
foreign financing should be limited to commercially viable projects. As indicated in the
previous DSAs, the prospective strong increase in real GDP related to the start of OT mining
operations is so large that historical scenarios with key variables at their historical averages
do not seem to represent relevant comparators. 5

B. Public DSA
8.
In the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 52 percent of GDP in 2012
and then falls rapidly over the medium term to 25 percent of GDP in 2017 before stabilizing at about
22 percent of GDP over the long run (Table 2). The domestic debt to GDP ratio declines rapidly as the
advance tax payments and the government’s investment share borrowing are repaid from the mining

5

At the same time, it should be noted that, despite the structural changes, the current account deficits during
2012-14 will still be larger than the average current account deficit of the past 10 years (4.5 percent of GDP).
Therefore, if the large current account deficits (and hence large external borrowing requirements) in the baseline
scenario in 2012–14 are replaced by the smaller current account deficits (and hence smaller external borrowing
requirements) in the historical scenario, then the debt to GDP ratio, the debt to export ratio and the debt to revenue
ratio decline very rapidly. However, for the subsequent five years the reverse is the case: the projected current
account balance is much stronger (moving into surplus). Therefore, whereas the debt to GDP ratio, the debt to export
ratio, and the debt to revenue ratio decline in the baseline scenario, they rise in the historical scenario.

projects’ forthcoming revenue streams. Meanwhile, new external borrowing by the DBM prevents a rapid
decline in the PV of external public debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
9.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected paths of debt indicators are
sensitive to alternative assumptions and point to some risks (Table 4 and Figure 2). A case in point is the
scenario in which GDP growth in 2013–14 is one standard deviation below its historical average. In this
scenario the PV of debt-GDP ratio rises from 52 percent in 2012 to 115 percent in 2032.

AUTHORITIES' VIEW
10.
The authorities concurred with the overall assessment. With regard to the DBM’s external
borrowing, they emphasized the need to increase investment in infrastructure. They viewed this as essential
to facilitate exports, reduce the economy’s reliance on the mining sector, and ease supply-side price
pressures, by improving the connections of traders and farmers to markets. The authorities confirmed that
the main purpose of the DBM is to finance bankable projects. Over time, DBM funding for non-bankable
social benefit projects would decrease.

CONCLUSION
11.
In the staff’s view, Mongolia is at a low risk of debt distress based on external indicators. The
overall medium- to long-term macroeconomic outlook is favorable. However, short-term risks remain as
expansionary policies lead to overheating pressures and increase Mongolia’s vulnerability to a commodity
price downturn, which remains a substantial risk in the current global environment. Under the baseline
scenario, public debt ratios are projected to peak in 2013 and then fall steadily over the medium term with
the rapid growth in the economy. On that basis, and taking into account possible contingent fiscal liabilities
related to government-guaranteed external borrowing by the DBM to fund infrastructure projects, the
projected path of public debt ratios does not alter the external DSA’s assessment.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assu
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation and
Third Post-Program Monitoring with Mongolia
On November 16, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2012 Article IV Consultation1 and Post-Program Monitoring2 with Mongolia.
Background
Mongolia has made impressive progress in developing its economy. Spearheaded by the
FDI-financed development of the mining sector, growth averaged 8 percent per annum
over the past 10 years, among the highest in the region. As a result, per capita GDP
increased five-fold, to about US$3,000, and Mongolia has gained access to international
capital markets. The authorities are addressing the key challenge of medium-term natural
resource management and Dutch Disease by putting in place a fiscal framework anchored

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Post-Program Monitoring provides for more frequent consultations between the Fund and
members whose arrangement has expired but that continue to have Fund credit outstanding,
with a particular focus on policies that have a bearing on external viability. There is a
presumption that members whose credit outstanding exceeds 200 percent of quota would
engage in Post-Program Monitoring.

2
by the 2010 Fiscal Stability Law (FSL), the 2011 Integrated Budget Law (IBL), and the
2012 Social Welfare Law (SWL).
Growth is decelerating from the very rapid pace in 2011. The expansion of the economy
slowed to 10 percent during the first nine months of 2012 (year-on-year), down from 17
percent in 2011. Growth has been buoyed by expanding coal and copper production, the
ongoing development of new large mining projects, a relatively mild winter boosting
agriculture, and highly expansionary fiscal policy.
Meanwhile, inflation remains high and the balance of payments is under pressure.
Inflation is around 15 percent, primarily due to rapidly rising government spending. Strong
domestic demand is driving up imports, and the resulting balance of payment pressures
are compounded by slowing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and slowing export
growth. In recent months, coal exports to China slumped amid China’s overall
decelerating imports.
Monetary policy has been tightened. Over the past year, in response to inflation rising
substantially above the official target of less than 10 percent, the central bank increased
its policy rate and reserve requirements. These tightening measures contributed to a
marked slowdown in credit growth, from 72 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in
September 2012 (year-on-year).
But fiscal policy has remained excessively expansionary. The overall fiscal balance
worsened by 5⅓ percentage points of GDP in 2011, to a deficit of 4¾ percent of GDP.
Revenue surged, thanks to the value added tax and customs duties collected on imports
of capital goods for mining sector development. But this was more than offset by a 62
percent increase in government spending. Government spending continued to soar during
the first half of 2012.
Over the past year, the togrog/U.S. dollar exchange rate has depreciated by 7 percent. At
the same time, Mongolia’s Net International Reserves (NIR) declined by a third
(US$0.7 billion) to a two-year low of US$1.5 billion. The effect of the balance of payment
pressures on gross international reserves (GIR) has been offset by BOM drawings on the
swap line with the central bank of China (US$0.2 billion) and by BOM deposit taking from
the DBM (US$0.4 billion) and commercial banks (US$0.2 billion). Thus, GIR remains near
an all-time high of US$2.6 billion (6.3 months of prospective non-mining imports).
The near-term outlook for growth is favorable, but inflation is projected to remain in double
digits. The external position is projected to remain under pressure. Coal export capacity
will expand further, and copper exports are projected to rise. However, imports will also
rise, owing to the DBM’s public investment projects.
Mongolia’s medium-term prospects are promising. Coal and copper production will be
ramped up and activity outside the mining sector is also projected to remain buoyant,

3
although this would need to be supported by continued reforms to strengthen the
business climate.
However, a number of challenges need to be addressed as the new government embarks
on implementing its Action Plan for 2012–16. Importantly, policies need to be set against
the continued uncertainties in the global economic outlook. Potential spillovers to
Mongolia are significant, possibly affecting export volumes, commodity prices, and FDI
inflows.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities for an impressive record of economic
growth over the last few years, but noted that there is scope to make growth more
inclusive. Directors considered that the key policy challenge going forward will be to meet
large investment needs without undermining macroeconomic stability. They agreed that
this task would be facilitated by the recently revamped legal underpinnings of the fiscal
framework.
While taking note of Mongolia’s favorable outlook for the medium term, Directors noted
that inflation remains high, and that booming domestic demand is putting pressure on the
balance of payments. Against this background, they emphasized that fiscal policy needs
to be tightened, and that the 2013 budget will be key to safeguarding domestic and
external stability. Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities to fully observe the
Fiscal Stability Law in the 2013 budget design and implementation, including the
2 percent of GDP structural deficit ceiling. In light of a likely revenue shortfall and the
uncertain external environment, Directors recommended cautious revenue projections and
lower budget spending, mainly by deferring lower-priority capital projects.
Directors emphasized the need for a clear policy to ensure that the Development Bank of
Mongolia (DBM) can help meet the long-term infrastructure needs of Mongolia in a
macro-economically sustainable manner with minimal fiscal risks. In particular, public
investment projects financed by the DBM should be taken into account when setting the
path of fiscal policy, consistent with the new fiscal framework. Directors welcomed efforts
to explore the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund, which could be an important
complement to the fiscal framework.
Directors considered the tightening of monetary policy over the past year to be
appropriate. With inflation still in excess of the authorities’ target, they saw no scope to
loosen the monetary stance unless fiscal policy is tightened and inflationary pressures
abate. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to allowing the exchange rate to
move in line with market conditions. They noted, however, that expansionary fiscal policy
has put net international reserves on a downward trajectory that is not sustainable.

4
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen and deepen the financial
sector, including the phased increase in capital adequacy ratios of systemically important
banks. They encouraged further steps to develop a government bond market, reduce
banking sector risks including those arising from unhedged foreign currency lending,
deepen the foreign exchange market, strengthen the monetary transmission channel, and
address deficiencies in the regime to combat money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. To promote a more diversified economy, Directors stressed the importance of
continued reforms to strengthen the business climate and clarify the foreign investment
regime.
