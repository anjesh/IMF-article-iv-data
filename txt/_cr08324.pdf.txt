EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2006, The Gambia has maintained
macroeconomic stability and made progress toward achieving debt sustainability. Fiscal
performance has improved and monetary policy has been geared to maintaining low
inflation. Real GDP growth has been strong and inflation has abated after a spike in the first
half of 2007.
A sharp appreciation of the dalasi in 2007 has mitigated the impact of increases in
world food and oil prices. The authorities’ response to the continuing rise in these world
prices has been measured; while eliminating sales tax on rice, they have raised other taxes to
compensate for the revenue loss. Petroleum product prices have been adjusted to eliminate an
implicit subsidy and bring them in line with import costs.
An updated DSA confirmed the conclusion reached at HIPC completion point last
December that The Gambia remains at high risk of debt distress even after receiving
HIPC and MDRI assistance. To maintain external debt sustainability, staff urged the
authorities to expedite the formulation of the national debt strategy and to rely mainly on
grants to finance their development plans.
Staff assesses the dalasi to be broadly in line with fundamentals. However, a marked
appreciation in 2007 is likely to contribute to slower growth in 2008 through its impact on
tourism. Staff and the authorities agreed that the main factors affecting The Gambia’s
international competitiveness include weak infrastructure, lack of access to long-term
financing, and the burden of a multiplicity of taxes and local government charges.
The Gambia’s revenue effort is good, but reforms are needed to make tax revenues
buoyant. With the Gambia Revenue Authority now fully operational, gains from improved
administration may be reaching their limit. More attention should be paid to broadening the
tax base and making the tax system buoyant. The authorities agreed to review the scope for
reducing import duty exemptions.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. All quantitative
targets for end-March 2008 were met, and four out of eight structural performance criteria
scheduled for implementation between December 2007 and July 2008 were fully met on
time. In view of remedial measures undertaken by the authorities, staff supports their request
for waivers for nonobservance of four structural performance criteria.
The main risks to achieving the authorities’ macroeconomic objectives include
continued increases in world food and oil prices, failure to maintain fiscal discipline,
and shortfalls in external assistance. The authorities may seek PRGF augmentation if
world food and oil prices continue to rise. Fiscal discipline is needed to contain domestic
debt and put downward pressure on interest rates. Shortfalls in external assistance would
undermine implementation of PRSP II.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since the 2006 Article IV consultation, The Gambia has maintained
macroeconomic stability and made progress toward achieving debt sustainability. Fiscal
performance has improved, and monetary policy has been geared to maintaining low
inflation. Satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported program helped the country
reach the HIPC completion point in December 2007 and thus benefit from substantial debt
relief. Although debt relief has reduced The Gambia’s external debt stock by more than half
(from 110 percent to 50 percent of GDP at end-2007), staffs of the Fund and World Bank
assess the country to be at high risk of debt distress.
2.
Per capita GDP has been growing, but poverty remains widespread. Over the last
five years, annual growth in per capita GDP has averaged 3.7 percent. Based on the results of
the 2003 household expenditure survey, the government estimates over 60 percent of the
population live below the poverty line.
3.
The Gambia’s second PRSP (PRSP II) provides the framework for the
authorities’ economic development program during 2007-11 (MEFP ¶18). PRSP II
reiterates the strategic priorities of the first PRSP, including: (i) macroeconomic stability and
effective public resource management; (ii) promotion of pro-poor growth and employment
through private sector development; and (iii) improved provision of basic services. PRSP II
contains intermediate targets toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The authorities have highlighted the importance of strengthened capacity in the public
service for the successful implementation of PRSP II.
4.
With the PRGF-supported program broadly on track, staff’s discussions with
the authorities focused on policies for sustaining macroeconomic stability, maintaining
external stability, and boosting long-term growth. The growth discussions centered on
trade and other policies to enhance The Gambia’s international competitiveness. The
discussions also touched on the authorities’ progress in reaching their poverty reduction
objectives.
5.
The authorities’ response to rising world food and oil prices has been measured.
While reducing the sales tax on rice imports from 15 percent to 5 percent in July 2007 and
eliminating it altogether in May 2008, the authorities increased other taxes (on car parts and
used vehicles) to compensate for the revenue loss. The pump prices of petroleum products
were increased in May 2008 by 10–24 percent to remove an implicit budget subsidy that had
emerged in the preceding months. Thus, the fiscal impact has so far been limited.
Appreciation of the dalasi helped cushion the impact on inflation but has lowered growth
prospects for 2008.

7.
Inflation abated after a spike in 2007 (Figure 1). Disruptions in the supply of
foodstuffs from neighboring countries and rising import costs (e.g., rice) pushed the annual
rate of inflation from less than 1 percent in December 2006 to 6–7 percent during most of
2007. However, tight monetary policy and appreciation of the dalasi helped to contain
inflation pressures and lower the annual rate to 2.2 percent in June 2008.
8.
The overall fiscal balance
improved from a 7 percent of
GDP deficit in 2006 to a
0.2 percent of GDP surplus in
2007. This was achieved through a
sharp fall in expenditures and net
lending. Current expenditures fell
by 2 percent of GDP, due primarily
to a fall in domestic interest rates.
Capital expenditures fell more
rapidly; spending on externally
financed projects fell by 5½
percent of GDP mainly due to a
dispute between a contractor and a consultant that delayed the disbursement of grants for an
(EU)-funded roads project (MEFP ¶4). The overall balance continued to be in

surplus in the first quarter of 2008. Increased expenditure on wages—in line with the budget
and aimed at helping the government retain and attract skilled employees—has been offset
by a decline in external interest payments (due to debt relief) and in externally financed
capital expenditures.
9.
A significant slowdown in broad money growth in 2007 reflected improved
government finances and stagnant lending to the private sector. Broad money growth fell
from 26 percent in 2006 to 7 percent in 2007. Reserve money exhibited an even more
pronounced slowdown—from 24 percent expansion in 2006 to a 4 percent decline in 2007. In
June 2007, to counter emerging inflationary pressures, the CBG raised its rediscount rate
from 14 percent to 15 percent. In March 2008, in response to tight monetary conditions and
against a backdrop of falling inflation, the CBG reduced the statutory minimum reserve
requirement of banks from 16 percent to 14 percent.

After remaining relatively stable from 2004 to 2006, the dalasi appreciated
significantly in 2007 and early 2008. A sharp
appreciation in the third quarter of 2007
appears to have been triggered by several
banks unwinding long open foreign currency
positions at the same time. Intervention by the
CBG halted the appreciation and the dalasi
weakened somewhat in the fourth quarter. For
2007 as a whole, the dalasi appreciated by
18 percent and 24 percent in nominal and real
effective terms, respectively. The dalasi
appreciated by 8 percent against the U.S.
dollar in the first half of 2008, reflecting strong inflow of remittances and reduced debt
service payments.

Yields on treasury bills have
fallen substantially over the last four
years but commercial banks’ lending
rates remain sticky. Successful
disinflation allowed the weighted yield on
treasury bills to fall from over 25 percent
in early 2005 to around 12 percent
currently. By contrast, commercial banks’
lending rates have been stuck above 20
percent. Banks cite high operating costs
and credit risks as factors behind the high
lending rates and wide interest rate spread.

9
12.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened from
11½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 12½ percent in 2007. Current transfers (mainly remittances
and official transfers) fell by 4 percent of GDP, helping push down imports by about
3 percent of GDP. The deficits were financed largely by inflows of foreign direct investment.
Gross official reserves increased by US$23 million in 2007, reaching 5½ months of imports
at year-end.
B. Performance Under the Program
13.
Performance has been satisfactory. The authorities have made solid progress on
fiscal consolidation, lowering interest rates and creating fiscal space for growth-promoting
and poverty-reducing expenditures. The government has improved public financial
management, especially budget execution, and the CBG has strengthened its governance. The
authorities made less progress deepening financial intermediation and improving the quality
of economic statistics.
14.
The authorities met all of the quantitative financial performance criteria for
end-March 2008 (MEFP Table A1). The cumulative basic balance through end-December
2007 fell slightly short of the indicative target, but by March 2008, it was back on target. The
indicative target on new external borrowing was met, and the government is ahead of
schedule on elimination of domestic budgetary arrears by end-2008.
15.
Four of eight structural performance criteria were implemented on time (MEFP
Table A2). The two special audit reports on program monetary data (due at end-December
2007 and end-June 2008) were submitted to Fund staff with slight delays. The other two—
making the credit reference bureau (CRB) fully operational, and the establishment of a
register of government expenditure commitments for projects largely financed by external
resources—were partially implemented. The CRB has been established but concerns about
the legal basis for sharing customer information have prevented it from becoming fully
operational (MEFP ¶14). The authorities have launched a review of the Financial Institutions
Act with a view to amending it to allow the CRB to share customer information among
banks. With regard to the register of expenditure commitments, Department of State for
Financial and Economic Affairs (DoSFEA) collected information in different formats with
varying degrees of completeness (MEFP ¶13). During the mission, the authorities designed a
uniform format for compiling data on each project or loan, and the establishment of the
register has now been set as a prior action for Board consideration of the PRGF third review.
The authorities are requesting waivers for the structural performance criteria that
were not observed.
III. KEY POLICY CHALLENGES
16.
Policy discussions addressed the following challenges to meeting the authorities’
macroeconomic objectives: (a) coping with rising world food and oil prices; (b) maintaining
external stability; (c) promoting growth and reducing poverty; (d) ensuring fiscal
sustainability; (e) making monetary policy more effective; and (f) enhancing financial
intermediation.

10
A. Coping with Rising World Food and Oil Prices
17.
Appreciation of the dalasi in 2007 helped contain the impact of rising world food
and oil prices on inflation. Most of the food consumed in the country is imported. The
authorities indicated that available stocks of rice—the main staple—should last through
September. They noted that, already, the domestic price of rice was beginning to increase and
that this trend would be reinforced if world prices continue their upward trajectory and/or the
dalasi weakens.
18.
The impact on the balance of payments is projected to be more pronounced in
2008 than in 2007 (Table 5B). The current account is projected to worsen by almost 2
percent of GDP. An up tick in inflation is also expected in the second half of 2008.
19.
To forestall pressures on the price of rice, the authorities eliminated the sales tax
on rice imports and took accompanying compensating revenue measures. The mission
discussed possible further measures to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable
households, including expanding existing social programs such as school feeding programs.
Staff recommended the government avoid general subsidies, noting they tend to be
ineffective and have created budgetary problems in other countries.
20.
The mission welcomed the recent adjustment of pump prices of petroleum
products to avoid a massive implicit budget subsidy. 1 Staff agreed that the budget could
not afford to subsidize petroleum products and urged the authorities to regularly review retail
prices to keep them in line with world prices. The government intends to continue to crosssubsidize kerosene through petrol and diesel prices (MEFP ¶6).
B.

Maintaining External Stability

21.
Staff assesses the value of the dalasi to be broadly in line with fundamentals. The
mission discussed with the authorities the preliminary results of a Selected Issues Paper (SIP)
that assesses The Gambia’s external stability (Box 1). Examination of balance of payments
flows suggests the current account deficit is sustainable. The external sustainability approach
suggests that the exchange rate is overvalued by about 8 percent while the macroeconomic
balance approach suggests overvaluation of 11 percent. The equilibrium real exchange rate
approach yielded results ranging from a slight overvaluation to a significant undervaluation.
The analyses are hampered by severe data weaknesses, but, on balance, staff concludes that
the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The authorities welcomed the analysis
and reiterated their policy of allowing the dalasi’s value to be determined in the foreign
exchange market. They stressed that official intervention occurs mainly to maintain adequate
international reserves or to smooth fluctuations in the exchange rate (MEFP ¶30).

The price build up formula includes an excise tax and a sales tax, as well as a residual element that operates
like a virtual stabilization fund. A positive residual is interpreted as a windfall tax, while a negative residual is
considered an implicit subsidy.

11
Box 1. Assessing External Stability in The Gambia
Different approaches to assessing The Gambia’s external stability yield different results. The external sustainability
(ES) approach indicates a real depreciation of about 8 percent would be required to stabilize the NFA to GDP ratio at its
current level while the macroeconomic balance approach suggests a depreciation of 11 percent is needed. The equilibrium
real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests a range of results from a 2-percent overvaluation to 33-percent
undervaluation in 2007.
The Balance of Payments and REER. Except for a sharp fall in reserves in 2001, the overall balance of payments has
registered surpluses averaging 2 percent per year since 1997. The current account deficit increased substantially
beginning in 2004. However, this was caused by additional investment in the tourism and telecommunication sectors.
After the switch to a floating exchange rate regime in 1986, the REER remained within 10 percent of its average level
until 2000. A burgeoning fiscal deficit and loose monetary policy caused the REER to fall 50 percent between 2000 and
2003. Fiscal consolidation and tight monetary policy allowed the REER to stabilize from 2003 to 2007. Comparison with
other countries in the region indicates the fall in the REER is consistent with lower productivity growth in The Gambia.
Underlying current account, external sustainability and macroeconomic balance approaches. The underlying current
account balance is defined as the observed current account balance stripped of temporary factors. The underlying current
account deficit is estimated at 11.7 percent of GDP in 2007 compared to the actual deficit of 12.5 percent of GDP.
The external sustainability approach calculates the current account balance that stabilizes the NFA to GDP ratio at today’s
level. As a result of debt relief, The Gambia’s net foreign liabilities ratio fell from just under 200 percent of GDP during
2003-2006 to 56 percent of GDP at end-2007. Staff calculates the current account deficit that would stabilize the NFA
ratio—given projected average nominal growth of 10 percent—at 5.9 percent of GDP. Based on estimated elasticities,
The Gambia’s real exchange rate would need to depreciate by about 8 percent to bring the underlying current account
deficit down to the level needed to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio. The macroeconomic balance approach estimates a
current account norm based on The Gambia’s economic fundamentals compared with other countries. This approach
indicates a current account norm of 4 percent of GDP is appropriate for The Gambia, requiring a 11 percent depreciation.
Equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER). A single-country estimation indicates a very small overvaluation of the dalasi
at end-2007. A panel regression using coefficients from 28 oil-importing sub-Saharan African countries 2 , indicates the
real exchange was 33 percent below its fundamental value in 2007, implying that economic fundamentals cannot explain
the drop in the dalasi between 2000 and 2003. The external terms of trade for goods and services, productivity relative to
trading partners (defined as relative per capita real GDP), and government consumption relative to trading partners yield
statistically significant estimations for both single country and panel regressions. Statistical significance notwithstanding,
the outcome of this approach is subject to data uncertainties and a relatively short sample period (only 19 annual
observations for estimating the REER using single-country estimation techniques).

The Gambia remains at high risk of debt distress because of the high level of
outstanding debt and the country’s vulnerability to shocks. An update of the LIC DSA
undertaken by staff found that lower-than-expected external borrowing in 2007 and thus far
in 2008 has improved key debt ratios. 3 Thus, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio now falls
comfortably below the threshold of 30 percent over the 20 year projection horizon. However,
the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio still peaks at 138 percent of GDP, well above the threshold
of 100 percent.

The authorities indicated that they were awaiting assistance from the
Commonwealth Secretariat to undertake an independent DSA which would provide
input to their national debt strategy. Staff urged the authorities to expedite the formulation
of their strategy and to rely mainly on grants to finance their development plans. Staff noted
that The Gambia’s debt and debt service ratios are among the highest in the group of
countries that have recently reached the HIPC completion point and benefited from MDRI
assistance (Figure 2). The authorities responded they expect to have the debt strategy in place
by end-February 2009, will ensure that new loans have a minimum grant element of 45
percent, and will respect the indicative limit on new borrowing for 2008 (MEFP ¶33).

The lower than expected external borrowing was the result of a slower than expected pace concluding
negotiations with lenders. The debt sustainability assessment is presented in Supplement 1.

C. Promoting Growth and Reducing Poverty
24.
Enhancing the country’s international competitiveness is central to the
authorities’ strategy for promoting growth. Surveys and studies suggest a broad agenda of
reforms is needed to address structural constraints to growth. The Gambia ranked 131 out of
178 in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators for 2008 and 102 out of 131 countries in
the World Economic Forum’s Competitiveness Indicators for 2007–08 (Box 2). The Gambia
ranked highly on employing workers, trade, and enforcing contracts. Problem areas included
paying taxes, protecting investors, innovation, health, and education. A 2006 Investment
Climate Assessment done by the World Bank found that firms ranked electricity, access to
credit, land access, and a heavy tax burden as the most important obstacles to doing business
in the country. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study led by the World Bank and completed
in 2007, concluded that The Gambia’s role as a regional entrepot was eroding, and made
wide ranging recommendations to boost the country’s international competitiveness (MEFP
¶19). The mission noted that most of the recommendations of the various studies fall outside
the remit of the Fund, but highlighted tax policy as an area where the Fund could offer
assistance.

In addition to promoting pro-poor growth, the authorities are committed to
boosting poverty-reducing expenditures in the budget. The PRSP specifies that 25 percent
of government revenues and 30 percent of departmental budgets should be spent on priority
sectors including agriculture, education, health, and the environment. The ratio of priority
spending to government revenues has risen but remains below 21 percent. The government
achieved the target for the departmental budgets in 2005 and 2006.

Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed (Figure 3
and Table 7). The Gambia has achieved gender equality as measured by the female to male
primary school enrollment ratio and made significant progress on boosting primary school
enrollments. Primary and secondary health care have expanded significantly and increased
immunization has reduced mortality rates. However, the incidence of poverty has not
declined, undernourishment is still a serious problem, and the incidence of malaria and
tuberculosis remain high.

Financial and technical assistance from The Gambia’s development partners
will be critical for the successful implementation of PRSP II. PRSP II highlights capacity
weaknesses, policy slippages, and shortfalls in the delivery of aid as important factors in the
poor outcomes under the first PRSP. The government presented PRSP II to a Donor Round
Table Conference in February 2008, and spearheaded the establishment of an in-country
Development Partners Coordination and Consultation Mechanism (MEFP ¶35–¶37). The incountry forum will be used to monitor and analyze progress using a Results Matrix that
contains quantitative indicators and targets matched to PRSP objectives.
D. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
28.
Continued fiscal consolidation will enable the authorities achieve public debt
sustainability (see section III of Supplement 1). Overall fiscal deficits are projected to
average 2.7 percent of GDP during 2008–13. With external financing averaging 3½ percent
of GDP and domestic surpluses measuring ¾ percent of GDP, domestic debt falls by more
than half from its end-2007 level of 28 percent of GDP. This allows room for some increase
in domestic borrowing in the event of a shortfall in external assistance.
29.
At about 21 percent of GDP, The Gambia’s revenue effort is good, but reforms
are needed to make tax revenues buoyant. Improvements in revenue administration have
been important in boosting government revenues over the last four years. Reforms included
the creation of the Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA), establishment of a large taxpayer unit,
and the introduction of taxpayer identification numbers. With the GRA now fully
operational, gains from improved administration may be reaching their limit. More attention
should be paid to broadening the tax base and making the tax system buoyant. The lack of
buoyancy is explained by the dominance of import taxes in revenues and by the increasing
proportion of imports exempt from customs duties. The authorities agreed to review the
scope for reducing these exemptions.

The fiscal impact of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU
should be manageable. The Gambia is involved in ongoing negotiations with the EU as part
of the Economic Community of West African States. The mission presented the preliminary
results of an empirical analysis of the potential revenue loss from an EPA, and advised the
authorities to pursue commitments by the EU to compensate partners for net revenue losses. 4
The analysis suggests that:
•

A full and immediate liberalization of trade with the EU would lead to revenue losses
of about 2½ percent of GDP a year and represent a major fiscal shock to The Gambia.

•

However, a gradual trade liberalization that takes advantage of the allowance of
protection for 20 percent of imports from the EU and of a long transition period
would contain the revenue loss to a ½ percent of GDP a year over the first five years.

31.
The government is considering options for a comprehensive civil service reform
program, drawing on studies funded by the World Bank and other donors. It is seeking
to build the capacity of the civil service to formulate and implement policies and to deliver
public services efficiently. Over time, low pay and difficult working conditions have led to
an exodus of professional and managerial staff which has severely undermined the
functioning of the service. The reform program is expected to cover pay and benefits, career
development, and job security issues (MEFP ¶23). On the basis of the available analytical
studies, staff believes the macroeconomic framework can support a substantial increase in the
wage bill. However, staff emphasized that the pay reform should be targeted to retaining and
attracting professional and managerial staff. The authorities agreed, but said increases will be
needed at lower grades too to move them towards a living wage. The government will decide
on the details of the pay reform as part of the preparation of the 2009 budget.
32.
Introduction of the Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS) has improved expenditure management, but more reforms are needed to
strengthen public financial management. In particular, the process of budget formulation
needs to be strengthened to ensure that budget allocations are realistic and in line with
4

See SIP chapter on fiscal implications of an economic partnership agreement.

18
priorities. The establishment of a register to track government’s own commitments for capital
projects funded largely by donors is a key part of structural reforms under the PRGFsupported program.
E. Making Monetary Policy More Effective
33.
Monetary operations are guided by a money targeting framework, using broad
money as the intermediate target and reserve money as the operating target. Weekly treasury
bill auctions are the CBG’s main instrument for achieving its target. The CBG uses a shortterm liquidity forecasting framework to determine weekly monetary operations.
Announcements about the rediscount rate at the end of bimonthly Monetary Policy
Committee meetings are also used to signal its policy stance.
34.
A high degree of uncertainty about monetary policy transmission mechanisms
hampers monetary operations. The primary objective of monetary policy in The Gambia is
price stability, and the CBG has done a good job of reining in inflation. However, a recent
MCM technical assistance mission noted that the shallowness of the money market, and an
environment of uncertainty about the stability, persistence and relative importance of the
possible channels of monetary transmission constrain monetary policy. The mission
discussed with the CBG the findings of the MCM mission as well as staff analysis that
suggests that the demand for broad money may not be stable, thus casting doubt on its
appropriateness as nominal anchor for monetary policy. In this regard, the mission suggested
that CBG supplement its money targeting framework with a range of indicators (including
the outlook for inflation and exchange rate developments).
35.
The almost exclusive reliance on treasury bills for monetary operations has
generated conflicting signals about monetary policy. Treasury bills have been effective at
mopping up liquidity when the authorities have been willing to let interest rates rise (and
signaled that willingness by raising the rediscount rate). However, the CBG’s ability to inject
liquidity through the treasury bill market has been constrained by low balances in the
sterilization account. Hence, on occasion, even though the liquidity forecasting framework
called for injecting liquidity, the CBG

issued new bills to rollover maturing

bills. Staff recommended the CBG

projections) without re-igniting
inflation.
36.
The mission discussed a work program for enhancing the monetary policy
framework. The main elements are: (i) enhancing short-term liquidity forecasting by

19
improving projections of government revenues and expenditures; (ii) carrying out analytical
work to better understand the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; (iii) developing
leading indicators of economic activity; and (iv) improving data quality, especially on output
and interest rates of commercial banks.
F. Enhancing Financial Intermediation
37.
The financial sector is sound and competition has been increasing. The entry of
two new banks in 2007 brings the number of commercial banks operating in The Gambia to
ten. The banks are generally profitable, adequately capitalized, and highly liquid, although
profitability and liquidity ratios fell during the third quarter 2007 as banks suffered valuation
losses associated with the steep appreciation of the dalasi. Interest rate spreads are high,
though not out of line with levels in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Nonperforming
loans, at 12–14 percent, are moderate by regional standards. However, the loan-to-deposit
ratio (41 percent) is relatively low in part due to high risks associated with a weak legal
system (MEFP ¶10).

Reforms are underway to deepen financial intermediation. Making the Credit
Reference Bureau operational should reduce lending risks. The authorities are also reviewing
several laws (including the Financial Institutions and Mortgage Acts) to remove legal
impediments to financial intermediation. The CBG reported progress in strengthening
capacity in banking supervision (with technical assistance from the Fund), and in
implementing the Prompt Corrective Action framework introduced in July 2007 to monitor
the health of banks. After the sharp appreciation of the dalasi in late 2007, the CBG has

20
tightened enforcement of prudential regulations on banks’ foreign currency net open
positions. The CBG decided to lower banks’ reserve requirements partly to lower the cost of
funds to the banks and lower barriers to financial intermediation.
IV. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
39.
Revisions to the medium-term macroeconomic framework (Tables 1–5) take
account of the changes in the international environment and staff’s reassessment of the
outlook for external financing (including new budget support from the World Bank
amounting to about US$7 million in 2009). The main features of the updated framework
compared to the second review are: (i) a downward revision in GDP growth of about
1 percent in 2008 and ½ percent in 2009 due to the impact of global downturn and dalasi
appreciation on tourism and remittances and poor output in the groundnut sector;
(ii) inflation about one percent higher in 2008—due to the pass through of higher food and
energy prices—but returning to a downward path in 2009; (iii) maintenance of the surplus on
the fiscal basic balances for 2008 and 2009 of about 1½ percent of GDP but lower interest
rates leading to a more rapid decline in domestic debt; (iv) broad money growth of
12 percent, slightly higher than nominal GDP growth; and (v) a deterioration in the current
account balance including official transfers in 2008 due to higher world food and oil prices.
B. Policies for the Rest of 2008
40.
The updated macroeconomic framework envisions that the central government
basic balance will remain in surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP while the overall
deficit drops to 3 percent of GDP in 2008. The improvement in the overall balance
compared to the second review is attributable to a downward revision in externally financed
capital expenditures (in line with the revised outlook for external grants and loans). Domestic
revenues are projected to remain at 21 percent of GDP with a small drop in personal and
corporate taxes offset by increased revenues from the sales tax on oil imports. On the
expenditure side, current expenditures are expected to remain at about 16 percent of GDP
while capital expenditures fall from 13 to 10 percent of GDP. Domestic interest bearing debt
is projected to fall from 28 percent of GDP at end-2007 to 22½ percent of GDP at end-2008.
41.
The CBG indicated monetary policy will continue to aim at keeping inflation
low. Rising world food and oil prices will pose a challenge. Improved coordination of fiscal
and monetary policies will help meet the challenge.
42.
The government is seeking debt relief from all its creditors. Following a Paris
Club agreement in January 2008, the government has signed bilateral debt relief agreements
with France and Norway, and expects to sign agreements with its two other Paris Club
creditors (Austria and Netherlands) in the coming months. Kuwait has agreed to provide debt

21
relief on comparable terms to those of the Paris Club. The authorities are following up their
previous communications with other creditors.
C. Program Monitoring, Risks, and Potential Augmentation
43.
The program’s quantitative targets have been extended through June 2009
(MEFP, Table A1) while the target dates for implementing some structural measures
have been reset. In particular, to allow adequate time for establishing a legal basis for the
CRB to share information on customers among banks, the performance criterion on making
the CRB operational has been reset from end-March 2008 to end-March 2009 (MEFP ¶14).
The Auditor-General delayed the submission of the report on the government’s 2000–04
accounts to the national assembly to give the Treasury Directorate an opportunity to respond
to some queries and correct portions of the accounts. The final report is now scheduled to go
to the national assembly in September 2008 (MEFP ¶16).
44.
Structural conditionality has been streamlined. The broad areas of focus remain
unchanged: (i) public financial management and accountability; (ii) central bank governance;
(iii) financial intermediation; and (iv) economic statistics. In recognition of progress made to
date, conditionality in the first two areas has been streamlined. There is no longer a
performance criterion on monthly fiscal reporting, which has now become routine. The
requirement of special audit reports of monetary data submitted to staff by the CBG for each
test date has also been dropped. These reports have served their purpose of addressing
reporting weaknesses.
45.

The main risks to achieving program objectives include:
•

Continued increases in world food and oil prices. These would fuel inflation and
worsen the current account deficit.

•

Failure to maintain fiscal discipline. This would lead to larger fiscal deficits, higher
levels of public debt, and higher domestic interest rates.

•

Sharp movements in the exchange rate. An appreciation would likely hurt tourism
and export earnings, while a depreciation would add to inflation pressures and worsen
the burden of external debt service.

•

Shortfalls in external assistance. These would jeopardize the program’s growth and
poverty-reduction objectives. For debt sustainability reasons external assistance
should be mainly in the form of grants or very highly concessional loans.

46.
The authorities may request PRGF augmentation at the next review if world oil
and food prices continue to rise (MEFP ¶41).

22
V. DATA, FUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
PROGRAM (FSAP)
47.
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but substantial
weaknesses remain in real sector and balance of payments. The national accounts data are
compiled using only the production approach, although progress has been made in
developing expenditure data. Implementation of an IFMIS system has improved fiscal
reporting; consolidated budget reports are now produced monthly with a one month lag.
Balance of payments reporting still has several gaps, in particular for re-exports and service
income. Data on private capital flows are poor but official grant and loan disbursements are
relatively well recorded.
48.
The authorities welcomed the appointment of a regional fiscal adviser to assist
with public financial management. The adviser, based in Liberia, made his first visit to
Banjul in July 2008. The authorities have requested ongoing assistance on banking
supervision, statistics (national accounts, balance of payments, and financial), and
compilation of a producer price index.
49.
The authorities also requested that The Gambia be considered for an FSAP
(MEFP ¶44).
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The authorities are to be commended for maintaining macroeconomic stability
and achieving robust growth. This resulted from prudent economic policies, including
significant fiscal consolidation and monetary policy geared to maintaining low inflation.
51.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ measured response to rising world food and oil
prices. So far, appreciation of the dalasi has helped contain the impact inflation but this is
likely to change in 2008. The authorities should continue to pass through increases in world
prices while considering targeted measures to help the poor, including expanding existing
social programs such as school feeding programs.
52.
Staff assesses the dalasi to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Different
empirical approaches yielded significantly different results—ranging from slight
overvaluation to substantial undervaluation. The analyses are hampered by severe data
weaknesses, but, on balance, staff concludes that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
53.
Notwithstanding some improvement in debt indicators, The Gambia remains at
high risk of debt distress. To the extent possible, the authorities should rely on grants and
highly concessions loans for financing their development program. In this regard, staff
welcomes the authorities’ efforts to strengthen their engagement with donors in order to
mobilize resources for implementing PRSP II.

23
54.
Further efforts are needed to improve the investment climate and The Gambia’s
international competitiveness. Staff encourages the authorities to work with the World
Bank and other donors for the speedy implementation of the recommendations of the DTIS,
especially in relation to the business climate.
55.
Reforms are needed to make the tax system buoyant. The government has made
important progress on tax administration and expenditure management, but further reforms
are needed to broaden the tax base and make it more buoyant. In particular, staff urges the
authorities to reduce the scope of import duty exemptions.
56.
Staff believes there is scope for higher growth in reserve money without fueling
inflation. In view of persistent undershooting of the CBG’s reserve money path, staff
recommends the use of foreign exchange operations as an additional instrument to influence
dalasi liquidity.
57.
Staff supports the authorities request for waivers for the nonobservance of four
structural performance criteria. The delays in submitting the two special audit reports
were due to circumstances beyond the authorities’ control. The authorities have initiated
steps toward removing the legal obstacles to making the CRB fully operational, and the
establishment of the register of government expenditure commitments is now a prior action
for completing the third PRGF review.
58.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months,
in line with the Decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

Appendix I
Banjul, The Gambia
July 30, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The Gambia’s three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement was approved by the IMF’s Executive Board in February 2007. The first and
second reviews were completed on August 29 and December 19, 2007, respectively. The
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews progress in
implementing the Government’s PRGF-supported program in 2007 and during the first half
of 2008, and sets out the policies that the government will pursue in the rest of 2008. We are
committed to continue maintaining macroeconomic stability and fostering reforms conducive
to higher growth and poverty reduction.
2.
Performance under the program has been quite strong. All the quantitative
performance criteria for end-March 2008 were met, and four out of eight structural
performance criteria scheduled for implementation between December 2007 and July 2008
were fully implemented on time. Of the remainder, two were met with a slight delay while
the other two were only partially implemented. On the basis of corrective measures that have
been taken (see MEFP, paragraphs 12–14), we request waivers for the nonobservance of four
performance criteria.
3.
In support of our policies described in the MEFP, the Government of The Gambia
requests the completion of the third review and the release of the fourth disbursement under
the PRGF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 2 million.
4.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate
to achieve the objectives of its program. However, it will stand ready to take any additional
measures that may become appropriate to meet these objectives. The Gambia will consult
with the IMF on the adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. The
fourth and fifth reviews under the PRGF arrangement are expected to be completed by no
later than end-January 2009, and end-July 2009, respectively.

34
5.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter and the attached MEFP
and Technical Memorandum of Understanding available to the public. Therefore, it
authorizes the IMF to arrange for these documents to be posted on the IMF website following
Executive Board conclusion of the review.
Sincerely yours,

Attachment I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum updates the Government of The Gambia’s economic and financial
program under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program, which was approved by the
Executive Board of the IMF in February 2007, aims at consolidating macroeconomic
stability and fostering the conditions for sustaining high economic growth and reducing
poverty. The first and second reviews were successfully completed in August and December
2007, respectively. The Gambia reached completion point under the enhanced Initiative for
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) in December 2007 and is receiving debt relief under
both the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Growth has remained strong but is expected to slow down in 2008. Real GDP grew at
about 6½ percent a year in 2006 and 2007, led by telecommunications, tourism and
construction. Tourist arrivals are on pace to increase by about 10 percent in the 2007/08
season compared to 2006/07; the average length of stay remained roughly the same, albeit
with a changing pattern and type of accommodation. Growth in the agriculture sector
declined in 2007 due to poor rains during the early part of the crop season. For 2008, overall
growth is projected to slow to 5.5 percent, mainly on account of the impact of adverse
international developments and dalasi appreciation on tourism and remittances.
3.
After rising sharply in 2007, inflation has slowed in 2008. Driven by rising world
food prices, the annual rate of inflation on a year-on-year basis rose from less than 1 percent
in December 2006 to 6-7 percent during most 2007. Appreciation of the dalasi and relatively
tight monetary policy helped to contain the price shocks. Year-on-year inflation was 2.2
percent in June 2008. The 12-month moving average rate fell from 5.2 percent in December
2007 to 4 percent in June 2008. In order to help keep the price of rice affordable, the
government eliminated the sales tax on rice imports in May 2008; the tax had been reduced
from 15 percent to 5 percent in July 2007.
4.
The overall fiscal balance improved in 2007. Gains from tax administration reforms
boosted revenues, while shortfalls in the projected level of external financing led to a marked
contraction in capital expenditures. In particular, a dispute between the contractor and the
supervising consultant delayed grant disbursements for a large European Union (EU)supported roads project. The problem has now been resolved and implementation of the
project is expected to proceed. The stock of domestic government debt fell from 32 percent
of GDP at end-2006 to 28 percent of GDP at end-2007, compared to nearly 30 percent
projected at the time of the second PRGF review.

36
5.
Performance weakened somewhat in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first
quarter of 2007. Domestic revenues were down 3.5 percent while domestic expenditures
increased by 16.5 percent. Nonetheless, the government was able to achieve a surplus of
D51 million on the basic balance. On the revenue side, taxes on international trade fell
11 percent. At the same time, wages increased 35 percent in line with the program to help
retain and attract skilled manpower to the government. This increase was partially offset by a
21 percent reduction in external interest payments due to HIPC and MDRI relief. In 2007, the
government cleared more domestic arrears than programmed, and is on target to clear the
remaining stock before the end of 2008.
6.
The government increased retail prices of petroleum products in May 2008. The
prices per liter were increased from D28 to D32 for diesel, from D30 to D33 for petrol, and
from D21 to D26 for kerosene. Petrol and diesel prices were last increased in January 2006,
and kerosene in June 2007. The government is committed to adjusting the prices as needed to
avoid burdening the budget by subsidizing these products. However, kerosene will continue
to be cross-subsidized by the other products.
7.
Growth in broad money slowed down significantly in 2007 and through May 2008.
Growth fell from 26 percent in 2006 to 7 percent in 2007 as a result of improved government
finances. Credit to the private sector was stagnant during most of 2007. Reserve money
contracted by 4 percent in 2007 after expanding by 24 percent in 2006, and fell further by 6
percent in the first half of 2008. In March 2008, in response to indications of tight liquidity
conditions, and against a backdrop of falling inflation, the CBG reduced the unremunerated
statutory minimum reserve requirement of banks from 16 percent to 14 percent.
8.
Since the sharp appreciation during the third quarter of 2007, fluctuation of the dalasi
in response to changing supply and demand conditions in the foreign exchange market has
become more pronounced. The dalasi appreciated by 32 percent by end-September 2007
against the U.S. dollar, mainly due to a change in market sentiments when many banks
decided to unwind their long net open positions at the same time during August and
September 2007. However, a reversal of the trend occurred during the fourth quarter 2007
when the dalasi depreciated by 18 percent. The CBG acted to restore stability by actively
intervening in the market during August-November. Against a backdrop of strong inflow of
remittances, less need for foreign exchange to service debt (due to debt relief), and tight
liquidity conditions, the dalasi appreciated by 8 percent during the first half of 2008.
9.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) widened from
11½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 12½ percent in 2007. The current account deficits were
financed largely by inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2007, FDI included
US$28.5 million in privatization proceeds, reflecting part payment (out of a total of US$35
million) for the sale of 50 percent of GAMTEL.

37
10.
The financial sector is relatively sound and competition has been increasing. With the
entry of two new banks since October 2007, there are now ten commercial banks operating in
The Gambia and two more have been granted approval-in-principle. Generally, the banks are
profitable and adequately capitalized. However, their gross earnings in 2007 were
significantly lower than in 2006, reflecting, in large part, revaluation losses associated with
the marked appreciation of the dalasi. The risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio has stayed in
the 22–23 percent range since the first quarter of 2007, against the minimum requirement of
8 percent. Nonperforming loans fell during the first quarter of 2008 to 10 percent of gross
loans (compared to about 13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007) as banks have been
making serious efforts in loan recovery and in restructuring loans. In order to satisfy the
demand for an Islamic instrument, the CBG introduced the short-dated Sharia-compliant
Sukuk Al-Salaam in November 2007.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
11.
All the quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2008 were met (Table A1).
New external loans contracted during October 2007-March 2008 amounted to
US$10.9 million in net present value terms, compared to an indicative target of
US$20.7 million.
12.
Four out of eight structural performance criteria were met (Table A2). Of the rest, two
(submission of special audit reports on program monetary data by December 2007 and June
2008) were implemented with a slight delay, while the others were only partially met. As was
the case in earlier reviews, the delays on the special audit reports reflected delays
experienced by the external auditor in obtaining confirmations from some of the CBG’s
correspondent banks abroad.
13.
With respect to the establishment of a central register of capital expenditure
commitments, information was collected in different formats and varying degrees of
completeness for individual projects. A uniform format has now been adopted and
information gaps are being filled. Completion of the register has been established as a prior
action for completion of the third review (Table A2).
14.
A credit reference bureau has been established but is not yet fully operational. Banks
are providing information to the Bureau but concerns about the legal basis for sharing
information have slowed down implementation of the project. The Financial Institutions Act
(2003) prohibits the sharing of information on individual customers of banks. The Act is
under review, inter alia, to address this shortcoming. In view of uncertainty about the
legislative calendar, this performance criterion has been reset to end-March 2009 to provide a
realistic timeframe for implementation.
15.
On the basis of the remedial actions that the government and the CBG have taken, the
government requests waivers for the non-observance of the four performance criteria
indicated above.

38
16.
With respect to structural benchmarks, there has been a delay in the submission of the
Auditor-General’s report on the government’s 2000-04 accounts to the national assembly
(scheduled for end-December 2007). In January 2008, the Auditor-General provided an
interim report to the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DoSFEA) to
allow the Treasury Directorate an opportunity to respond to some queries and correct
portions of the accounts. DoSFEA responded in May, and the Auditor-General now expects
to complete a review and submit his final report to the national assembly by end-October
2008.
17.
Work is progressing well on rebasing the national accounts to 2004 prices and on
beginning to estimate GDP by the expenditure approach. Full implementation of this
benchmark is now expected by end-September 2008.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
18.
The government’s medium-term objectives and strategy are contained in The
Gambia’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II). PRSP II, which covers 200711, provides the framework for poverty reduction efforts in The Gambia and also sets the
development agenda towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.
Strategic priorities include: (i) macroeconomic stability and effective public resource
management; (ii) promotion of pro-poor growth and employment through private sector
development; and (iii) improved provision of basic social services. Successful
implementation of PRSP II requires significant strengthening of capacity in the civil service,
improvements in the budget process (formulation, monitoring), and the mobilization of
highly concessional external resources.
19.
A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) led by the World Bank was approved
by the government in August 2007, following the validation of its findings by stakeholders. It
found that re-export trade (on which a large part of the economy and public finances depend)
was in decline as a result of The Gambia losing some of the advantages which made it an
attractive regional entrepot. In particular, harmonization of imports and sales taxes in the
region and improvements in ports and customs operations in Senegal and other neighboring
countries have eroded The Gambia’s competitive edge. The DTIS contains a wide range of
recommendations to enhance The Gambia’s international competitiveness through sectorspecific reforms and cross-cutting measures to improve the investment climate. Key areas of
focus include infrastructure (e.g., transport, energy), tourism, and agricultural export
diversification. The government is seeking funding to implement the highest priority
recommendations of the DTIS, including those related to reinforcing trade facilitation
services.
20.
The Gambia has preserved macroeconomic stability in the last two and a half years
with strong growth, relatively low inflation, and adequate international reserves. The
government will continue to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies in the face of

39
challenging global economic and financial conditions. The main objectives and assumptions
underlying the medium term macroeconomic framework are:
•

real GDP growth rates of 5.5–6.5 percent a year;

•

inflation below 6 percent;

•

basic fiscal balance surpluses of 1–2 percent of GDP;

•

a reduction in government’s domestic debt from 28 percent at end-2007 to 16 percent
at end-2010;

•

external current account deficits (including official transfers) around 10 percent of
GDP; and

•

international reserves equivalent to 4–5 months of imports.

21.
The baseline scenario takes into account the importance of preserving fiscal
discipline, containing inflation, and ensuring the sustainability of the external current
account. It seeks to reduce the burden of domestic debt to ease upward pressure on interest
rates and create fiscal space for poverty-reducing expenditures. The current account path
reflects the medium-term projections of capital inflows.
22.
Resources freed by debt relief under the HIPC and MDR Initiatives will be used to
increase poverty-reducing expenditures, in line with PRSP II priorities. They will be
allocated among various uses, including increased social sector expenditures, reduced
domestic debt, and civil service pay and pension reform.
23.
The government has established a Task Force to prepare recommendations for a
comprehensive civil service reform program for The Gambia, drawing on studies supported
by the World Bank and other donors. The main aim of the reform is to rebuild the capacity of
the civil service to formulate and implement policies needed for effective delivery of public
services. A heavy loss of professional and managerial staff has undermined the effectiveness
of the civil service. To reverse this, the reform program is expected to address issues related
to pay and benefits, as well as career development. In the short run (within one year), the
reform will focus on pay reform, developing a pension reform strategy, and strengthening
payroll and establishment controls. Over the medium-term (2–5 years), activities will include
functional review of all departments, overhaul of job descriptions and schemes of service,
and implementation of the pension reform.
24.
The CBG will continue to take steps to promote the development and deepening of
the financial sector. The CBG will encourage competition among financial institutions in
order to lower interest rate spreads, increase the provision of services, expand the branch
network in all parts of the country, and enhance growth and development. The CBG has
taken a number of legal initiatives to promote a safe and vibrant financial system in The
Gambia. To that end, it: (1) is preparing a draft Banking Act to replace the Financial

40
Institutions Act 2003; (2) has prepared a new Non-Bank Financial Institutions Bill to
encourage nonbanks to provide financial services; (3) has proposed amendments to Mortgage
and Sheriff Acts that will reduce legal risks for banks, thereby promoting lending to the
private sector. The CBG Board also has approved two new initiatives to promote foreign
exchange operations. They are: (1) a code of conduct of foreign exchange market operators;
and (2) establishing a system of market makers in foreign exchange, similar to the primary
market dealership in treasury bills. The CBG will continue to implement the Prompt
Corrective Action (PCA) framework, introduced in March 2007, to guide and help troubled
banks. The CBG is setting up a new Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to combat money
laundering.
V. POLICIES FOR THE REST OF 2008
25.
A major challenge for economic management in the second half of 2008 will be
coping with the impact of rising world food and oil prices. Thus far, appreciation of the
dalasi has helped contain the impact of the price increases. At the same time, it has adversely
affected the prospects for the upcoming tourist season.
A. Fiscal policy
26.
Revenue is broadly on track to meet the targets set in the government’s 2008 budget.
On the expenditure side, efforts will be made to speed up the disbursements for externally
financed capital expenditures. The government may consider expanding social programs
(e.g., school feeding program) to mitigate the impact of rising world food prices on the poor.
27.
Preparation for the 2009 budget has begun with the issuance of the call circular in
June. Key elements of the preparations will include government decisions on civil service
and pension reforms. The government is also in discussions with the AfDB, EU, and the
World Bank for assistance in the form of budget support.
28.
The CBG and DoSFEA have enhanced their coordination of fiscal and monetary
policies. Further to signing a memorandum of understanding last year to guide domestic debt
management and monetary operations, the government has undertaken the following to
strengthen the CBG’s financial position and its ability to conduct monetary policy. It will:
(1) take over a nonperforming loan of the CBG to the Gambia National Petroleum
Corporation of D136.9 million and clear the loan within four years at equal installments with
the first one beginning in the last quarter of 2008; (2) continue to replenish the CBG’s capital
by D20 million each year to the total of D100 million; of which, contributions for 2006–07
and half of the amount for 2008 have already been made; (3) reach agreement with the CBG
in the near future on the timing and the amount of replenishment of the treasury bill special
deposit account. Currently, this account has a very low balance, thereby limiting the CBG’s
options to conduct monetary policy. DoSFEA and the CBG will agree on concrete proposals
by end–October 2008.

41
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
29.
The CBG will continue to use a money targeting framework to pursue its price
stability objective. It will also use its rediscount rate to signal changes in its policy stance. In
setting the rediscount rate, the CBG will analyze developments in the economy and the
inflation outlook. It will strengthen the short-term liquidity forecasting framework through
efforts to improve forecasts of government revenues and expenditures.
30.
The exchange rate of the dalasi is market determined. The CBG will intervene in the
foreign exchange market from time to time to: (1) accumulate foreign reserve assets to meet
targets or prevent reserves from being depleted, which is essential to build investor
confidence and strengthen the government’s debt repayment capacity and external liquidity
conditions; (2) correct misalignment of the exchange rate of the domestic currency; and
(3) calm disorderly markets, including exchange rate volatility and market illiquidity.
31.
The second half of 2008 will be a challenging period for monetary policy making as
The Gambia faces the impact of the increase in international food and oil prices. CBG policy
will continue to be based on maintaining price stability. The CBG will use all the available
instruments at its disposal to reach this goal.
C. External Debt
32.
The HIPC and MDRI relief has significantly reduced The Gambia’s external debt
burden. In net present value terms, the stock of debt fell from $439 million (68 percent of
GDP) to $165 million (24 percent of GDP) at end-2007. Paris Club creditors have confirmed
that they will provide the debt relief they promised. The government is making efforts to
obtain debt relief from all non-Paris Club bilateral creditors.
33.
The government is committed to the careful management of external debt to maintain
external stability. To this end, it promotes a strategy of donor engagement and prudent debt
management to attain PRSP priorities without compromising debt sustainability. It will be
prudent with new borrowing and will respect the indicative targets for 2008 ($50 million)
under the program. The limit for 2009 ($25 million) will be revisited in the context of
program reviews, which will take into account the result of the government’s own debt
sustainability analysis (DSA). Support is being sought from the Commonwealth Secretariat
for technical assistance to undertake a DSA and to build capacity. Results of the DSA are
expected by October 2008. The government will also ensure that new loans have a minimum
grant element of 45 percent.
34.
The results of the DSA will feed into the design of a national debt management
strategy which will be prepared by end-February 2009. The strategy will be in line with best
international practice and will incorporate the following principles: (1) a clear definition of
debt management objectives; (2) a well-defined institutional framework; (3) an adequate

42
mechanism to prevent the accumulation of arrears and monitor contingent liabilities; and
(4) a commitment to implement cost effective cash management policies.
D. PRSP II Implementation and Aid Effectiveness
35.
PRSP II was the focus of a Round Table Conference on The Gambia held in London
in February 2008. The government has established mechanisms to monitor and analyze
progress implementing PRSP II. In particular, the government has prepared a Results Matrix
providing quantitative indicators and targets that can be matched to development results.
A draft of the Annual Poverty Report for 2007 has been completed, and a final version will
be published after it has been validated by stakeholders. A draft of the Poverty Reduction
Expenditure Report for 2007 is also under preparation, and is expected to be finalized by
end-August 2008.
36.
Under the government’s ownership and leadership, an in-country Development
Partners Coordination and Consultation Mechanism has been established under the
Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs. This mechanism is
to facilitate and deepen development dialogue with The Gambia’s partners, bring about
positive changes to aid practices, and encourage more effective use of aid resources for
greater development impact for the implementation of PRSP II.
37.
At the first consultation and coordination meeting held in April 2008, the government
presented to its development partners a draft Aid Effectiveness Action Plan. The Action Plan
adapted the Paris Declaration principles of Ownership, Alignment, Harmonization,
Management for Results, and Mutual Accountability to the situation of The Gambia. The
meeting noted the positive steps taken by some multilateral donors to have a joint Country
Assistance Strategy for The Gambia and called on other development partners to develop
similar joint and harmonized programming activities for the country. Consultation and
coordination meetings will be held quarterly. At the next meeting, the Aid Effectiveness
Action Plan will be finalized. The government informed development partners of plans to
hold sector specific consultation and coordination meetings starting with Health and
Education in the course of 2008.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING AND ACCESS LEVEL
38.
The program will continue to be monitored based on agreed quantitative targets
(Table A1), a set of structural performance criteria and benchmarks (Table A3), and program
reviews. The quantitative financial targets for end–September 2008 and end–March 2009 are
performance criteria; and those for end–December 2008, and end–June 2009 are indicative
targets. The fourth and fifth program reviews are scheduled to be completed by end–January
2009 and end–July 2009, respectively. Definition of all targeted variables and reporting
requirements are contained in the attached technical memorandum of understanding (TMU).

43
39.
The CBG has strengthened its internal control and audit. In lieu of the special audits,
the CBG proposes to implement alternative measures that would provide assurances to the
IMF that financial controls at the CBG have been strengthened. These measures include:
(1) preparation of pro-forma financial statements for 2007 based on the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which should be reviewed by the CBG’s external
auditor, and (2) internal audit reports verifying the accuracy of monetary program data for
test dates (September 2008 and March 2009). As the contract of the current external auditors
expired after the audit of the 2007 financial statements, the CBG and the Auditor-General
(who is responsible for appointing the CBG’s external auditor) are discussing an audit
rotation and selection policy appropriate for The Gambia’s circumstances (few options
available locally).
40.
To ensure effective monitoring of program implementation, the PRGF Monitoring
Committee, headed by the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs will continue
to meet regularly to review performance under the program. It will also ensure that data are
reported to the IMF as per the schedule agreed in the TMU and will provide any other
information deemed necessary or requested by IMF staff in order to monitor the program.
The committee will also take remedial actions in the event there are gaps or delays in
reporting reliable statistics.
41.
The government will monitor the impact of rising world food and oil prices on The
Gambia’s balance of payments in the coming months. If the balance of payments deteriorates
significantly on account of adverse price developments, the government may request an
augmentation of the level of access to IMF resources under the PRGF arrangement. The
government intends to take this up with the next review mission, currently scheduled for
October/November 2008.
VII. REQUESTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FSAP
42.
The government is grateful for the technical assistance that the IMF has provided to
The Gambia. It welcomes the resumption of assistance in public financial management with
the appointment of a new regional advisor based in Liberia whose work will complement the
work of other macro-fiscal and debt management experts in DoSFEA, who are being
supported under an AfDB technical assistance grant.
43.
The government and the CBG welcome the continuation of assistance on financial,
balance of payments, and national accounts statistics. The government requests that the IMF
provide assistance to the Gambia Bureau of Statistics in the compilation of producer prices.
44.
Technical assistance from the IMF has also contributed to the strengthening of
banking supervision at the CBG. In view of the increasing number of banks and the
introduction of new products in the financial sector, we request The Gambia be considered
for an FSAP.

Attachment II
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
(July 2008–September 2008)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Gambian authorities and
staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, structural performance criteria, and structural
benchmarks that will be used to monitor the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)supported program covering the period of 2007–09. It also sets out the related reporting
requirements and describes the adjusters that will be applied to certain quantitative
performance criteria of the program.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank
2.
Definition: The net domestic assets of the CBG are defined as the difference between
reserve money and the net foreign assets of the CBG. Reserve money is defined as the sum of
currency issued by the CBG (i.e., currency in circulation) and the deposits of commercial
banks at the CBG. Net foreign assets are defined as foreign assets minus foreign liabilities.
Foreign assets and foreign liabilities are defined as claims on nonresidents and liabilities to
nonresidents, respectively.
3.
For program monitoring purposes, in the calculation of the net domestic assets of the
CBG, foreign assets and liabilities will be converted first into U.S. dollars at the prevailing
cross-rates and then converted into dalasi using the D/USD program exchange rate of 22.
This is an accounting exchange rate only and should not be construed as a projection.
4.
Adjuster: The net domestic assets of the CBG will be adjusted upward (downward)
by the dalasi equivalent of the extent to which actual receipts fall short of (exceed) the
projected level of privatization receipts.
5.
Supporting material: Net domestic assets of the central bank will be transmitted as
part of the balance sheet of the CBG (compiled based on the TMU rate) on a monthly basis
within four weeks of the end of each month. For analytical purposes, the balance sheet of the
CBG compiled on a current-rate basis will also be submitted.
6.
Supporting material: The CBG will report data on privatization receipts in the
currency it is received in as well as equivalent amounts in U.S. dollars and in dalasis on a
monthly basis within two weeks of the end of the month. The Department of State for

48
Finance and Economic Affairs (DoSFEA) will report data on a monthly basis within two
week of the end of the month on expenditures made from the privatization receipts.
B. Basic Balance of the Central Government
7.
Definition: The basic balance of the central government is defined as revenue (tax
and nontax) minus total expenditure and net lending, excluding externally financed capital
expenditure. Central government excludes local and regional governments and public
enterprises.
8.
Supporting material: Reporting on the basic balance will form part of the
consolidated budget report described in paragraph 30 below.
C. New External Payments Arrears of the Central Government
9.
Definition: External payments arrears are defined as the stock of external arrears on
loans contracted or guaranteed by the central government, except on debts subject to
rescheduling or a stock of debt operation. Debts subject to rescheduling include debts
covered under traditional mechanisms (bilateral creditors, such as the Paris Club members)
or HIPC. External payments arrears occur when undisputed interest and amortization
payments on the above-referenced loans are not made within the terms of the debt contract or
in conformity with the terms for interim relief provided under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
This performance criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.
10.
Supporting material: An accounting of nonreschedulable external arrears (if any) by
creditor countries, with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within
four weeks of the end of each month. This accounting would include, separately, arrears
owed by the central government and other public sector entities to Paris Club and non-ParisClub creditors.
D. Net Usable International Reserves of the Central Bank of The Gambia
11.
Definition: Net usable international reserves (NIR) of the CBG are defined as the
difference between usable reserve assets and reserve liabilities. Usable reserve assets are
readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They
include the CBG holdings of SDRs, foreign currency cash, foreign currency securities,
deposits abroad, and the country’s reserve position at the IMF. Excluded are any assets that
are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, claims on residents, claims in foreign
exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and options), precious metals, assets in nonconvertible currencies,
and illiquid assets (including capital shares in international organizations). Reserve liabilities
are all foreign exchange liabilities to residents and nonresidents, including commitments to
sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and
options), and all credit outstanding from the IMF.

49
12.
Adjuster: Net usable international reserves of the CBG will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the extent to which actual receipts in foreign currency exceed (fall short of)
the projected level of privatization receipts in foreign currency.
13.
Supporting material: End-month data on net usable international reserves of the
CBG will be transmitted within seven days of the end of each month. The CBG will identify
the U.S. dollar equivalent of privatization receipts within net usable international reserves as
a memorandum item.
E. New Nonconcessional Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Central Government with Original Maturity of More Than one Year
14.
Definition: This target refers to new nonconcessional external debt with original
maturity of more than one year contracted or guaranteed by the central government. It applies
not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000
(Decision No. 12274–00/85), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received. Excluded from this target are loans or purchases from the IMF
and debts with a grant element of at least 45 percent.
1
15.
Also excluded are two loans from the OPEC Fund for International Development
with grant elements of 39.5 percent each, which were approved in the first half of 2007.

16.
Supporting material: A comprehensive record, including a loan-by-loan accounting
of all new concessional and nonconcessional debt contracted or guaranteed by the central
government with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within four
weeks of the end of each quarter. Nonconcessional external debt over one year includes
financial leases and other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, on nonconcessional terms.
F. Outstanding Stock of External Public Debt with Original
Maturity of One Year or Less
17.
Definition: This target refers to the stock of outstanding external public sector debt
with original maturity of one year or less, owed or guaranteed by the central government. 2
1

A loan is concessional if its grant element is at least 35 percent, calculated on the basis of the commercial
interest reference rates (CIRR) and following the methodology set out in staff paper on Limits on External Debt
or Borrowing in Fund Arrangements – Proposed Change in Implementation of the Revised Guidelines
approved by the IMF Executive Board on April 15, 1996.

2

The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000 (Decision No.
12274–00/85).

50
Public sector consists of the central and regional governments and other public agencies,
including the CBG. Excluded from this target are normal import-related credits.

Supporting material: A comprehensive record of all external debt with original
maturity of less than one year owed or contracted by the public sector, with detailed
explanations, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within four weeks of the end of each
quarter.
III. QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Domestic Budgetary Arrears
19.
Definition: Domestic budgetary arrears are defined as the sum of all bills that have
been received by a central government spending unit or line ministry under the recurrent
expenditure budget (including rents and utilities) or the development expenditure budget, and
for which payment has not been made within 30 days. Arrears can be cleared in cash or
through debt swaps.
20.
Supporting material: A comprehensive record of all domestic budgetary arrears,
with detailed explanations, will be transmitted on a quarterly basis within four weeks of the
end of each quarter.
B. Net Present Value of New Contracted External Debt
21.
Definition: The net present value (NPV) of new external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the government from October 2007 onward is calculated by discounting the
future stream of payments of debt service due by the country-specific commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) as published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). The new external debt will be measured by the U.S. dollar nominal
sum of all loan agreements that have been contracted. Disbursed debt will be converted to
U.S. dollars, based on prevailing WEO test date exchange rates; for loans contracted but not
yet disbursed, the profile disbursement will be measured at the actual exchange rate at the
test date, based on the projected drawdown consistent with the medium-term fiscal
framework as discussed with the Fund staff.
22.
Supporting material:. Data on the NPV of the stock of outstanding external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the government since October 2007 will be provided on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
THE GAMBIA
Update on Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Hugh Bredenkamp and Mark Plant
August 20, 2008
The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) confirms that The Gambia remains at high
risk of debt distress after receiving HIPC and MDRI debt relief. In particular, the NPV of
external debt-to-exports ratio remains above its threshold of 100 percent and standard stress
tests show that The Gambia remains vulnerable to shocks to GDP and the exchange rate. The
fiscal DSA shows public debt declining due to recent fiscal consolidation.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the last DSA presented to the Fund
Board in December 2007 at The Gambia’s completion point. This update was prepared by
IMF staff and reviewed by staff of the World Bank. The DSA is based on debt and debt
service data reconciled for the completion point under the HIPC/MDRI initiative. These data
were updated to reflect newly available debt data and a revised macroeconomic framework
resulting from the 2008 Article IV consultation.
2.
The Gambia reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
and qualified for debt relief under the MDRI on December 19, 2007. At the end of 2006,
prior to completion point, the stock of nominal external public debt was US$676.7 million
(133.6 percent of GDP). Multilateral creditors accounted for 84 percent of this debt, with
IDA as the largest creditor (39 percent of total outstanding debt). At end-2007, postcompletion point, the stock of external public debt fell to US$299.4 million (46.5 percent of
GDP). In January 2008, Paris Club creditors agreed to cancel outstanding claims
(US$13 million in NPV terms at end-2006) on The Gambia. Bilateral agreements have been
signed with Paris Club creditors France and Norway and agreement has been reached with
non-Paris Club creditor Kuwait. Agreements on the delivery of debt relief are still pending
with Paris Club creditors Austria, the Netherlands, and the EU-IDA and with non-Paris Club
creditors the Saudi Fund for Development, Taiwan Province of China, Libya, China, and

The last DSA was presented to the Fund Executive Board on December 19, 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 08/109,
Appendix I) and to the World Bank Executive Board on December 20, 2007 (Enhanced HIPC Completion Point Document
and MDRI, Report No. 41413-GM).

India. HIPC debt relief has been or is in the process of being delivered by all multilateral
creditors with the exception of ECOWAS, which to date has not participated in the HIPC
Initiative. 2
Box 1: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
The medium-term assumptions in the baseline scenario are consistent with the IMF PRGF
supported program. Key macroeconomic assumptions include continued robust growth,
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, investment in infrastructure and tourism, and a scaling
up of donor assistance.
Real GDP growth averaged 6½ percent over the past five years and is projected to remain at
5½ to 6 percent out to 2013. The main drivers of growth are expected to be tourism,
construction, telecommunications, and banking. Inflation is projected to decline gradually
from 6 percent in 2008 to 4 percent over the medium-term. This assumes the authorities
maintain tight monetary policy to adjust to high food and energy costs over the medium to
long-term.
Growth of exports of goods and services is expected to be driven by tourism and agricultural
exports. Re-exports are expected to decline as a share of GDP as tariff harmonization and
improvements in neighboring countries erode The Gambia’s competitive advantage. Export
growth is expected to average 6¼ percent from 2008–2013 while import growth is expected
to average 9¼ percent over the same period. Official transfers are expected to gradually
recover to 3–4 percent of GDP over the medium-term. FDI is expected to remain strong while
official loans fall from a peak of 4½ percent of GDP in 2009 to about 1–2 percent of GDP
over the medium- to long-term. The non-interest current account deficit is projected to
gradually declines from a peak of 14 percent of GDP in 2008 to 11 percent of GDP in 2012
and 6¼ percent of GDP in 2027.
The primary fiscal balance is projected to decline from a surplus of 5½ percent of GDP in
2007 to close to zero in 2027. The surplus is expected to drop in the near term due to a
recovery in capital expenditures. Over the long-term, tax revenues are projected to remain
close to 20 percent of GDP while poverty reducing expenditures are boosted in line with the
fall in debt service payments. Donor support, including program and project assistance is
expected to remain robust over the medium-term. Grant financing is expected to remain in the
region of 3–4 percent of GDP over the medium-term before falling to an average of 2 percent
over 2013–27. The grant element of new external borrowing is projected to remain at
45 percent.

The debt relief agreement with the Islamic Development Bank has been negotiated and is in the process of
being signed.

3
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
3.
Under the baseline scenario, all but one of the NPV of debt indicators will
remain below their corresponding thresholds for 2008–27 as a result of the
HIPC/MDRI relief (Table 1 and Figure 1). 3 The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio falls to
22 percent in 2008—declining 3 percentage points from the predicted level at completion
point as a result of delayed loan disbursements. New borrowing associated with increased
investment raises the NPV of debt-to-GDP through 2012 before it declines as investment
levels off and growth is sustained. The NPV of debt-to-revenue and the debt service ratios
fall considerably beneath their respective thresholds. While they too increase through 2012,
they remain at comfortable levels throughout the projection period.
4.
The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches the debt-burden threshold for a
protracted period. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio declined significantly to 114 percent in
2007 following full impact of HIPC and MDRI, but this is still above the indicative policydependent threshold of 100 percent. Furthermore, this ratio increases through 2012 due to
new borrowing, and it stays above the threshold for a protracted period. It gradually
gravitates towards the threshold over the medium term, due to sustained growth in receipts
from tourism, re-export services, and agricultural exports.

As outlined in the HIPC completion point DSA, outstanding debt at end-2007 before completion point is
estimated at NPV US$439 million. Following completion point, HIPC assistance reduces the NPV of existing
debt by US$92 million while MDRI results in an additional US$182.1 million reduction.

4
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
5.
Alternative scenarios reveal that external debt indicators are vulnerable to
substantial deterioration under a range of scenarios (Table 2, Figure 1).
•

Under the “less favorable terms” scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP deteriorates above
its threshold emphasizing the need for the authorities to refrain from non-concessional
borrowing. With the exception of the debt service indicators, which remain beneath their
thresholds, the debt stock indicators all deteriorate significantly under this scenario.

•

If the US dollar GDP deflator is below its historical average, the debt-to-GDP, debt-toexports, and debt-to-revenues ratios all deteriorate significantly.

•

A combination of adverse economic shocks (i.e. lower growth and exports) would also
result in a significant rise in debt ratios.

•

Table 2 (line B6) demonstrates the deterioration in the debt-to-GDP ratio as a result of
an exchange rate depreciation. In particular, a one-time 30 percent depreciation results in
the debt-to-GDP ratio breaching the 30 percent threshold for much of the projection
period. This scenario serves to illustrate the importance of recent exchange rate
appreciation on the baseline debt-to-GDP ratio. If this appreciation is not permanent,
debt-to-GDP will rise above the indicative threshold in the near term despite HIPC and
MDRI relief.
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
C. Baseline

6.
Domestic debt is expected to fall from 30.7 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to
13.8 percent of GDP in 2012 and to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2027, reflecting sustained
good fiscal performance. Recently fiscal performance has been aided by reforms to tax
administration that are expected to maintain revenues close to 21 percent of GDP. Relatively
restrained fiscal policy, as programmed for the medium term, should help lower domestic
interest rates. Over the long term, the delivery of external debt relief and lower domestic
interest rates should provide fiscal space to increase basic primary expenditures 4 and offset a
decline in externally-financed projects as a percent of GDP.
7.
The NPV of public debt is projected to decline from about 56.0 percent of GDP
in 2007 to 42.3 percent in 2012 and to 29.9 percent in 2027 (Table 3 and Figure 2). The
biggest factor in the near term is a fall in the domestic debt. As a ratio of domestic revenues,

4

Defined as expenditures excluding interest payments and externally-financed projects.

5
the NPV of public debt is projected to fall from about 257 percent in 2007 to 141 percent at
the end of the projection period.
D. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
8.
Stress tests indicate that public debt ratios are sensitive to a depreciation in the
near term and a shock to GDP growth in the long term, but not to most other adverse
shocks (Table 4 and Figure 2).
•

Under a permanently lower output growth rate (4.3 percent instead of 5 percent), the
NPV of total debt-to-GDP ratio would decline from 56 percent in 2007 to 48 percent in
2027, as opposed to declining to 30 percent under the baseline scenario. Similarly, the
NPV of debt-to-revenues would be 219 percent in 2027 compared to 136 under the
baseline and the debt service-to-revenue ratio would increase from 11 to 19 percent of
GDP.

•

With a one-time 30 percent depreciation in 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from
50 percent to 63 percent and the debt-to-revenue ratio would rise from 217 percent to
271 percent in 2008 compared with the baseline. However, the effects would be
mitigated over time and these ratios would not be significantly worse than under the
baseline in 2027.

•

In contrast, the outlook for public debt is not sensitive to shocks to the primary balance,
a combination of shocks to growth and the primary balance, or a ten percent increase in
other debt-creating flows. Under none of these scenarios does the debt-to-GDP or debtto-revenue ratio rise much above the baseline in 2008–2009 or out to 2027.

•

Because the primary balance was close to balance in 2007, the alternative scenario based
on the primary balance being unchanged would result in a rapid decline in The Gambia’s
public debt ratios with all debt eliminated by 2020.
IV. CONCLUSION

9.
The Gambia is at high risk of debt distress based on external debt burden
indicators. The Gambia’s debt situation has improved since the last DSA due to an
improvement in the overall fiscal balance in 2007 and a decline in new borrowing. But given
continuing risks, it will be important for the authorities’ to finalize and implement the
planned national debt strategy as soon as possible. Staff recommend that new borrowing be
on highly concessional terms and that the authorities exercise restraint in contracting new
loans. The major risks to debt sustainability include lower than expected economic and/or
export growth, higher than expected new borrowing, or a deterioration in fiscal performance.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards assessments
An update Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) was conducted
in November 2006. This update assessment was performed against the backdrop of previous
safeguards findings, which identified significant vulnerabilities in the CBG’s safeguards
framework. While the CBG has instituted a series of control reforms since that assessment, a
key challenge looking forward is to build on existing progress to strengthen remaining
vulnerabilities in the CBG’s safeguards framework, including controls over international
reserves and procedures for extending credit to the government. The update assessment,
completed in February 10, 2007, recommended certain priority actions to be taken, including
semi-annual audits of monetary program data, the implementation of segregation of duties in
the reserves management function, a phased implementation of International Financial
Reporting Standards, and an action plan to ensure that government borrowing from the CBG
is brought within the statutory limits. The CBG is progressively implementing these
recommendations.
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling
at a rate of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was
introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. Effective
June 30, 2002, the exchange rate arrangement of The Gambia was reclassified from
independently floating to managed float with no preannounced path. As of end–June 2008,
the midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D20.651 per U.S. dollar. The
Gambia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The Gambia maintains exchange restrictions for security
reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been notified to the Fund for
approval under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
The Gambia has been part of the exchange rate mechanism of the West African Monetary
Zone (WAMZ) since April 2002.
Last Article IV consultation
The Executive Board concluded the 2006 Article IV consultation on October 13, 2006.
Technical assistance
The Fund has been providing The Gambia with extensive technical assistance in
macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary areas, and in improving the compilation of
macroeconomic statistics. Specific technical assistance projects are the following:

The Gambia: Relations with the African Development Bank
(As of June 20, 2008)
The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group began lending to The Gambia in 1974. As of
March 31, 2008, it had approved 54 operations with total commitments (net of cancellations)
of UA205.8 million (US$338.4 million) in the following sectors: transport (25 percent);
agriculture (21.7 percent); social (24.6 percent); public utilities (12.1 percent); multisectoral
(8.8 percent); environment (5.8 percent); and industry (2.0 percent). 16 About 84.8 percent of
the Bank Group’s net commitments were made from the resources of the African
Development Fund (ADF), 8.6 percent from the AfDB nonconcessional window, and
6.6 percent from the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF).
As of June 20, 2008, 41 operations had been completed, 2 were cancelled at the
government’s request, and 11 others continue, including 3 multinational projects, all in
agriculture. Implementation of the portfolio is generally satisfactory; it achieved a rating
score of 2.01 (on a scale from 0 to 3) during the Bank Group’s 2006 portfolio review. The
portfolio has a relatively low project-at-risk (PAR) rate of 33.3 percent, which compares well
with the Bank-wide average of 43 percent as indicated in the AfDB’s 2004 Annual Portfolio
Performance Review (APPR). Total disbursement rates for the portfolio are also satisfactory.
By June 20, 2008, they were 89.1 percent (overall), 100 percent (AfDB-financed projects),
89.3 percent (ADF), and 72 percent (NTF). The disbursement rate for the ongoing portfolio
was 53 percent as of June 20, 2008. The satisfactory performance of the portfolio is
attributed to more frequent supervision missions conducted by the AfDB, especially
since 2003.
The AfDB is also a major participant in The Gambia’s enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative program, under which it is due to grant debt relief of
US$15.8 million in net present value (NPV) terms (23.6 percent of total debt relief under the
program). Of this, $6.3 million in end-1999 NPV has been paid as interim relief.
Additionally, MDRI relief from the AfDB will yield annual debt service savings (net of
HIPC assistance) averaging US$1.6 million over the next 5 years and US$3.9 million over
the following 39 years.
The AfDB has recently prepared a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) with the World Bank to
cover 2008–11. The JAS is based on two main pillars—(1) strengthening the institutional
framework for economic management and public service delivery, and (2) enhancing growth
and competitiveness and the productive capacity of the poor. The JAS will help support the
Government’s national priorities through the main channels of budget and project support in
the context of growth poles and enhanced service delivery. The strategy was approved at the

UA stands for unit of account = 1 SDR (equivalent to about $1.6445 as of March 31, 2008).

11
World Bank in February 2008 and at the AfDB in March 2008. The JAS is anchored to the
Gambia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper PRSP II (2007–2011) and will be supported by
new lending and by the ongoing portfolio, which is summarized in Table 2. Table 1 below
describes some of the recent projects in the portfolio:

(DOSFEA), National Audit Office (NAO),
and SPACO.

Under ADF–10 and ADF–11, The Gambia is a grants-only recipient. Additional resources
can be made available if there is improvement in both performance under the Country
Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and portfolio performance.
The AfDB’s strategy is implemented through both lending and nonlending activities.
Lending activities will comprise project finance and budget support. Nonlending
intervention is designed to strengthen policy dialogue between the government and
stakeholders and focuses mainly on studies, funded through grants, to improve governance,
mainstream gender, enhance efficiency of infrastructure, and improve the energy supply.
The AfDB prepared a Governance Profile for The Gambia in 2007 and has recently
collaborated with the World Bank and the U.K. Department for International Development
(DfID) in the preparation of a study on Civil Service Reform.

The Gambia: Statistical Issues
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the
authorities have made some progress in improving the compilation of economic and financial
statistics, substantial shortcomings remain in national accounts, balance of payments, and
external debt statistics. Data reporting to the Fund is somewhat irregular. The country
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), with its metadata last
updated in the second half of 2003.
The National Assembly passed a new Statistics Act in December 2005 and work began in
June 2006 to implement the plan for transforming the Central Statistics Department (CSD)
into The Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS). A Statistics Council and a Statistician General
have already been appointed and efforts are ongoing to fully staff the GBoS. A mission
visited Banjul in February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC, which was published by the Fund in
November 2005.
Real sector
The main constraints to improving national accounts include inadequate source data due to
low response rates of surveys (manufacturing, trade, and business services industries), as
well as poor quality of external data and inattention to other important sources (such as the
household budget survey, livestock census, and census of industrial production). The GBoS
continues to face human and financial constraints to undertake such surveys and process the
data.
STA missions on national accounts in 2007 and March 2008 assisted the GBoS to implement
the 1993 System of National Accounts methodology and rebase the national accounts to
properly reflect the country’s output levels, economic structure and relative prices. In this
context, STA missions have helped the authorities: (1) process the data collected for the 2004
Economic Census; (2) rebase the GDP series using the results of the 2004 Economic Census;
and (3) improve the GDP estimates by the production approach and begin compiling GDP
series by the expenditure approach. The authorities now have a preliminary revised nominal
GDP series compiled by the production approach for the period 2000–07 (with a base year of
2004). GDP series by the expenditure approach are still under review. In May 2007, the
country began participating in the second phase of the GDDG Project for Anglophone Africa
on national accounts, which is funded by the U.K. Department for International Development
(DfID).
The World Bank has been providing technical assistance to the GBoS to update the consumer
price index (CPI) using the 2003 household expenditure survey to better reflect current
consumption patterns. The GBoS began to publish in early 2007 a new national CPI with
representative expenditure basket as of August 2004.

14

Government finance
The authorities release data on central government transactions with a lag of about four
weeks for both revenue and expenditure. The central government accounts for 1991–99 were
not audited until 2005. Inadequacies persist in compiling data on an economic basis and in
tracking foreign-financed expenditure. Monthly data on domestic government financing are
available with a delay of six to eight weeks. At a meeting with STA in October 2007, the
authorities expressed interest in technical assistance to facilitate the migration to GFSM2001.
No data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or
in the IFS.
Monetary data
The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has improved data reporting to the Fund, but
sometimes the reports are delayed. An April–May 2006 STA mission recommended:
expanding the coverage of depository corporations to include credit unions; including
accrued interest in the value of financial instruments; and compiling a financial survey given
the significant influence of the Social Security and Housing Finance Corporation in monetary
developments. To improve the accuracy and classification of government accounts, the
mission designed a supplementary form for reporting government positions at the CBG, to be
reported to the IMF monthly. It also assisted the CBG in the introduction of standardized
report forms (SRFs). A follow-up mission in April/May 2008 made further progress on the
SRFs for reporting data on the central bank and other depository corporations to STA and
establishing an integrated monetary database, which would generate alternative outputs for
use by the CBG, STA, and AFR. The authorities have now prepared a preliminary set of
SRFs.
External sector statistics
Despite recent improvements, balance of payments statistics continue to be affected by
shortcomings. These include long delays in the collection of trade, customs, and tourist
arrival data; crude methods of estimating re-export trade; poor data on capital flows; lack of a
register of firms and establishments engaged in external transactions; poor classification of
balance of payments data; and lack of consistent methodology. Institutional weaknesses have
also been a major impediment to improving statistics. Official grant and loan disbursements
and repayments are generally well recorded, but there are some gaps in project
disbursements.
The CBG produces balance of payments statistics according to the Balance of Payments
Manual, 5th edition (BPM5). These statistics are published in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) and in the 2007 IMF Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY 2007).
The CBG has been compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics through a Fund-

15
administered technical assistance project funded by DfID. The most recent data available are
for the first quarter of 2008.
With DfID assistance the CBG conducted an enterprise survey in March 2006 to collect data
for the international investment position. In April 2006, the CBG also initiated a survey
funded by the World Bank to collect data on selected components of the current account.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
The Gambia
On September 8, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Gambia. 1
Background
Over the last two years, The Gambia has maintained macroeconomic stability, sustained
high growth and made progress toward achieving debt sustainability. Fiscal
performance improved and monetary policy remained geared to maintaining low
inflation. Real GDP growth, which has averaged 6½ percent a year since 2004, has
been led by the construction, tourism and telecommunications sectors, facilitated by a
steady inflow of foreign direct investment. However, performance of the agriculture
sector—critical for achieving the government’s poverty reducing objectives—has been
mixed. In particular, groundnut output fell substantially in the 2007/08 season largely
due to a poor pattern of rainfall.
Inflation has abated after a spike in 2007. Disruptions in the supply of foodstuffs from
neighboring countries and rising import costs pushed the annual rate of inflation from
less than 1 percent in December 2006 to 6-7 percent during most of 2007. In the first
half of 2008, tight monetary policy and the lagged effect of a sharp appreciation of the
dalasi in the third quarter of 2007 helped contain inflationary pressures from increases in
world food and fuel prices. The annual rate of inflation fell to 2 percent in June 2008.
1
1.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral
discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects
economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion,
the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The central government budget improved markedly in 2007, going from an overall deficit
of 7.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007. Total
expenditure and net lending fell sharply, reflecting substantially lower externally financed
capital expenditures than budgeted for 2007. The stock of public domestic debt fell from
32 percent to 28 percent of GDP.
The Gambia’s external current account deficit widened from 11½ percent of GDP in
2006 to 12½ percent in 2007. While the trade balance remained unchanged, an
improvement in the services balance was more than offset by a decline in remittances
and official transfers. The deficits were financed largely by inflows of foreign direct
investment.
The Gambia’s external debt position was helped by the delivery of HIPC and MDRI debt
relief at the end of 2007, resulting in the stock of external debt falling from 110 percent
of GDP to 50 percent. However, The Gambia remains at high risk of debt distress
because of the high level of outstanding debt and the country’s vulnerability to shocks.
The Gambia’s macroeconomic policies are being supported by a three year PRGF
arrangement approved in February 2007. The program’s objectives draw on the
strategic priorities set out in The Gambia’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
which include: (i) macroeconomic stability and effective management of public
resources; (ii) pro-poor growth and employment through development of the private
sector; and (iii) improved provision of basic services.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Gambian authorities for their prudent fiscal and
monetary policies, which have laid a solid foundation for macroeconomic stability.
Despite the increases in world food and fuel prices, growth has remained strong, per
capita GDP has increased significantly, and inflation has been contained at low singledigit levels.
Directors agreed that The Gambia’s major economic challenge will be to sustain strong
growth and continue to reduce poverty, which remains widespread. They encouraged
the authorities to continue prudent macroeconomic policies while boosting povertyreducing government expenditures, in line with the targets in the country’s PRSP, to
make faster progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ measured response to the recent adverse
international price shocks. The sales tax on rice—the principal staple food in the
country—was eliminated to mitigate the impact of its rising cost, while compensating
revenue-raising measures were implemented to safeguard the fiscal position. Directors
commended the authorities for adjusting retail petroleum product prices to avoid budget
subsidization. They recommended that any further support for the most vulnerable
households, if needed, be provided through carefully-targeted programs rather than
through general subsidies.

3
Directors acknowledged the authorities’ solid revenue effort, underpinned by improved
tax administration. They encouraged the authorities to undertake further reforms to
broaden the tax base and make the tax system more buoyant. They suggested that the
authorities review import duty exemptions with a view to reducing their scope. Further
progress in strengthening public financial management will be desirable in order to
ensure that budget formulation is realistic and in line with PRSP priorities.
Directors commended the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) for keeping inflation in
check under challenging circumstances. In view of the uncertainties about the monetary
policy transmission mechanism, most Directors encouraged the CBG to supplement it
money targeting framework with a range of indicators, and to use foreign exchange
operations as an additional instrument to influence domestic liquidity conditions.
Directors agreed that The Gambia’s flexible exchange rate system has served the
country well, with market interventions limited to preventing disorderly adjustment and
replenishing foreign reserves, as needed. They took note of the staff’s assessment that
the real exchange rate of the dalasi appears to be in line with fundamentals. They
encouraged the authorities to take steps to enhance the country’s investment climate
and international competitiveness, by addressing the heavy burden of central and local
government taxation on business, and by investing in infrastructure, education, and
health.
Directors considered that The Gambia’s banking sector is fundamentally sound, while
noting the substantial scope to further deepen financial intermediation. They welcomed
the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the prudential supervision of banks. They looked
forward to the functioning of the national credit reference bureau, which should bolster
the prudent extension of credit and support private sector development and growth.
Directors noted that HIPC and MDRI debt relief provided at end-2007 has improved
significantly The Gambia’s external debt indicators. Nonetheless, The Gambia remains
at high risk of debt distress due to the high level of outstanding debt and the country’s
vulnerability to shocks. Directors urged the authorities to speed up the formulation of a
national debt strategy and to rely primarily on grants to finance their development plans.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review under PRGF Arrangement for
The Gambia and Approves US$3.1 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third
review of The Gambia’s performance under a program supported by a three-year Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review allows
for the disbursement of SDR 2 million (about US$3.1 million), which would bring total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 8 million (about US$12.4 million).
The Executive Board also approved the authorities' request for waivers of nonobservance of
four structural performance criteria concerning the submission of two special audit reports,
the making operational of a credit reference bureau, and the establishment of a central
register of fiscal expenditure commitments.
The PRGF arrangement with The Gambia was approved on February 21, 2007 (see Press
Release No. 07/28) for an amount of SDR 14 million (about US$21.7 million).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:
“The Gambian authorities are to be commended for maintaining macroeconomic stability in
the context of robust growth and moderate inflation. The PRGF-supported economic program
has been implemented satisfactorily, despite the recent increases in world food and fuel
prices.
“Over the medium term, The Gambia will face the challenge of maintaining strong growth
while further reducing poverty and attaining the Millennium Development Goals. To this
end, the authorities are committed to promoting fiscal discipline, private sector growth, and
investment in infrastructure, education, and health. The authorities are advised to consider
steps to improve The Gambia’s international competitiveness through measures to improve
the business climate, such as alleviating the burden of central and local government taxation
on businesses.
“The Gambia has made strong and successful efforts to improve revenues, in particular
through improvements in tax administration. The authorities recognize the need to focus now
on broadening the tax base and making it more buoyant, including by reducing the scope of

2
import duty exemptions. Making further progress in strengthening public financial
management will also help to ensure that budget formulation is realistic and in line with
priorities in the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
“The current stance of monetary policy appears broadly appropriate, and has been able to
contain inflationary pressures so far. Exchange rate appreciation has also helped to restrain
inflation. The authorities should continue to pass through the increases in international food
and fuel prices to consumers, while considering carefully-targeted measures to help the poor.
“Despite receiving debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) at end-2007, The Gambia remains
at high risk of debt distress due to the high level of outstanding debt and the country’s
vulnerability to external shocks. The authorities are formulating a national debt strategy to
guide future borrowing decisions, but intend to rely primarily on grants to finance their
development program,” Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an
annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace
period on principal payments.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for The Gambia
and Leonia Lephoto, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 8, 2008
Introduction
Our Gambian authorities are grateful for the constructive engagement by staff during the
consultations. They thank the Fund Executive Board and management for their continued
support. The authorities are in broad agreement with the thrust of the staff reports.
The Gambia has made significant progress towards macroeconomic stability in recent years
and performance under the program has continued to be strong. All the quantitative
performance criteria for the period ending March 2008 were met. Four of the eight structural
performance criteria were comfortably met while two were implemented with a slight delay.
The remaining criteria, related to the full operationalization of the credit reference bureau and
the register of government commitments for externally financed projects were partially met.
The authorities have since taken remedial steps, including the completion of the register of
externally financed projects in July. With regard to the credit bureau, it had been set up on
time but was not able to operate due to a legal obstacle that had not been envisaged. The
authorities have done a review of the relevant legislation and have initiated the process of
getting the law modified to facilitate the credit bureau’s full operationalization. Accordingly,
they are requesting waivers for the missed performance criteria.
Recent Economic Developments
Gambia’s macroeconomic performance continued to be strong with real GDP growth
estimated to have averaged 6½ percent a year in 2006-07. Economic growth was led by
robust telecommunications, tourism and construction activities. Following a sharp rise driven
by high international food and oil prices in 2007, inflation has slowed down in 2008. The
appreciation of the dalasi and the relatively tight monetary policy has helped to contain
inflationary pressures from rising world food and oil prices.
Overall fiscal performance has improved significantly, registering an overall surplus in 2007
and in the first quarter of 2008. This reflected strengthening in tax administration, which
boosted revenues, and unfortunately a decline in capital expenditures on account of shortfalls
in external financing, including the delayed grant disbursements for a large EU-supported
roads project. Government domestic debt has continued to fall and was 28 percent of GDP at
end-2007, as the government cleared more domestic arrears than programmed and is
planning to clear the remaining stock of arrears by the end of 2008.
The sharp appreciation of the dalasi during the third quarter of 2007 was mainly a result of
changes in market sentiments. Although the Central Bank of Gambia (CBG) intervention
stabilized the situation in the foreign exchange market for the remainder of 2007, the
appreciation resumed in 2008 due to strong inflow of remittances and reduced debt service
payments.

2

Despite the slight widening of the current account deficit as a result of lower transfers, an
improvement in the overall external position was realized in 2007. The current account
deficit was more than financed by foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and official
concessional loans. As a result, the level of foreign reserves was estimated to have risen to
5.5 months of import coverage by the end of the year.
Performance under the program
The authorities’ dedication to macroeconomic stability continued to ensure successful
implementation of the program. All the quantitative program targets for end-March 2008
were met, and the authorities were able to accelerate the elimination of domestic arrears.
Four of the eight structural performance criteria were comfortably met while two were
implemented with a slight delay.
The remaining criteria, which pertained to the full operationalization of the credit reference
bureau and the register of government commitments for externally financed projects were
only partially met. The delay in operationalizing the credit reference bureau was caused by
the limitations on data sharing under the current financial institutions laws. The authorities
have already established the credit reference bureau and banks are providing information to
it. The legislation has been reviewed to allow for, among others, the sharing of customer
information among the financial institutions and the process of amending it has been started.
With regard to the register of government commitments to externally financed projects
information needed for the register had been collected. The authorities have filled the gaps
with regard to some individual projects, and completed the register by July 15, 2008.
Macroeconomic policies
The authorities have made significant strides towards the achievement of their goals of
consolidating macroeconomic stability and fostering conditions conducive to high and
sustainable growth as well as poverty reduction. They remain committed to the
implementation of prudent macroeconomic management.
Fiscal policy
Ensuring fiscal sustainability through continued implementation of prudent fiscal policies
remains the authorities’ priority. Fiscal policy will aim at containing public debt and related
interest payments at sustainable levels, in line with the program.
Revenue performance is thus expected to remain strong in the near to medium term, with
continued improvements in tax administration. The authorities are cognizant of the need to
review tax policy to broaden the tax base and boost revenues, as efficiency gains from
improved revenue administration could be approaching full realization. Such a review will
include consideration for streamlining the exemptions on import duties. However, the
implementation of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), currently being negotiated
between the ECOWAS and the EU, is expected to have adverse effects on revenue, which

3
could represent a fiscal shock to The Gambia, depending on the pace of implementation of
the EPA.
The main challenge confronting the authorities is how to address the effects of the high
international food and oil prices while maintaining macroeconomic stability. So far,
appreciation of the dalasi has helped contain the impact of the price increases. After reducing
the tax on rice from 15 percent to 5 percent in July 2007, in order to help keep rice
affordable, the government eliminated the sales tax on rice imports in May 2008. Rice is an
essential commodity in the consumption basket of the poor in The Gambia. With regard to
the price of oil, the authorities plan to alleviate the impact on the poor by cross-subsidizing
kerosene through petrol and diesel prices.
The authorities will continue to make efforts to enhance the efficiency and transparency of
fiscal operations. Significant improvements in commitment controls, budget execution and
monitoring of PRSP related spending have been realized since the introduction of IFMIS in
January 2007. The recently established register of capital projects will help strengthen the
system for allocation and monitoring of government counterpart funds to externally-financed
capital projects. Efforts to strengthen the budget formulation process, enhance accountability
in the use of public resources and improve the quality of public projects will also be
continued.
In order to enhance effectiveness of the public sector, the authorities are undertaking a
comprehensive civil service reform program with the support of the World Bank. The reform
is expected to enable the authorities to attract and retain highly qualified professional staff.
The Gambia’s external debt has been significantly reduced by the HIPC and MDRI relief.
However, the country continues to be at a high risk of debt distress. Delivery of the promised
relief by the Paris Club bilateral creditors would further alleviate the debt problem. The
authorities are making efforts to obtain additional debt relief from all non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors. The authorities are committed to safeguarding external stability through prudent
management of external debt. In that regard, they are planning to prepare a comprehensive
debt management strategy. To provide input into the strategy they will undertake an
independent debt sustainability assessment (DSA) with the assistance of the Commonwealth
Secretariat. The new debt strategy will guide The Gambia’s debt policy going forward. In the
meantime, the government will continue to observe the indicative limits, established under
the PRGF-supported program, on contracting of new debt and will limit new borrowing to
highly concessional terms. These limits will be revisited within the context of program
reviews, once the government’s strategy is developed and government is able to conduct it
own DSAs.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The monetary policy objective of the CBG is to maintain price stability. The money targeting
framework is used to conduct monetary policy and the rediscount rate to signal changes in
policy stance. Increasing international prices of food and oil are expected to pose a challenge
to monetary policy from the second half of 2008 onwards.

4
The authorities welcome the staff assessment that the Dalasi is in line with fundamentals.
The CBG remains committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate system. However, it
will occasionally intervene in exchange markets to prevent disorderly adjustment, correct any
misalignment of the exchange rate, and build up foreign reserves or prevent their depletion.
This will be conducted in line with its well-defined intervention policy.
The authorities intend to pursue measures to enhance the CBG’s operational independence
and its monetary policy execution capacity. These will include ensuring compliance with the
provisions of the CBG Act (2005) on its capital requirements and limits on lending to
government.
Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies will remain an important part of the authorities’
macroeconomic agenda. This will be led by the memorandum of understanding signed by the
Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs (DoSFEA) in 2007 and the CBG to
guide domestic debt management and monetary operations. To enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy, the government will continue to replenish the treasury bill special deposit
account to mitigate the constraints to the CBG’s monetary operations arising from low
balances in the account.
The banking sector in The Gambia is sound. However, private sector lending remains weak
as the banks continue to be risk averse. To facilitate financial intermediation, the CBG has
established a credit reference bureau which will provide the financial sector with information
on the credit worthiness of potential borrowers. Banks have started providing data on their
customers to the credit bureau. However, the information cannot yet be accessed as the
current legislation does not permit sharing information on individual customers. The ongoing
review of the financial sector legislation is expected to, among others, remove this restriction
and facilitate full operationalization of the credit bureau. The authorities are continuously
strengthening prudential supervision of banks. They have made significant headway in the
use of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, introduced in 2007, to monitor bank
compliance and performance against a number of critical indicators. They appreciate the
assistance they have thus far received from the Fund in strengthening their banking
supervision capacity.
Growth and Poverty Reduction
The authorities are confronted with the challenge of translating economic growth into the
improvement of the economic well-being of the majority of the people, more than 60 percent
of whom are estimated to live below the poverty line. The Gambia’s second PRSP (PRSP II)
attempts to address this through the promotion of macroeconomic stability and effective
public resource management, pro-poor growth and employment through private sector
development, as well as improvement in the provision of basic services. However, significant
funding resources and strengthened capacity in the public service will be needed for the
successful implementation of the PRSP II and the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals. The assistance of international development partners will be very
important in this regard.

5
Conclusion
We would like to reaffirm the authorities’ commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies,
growth promotion and improving the livelihood of the people. They appreciate the support
they have received from the Fund and the international community thus far. We encourage
The Gambia’s development partners to continue supporting the country to alleviate the
enormous capacity and financial constraints they face. The recently received HIPC and
MDRI debt relief has been beneficial in creating some fiscal space which will facilitate
allocation of resources to development and poverty reducing activities. Additional debt relief
from the remaining creditors would also be very beneficial.
