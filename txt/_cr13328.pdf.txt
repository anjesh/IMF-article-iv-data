STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 25, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth recovered and inflation declined sharply in 2013. Leverage has risen,
with real estate a major beneficiary, but providing only a muted growth impulse.
Intensive use of macroprudential measures recently stabilized house prices, which had
grown rapidly. The financial sector has so far absorbed expectations of tapering by the
Federal Reserve with limited volatility. Measures to encourage productivity growth
continue to be rolled out, including through further tightening of foreign worker
policies, which has pushed up wages.
Outlook, risks and macroeconomic policies. Growth is likely to reach 3½ percent
in 2013−14, supported by stronger G3 demand, despite softening in the region. A
positive output gap and rising labor costs will raise core inflation, but headline inflation
will stabilize on smaller asset price increases. External and domestic factors tilt the
balance of growth risks to the downside. Cyclical conditions warrant a restrictive stance
overall. The current policy of modest gradual appreciation is consistent with limiting the
output gap and anchoring inflation expectations, while continued targeting of
macroprudential policies will help contain asset prices and ensure prudent lending. The
budgeted fiscal stimulus is warranted to support the goal of raising productivity to
relieve future supply constraints.
Financial sector issues. Significant risks have built up under very low interest rates, but
appear manageable, although confirmation will come only once the cycle has turned.
Regional and global interconnectedness also brings risks. A countercyclical capital buffer,
stepped-up onsite bank inspections, strengthened fx liquidity management practices by
banks, and vigorous enforcement of international AML/CFT commitments are advised.
Higher leverage increases aggregate sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks and interest
rate cycles, exacerbated by significant balance sheet heterogeneity.
Demographic shifts. Prospective population aging and workforce shrinkage call for
continuing to boost labor productivity, aided by the higher education levels of younger
cohorts and continuing to tap foreign workers—though at a slower pace than previously.
Recent commitments to strengthen social safety nets in a targeted manner, especially for
the elderly, are welcome.
External sector assessment. From a multilateral perspective and taking into account
Singapore’s unique characteristics, the external position is stronger than warranted by
fundamentals. Increased public spending and a tighter labor market caused by a slower
pace of foreign worker inflows—consistent with the authorities’ plans—and appropriate
adjustments in other countries should narrow the large current account surplus.

BACKGROUND
A. Challenges and Opportunities
1.
Transformed by decades of rapid growth, the Singapore economy is now facing
several challenges common to advanced country peers, and others unique to a mature city
state. Singapore is grappling with the economic effects of a rapidly-aging population, limited room
for productivity catch­up in sectors close to the technology frontier, and widening income
inequality. These challenges are amplified by growing land scarcity, the social choice to slow the
intake of foreign workers, and the likely more moderate growth trajectory for large advanced and
emerging market economies over the long haul. Nonetheless, Singapore’s flexible markets, strong
finances, and forward-looking policymaking should position it to manage these challenges and
benefit from opportunities brought by the pivot of global growth toward Asia, with its burgeoning
middle­ and upper­income classes.
2.
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors endorsed the view
that weak external demand, price pressures from labor market tightening, large property
exposures, and growing cross­border financial linkages present a challenge. In the interim,
however, notable progress has been made in moderating consumer price inflation, but the outlook
for Singapore’s main trade partners has been revised down. Also, while credit and household
indebtedness have continued to rise, but at a more moderate pace, property prices appear to have
recently stabilized.

B. Recent Developments
3.
In recent years, external weakness, ultra­low global interest rates, and domestic
structural reforms have shaped the Singapore economy. As a very small, very open economy,
activity is heavily influenced by developments abroad, and in a multi­speed global economy, G3
(United States, euro area, and Japan) demand remains Singapore’s main external growth engine.
Unconventional monetary policies (UMPs) in advanced countries and shifts in global risk sentiment
have boosted Singapore’s financial market activity and demand for real estate. Managing the
dependence on foreign workers (FWs) is a domestic policy priority, and measures to slow the
increase in FWs were introduced in 2010 and subsequently tightened with the aim of encouraging
faster wage and productivity growth in labor­intensive sectors while easing congestion.
4.


These factors have had a notable effect on the real economy:
The pace of growth has slowed and the external sector contribution has become more erratic.
Growth weakened from 5¼ percent in 2011 to 1¼ percent in 2012, before rebounding strongly
in H1:2013 (Figure 1). This variability reflects mainly swings in G3 demand and shifts in global
risk sentiment that impacted financial services. Domestic demand—especially consumption—has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

SINGAPORE

been considerably less volatile, though generally subdued, despite the tight labor market and
low interest rates.1


On the external side, the current account surplus shrank by 6 percentage points in 2012, and the
real effective exchange rate continued to strengthen. The current account fell to a still­high
18½ percent of GDP as exports declined while imports continued to expand. This occurred
against further real appreciation from wage and price increases and nominal appreciation. The
CPI­based real effective exchange rate (REER) has risen by a cumulative 8¾ percent since
end 2010, while the unit labor cost­based REER has jumped 17 percent.



Inflation fell sharply in 2013 as asset price appreciation eased. Rising prices of housing and
rationed vehicle ownership permits pushed headline inflation to 4−5 percent during 2010−12.
Core inflation (which excludes the cost of accommodation and private road transport) increased
more modestly as pass through of rising unit labor costs was dampened by faster nominal
appreciation and subdued global commodity prices. More recently, restrictive macroprudential
(MaP) measures on housing and cars pushed down headline inflation (to 1.6 percent in
September).



Despite slower GDP growth, the labor market has remained tight. At 2.9 percent, the resident
unemployment rate is hovering close to historical lows as labor supply growth has slowed on
tighter limits on FWs.2,3 As a result, resident labor force participation, including among older
workers, has edged up to high levels, and unit labor costs are rising at an annual rate of
6¼ percent in 2013.

5.
Bank loans have expanded briskly alongside the higher credit intensity of GDP. Loans
to nonfinancial resident borrowers increased by a cumulative 60 percent since end 2009 (Figure 2).
Real estate­related loans (housing loans, loans to the building and construction sector) grew an
even faster 75 percent and now account for 46 percent of DBU loans to nonbank customers.4
However, the sizable increase in leverage—from 151 percent of GDP in 2008 to 182 percent of GDP

1

Within investment, stock-building has played an important countercyclical role. Also, the global slump in personal
computer sales has adversely impacted Singapore’s external demand more than some other Asian economies that
are more focused on smart phones and tablets.

2

Nonresident foreign workers are regulated through a system of levies and firm-level quotas (dependency ratio
ceilings) that vary by sector and/or skill level. Further tightening measures have been announced through 2016.

3
Singapore’s labor force was among the fastest growing in Asia during the past decade, considerably outstripping
that of other advanced or emerging market Asian countries. As a small city state with space constraints, this strategy
could not continue indefinitely.

4

Real estate loans account for 28 percent of total (DBU plus ACU) loan portfolios. The domestic banking unit (DBU)
and Asian currency unit (ACU) accounting distinction no longer provides a useful delineation between: (i) resident
versus nonresident borrowing because domestic banks extend loans to nonresidents through their DBU books
(about a third of the total); and (ii) activities of domestic versus foreign banks because some foreign banks have
sizable DBU books in view of their significant presence in the domestic retail market. While DBU housing loans to
residents would provide the best indicator of banks’ mortgage exposure to Singapore, this data is not available by
sector.

in mid 2013—appears to have provided a diminishing impetus to real activity.5 This may reflect
significant and growing credit leakage abroad given Singapore’s role as a regional financial center
and/or that a large part of credit was used to purchase financial and pre­existing assets, including
real estate (see Box 1).
6.
After having risen some 54 percent on average from their mid­2009 trough, private
and public resale house prices have recently stabilized on intensive application of MaPs
(Figure 3).6 Residents’ appetite for real estate has been fueled by very low mortgage rates (around
one percent), low returns on alternative savings vehicles, provisions in the pension scheme allowing
part of savings to be used for house purchases, and a strong increase in the number of residents
against a more limited increase in the stock of housing. Nearly half of household wealth is held as
real estate (see Box 2). Demand by nonresidents and domestic corporates—which accounted for
nearly 25 percent of transactions in late 2011—was buoyed by ample global liquidity, trend
appreciation of the Singapore dollar and Singapore’s safe­haven status. Since late 2009, an
escalating series of MaP measures targeting private and public housing (see Box 3) has reduced the
volume of transactions, lowered average loan­to­value (LtV) ratios, and in recent months scaled back
the average tenor of new mortgages. Guidelines on prudent total debt service ceilings were issued
at end June.7 The cumulative impact of these measures has been to slow and more recently stabilize
residential property prices. However, price growth has continued for commercial and industrial
space.
7.
Singapore’s financial markets have so far absorbed expectations of future QE tapering
by the Federal Reserve with limited volatility (Figure 4). A large net foreign asset position, deep
financial markets, and role as a regional financial hub—whereby large bank­related financial inflows
are broadly matched by contemporaneous outflows—provide resilience (see Box 4). Nonetheless, at
high frequencies, Singapore’s equity and currency markets are positively correlated with global risk
appetite (see Box 5). During late April to late October, the stock price index has fallen 7 percent,
while the Singapore dollar eased by less than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar and the nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) has returned to the upper half of the policy band. Longer­dated
government bond yields have risen by ¾−1¼ percentage points, while short­term rates are
unchanged.

5

Leverage is defined as (DBU and ACU) credit to the private sector and outstanding Housing Development Board
(HDB) mortgage loans to households. For Singapore, the ratio of resident credit to GDP may be a somewhat less
informative indicator of leverage and may not be fully comparable to ratios for other countries because resident
foreigners and resident foreign companies together generate more than 40 percent of GDP.

6

Prices of private houses are pro-cyclical, and dropped 25 percent during the GFC, but have since recovered
strongly, increasing by 62 percent. Prices of public resale housing are more stable but, nevertheless, have risen
46 percent since mid‐2009. The greater cyclicality of private house prices reflects the larger fraction of non-owner
occupied buyers, including foreigners and companies, who tend to be more sensitive to interest rates and other
macroeconomic conditions.
7

The total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) caps payments at 60 percent of household income, calculated using an interest
rate of 3½ percent (or the prevailing market interest rate, if higher) for the marginal mortgage loan. The maximum
allowable mortgage loan tenor is now 35 years, with shorter limits for older borrowers.

C. Structural Challenges
8.
Singapore is facing a strong demographic headwind. Very low fertility rates for several
decades, already-high labor force participation, and physical and social constraints on absorbing a
further large influx of foreign workers suggest that Singapore’s workforce will plateau later this
decade and decline thereafter. Absent structural changes to shift the economy from the previous
labor­intensive growth model, per capita income could decline and prices of labor-intensive goods
could rise sharply. In addition, rising life expectancy will increase the citizen old­age dependency
ratio (those aged 65 and above relative to those of working age) from less than one-in-five in 2012
to one­in­two in 2030.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
With support from G3 external demand, Singapore’s GDP is forecast to grow
moderately during 2013−14, despite softening in regional emerging market economies.8
Growth is forecast to reach 3½ percent this year and next (with carryover accounting for
1½ percentage points of growth in 2014), keeping output just above potential. Strengthening G3
activity is expected to offset slower regional growth, returning the external sector to expansion.
Consumption is likely to increase modestly as the impact of sustained real wage growth is tempered
by a squeeze on households’ “free” income as debt service costs begin to rise. Public investment is
forecast to remain robust. A sustained positive output gap and pass through of higher employment
costs from labor market tightening amid continued subdued import prices are expected to raise
core inflation from temporary lows in 2013. However, headline inflation is likely to stabilize at about
2½ percent on smaller increases in housing rents and car permit costs. The current account surplus
is forecast to narrow modestly to around 17½ percent of GDP by 2014.
10.
Over the medium term, tight labor market policies and increased public spending will
continue to support demand rebalancing. Potential GDP growth is expected to dip significantly in
the next few years on slower labor force expansion, and then recover gradually as faster labor
productivity growth takes hold, reaching just under 4 percent in the medium term—well below the
pace during 2000−08. Tighter labor supply due to slowing foreign worker intake in the near term
and population aging in the medium term will boost wages, and with productivity gains unlikely to
fully compensate, core inflation will increase temporarily and—together with continued nominal
appreciation—push up the REER, dampening exports.9 Frictional unemployment is expected to
increase in the transition as workers move between firms and across sectors in response to new
wage and productivity patterns. Supported by a 2½ percentage points of GDP increase in primarily

8

Based on analytical work for the forthcoming April 2014 Asian Regional Economic Outlook, inward growth spillovers
to Singapore from China and other ASEAN countries have risen in recent years relative to those from the U.S., euro
area, and Japan. However, in absolute terms, growth spillovers from the advanced economies continue to dominate.

SINGAPORE

aging­related social spending, the more appreciated REER is expected to rebalance growth toward
domestic demand and narrow the current account surplus.
11.
A challenging external environment and possible adverse effects of domestic policies
tilt the balance of Singapore’s growth risks to the downside (Appendix 1).
Stronger­than­anticipated recoveries in the G3 would benefit Singapore through increased export
demand. However, as host to G­SIFIs and with the large regional presence of its domestic banks,
Singapore could be exposed to strains from asset repricing and liquidity pressures in the event of a
disorderly UMP exit, flare up in euro area financial stress, and/or emerging market capital flow
reversals. In addition, with high leverage among households and firms, an unexpectedly sharp
increase in interest rates could constrain spending. Prolonged slow euro area growth, weaker
growth in emerging markets, or a sharp medium-term slowdown in China would depress
Singapore’s externally-oriented economy through trade, financial, and tourism channels. Domestic
policies to reduce labor intensity carry the risk that productivity gains will be insufficient,
undermining competitiveness, and causing significant business closures—especially among SMEs—
and structural unemployment. Recent public reports that Singapore’s foreign banks, companies and
trusts may have permitted nonresidents to conceal beneficial ownership of assets for the purpose of
evading taxes in other jurisdictions could expose Singapore to reputational risk, with negative
implications for financial and external stability.

Authorities’ Views
12.
Growth is expected to pick up in 2013 on somewhat better global prospects. Improved
conditions in advanced economies and recovery in the global IT sector should cause the economy to
expand by 2½−3½ percent this year. These factors outweigh headwinds from the slowdown in
China and softer regional trade. Headline inflation is expected to ease considerably to 2.5−3 percent
in 2013 on measures already taken, but with core inflation rising mildly from the middle of 2013 as
pent up wage and rental cost pressures are passed on to prices in the context of firmer demand
conditions.
13.
While the probability of extreme events has receded, several risks remain. Conditioned
on a smooth exit, prospective unwinding of UMPs was viewed in a generally positive light, with deep
financial markets, exchange rate flexibility within the band, and scope for fx intervention expected to
ensure an orderly adjustment. However, a mis­timed exit from UMPs, a hard landing in China, or a
renewed flare up in euro area stress would adversely affect the Singapore economy through trade,
credit, and financial channels. The ongoing domestic restructuring was also seen as posing potential
risks in the event inflation expectations become unhinged or productivity significantly lags wage
growth.

POLICIES TO PRESERVE MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
A. Monetary and Macroprudential Policies—A Complementary Pair
14.
The MAS’s moderately restrictive monetary policy is appropriate to contain demand
pressures and prevent possible second round inflation effects. Ongoing structural reforms will
alter the growth-inflation trade off, making inflation more responsive to an increase in demand.10 In
the context of the exchange rate­centered monetary policy, the modest gradual appreciation of the
band since early 2012 continues to be appropriate for keeping aggregate demand in line with
output and preventing restructuring-related transitory price effects from becoming entrenched.
Although the specific parameters of the basket-band-crawl framework are not made public, staff
estimates that the NEER band—with a width of about ±2 percent—is appreciating at an annual rate
of around 2½ percent (Figure 5).11 Sustained deviations from the baseline growth forecast or
evidence of significant second round inflation effects would warrant a compensating adjustment to
the policy rate of crawl.
15.
Macroprudential tools are an essential complement to the exchange rate­based
monetary policy, but may be subject to operational limits:


Using the NEER to affect aggregate demand is consistent with Singapore’s very large external
sector (trade is nearly four times GDP). However, tightening policy through faster appreciation
could increase financial stability risks by depressing nominal interest rates, which are determined
by interest parity conditions in the context of the very open financial account. The authorities’
extensive targeted and well-coordinated arsenal of MaP measures has been effective in slowing
house and car prices, thereby dampening the contribution of asset prices to headline inflation.12
MaPs have also helped make lending more prudent by capping tenors on new loans and
reducing the number of multiple mortgages.



The MaP toolkit may be implemented in a countercyclical manner, and a roadmap for relaxing
existing measures should be readied in the event the financial cycle turns.



Despite their demonstrated effectiveness at slowing asset prices, growing demands on MaPs
may test their limits through circumvention and demand spillovers to near substitute assets.
Also, internationalization of a segment of the housing market suggests that adoption of MaPs

10

Reduced recourse to foreign workers will affect the output gap asymmetrically across the business cycle. When
demand is weak, non-renewal of short-term employment contracts of FWs will reduce potential output, thereby
limiting the negative output gap. However, during a strong upswing in demand, quotas on FWs will become more
binding, constraining the potential supply response to higher demand, and opening up a large positive output gap.

abroad may cause demand for property to spill over to Singapore. The authorities have been
obliged to plug loopholes through an ever­broader and more complex set of measures, thereby
increasing administrative complexity.13

Authorities’ Views
16.
Modest, gradual appreciation of the NEER policy band is appropriate to contain
inflation amid economic restructuring and low global interest rates. The resulting real
appreciation helps facilitate productivity gains and demand rebalancing over the medium term,
while guarding against a buildup of inflation expectations. While efficacy of the exchange
rate­centered regime is more challenging when global interest rates are near the zero lower bound,
the current policy framework remains superior for Singapore because unilaterally raising interest
rates would attract additional capital inflows. Moreover, because exchange rate­sensitive
components continue to dominate real activity, an exchange rate­based framework minimizes
output volatility, including from unpredictable capital flows.
17.
Sustainable asset prices are fundamental to financial stability and to low consumer
price inflation. Because monetary policy cannot adequately address asset inflation, a coordinated
set of MaP measures has been adopted to dampen asset price cyclicality. The heavy focus on
property-related measures reflects the structural importance of housing to the Singapore economy.
Singapore’s approach has been to target demand at its source, minimize unintended consequences
by adopting measures incrementally, and reduce distortions and the risk of circumvention by
defining measures comprehensively. Some MaPs—including the total debt servicing ratio—should
be considered permanent features of the financial stability architecture, to be dialed up and down in
line with cyclical conditions.

B. Fiscal Policy
18.
While cyclical conditions warrant a somewhat restrictive fiscal stance in 2013−14,
some stimulus can be justified given the budget’s emphasis on restructuring. Consistent with
prevailing cyclical conditions, fiscal policy was restrictive in 2012-13 owing to large one-off revenue
from property transaction taxes and proceeds from the auction of car ownership certificates.
Initiatives in the FY 2013 Budget (in effect during April 2013-March 2014) focus on restructuring and
raising inclusiveness. Specific measures include continuing the calibrated tightening of the FW
policy, encouraging businesses to enhance productivity through cost defrayments, making the tax
system more progressive, strengthening social safety nets, and increasing spending on public
transport. In all, staff expects fiscal policy to inject a stimulus of about 1¾ percent of GDP this year
and next, although leakage abroad of demand is likely to be significant given the very open
economy. With a sizable part of the budgeted spending increase aimed at boosting productivity,

13

In June 2013, MAS stipulated that the mortgage borrower must be the same as the holder of the legal title to the
property. Also, several measures originally applied to housing loans were subsequently extended to loans for other
types of real estate and cars.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SINGAPORE

and hence relieving future supply constraints, some stimulus is appropriate, provided monetary
policy maintains a tightening bias.

Authorities’ Views
19.
Fiscal policy continues to focus on medium-term objectives of strengthening
productivity and fostering greater inclusiveness. It is essential that firms begin adjusting to the
permanently tighter labor market conditions arising from restrictive FW policies and population
aging. A three­year budget­financed transition support package is intended to promote
restructuring by absorbing part of the cost to firms of wage increases and new investments. These
support mechanisms, including wage credits, corporate income tax rebates, and investment
subsidies, are designed to benefit the most impacted firms, particularly SMEs. Social measures
include improving access to education, expanding wage supplements for low­income workers, and
increasing direct assistance to the elderly. All told, the Budget implies a fiscal impulse of 1¾ percent
of potential GDP. However, the macroeconomic impact will be dampened considerably as some of
stepped­up social transfers will be saved and monetary policy decisions will internalize the fiscal
stance. Moreover, some near­term impulse can be justified because successful economic
restructuring would increase potential output and hence lower inflationary pressure over the
medium term.

SHORING UP FINANCIAL SECTOR RESILIENCE
A. Adapting to Changing Global Monetary Conditions
20.
Notwithstanding important strengths identified in the 2013 FSAP update, risks to
financial stability have risen under the aegis of UMPs. Healthy balance sheets of banks and the
sovereign provide important buffers to absorb risks, as confirmed by investment ratings that are
among the highest in the world and joint MAS­IMF stress tests conducted as part of the FSAP
update. Financial positions of the household and corporate sectors, which provide the first line of
defense in the event of shocks, are robust in the aggregate. However, the wide dispersion of
household income and wealth, and significant firm heterogeneity coupled with weak profits in
recent years may conceal pockets of risk. In addition, the buildup of leverage has increased exposure
to turns in the economic cycle and potential shocks. With property and interest rate cycles now
having reached a mature phase, and with Singapore’s ongoing restructuring expected to bring
slower GDP growth and possibly higher frictional unemployment, the economy’s future
debt­carrying capacity may be reduced.
21.
Given the important economic and social role of housing, the authorities’ proactive
approach to addressing related risks is warranted. First, property prices could accentuate the
cyclicality of the economy because about 70 percent of mortgages have variable rates that are tied
to the 3­month SIBOR, suggesting that most rates would reprice in unison when short­term market

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

rates increase. With tenors of mortgages having risen sharply in recent years, scope is limited to
cushion the impact of higher interest rates on debt service payments by refinancing to longer
duration loans. Second, net housing wealth is large, but assets are subject to valuation changes while
liabilities are fixed, suggesting possibly sizable wealth effects if prices fall. Third, while housing
generally remains affordable, this has been achieved for new HDB flats by increasing the public
subsidy and not adjusting prices in line with the resale market. And fourth, real estate-related
activities account for a non­negligible share of GDP and employment, with potential feedback to
loan quality in a slowdown. Therefore, the recent TDSR guidelines and credit card issuance rules are
positive steps to ensure prudent underwriting standards and to slow credit growth. As highlighted in
the FSSA (see Box 6), broadening the coverage of banks’ real estate exposure limits to include loans
for owner­occupied housing, encouraging excessively leveraged households to reduce housing
debt, and increased on­site inspection of banks’ credit risks would further help contain housing
market­related financial stability risks.
22.
Heavy reliance on MaPs may reflect some concern about disadvantaging local banks
vis­a­vis foreign branches. Capital risk weights applied to mortgages by local banks (averaging
about 10 percent) are very low by international standards. MAS does not have explicit authority over
risk weights and other capital­based measures used by foreign branches, which are regulated by
home supervisors. On the other hand, all financial institutions operating in Singapore (local banks,
foreign branches, and nonbank financial institutions) are subject to the MaP measures. Limited
reliance on capital-based measures may imply that banks do not adequately internalize the extent of
systemic risk caused by the large stock of mortgages.14 Risk weights used by several major foreign
banks in Singapore and Hong Kong SAR (together) are lower than those applied elsewhere within
the banking groups, but are similar to weights at local Singapore banks.15 Scope may exist to raise
mortgage risk weights without creating an unlevel playing field provided home supervisors respond
accordingly by revising up the risk weights they require on mortgages in Singapore. The recent
conversion of a major foreign bank branch into a Singapore subsidiary further strengthens the case
for introducing a minimum mortgage risk weight floor that exceeds prevailing weights.
Authorities’ Views
23.
Singapore’s financial system is resilient to the normalization of global monetary
conditions, but a significant minority of households could be over leveraged.


Locally incorporated banks hold capital in excess of MAS’s minimum requirements, which exceed
Basel III standards, have buffers against large property price declines, and are subject to rigorous

14

Lower risk weights allow banks to maintain higher capital ratios for any given amount of leverage. This tends to
amplify the return on equity and encourages lending procyclicality.
15

This is based on 2011 data, prior to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority establishing a risk weight floor of
15 percent (considerably above previous actual practice) for all new residential mortgages in February 2013. See
“Singapore and Hong Kong Banks: The End of Super Low Mortgage Rates,” Barclay’s Equity Research, March 8, 2013.

stress testing to assess resilience to property market shocks. MAS periodically reviews local
banks’ Internal Rating Based models that are used to determine risk weights, including for
mortgages. The high proportion of variable rate loans is seen as helping to cushion the impact
on banks of higher interest rates in the event of UMP exit.


However, pockets of concern exist, with an estimated 5−10 percent of households
over­leveraged on their property purchases (defined as total debt service payments in excess of
60 percent of income), which could rise to 10−15 percent if mortgage rates rise by 3 percentage
points. Lower­income households with smaller savings pools and those with multiple mortgages
or longer loan tenors are most at risk, although they may not necessarily default. Proactive use
of macroprudential measures is intended to ensure that credit supplied at low interest rates
does not drive house prices beyond levels compatible with underlying income growth.



Large government assets provide scope for systemic support in the event of financial stability
risks, including a prolonged period of elevated unemployment.

B. Financial Center Considerations
24.
The financial sector’s strong regional and global orientation brings benefits of
diversification and scale economies, but also creates the potential for spillover risk (Box 7).


Foreign banks in Singapore mainly operate as branches, which are closely interconnected with
their much-larger parent banks.16 In view of the special challenges foreign branches pose for
supervision, MAS has adopted mitigating measures, while also advocating in international fora
for enhanced sharing of supervisory information, including on G­SIFIs active in Singapore.



Rapid expansion of cross-border trade finance by the Big 3 local banking groups has increased
their presence in relatively under­banked, fast­growing neighbors, but which also gives rise to
liquidity and credit risks. Trade­related lending mainly to China and ASEAN has allowed the
domestic banks to utilize their excess Singapore dollar liquidity by swapping it into U.S. dollars.
These loans are short term, self liquidating, and collateralized, and banks have increased their
on­balance sheet U.S. dollar funding at the request of the MAS. Nonetheless, reliance on the
fx swap market, which could seize up during periods of global stress episodes (including a
disruptive unwinding of UMPs or a resurgence of euro area financial turbulence), remains high.17
These loans may also carry additional operational risk reflecting weaker creditor rights and
enforcement mechanisms in host countries.

16

Using comprehensive international banking data, the FSAP update performed numerical simulations of potential
spillovers from other jurisdictions onto Singapore’s banking system through its cross-border interbank exposures,
highlighting the importance of major financial centers, including the U.K.

17

However, Singapore’s fx swap market has been resilient to earlier stress episodes, including the global financial
crisis, which may to some extent reflect support from the MAS.

14



The large size and rapid growth of assets under management and weaknesses identified during
the 2008 AML/CFT assessment expose Singapore’s financial sector to the risk of being used as a
harbor or conduit for illicit assets. Measures already in place or in the process of implementation
—including making tax evasion a predicate crime for money laundering, bolstering the
framework for international tax cooperation and sharing of tax information, and committing to
undergo in 2015 an AML/CFT assessment under the revised FATF methodology—are therefore
welcome. Addressing previously identified deficiencies regarding transparency of beneficial
ownership of companies and trusts established or operating in Singapore is also urged.

Authorities’ Views
25.
Preemptive steps have been adopted to contain risks inherent in being a regional
financial hub. MAS actively participates in Supervisory College and Crisis Management group
meetings hosted by respective home supervisors. Growth of nonbank loans by local banks to
Asia­10 countries has been in line with Asia­10’s GDP growth, although a large part of their loan
portfolios remain in Singapore. In discussion with MAS, banks broadened their U.S. dollar funding
profile by issuing commercial paper and stepping up deposit taking. Singapore has implemented
stringent measures as part of international efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism
financing, and tax evasion. On tax, the “exchange of information” regime is aligned to
internationally-agreed standards, and since July 2013, Singapore has criminalized the laundering of
the proceeds of tax evasion and tax fraud.

ADJUSTING TO DEMOGRAPHIC DECLINE
26.
A large education dividend, supplemented by inflows of foreign workers with key
skills, would cushion the impact of the coming demographic decline. The much higher
educational attainment of younger relative to retiring cohorts will allow the smaller labor force to be
used more effectively.18 Greater reliance on labor­saving technologies would also help deal with a
shrinking domestic labor force. However, this process may result in the hollowing out of laborintensive tradables, leading to labor redundancies if workers cannot be successfully re­trained. Local
shortages of critical skills should be alleviated by continuing to tap foreign manpower.
27.
An aging population will raise demand for private and public resources and help
rebalance the economy. The mandatory defined-contribution savings scheme (Central
Provident Fund), where contributions are based on income, implies that fiscal obligations for
old­age income support are limited to providing a guaranteed minimum rate of return on
accumulated savings. However, only citizens and permanent residents may participate in
the CPF, and the uneven distribution of income within and across generations, as well as
incentives in the CPF that encourage saving in the form of real estate, implies that some
elderly may retire with insufficient liquid assets (Figure 6). An aging population will also require
more health care spending, which is currently largely privately financed. Despite the
18

SINGAPORE

dominant private sector role in financing retirement and health costs, in recent years, the
government has increased spending for social safety nets and infrastructure, including for the
elderly. The government’s commitment to further increase spending while drawing on income from
public sector reserves and, to a lesser extent, raising taxes, is commendable. The consequent
narrowing of the fiscal surplus and stepped up spending by retirees of their CPF and other savings
are expected to further narrow the current account surplus over the medium term.19

Authorities’ Views
28.
A comprehensive approach has been adopted to address Singapore’s demographic
challenges beginning later this decade. The government’s strategy balances social concerns and
physical space constraints and focuses on: (i) enhancing labor productivity; (ii) raising fertility rates
and further increasing resident labor force participation; (iii) continuing immigration and FW inflows
in a calibrated manner, and offshoring some labor­ and land­intensive activities; and (iv) expanding
infrastructure to accommodate a growing population. As the economy restructures and businesses
adopt laborsaving technologies, some increase in unemployment is to be expected, but with
retraining, no permanent uptick is likely.
29.
A strategic shift is underway to strengthen social safety nets while preserving the goal
of self reliance. As a result of the CPF, Singapore’s contingent fiscal liabilities related to population
aging and social security are limited. Nonetheless, the government provides significant income
assistance to the low­income elderly and families. Going forward, it will play a greater role by
allocating an additional 1−2 percentage points of GDP over the medium term for social and
economic priorities, including healthcare, income support, education, housing grants, and transport
infrastructure . To ensure these policies are commensurate with preserving strong public finances,
benefits will be well targeted, and work incentives will be retained. The government has sufficient
space to fund the policy shifts for now. However, it will need to ensure that revenues will continue to
be able to meet expenditure increases.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
30.
From a multilateral perspective, standard indicators suggest the external sector
remains stronger than warranted by medium­term fundamentals and desired policies
(Appendix 2). Singapore’s large current account surplus since 2000 reflects a heavy reliance on
low­wage foreign workers that discouraged fixed capital investment, policies that boost public and
private saving, and, as a major financial center, a large stock of net international assets to safeguard
against financial shocks (Figure 7). Current reserve levels—at 95 percent of GDP—appear adequate,

19

Population aging will lower the current account by increasing imports of consumption goods and reducing income
inflows as foreign assets of retirees are drawn down.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

and there is no clear case for further accumulation for precautionary purposes.20 Nonetheless,
income generated by the existing large net foreign assets keeps the current account elevated.21 The
recent sharp narrowing of the current account during 2011−12 appears to have been driven by
structural factors, rather than multilateral output and terms of trade gaps. While rebalancing by the
rest of the world is likely to have contributed significantly, Singapore’s efforts at reducing labor
intensity and the resulting increase in the REER probably also played a role in lowering the structural
surplus. Despite the recent narrowing, projected future population aging, and the authorities’ plans
to further increase public spending, deliver a more-even distribution of consumption across
generations, and maintain slower foreign worker inflows, various standard indicators—including
CGER methods—suggest the current account remains 4½−8 percent of GDP above its norm in the
medium term.
31.
However, additional considerations beyond the scope of—or not fully accounted for
by—standard quantitative benchmarks are likely to make a sizable contribution to
Singapore’s current account and increase uncertainty surrounding any quantitative
assessment. Because Singapore is an outlier across several dimensions included in multilateral
empirical estimates of the current account (extent of population aging, a major financial center but
not a reserve-currency issuer, a large lagged current account and NFA stock), it is reasonable to
conclude that estimated contributions from these factors may be understated. In addition, structural
features beyond those included in standard methodologies may also raise Singapore’s saving rate.
The low labor share of GDP from a cross­country perspective implies a large share accruing to the
corporate sector. In turn, corporate saving—defined as profit less dividends—may be higher on
account of the significant presence of foreign multinationals that, on a global basis, have tended to
retain a large part of earnings in recent years. Greater income inequality than in many other
countries (as measured by the Gini coefficient), together with the higher saving propensity of
wealthier households, could also have raised the aggregate saving rate and hence the current
account. While data limitations preclude quantifying their current account contributions, the
combined impact is unlikely to overturn the assessment that the external sector is overly strong.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The external sector is expected to continue to move toward equilibrium over the
medium term. While it is difficult to identify equilibrium values with precision, the current account
surplus will likely continue to narrow and the real exchange rate continue to appreciate over the

20

Liquidity stress tests indicate that under the severe but short-lived V-shaped risk scenario described in Box 2 of the
accompanying FSSA report, over a one-year horizon, banks could face a U.S. dollar funding gap of US$50 billion
(about one-fifth of official reserves).
21

Maintaining a constant net foreign asset-to-GDP ratio requires an ongoing current account surplus of about 10
percent of GDP. In the CGER macrobalance approach, the lagged current account surplus is the main contributor to
Singapore’s current account norm (but this does not necessarily imply that past surpluses were themselves
appropriate).

medium term. This reflects additional spending related to population aging and the ongoing shift to
a less labor­intensive growth model.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Singapore’s economic conditions improved considerably in 2013. Following the weak
performance of 2012, growth is expected to recover this year to a moderate pace, reflecting the shift
in global growth dynamics toward advanced economies, despite weaker activity in the region and
higher interest rates. Inflation has fallen sharply from elevated levels on containment of house and
car price increases and subdued world commodity prices, and inflation expectations have eased.
Unemployment remains low, with robust job creation. Meanwhile, credit growth has moderated to
low double­digit rates and house prices have stabilized. However, a combination of external and
domestic factors tilts the balance of growth risks to the downside.
34.
Cyclical conditions warrant a somewhat restrictive macroeconomic stance overall.
MAS’s current policy of modest gradual appreciation is consistent with keeping the output gap
contained and inflation expectations anchored. The authorities have appropriately applied a
targeted toolkit of MaPs to address financial stability risks. These have been effective in slowing
asset price increases and making lending more prudent, but could face operational limits if utilized
excessively. While the FY 2013 Budget is expansionary, this is appropriate in view of significant
expected leakage abroad, the tightening bias in monetary policy, and to deliver the goal of
enhancing productivity to relieve future supply constraints.
35.
Singapore’s financial system is highly developed, well regulated and supervised, and
risks faced by domestic banks—though significant—appear manageable. Since the previous
FSAP, domestic banks have performed well, based on diversified business strategies and a favorable
environment of low interest rates and strong economic growth. Key risks stem from high leverage in
the economy, elevated real estate prices, and future tightening of monetary policies in advanced
economies. On the basis of comprehensive stress tests, these risks appear manageable, although the
extent to which systemic risks have built up will become apparent only once the cycle has turned.
Therefore, further enhancing resilience by implementing a countercyclical capital buffer and
stepping up onsite inspections of banks’ credit risk are advised. In addition, banks should further
strengthen their foreign currency liquidity management practices to limit potential shortages during
periods of market stress.
36.
The buildup of leverage in recent years has heightened the sensitivity of the economy
to macroeconomic shocks and interest rate cycles. Property prices and interest rates may now
have reached a turning point, and with the prospect of slower GDP growth and possibly higher
unemployment due to ongoing restructuring, the economy’s debt­carrying capacity could decline.
Recent measures to limit the pace of credit growth are therefore welcome. Expanding the cover of
banks’ real estate exposure ceilings to include owner-occupied mortgages and encouraging
excessively leveraged households to divest some real estate holdings is also advised.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

37.
The financial sector’s regional and global interconnectedness brings its own risks. MAS
is addressing risks of cross-border contagion and protecting domestic deposits by converting large
retail branches into domestic subsidiaries and imposing asset maintenance requirements on
remaining foreign branches. Cross-border interbank liabilities, the bulk of which are intragroup, and
liquidity coverage ratios for significant foreign currencies should be closely monitored. The
authorities have adopted important legal changes and made key international commitments related
to anti­money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, and these should be
implemented in a timely manner and vigorously enforced.
38.
Addressing the challenges brought by a shrinking workforce and population aging
requires a multi-faceted response. As a small city state, Singapore faces limits on labor­driven
growth. Continuing to raise productivity is also needed to adjust to future declines in the resident
labor force, aided by the higher education levels of younger cohorts. But continuing to tap foreign
workers—though at a slower pace than in recent decades—will also be necessary to fill critical skill
gaps and smooth labor supply to guard against a large loss of competitiveness. Singapore’s
defined-contribution Central Provident Fund limits fiscal obligations related to aging, health care
and other social spending. Nonetheless, discretionary social spending will need to increase over the
medium term to ensure basic needs are met. Recent commitments to significantly strengthen social
safety nets in a targeted manner, especially for the elderly, are therefore welcome.
39.
From a multilateral perspective and taking account of Singapore’s unique features, the
external position remains stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals. In addition
to policy adjustment in the rest of the world, achieving a more balanced external position in
Singapore calls for increasing public spending, a more-even distribution of consumption across
generations, and maintaining a slower pace of foreign worker inflows, consistent with the
authorities’ current policies and commitments. A number of Singapore’s unique structural
characteristics may have also elevated the current account.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Singapore be held on the standard
12­month cycle.

Box 1. Singapore: Credit Growth and the Credit Intensity of Output
After peaking in 2011 at about 18 percent, the growth of bank and Housing Development Board (HDB) credit to the private
sector moderated to 13 percent in 2012. As a result, relative to GDP, bank and HDB credit to the private sector jumped from
157 percent in 2009 to about 182 percent as of mid­2013. Yet despite the recent cooling of credit growth, the flow of new
credit—i.e., the change in the stock of credit—has remained elevated at around 18−20 percent of nominal GDP per year
owing to the now­larger volume of credit outstanding.
The sustained large flow of new credit has occurred alongside a
sharp drop in the rate of real and nominal GDP growth. This
implies that the credit-intensity of Singapore output—the amount
of new lending required to generate a unit of output—has risen
sharply. Credit intensity has now reached levels observed in the
mid­late 1990s and prior to the GFC. Until recently, the credit
intensity of output was closely correlated with the pace of real and
nominal activity (with a short lag). However, the period since the
GFC has been unusual in that credit intensity has been elevated
while activity has remained subdued on a persistent basis.
Several factors may have contributed to the divergence between
credit intensity and output growth since the GFC:
(i) Purchase existing assets: To the extent that housing loans are used to purchase already-built properties, rather than new
construction, the effect of lending on output would be
weakened. The contribution of housing loans (mortgages and
HDB loans) to total credit growth in the recent period has
been much larger than pre­GFC, but similar in magnitude to
the pre­Asian crisis period. However, during that earlier
period, HDB loans were the dominant type of housing finance,
and may have been more closely associated with new housing
construction. This conjecture is consistent with data on the
stock of housing, where the annual increase in the number of
housing units was much smaller in recent years than pre­Asian
crisis and pre­GFC, despite the recent strong housing
1/
demand. Also, during earlier periods, growth of “other” credit
categories—possibly more highly correlated with real
activity—was much stronger.
(ii) Credit leakage abroad: In view of Singapore’s role as a regional financial center and the strong presence of multinational
firms, a rising share of credit may have been used to finance activity abroad. Because locally­incorporated firms are
residents of Singapore—irrespective of ownership—data on credit to the private sector may include a substantial part
that is used abroad, including for outward expansion by locally­owned companies.
(iii) Changes in corporate funding strategy: Within their overall funding needs, nonfinancial corporates may have shifted from
equity financing toward debt financing—both bank loans and bond issuance. This conjecture is consistent with the
observed decrease in IPOs at the Singapore Exchange in 2012 and increase in corporate bond issuance in recent years.
_______________________________
1/ While construction loans have also grown strongly in recent years, a significant part is used for “en bloc” redevelopment, whereby
an existing building is demolished and replaced with new construction that includes more housing units. Thus the net increase in the
number of housing units is smaller than in the case of a new development. The average age of private residential buildings in
Singapore at the time of en-bloc redevelopment is about 10−15 years (but somewhat older for HDB buildings).

Box 2. Singapore: Balance Sheets of the Private Sector
Households
Household finances are strong in the aggregate. Assets—half of which are in the form of residential
property—are more than 6 times liabilities, of which nearly three quarters are mortgages.
Nonetheless, household debt is among the highest in the region at 77 percent of GDP in 2012
(about 210 percent of household income), reflecting the high home-ownership rate and high
property values in the city state. Mortgage debt has risen more than 40 percent since end 2009,
and one third of outstanding loans are for non-owner occupied properties. Nearly all loans are at
variable interest rates. Despite the concentration of assets into real estate, households have large
liquidity buffers, with currency and deposits exceeding total household debt.1/ However, the health
of balance sheets is not uniform across households, and financial assets and debts are likely
concentrated in different segments of the household population, with implications for the ability
to absorb higher interest rates.
Corporates
Leverage in the publicly listed corporate sector has edged up, although interest costs are low. The
median debt-to-equity ratio during 2011−2012 increased in nearly all sectors, while returns on
equity and assets have declined after a short-lived rebound in 2010 (except in finance and real
estate sectors). Rising corporate leverage reflects an increase in bank loans as well as corporate
debt issuance . The interest coverage ratio (earnings before interest and tax divided by interest
expense) has declined since 2010 to about 6 in 2012, which reflects rising leverage amid subdued
earnings. With interest costs at a cyclical trough, there may be some pressure on corporates’ debt
servicing capacity going forward, in particular if earnings do not recover at a sufficient pace.
Domestic Banks
Domestic banks are among the highest-rated in the world. They comfortably meet minimum
Basel III capital requirements (with total and Tier 1 capital ratios of 17 percent and 14 percent
respectively at end-March 2013), rely predominantly on nonbank deposit funding, maintain
liquidity cover consolidated across all currencies in excess of 100 percent (but lower for
U.S. dollars), are highly profitable, and have limited maturity mismatches and very low
nonperforming loans (about 1 percent). Expansion by domestic banks into the region has
contributed significantly to their recent profitability as the banks took advantage of fastergrowing markets with higher interest margins. Loan growth in Singapore and the region has been
rapid in recent years, increasing banks’ exposure to regional and global effects of exit from UMPs.

Box 3. Singapore—Macroprudential Measures on Housing—A Historical Perspective
Singapore is a pioneer in the use of macroprudential policies (MaPs) to moderate financial
stability risks arising from the housing market. This usage dates back to 1996, when a package of
cooling measures was adopted amid sharply rising prices and speculative activity. Some of these
measures were subsequently reversed following the onset of the Asian financial crisis and with house
prices remaining relatively subdued through the early 2000s. A new tightening cycle began in 2009 in
an effort to cool renewed housing market pressures.
During both tightening episodes, measures targeted mainly speculative activity, while
protecting owner-occupied mortgages.1/ Buyer stamp duties on purchases of unfinished properties
(introduced in 1996), higher seller stamp duties on properties sold within four years (introduced
in 2011), and capital gains on properties sold within three years of purchase (introduced in 1996 and
rescinded in 2001) were intended to discourage property “flipping.” LtV limits were set at lower levels
for holders of multiple mortgages to reduce access to credit for investment properties, while
insulating households with single mortgages. Concern about speculative activity by foreigners and
domestic corporations led to the imposition of a higher buyer’s stamp duty for these groups. New
types of measures, including caps on loan tenors and debt service­to­income ratios, were introduced
recently to prevent borrowers from becoming over­extended.
Since 2009, the range of MaP tools has become broader, while some classes of tools have been
used more intensively.
Relative to the 1990s, in recent
years the variety of MaPs has
increased, with the introduction
of maximum loan tenors and
the total debt service to income
limit (illustrated in the chart by
a broader array of colors than
previously). Also, some
categories of measures
(e.g., LtVs, stamp duties) have
been tightened incrementally
over time (where introduction
or tightening of a specific
measure is shown as an
increase in the area of the
corresponding color)—for
example, by capping the LtV on
second and additional
mortgages at a lower level.
Sequential refinement of individual classes of measures has tended to introduce greater specificity,
and hence complexity, into the regulations. This highlights the inherent trade-off between minimizing
policy errors and closing loopholes on the one hand, and introducing administrative complexity on
the other.

Box 3. Singapore: Macroprudential Measure on Housing―A Historical Perspective (Continued)
Date
September 2009

Property Market Measures
The interest absorption scheme (allowing some deferment of principal payments) and interest-only housing loans for private residential projects were disallowed.
Loan-to-value (LtV) ceilings were lowered to 80 percent from 90 percent for all housing loans provided by banks (including for HDB flats).

February 2010

A seller's stamp duty (SSD) was introduced on all residential properties sold within one year of purchase at the rate of 1 percent for the first S$180,000, 2 percent
for the next S$180,000, and 3 percent for the remaining balance.
LtV ceilings were reduced from 80 percent to 70 percent for buyers with at least one existing mortgaged property.

August 2010

The SSD was extended to sales within three years of purchase, with rates depending on the holding period (the full SSD rate (i.e. 1 percent for the first S$180,000,
2 percent for the next S$180,000, and 3 percent for the remaining balance) if sold within one year of purchase, 2/3 of the full SSD rate if sold within the 2nd year
after purchase, and 1/3 of the full SSD rate if sold within the 3rd year after purchase).
For buyers with at least one existing mortgaged property, the minimum cash payment not sourced from CPF savings was increased from 5 percent to 10 percent of
the valuation limit.

January 2011

December 2011

October 2012

The SSD was extended to sales within four years of purchase, with the rates raised to 16 percent, 12 percent, 8 percent, and 4 percent correspondingly.
LtV ceilings were lowered to 60 percent for individuals with at least one existing mortgaged property and to 50 percent for corporates.
An additional buyer's stamp duty on residential property purchases was imposed (in addition to the existing duty of up to 3 percent). The rate is 10 percent for
foreigners and corporate entities buying any residential property, 3 percent for permanent residents buying their second or subsequent property or for Singapore
citizens buying their third or subsequent property.
The maximum tenor of all new residential property loans (including refinancing loans) will be capped at 35 years. This will apply to both private properties and
HDB flats. Refinancing facilities are also subject to loan tenor rules in that the sum of the tenor of the refinancing facility and the number of years since the first
housing loan granted to the borrower for the purchase of that residential property was first disbursed, cannot exceed 35 years.
If loans exceed 30 years tenor or if the loan period extends beyond the retirement age of 65 years, the loan­to­value (LTV) limit will be 40 percent for a borrower
with one or more outstanding residential property loans and 60 percent for a borrower with no outstanding residential property loan. LTV limit for residential
property loans to non­individual borrowers will also be reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent.
Additional buyer's stamp duty rates will be raised between 5 percent and 7 percent across the board. Permanent residents purchasing their first property and
Singaporeans purchasing their second residential property will now be subject to additional buyer's stamp duty rates of 5 percent and 7 percent respectively.
Permanent residents purchasing their second and subsequent properties and Singaporeans purchasing their third and subsequent properties will have to pay
additional buyer’s stamp duty of 10%. Companies and foreigners will be subject to additional buyer’s stamp duty of 15% on all purchases of residential property.
Loan to value limits on loans granted by financial institutions will be tightened for a) individuals obtaining a second housing loan (from 60 percent to 50 percent
for individuals, from 40 percent to 30 percent if loan tenor exceeds 30 years or if the loan period extends beyond the borrower's retireement age of 65); b)
individuals obtaining a third or more housing loan (from 60 percent to 40 percent for individuals, from 40 percent to 20 percent if loan tenor exceeds 30 years or
if the loan period extends beyond the borrower's retireement age of 65); c) non-individuals such as companies (from 40 percent to 20 percent).
The minimum cash down payment for individuals applying for a second or subsequent housing loan will also be raised from 10 percent to 25 percent.

January 2013

Measures on Public Housing: Cap on the Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) for housing loans to buy HDB flats (public housing) granted by financial institutions at 30
percent of a borrower’s gross monthly income. For loans granted by HDB, the cap on the MSR will be lowered from 40 percent to 35 percent. Permanent residents
who own a HDB flat will be disallowed from subletting their whole flat. Permanent residents who own a HDB flat must sell their flat within six months of purchasing
a private residential property in Singapore. An additional measure will take effect on 1 July 2013 to tighten the terms for granting HDB loans and the use of CPF
funds for the purchase of HDB flats with remaining leases of less than 60 years.
Measures on Executive Condominiums: The maximum strata floor area of new EC units will be capped at 160 square metres. Sales of new dual-key EC units will be
restricted to multi-generational families only. Developers of future EC sale sites from the Government Land Sales programme will only be allowed to launch units
for sale 15 months from the date of award of the sites or after the physical completion of foundation works, whichever is earlier. Private enclosed spaces and
private roof terraces will be treated as gross floor area (GFA). The GFA of such spaces in non-landed residential developments, including ECs, will be counted as
part of the ‘bonus’ GFA of a residential development and subject to payment of charges. This is in line with the treatment of balconies under URA’s current
guidelines.
Measures on industrial space: Introduction of Seller’s Stamp Duty (SSD) on industrial property and land bought on or after 12 Janaury 2013 and disposed within
three years of purchase. The following SSD rates will be imposed: 15 percent if sold within one year, 10 percent if within two years, and 5 percent if within three
years.

February 2013

June 2013

Property taxes : The progressivity of property taxes for owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties are increased. New rates will be effective January 1,
2014.
Total Debt Servicing Ratio : Total debt servicing ratio should not exceed 60 percent for credit facilities that are collateralized by property. Debt service on the
housing loan under application needs to be calculated based on a medium-term interest rate of 3.5 percent or the prevailing market interest rate, whichever one is
higher. Further, debt service on non-residential property loans under application is to be computed based on medium-term interest rates of 4.5% or the actual
rate, whichever is higher. Debt service on all other debt obligations is based on the actual debt service paid. Income needs to be calculated applying certain
haircuts to the variable component of income and rental income.
Refinement to previous measures: Borrowers named on a property loan are required to be mortgagors of the residential property for which the loan is taken.
Guarantors need to be brought in as co-borrowers if the borrower does not meet the TDSR threshold of 60 percent. In case of joint borrowers, income-weighted
average age of borrowers should be used in applying rules on loan tenor.

August 2013

2009-present

Measures on public housing: Maximum tenor for HDB housing loans are reduced from 30 years to 25 years. The Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) limit is also
reduced from 35 percent to 30 percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income. In tandem, the maximum tenor of new housing loans and re-financing facilities
granted by financial institutions for the purchase of HDB flats (including DBSS flats) were reduced from 35 years to 30 years. New loans with tenors exceeding 25
years and up to 30 years will be subject to tighter loan-to-value (LTV) limits. Permanent residents (PRs) will need to wait three years from the date of obtaining PR
status, before they can buy a resale HDB flat. Conditions for qualifying for CPF Housing Grants for (first-time and second-time purchasers)were loosened.
Supply of public housing and land sold to private developers has been increased.

Box 3. Singapore: Macroprudential Measure on Housing―A Historical Perspective (Concluded)
Date

Other Macroprudential Measures
Unsecured Credit: Financial institutions will be required to conduct comprehensive checks with the credit
bureau before granting each new credit card, charge card or unsecured credit facility. Financial institutions
will be restricted from unsolicited offers of unsecured credit facilities, unless a written request is provided
by the customers. More explicit requirements on disclosure of credit cards and unsecured credit.

March 2009

February 2013

Unsecured Credit : Minimum income requirement for credit cards remain the same but it will be lowered
from $30,000 to $20,000 for other unsecured credit facilities. An aggregate maximum credit limit for all
unsecured credit and credit cards across all affiliated entities will be set at four times the borrower’s
monthly income for individuals earning at least $30,000. For individuals with an annual income below
$30,000, who are therefore not eligible for credit cards, a maximum credit limit of two times the
borrower's monthly income will apply.
Motor Vehicle Lons: Loan-to-value (LtV) ceilings were introduced. For cars with an open market value not
more than $20,000, maximum LTV is set at 60 percent of the purchase price, including relevant taxes and
the price of the Certificate of entitlement. Maximum LTV for cars with a higher open market value is set at
50 percent.
Motor Vehicle Loans: Maximum tenor of a motor vehicle loan is capped at 5 years.

April 2013

Motor Vehicle Loans: Restrictions introduced in February 2013 will be lifted for a period of 60 days for the
purchase of used cars that were part of car dealers' inventory before the introduction of restrictions.
Motor Vehicle Loans: The scope of financing restrictions will be extended to all entities that finance car
purchases, including those that are not regulated by MAS.

Credit card and unsecured credit rules: Financial institutions will be required to review a borrower’s total
debt and credit limits before granting a new credit card or unsecured credit facility, or increasing the
credit limit on such facilities. Financial institutions will be required to disclose to individuals who roll over
their credit card debts and revolving credit facilities the potential cost of doing so and how the debt will
accumulate. Financial institutions will be required to obtain a borrower’s express consent for the amount of
September 2013 each credit limit increase. Financial institutions will not be allowed to grant further unsecured credit to
individuals whose unsecured debts with those financial institutions are more than 60 days past due, until all
past due amounts are paid. Financial institutions will not be allowed to grant further unsecured credit to
individuals whose aggregate interest-bearing outstanding unsecured borrowings across all financial
institutions exceed 12 months of their income for 90 days or more. These changes are to be implemented
progressively between December 2013 and June 2015.

Box 4. Singapore as a Financial Center
Notwithstanding volatile global financial conditions in recent years, Singapore has continued to grow
as a major international financial center:



Balance sheets of domestic and foreign banks total almost 6 times GDP (US$1.7 trillion). In recent
years, the “Big 3” domestic banks, accounting for about one third of total bank assets, have
expanded regionally (mainly in China, Indonesia, Malaysia), where credit penetration is lower and
margins are wider. Foreign banks operate mainly as branches, with funding from and lending to
all regions of the world, but with a focus on East Asia, including Singapore.



Assets managed by fund managers have grown rapidly over the past decade to US$1.3 trillion
in 2012. About 70 percent of AUM is invested in the Asia­Pacific region.



With average daily turnover equivalent to US$360 billion during the first seven months of 2013,
Singapore has become the third largest global fx trading platform, and the largest in Asia.



Singapore is one of the largest trading centers for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in Asia, with
a notional amount outstanding of S$8.9 trillion (US$7.2 trillion) as of January 2013, composed
mainly of interest and fx derivatives.



Singapore is a large regional player in the corporate debt market. Outstanding corporate debt
securities were US$189 billion (S$231 billion) at end­2012 . Issuance volumes picked up in recent
years, recording US$74 billion and US$110 billion in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In 2012, about
75 percent of all issuances were in foreign currencies. Among Singapore dollar issuances,
non­Singaporean firms accounted for nearly one quarter of the total.

Safe haven currencies are those that hold their value or appreciate during bouts of elevated global risk
aversion. Economies with safe haven currencies tend to be issuers of a reserve currency, have deep and
liquid financial markets, and may have a strong net foreign asset position. A safe haven is typically
identified by observing a positive correlation between changes in the NEER and the VIX at high
frequencies. Only the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc have exhibited this feature since the
onset of the global financial crisis (see 2013 Pilot
VIX and Singapore NEER
External Sector Report). This correlation has been

Singapore may be considered a safe haven “during

Sources: Bloomberg LP; and IMF, APDDAILY database.

Over longer horizons, on the other hand, several
structural features make Singapore an attractive
safe haven. These include its high sovereign
investment rating, large reserves, and strong banks.
In addition, Singapore’s monetary policy framework
may contribute to its safe haven status through the
appreciating exchange rate trend over the medium
term. This can be seen by comparing the variance
of the linearly detrended NEER at different
frequencies, where one observes a marked decline
at the annual frequency (see text figure). Thus, the
appreciating trend, combined with the reduced
variance, suggests that the Singapore dollar
provides predictable returns for longer-term inflows.

Box 7. Singapore: Financial Sector Spillovers
Banks operating in Singapore have gradually reduced their geographic specialization. Historically, domestic
banks maintained an almost exclusive home orientation in their funding and lending activities, while foreign branches
intermediated funds between jurisdictions outside of Singapore. Although this broad pattern still persists, it has
become less pronounced in recent years. Domestic banks have increased their regional footprint in order to diversify
lending into markets with wider interest margins and lower credit penetration, while also raising their foreign funding,
but by less than the increase in foreign assets. At the same time, liberalization of banking and financial regulations
encouraged foreign subsidiaries and branches to tap onshore Singapore dollar funding. Alongside this increase in
local funding, foreign banks expanded their Singapore-domiciled assets, thereby maintaining a “hedged” geographic
exposure. As a result of foreign and domestic banks’ expansion in Singapore and the region, banking assets stood at
close to 600 percent of GDP in 2012.

The cross-border expansion of banks’ activities has increased transmission channels for external stability risks.
Foreign branches, especially G­SIFIs, rely heavily on cross-border interbank funding, which tends to have short
maturities and the cost of which varies with global financial market volatility and perceptions of counterparty risk. In
fact, since the GFC, foreign banks in Singapore have increased their onshore funding at the expense of external
interbank funding in view of the scaling back of the global interbank market on concerns over elevated counterparty
risk. Of their remaining interbank funding, a higher share is now sourced from within the bank group, exposing
Singapore branches to potential liquidity shortfalls in the parent. While domestic banks do not rely significantly on
interbank funding, they retain some exposure to global risk sentiment because an important segment of their overseas
lending is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is funded in part by swapping out of Singapore dollars. The fx swap
market is vulnerable to rollover and repricing risk and may seize up during stress episodes. Regional lending may also
entail higher credit risk.
MAS has adopted several measures to dampen cross-border financial spillovers. Enhanced supervision of foreign
branches and monitoring of emerging risks are critical. Singapore’s regulation and supervision of its financial sector
was judged by the 2013 FSAP Update to be among the best in the world, as warranted by its role as one of the world’s
largest financial centers. Nonetheless, because foreign banks—including several G­SIFIs—are present in Singapore as
branches, this restricts MAS’s regulatory authority, particularly as regards capital, which is determined by the home
supervisor and held at the level of the parent. To overcome these limitations, MAS has adopted two policies:
(i) qualifying full banks (QFBs) with significant domestically-sourced deposits will be required to incorporate their local
retail business in Singapore as a subsidiary, and hence be subject to MAS regulation and supervision of capital; and
(ii) for remaining foreign branches, an asset maintenance requirement (AMR) mandates them to hold
Singapore­domiciled assets in proportion to their nonbank deposits booked in Singapore. This requirement may
account for the geographically hedged position of foreign banks. The AMR may have had a role in limiting foreign
branches’ drawdown of their Singapore assets at the height of the Lehman crisis. MAS also asked domestic banks to
reduce exposure to potential U.S. dollar funding shocks.

and other currencies. Historically, ACU and DBU were
analogous to foreign and domestic banks, respectively.
More recently, banks with full banking licenses may maintain
both DBU and ACU books, and DBU books are not restricted
to Singapore dollar activities. Thus, while the ACU-DBU
distinction has become blurred, data under an alternative
classification that would be more economically relevant is

Expected Impact of Risk
Medium to high
Financial activity generates
12 percent of GDP. The banking
sector exceeds 6 times GDP, and
Singapore hosts large currency and
interest rate OTC derivative markets.
Equities and gross capital flows are
very sensitive to global risk
sentiment. Real estate prices may
have become overstretched by
spillovers of lax monetary policies
abroad, and private sector
indebtedness has risen sharply.
Sudden retrenchment of interbank—
including intra­group—funding of
offshore banks may create liquidity
pressures and valuation losses across
a broad range of financial and real
assets, with contagion to domestic
banks.
Exposure to Europe is limited for
domestic banks; but significant for
offshore banks (about 21 percent of
assets and 28 percent of liabilities).
Medium to high
Very high degree of trade openness,
with exports around 200 percent of
GDP and trade­related sectors
accounting for more than 50 percent
of GDP. While direct exports to the
EU (U.S.) comprise only
10 (5) percent of total, indirect
exports through regional supply
chains are likely considerably larger.
China is a key link in the regional
supply chain, but Singapore’s exports
are not very sensitive to Chinese
domestic demand. China is the
second largest source of tourists.
Domestic banks’ lending to
corporates and banks in China and
Hong Kong SAR has grown to
above 20 percent of Singapore’s
GDP.
High
Profit margins of labor­intensive
firms are squeezed, leading to
erosion of competitiveness,
widespread SME closures and worker
layoffs. External and domestic
demand contract. NPLs rise on SME
defaults and deterioration in
mortgage quality on elevated
unemployment.
Medium
If risks are not adequately
addressed, changing perceptions
about Singapore’s good reputation
could lead to closing of accounts,
with adverse effects on the viability
of the industry, and knock­on effects
to related tax revenue and
employment.

Recommended Policy
Response
Ensure financial institutions
maintain prudent risk
management practices and
have adequate liquidity
buffers (and capital buffers in
the case of domestic banks).
Maintain close links with
home country supervisors. In
an extreme event, the strong
official reserve position
provides an additional
cushion, possibly
complemented by swap lines
with other major central
banks.

Provide adequate social safety
nets while re­orienting the
economy to cater to demand
from faster-growing regions,
including Asia.

Achieving productivity
improvements is
unpredictable in terms of
timing and amount. Avoid
overtightening the labor
market to prevent long­term
economic repercussions.

Effective implementation of
international AML standards,
particularly relating to
transparency of companies

evasion as a predicate crime.
Ensure service providers

Appendix 2. Singapore—External Sector Developments
and Assessment
Current Account (CA)
Singapore’s current account surplus narrowed by over 8 percentage points since 2010 to
18.6 percent of GDP in 2012, primarily due to a decline in the goods balance. This reflects both a
pickup in private investment relative to GDP and a weakening of the national saving ratio. Based on
EBA 2.0 methodology, the current account narrowing is structural, rather than driven by cyclical
output and terms of trade gaps in Singapore and the rest of the world.1 While rebalancing by the
rest of the world is likely to have contributed significantly to the decline in the structural balance,
Singapore’s efforts to reduce labor intensity, and the resulting increase in the REER, probably also
played a role.

Singapore has run a current account surplus since 1988, which widened as the saving rate increased
steadily. After the Asian financial crisis, the investment share shifted lower while the saving rate
resumed its upward trend and the current account surplus peaked at 26.8 percent of GDP in 2010.
Developments in the current account have been dominated by the trade surplus which has
exceeded 20 percent of GDP since 2001. The service and incomes account deficits have declined over
the last 10 years and the income account is broadly balanced despite Singapore’s large NFA position,
consisting of large net FDI liabilities (115 percent of GDP) that are exceeded by (non­FDI) assets of
338 percent of GDP.
Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
The CPI­based REER appreciated by 10 percent between 2010 and 2012, driven by nominal
appreciation and a higher inflation rate than in trading partners. This latter development differs from
1

Although Singapore is not in the EBA 2.0 estimation group, the relevant EBA coefficients were applied to the
Singapore data to derive the multilaterally consistent structural balance, which is estimated to have declined by over
8 percentage points since 2010.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

the historical experience when Singapore consistently maintained lower inflation than its trading
partners, with the exception of Japan (see Box 1, IMF Country Report No. 12/248). As a result, while
previously relative inflation dampened the effect of nominal appreciation on the REER, since 2010,
these effects have been reinforcing. In all, the CPI­based REER has risen by a cumulative 28 percent
since 2005, above levels just prior to the Asian crisis in the late 1990s.The ULC­based REER suggests
a much sharper real appreciation (totaling 64 percent since 2005), reflecting both sluggish
productivity growth and tight domestic labor market conditions. In contrast, value­added REERs,
which take account of global supply chains, suggest a more muted real appreciation (14 percent
cumulative since 2005).

Reserve Accumulation and the Financial Account
The financial account deficit and reserve accumulation are the complement to the current account
surplus. The volume of gross financial flows moves with the global financial cycle, reflecting
Singapore’s role as a financial center. On a net basis, the deficit tends to be larger when global
financial activity is strong, reflecting in part reinvestment abroad of income from foreign assets of
the official sector (the largest contributor by sector to net financial flows). Financial flows also
encompass sizable net inward FDI and smaller—but more volatile—net bank­related flows. However,
gross bank flows are sizeable, reflecting Singapore’s role as a financial center and have also exhibited
large swings. The nonbank corporate sector (which includes some SWF­related activities) is generally
associated with net outflows.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

As a financial center, prudential motives call for a large net IIP buffer, including in the form of liquid
official reserves, to safeguard against financial shocks. Also, because Singapore is not a reserve currency
issuer, reserves buffers may need to be larger than in most other financial centers. At US$262 billion
(94.7 percent of GDP), current reserve levels appear adequate, and there is no clear case for further
accumulation for precautionary purposes.

Standard Benchmarks1
Standard indicators suggest that the external sector remains stronger than what is consistent with mediumterm fundamentals. Based on the CGER equilibrium real exchange rate method, the real exchange
rate appears around 15 percent stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals (including
rapid population aging) and desirable policies.2 The CGER CA methodologies (external sustainability
and macrobalance approach) imply a CA surplus of 8−10 percent of GDP as the norm, reflecting

1

Singapore is not included in the country sample used to estimate the Fund’s External Balance Assessment or CGER
methodologies. In this section, estimated parameters from these approaches are applied to Singapore data.

2

CGER‐like and EBA‐like equilibrium real exchange rate approaches find the REER is overvalued. This result likely reflects the
inclusion of a fixed effect together with the U‐shaped pattern of the actual REER since the mid‐1990s, leading to a fitted series
that—for methodological reasons rather than fundamental economic considerations—is flatter than the actual REER series.

SINGAPORE

Singapore’s large NFA and lagged current account, respectively.1 Despite the recent narrowing of the
CA, CGER methods suggest the CA remains 4½−8 percentage points of GDP above its norm in the
medium term.
In addition to large fiscal deficits in major advanced economies, Singapore’s current account surplus
is elevated on account of policies and structural factors that boost the private and public saving rate.
From a multilateral perspective, and consistent with the authorities’ intentions, increased public
spending, a more­even distribution of consumption across generations, and recourse to slower
foreign worker inflows would help to further moderate the current account and slow accumulation of
foreign assets.

In the CGER macrobalance approach, the lagged current account surplus is itself the main contributor to the current
account norm (although no judgment is made as to whether past surpluses were themselves appropriate).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

Additional Considerations
Several of Singapore’s characteristics may not be fully accounted for in—or beyond the scope of—
standard empirical approaches, and these factors may help account for part of the deviation of the
current account from its estimated norm and add to associated uncertainty. While the CGER
macrobalance approach includes explicitly a dummy for financial centers and captures omitted
factors indirectly via the lagged CA, because Singapore is an outlier in these dimensions, it is
reasonable to conclude that their contributions to the current account are understated.1 Implications
of the following factors are considered below: (i) Singapore’s role as a hub for international finance;
(ii) additional structural drivers of saving; and (iii) the presence of multinational corporations that
could give rise to measurement and other issues.
The Impact of Financial Centers
Countries with large financial centers tend to have current account balances that average about
3½ percent of GDP higher than in other countries.2 Precautionary motives may drive this result in
order to build up large private and public balances as self-insurance against volatility in gross
liabilities.3 Additionally, because the current account does not reflect valuation changes, it may not
provide an accurate measure of changes in national wealth. This is especially relevant in the case of
financial centers, which tend to have very large gross foreign assets and liabilities, making the current
account a less accurate indicator of the saving-investment balance than in countries with smaller
external stocks. Also, higher per capita income that is typically associated with financial centers may
imply a higher private sector saving rate.4
Structural Drivers of Saving
Structural characteristics beyond demographics and high mandatory provident fund contribution
rates may have also increased the private sector saving rate. Singapore’s low labor share of GDP
relative to other countries implies a larger share accruing to the corporate sector (see text figure).
National accounts data on corporate saving is not available. If proxied by profit minus dividends,
1

In addition, the coefficient on the lagged CA in CGER is less than unity, and therefore would not fully account for
persistent omitted structural factors that elevate the current account.
2

Financial centers were estimated to add 3 percentage points of GDP to current accounts in CGER (2006) and
3½ percentage points in the External Balance Assessment (see IMF, 2013, External Balance Assessment Methodology:
Technical Background). This effect is in addition to the contribution from the lagged current account (in CGER) and the
NFA position (EBA).
3

Liquidity stress tests undertaken in the context of the 2013 FSAP update indicate that under a severe but short-lived
V-shaped shock banks could face a U.S. dollar funding gap of US$50 billion (about one-fifth of official reserves) over a
one-year period.
4

See Exchange Rate Assessments in Special Cases, SPR Departmental paper (forthcoming), which finds that the
coefficient on relative per capita income is higher for countries with large financial sectors implying a larger current
account balance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

SINGAPORE

corporate saving is estimated to account for just
over half of national saving in 2011.1 The high
corporate saving rate may reflect the significant
presence of foreign multinationals that—on a
global basis—have tended to retain a large part
of earnings in recent years.2 Moreover, corporate
profit rates are very high, with the gross operating
surplus averaging more than 50 percent of
industry value­added (over 65 percent in
manufacturing). Studies have found that
elsewhere in Asia, high corporate saving can be
partly attributed to weak corporate governance and limited access to finance; however these factors
are unlikely to be relevant for Singapore and, moreover, would not explain the globally synchronized
increase in corporate saving over the past two decades. In addition, aggregate household saving
may be elevated relative to other countries on account of greater income inequality and the higher
saving propensity of wealthier households. Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is higher
in Singapore than in many other advanced or emerging market countries (text figure).3

1

Corporate saving is estimated using data on profit before tax minus dividends paid (Table 15 in “Singapore’s
Corporate Sector,” 2011) and therefore may overstate corporate saving somewhat because taxes are not deducted.
2

From a theoretical perspective, high corporate profits should not boost national savings since, in the absence of tax
distortions and liquidity constraints, household saving would decline to offset any increase in corporate saving. This is
consistent with the Modigliani-Miller view of firms as a veil. Empirically, however, households are not found to fully
‘pierce the veil’ (see Poterba, J., 1992, “Dividends, Capital Gains, and the Corporate Veil: Evidence from Britain, Canada,
and the United States,” NBER Working Paper No. 2975; and Auerbach, A.J. and K.A. Hassett, 1991, “Corporate Savings
and Shareholder Consumption,” NBER Working Paper No. 2994). The evidence for Asia suggests a smaller household
offset of corporate saving than in other regions (see IMF October 2009, Asia and Pacific Regional Economic Outlook).

3

More than 13 percent of annual income was received by the top 1 percent of households in 2010, compared with
17.5 percent in the United States but less than 10 percent in Japan (Alvaredo, Facundo, Anthony B. Atkinson, Thomas
Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, The World Top Incomes Database, 22/08/2013, available via the Internet:
http://topincomes.g‐mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/).

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

MNCs and the Measurement of Current Account Balances
For countries with a large multinational corporation (MNC) presence, recent analysis has shown that
the measured current account balance may be a misleading indicator of national wealth
accumulation.1 One factor relates to the balance of payments treatment of retained earnings in the
current (and financial) account, which differs depending on whether the domestic firm has at least
one single foreign investor with an equity stake of 10 percent or more (FDI) or whether no single
foreign owner reaches the 10 percent threshold (portfolio investment). Switzerland is a case where
FDI assets and portfolio investment liabilities coexist.2 As a result, the current account is biased
upward because retained profits of foreign subsidiaries of domestic MNCs are reported as income of
domestic residents (Swiss MNCs), rather than attributed to the largely foreign portfolio investors in
the Swiss­based companies. In Ireland, the current account is pushed up by the presence of
“redomiciled publicly-listed companies (plcs),” that is, companies with major investments elsewhere
in the world that have established a legal presence in Ireland.3 As a result, MNC profits are paid to
Ireland, and if they are not paid out as dividends, the measured current account is raised.
Foreign MNCs have a significant presence in the Singapore economy, and many locate their regional
or international headquarters there. This is consistent with Singapore’s large stock of FDI liabilities
(262 percent of GDP). Moreover, there is some evidence that the substantial presence of MNCs tends
to elevate the current account (which is compiled according to BPM6 principles) relative to the
underlying wealth accumulation by Singaporeans. While Singapore has a large positive net portfolio
asset position (about half of which is equities), cumulating net portfolio investment flows since 2000
indicates a large negative “stock”—consistent with the Swiss case— and suggests the current
account surplus could be overstated.4 However, relevant data is not available to determine whether,
as in the Irish case, MNC profits earned abroad and not paid out as dividends are attributed to
Singapore from a BoP perspective.
Overall Assessment
Additional considerations beyond the scope of—or not fully accounted for by—standard quantitative
benchmarks are likely to make a non­trivial contribution to Singapore’s current account surplus.
While data limitations preclude quantifying contributions, their magnitude is unlikely to overturn the
assessment that the external sector is overly strong.

This “distortion” is distinct from possible differences in the underlying saving behavior of MNCs compared with
other residents.

Exchange Arrangement
Singapore’s exchange rate is classified as “other managed.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) monitors its value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to
maintain this value within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency.
Singapore has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for the preservation of national
or international security, which have been notified to the Fund in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Executive Board decision 144-(52/51). Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore
dollar credit facilities to, and bond and equity issuance by, nonresident financial institutions.
Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant
banks, finance companies, and hedge funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for
equity listings or bond issuance to finance activities outside Singapore must be swapped or

converted into foreign currency upon draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from
extending Singapore-dollar credit facilities in excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if
there is reason to believe that the Singapore-dollar proceeds may be used for Singapore-dollar
currency speculation. In a bid to contain a real estate price bubble, Singapore imposed additional
stamp duties on purchases by foreigners and corporate entities of residential properties in
Singapore.
Article IV Consultation
Singapore is on the 12˗month consultation cycle. The 2012 Article IV consultation discussions were

SINGAPORE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to expand the
range of publicly available data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would enhance the basis for
macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external and fiscal areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data sources and
methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted in 2006, resulting in
lower statistical discrepancies. (DOS) has completed the rebasing of Singapore’s national accounts to reference
year 2005.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base year 2009. The CPI
is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and composition of goods and services
consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published nor
provided to the Fund. The government publishes annually partial information on the interest and dividends on
these assets. Debt service payments on domestic debt made from the extra budgetary Government Securities
Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the consolidated public sector are not
published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report forms
(SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting data to be broken
down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: In February 2012, the DOS concluded the migration of the balance of payments accounts
to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The main changes relative to the 5th edition include:
reclassification of repairs on goods and goods for processing to services (from goods); reclassification of
merchanting to goods (from services); and treating banks’ Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as residents (previously
they were regarded as nonresidents, and hence their transactions were excluded from the balance of payments).
Data on Singapore’s international investment position (IIP) is not provided on a disaggregated sectoral basis as
suggested by the Balance of Payments Manual. Also, the IIP does not include all net foreign assets held by
Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation, although all associated flows are included in the balance of
payments data. The authorities reconfirmed their commitment to fully report the IIP data to the Fund
by mid‐2014.
Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These include the
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data;
and the dissemination of advance release calendars;
quarterly certification of the metadata posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board;
and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 13, 2013

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Singapore
On November 8, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Singapore.
Since the robust recovery from the global financial crisis, Singapore’s growth momentum has
eased and become more erratic. Growth decelerated to 1¼ percent in 2012 before picking up
sharply in the first half of 2013. This reflects shifts in G3 (U.S., Europe and Japan) demand
and global risk appetite. At the same time, the current account surplus narrowed sharply to a
still-high 18½ percent of GDP in 2012, and previously elevated inflation subsided to
2 percent as house and car price appreciation eased in response to restrictive macroprudential
policies.
Leverage rose strongly in recent years, with real estate a major beneficiary. Bank loans
expanded briskly, reaching more than 170 percent of GDP in mid 2013. Real estate-related
loans grew especially fast, and housing and construction accounts for 46 percent of bank
loans while household indebtedness is more than double household income. Nonetheless, the
increase in credit appears to have provided only a muted impetus to real activity.
After rising some 55 percent since 2009, house prices recently stabilized on intensive
application of macroprudential policies. Appetite for real estate by both residents and
nonresidents has been fuelled by very low interest rates, ample global liquidity, provisions in
the pension scheme that encourage house purchases, and the rise in the number of permanent
residents. Nearly half of household wealth is held in the form of real estate. An escalating
series of broad-based macroprudential policies has contained residential property prices.
Singapore’s large and highly-developed international financial center has continued to
expand despite volatile global conditions. Local financial markets absorbed expectations of
future tapering by the Federal Reserve and the accompanying turbulence in emerging

markets with limited volatility so far. Currency and equity prices weakened only modestly,
but long-term interest rates have risen by around 1 percentage point.
To address the dual challenges of shifting from labor-intensive growth and impending labor
force aging, the authorities have embarked on policies to enhance labor productivity. Foreign
worker inflows have been slowed and fiscal support for skills and technology upgrading and
higher wages have been offered. These ongoing structural changes will slow the pace of
growth, make inflation more responsive to an increase in demand, and permanently raise the
real exchange rate. Rising life expectancy will sharply raise the old-age dependency ratio and
increase the need for aging-related social spending.
The near-term outlook is for GDP to grow by 3½ percent in 2013−14, supported by stronger
demand from major advanced economies, despite some softening in regional economies.
Improved external demand will slow the adjustment in the current account, which is expected
to narrow modestly to around 17½ percent of GDP by 2014. A positive output gap and rising
labor costs are projected to raise core inflation, but headline inflation is forecast to stabilize at
2½ percent on smaller increases in housing rents and car permit costs.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ sound policies and skillful macroeconomic
management that have spurred the rebound in economic activity and kept inflation in check.
Looking ahead, Directors counseled vigilance against a reemergence of inflationary pressures
and risks in the financial and housing sectors, and stressed the importance of further efforts to
promote external rebalancing and address demographic challenges.
Directors concurred that cyclical conditions call for a moderately restrictive policy mix. A
tight monetary stance, reflected in the current targeted nominal exchange rate appreciation,
will help avoid overheating and anchor inflation expectations. Macroprudential policies
should continue to be deployed as needed to contain asset prices and promote prudent
lending. At the same time, Directors agreed that the modest fiscal stimulus in the budget is
warranted to enhance productivity and relieve future supply constraints.
Directors welcomed the 2013 finding under the Fund’s Financial Stability Assessment
Program that Singapore’s financial regulation and supervision frameworks are among the
best globally. They noted, however, that the rapid growth of credit and real estate prices in
recent years could exacerbate aggregate sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks and interest
rate cycles. Directors agreed that banks’ large capital and liquidity cushions, together with
appropriate macroprudential actions, will help mitigate risks. They recommended a

countercyclical capital buffer, stepped-up onsite inspections of banks’ credit risk, and
strengthened foreign currency liquidity practices by banks. They noted important legal
changes adopted by the authorities related to the regime against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism and called for vigorous enforcement of their international
commitments in this area.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that Singapore’s external position appears to be
stronger than warranted by fundamentals, suggesting the importance of further efforts to
narrow the current account surplus over the medium term. Directors accordingly supported
the authorities’ plans to raise public expenditure in infrastructure and targeted social
spending. The latter, together with measures to boost labor productivity, will also help
address the challenges from population aging and prospective workforce decline. A few
Directors considered that a faster pace of nominal exchange rate appreciation might aid
external rebalancing.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the 2013 Article IV
Consultation. The authorities would also like to express their appreciation to the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) team for a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of
Singapore’s financial system. The discussions in both instances were constructive.
2

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
The Singapore economy expanded through H1 this year, supported by the
strengthening pace of activity in developed countries. Growth slackened in Q3 2013,
however, with preliminary estimates indicating that GDP may have contracted by 1.0% in on
a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally-adjusted annualised basis. This reflected both a broad-based
cyclical pullback following the strong Q2 performance, as well as fresh external
uncertainties—particularly over the timing of US Fed tapering and the challenges faced in
some emerging market economies in the transition to less accommodative global monetary
conditions.
2.2
Singapore’s near-term outlook will be mainly influenced by the divergent growth
momentum in the advanced and emerging market economies. On balance, the external
environment should be supportive of a pick-up in the Singapore economy. However, the
authorities remain alert to the downside risks, as several legacies from the crisis remain
unresolved globally even as new pressure points have emerged. The global recovery could be
jettisoned by events such as a disorderly market response to the unwinding of unconventional
monetary policies and/or a sharper than expected deceleration in real activity in China. On
the domestic front, supply-side constraints could translate into larger-than-expected increases
in business costs and constrain the upturn.
2.3
All in, Singapore’s GDP growth is projected at 2.5–3.5% for the whole of 2013, and
is unlikely to be significantly different next year. This does not, however, rule out
intermittent volatility in view of the uneven and still-fragile external demand conditions.
2.4
Inflation was modest in recent quarters due to benign cyclical factors. External price
pressures were largely muted while domestic cost pass-through to consumer prices was
generally contained. As a result, MAS Core Inflation, which excludes the costs of
accommodation and private road transport, moderated for five consecutive quarters and
averaged 1.6% in H1 2013. CPI-All Items inflation fell to 1.6% in Q2 2013 from 4.0% in the
preceding two quarters as car prices also corrected sharply. More recently, however,
businesses have passed on more of their cumulative cost increases to consumers alongside an
improvement in economic conditions. As a result, MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items
inflation rose to 1.7% and 1.8% respectively in Q3, with the latter being driven also by a
recovery in car prices.

2
2.5
Over the next few quarters, while imported inflation is expected to remain subdued,
the pass-through of higher domestic business costs to consumer prices could intensify as the
economy gradually improves. MAS Core Inflation is thus expected to rise into 2014, and
average 1.5–2% in 2013 and 2–3% in 2014. CPI-All Items inflation should also come in
higher, and will be susceptible to swings as car prices adjust to vehicle-related policies. CPIAll Items inflation is projected at 2.5–3% for the whole of 2013, and 2–3% in 2014.
3

Monetary and Fiscal Policies

3.1
Singapore’s overall macroeconomic policy setting has been formulated to balance
cyclical considerations with regard to growth and inflation, while facilitating the ongoing
longer-term restructuring of the economy. MAS has maintained its current monetary policy
stance of a modest and gradual appreciation of the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal
effective exchange rate) policy band since April 2012, including in its latest policy
announcement in October 2013. While short-term external demand uncertainties have
emerged recently, domestic inflationary pressures remain at the fore given the tight labour
market. The slight tightening bias of the prevailing policy is appropriate for anchoring
inflation expectations and guarding against a wage-price spiral.
3.2
Singapore’s monetary policy framework is sufficiently flexible to accommodate
short-term financial market volatility and external shocks to the economy, by allowing the
S$NEER to adjust within its policy band. At the same time, the use of targeted
macroprudential measures have been an important complement to monetary policy in
responding to the unique circumstances presented by the extended period of low global
interest rates, and to ensure sustainable credit practices and financial prudence in the
economy (see section on Financial Sector Policies).
3.3
On the fiscal front, the FY2013 Budget announced in February continued to focus on
supporting the economy’s ongoing restructuring process and fostering a more inclusive
society. These included measures to incentivise businesses to improve productivity, and to
mitigate the strains on cash flows during the transitional period. Further initiatives were
introduced to promote social mobility and enhance progressivity. Pre-school subsidies for
lower- and middle-income households were enhanced and more support was provided at
school for disadvantaged students. In addition, there was an increase in the coverage and
payouts of the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme which was introduced in 2007 to
supplement the wages and retirement savings of low-wage workers and to encourage them to
stay employed. The tax structure for properties and cars was also made more progressive,
while one-off transfers were provided to households to alleviate the cost of living. These
measures have resulted in a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2013.
3.4
The authorities would like to highlight the importance placed on both equity and
financial sustainability, in the forward planning for increased budgetary expenditures such as
in social spending. Singapore adopts a targeted approach to helping lower income groups
through a range of government subsidies. For instance, while aggregate healthcare spending
is largely privately financed, the government funds up to 80% of the bills of Singaporeans
who are admitted to the subsidised wards in our public hospitals. This ensures that healthcare
expenses remain affordable for all Singaporeans on a sustainable basis.

Financial Sector Policies

4.1
Singapore’s financial system was assessed in the FSAP to be well regulated and
supervised. The locally-incorporated banks are in a strong financial position. Stress tests
performed by both MAS and the FSAP team reaffirm that banks in Singapore remain
resilient under adverse macroeconomic scenarios.
4.2
Over the last three years, Singapore saw an increase in credit growth but this has
moderated more recently. The growth of non-bank loans given by Singapore banks was in
line with economic growth in Asia and reflected Singapore’s role as a regional financial
centre. Domestic credit growth was broad–based, spanning both household and corporate
sectors. Singapore’s corporate and household balance sheets remain strong1, in particular
with aggregate household cash and deposits alone exceeding household debt. While
corporates in Singapore have increased leverage to finance business expansion amidst the
low interest rate environment, the median debt-to-equity ratio is broadly comparable to those
in similar economies and the median interest coverage ratio is amongst the highest in Asia.2
4.3
Nonetheless, the authorities have been concerned about pockets of vulnerability in the
system. They have implemented various measures to encourage financial prudence by
borrowers and strengthen credit underwriting practices by banks. These include restrictions
on loan tenures and debt servicing ratios for property and motor vehicle loans, and
restrictions on unsecured credit.
4.4
In particular, property-related measures have been calibrated to address the distinct
sources of risk, and to minimise spillover effects of excessive property price cycles. The
measures have been imposed on all banks, regardless of country of incorporation, as foreign
bank branches account for a sizeable share of total housing loans. MAS complements these
measures with rigorous supervision, including onsite credit inspections3 of the major banks in
Singapore on a regular basis. The authorities remain vigilant and will implement additional
measures where needed, while concurrently raising public awareness of the risks of
imprudent borrowing.
4.5
Banks in Singapore are cognisant of the risks posed by their exposure to mortgages
and conduct regular stress tests using severe property downturn scenarios. The mortgage risk
weights applied by the locally-incorporated banks are appropriate to the asset quality in their
portfolios. The overall non-performing loan (NPL) ratio on mortgages has historically been

1

The household debt-to-income ratio was 2.1 times in 2012, comparable to the ratio in most advanced
economies despite Singapore’s high home ownership rates. This was significantly lower than the peak of 2.6
times seen about ten years ago.
2
3

The median interest coverage ratio for the Singapore corporate sector remains healthy at close to 6 times.

Recognizing the potential risks in the credit environment, MAS conducted thematic inspections of banks’
underwriting standards on residential mortgages in late 2012.

4
low, even during stress periods, and was 0.3% as at Q3 2013.4 This is partly because the bulk
of these mortgages are for owner-occupied properties, for which the default experience has
been low. The FSAP stress tests found the banks to be resilient even under severe property
market stresses. In addition, Singapore-incorporated banks hold more capital for their
mortgage portfolios as they are required to comply with total capital requirements that are
2% points higher than the Basel III minimum.5
4.6
As part of their macroprudential surveillance efforts, the authorities monitor the
potential risks and impact that developments in global and domestic financial systems may
have on macroeconomic and financial stability. This takes into account Singapore’s role as
host to a large number of financial institutions with significant cross-border activities. In
order to mitigate liquidity risks arising from the financial flows intermediated in Singapore,
the authorities are looking to enhance the current risk-based Minimum Liquid Assets
framework6 by adopting the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio rules, with enhancements to
suit domestic conditions.
4.7
Regarding cross-border issues, the authorities engage in a high level of cooperation
with the home regulators of the foreign banks in Singapore so as to enhance their
understanding of the banks’ overall risks. The authorities also participate actively in FSB-led
initiatives on resolution and recovery planning for globally systemically important banks
which aim to promote coordinated responses in crisis management.
4.8
Singapore’s resilience in the face of several financial crises is the best evidence of a
track record of independent and effective supervision of financial institutions. MAS enjoys
autonomy in financial supervision and its legal and institutional safeguards have worked
well. As thinking on the appropriate institutional structures for effective supervision
continues to evolve in various jurisdictions, the authorities will continue to review current
arrangements to sustain a track record of supervisory resilience.
5

Medium-term Economic Restructuring

5.1
Beyond the short-term economic and financial developments, the ongoing
restructuring drive is imperative for laying the foundations for a productivity-led growth
model. The shift into higher value-added activities will help Singapore to stay relevant in an
increasingly competitive global landscape.

4

In addition, the average loan-to-value ratio of all outstanding mortgages is 47.5%. On an overall basis (i.e.
combining both retail and wholesale exposures), the average risk weights of the locally-incorporated banks are
around 45%, as at Q2 2013, on the higher end of average risk weights among banks globally.
5

Singapore has fully implemented the Basel III capital requirements, two years ahead of the timeline prescribed
by the Basel Committee.
6

The risk-based Minimum Liquid Assets framework requires every bank to hold a minimum percentage of its
qualifying liabilities in liquid assets.

5
5.2
The authorities have adopted a multi-pronged approach to facilitate the transition of
the economy. First, measures to incentivise businesses to raise their productivity through
process improvements and technological innovation have been put in place. Second,
significant investments are being made in continuous education and training to upgrade the
skills of workers. These efforts, alongside the higher education attainments of younger
cohorts, will allow Singapore to reap a human capital dividend in future years that will offset
the slowdown in labour force growth, as well as lift incomes.
5.3
Third, the authorities have taken steps to avoid an excessive reliance by businesses on
low-skilled foreign manpower. Notably, foreign worker policies are being tightened in steps
so as to raise the relative price of low-skilled foreign labour, and to provide firms the
incentives to make necessary investments in physical and human capital. The approach is a
calibrated one which considers the circumstances of each sector and each category of
workers. It also ensures that Singapore remains open to foreigners with the requisite skills to
complement the Singaporean core in its workforce. Companies are also given time to adjust
as the measures are announced in advance and progressively implemented. In addition, a
three-year support package, which includes the Wage Credit Scheme, was introduced to ease
the transition costs for businesses.
5.4
As the economy restructures over time, the productivity improvements from a more
efficient use of factor resources will help relieve supply constraints, support potential output
and real wages. The initiatives to promote social mobility and reduce income inequality will
enable all segments of the population to benefit from growth.
6

Final Remarks

6.1
The external environment has improved, but the authorities remain vigilant to
continuing external risks. They have the wherewithal to respond in a timely and appropriate
manner to secure macroeconomic and financial stability. The authorities welcome the
positive assessment of the financial system, and will review the FSAP assessment
recommendations and follow-up as appropriate.
6.2
Over the longer term, the focus is on a progressive restructuring of the economy, with
policies being subject to frequent review and feedback to take into account the pace of
adjustments among firms and workers. Indeed, because of the openness of the economy and
its limited resources, Singapore has always had to continually upgrade its industries and
exports to more capital- and technology-intensive production to secure its competitiveness in
world markets.
6.3
Finally, the authorities are pleased to inform the Executive Board that they agree to
the publication of the full suite of reports, covering the 2013 Singapore Article IV
Consultation Report, Selected Issues Papers, Financial System Stability Assessment report,
the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes and the Detailed Assessment Reports.
