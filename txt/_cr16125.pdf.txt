IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Lithuania

On May 13, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Lithuania.
Economic growth suffered a temporary setback from a difficult external environment last year.
Private consumption and investment expanded strongly, but exports were stagnant, reflecting
sluggish demand from trading partners, particularly Russia. GDP grew by only 1.6 percent,
compared to an average of 3.5 percent per year during 2012–14. Wages rose strongly in a
tightening labor market, but inflation was nonetheless slightly negative on account of declining
energy and food prices. Investment benefitted from high capacity utilization and a revival of
credit growth. Weak exports also meant that the current account balance moved from a surplus
into a moderate deficit.
Growth should pick up to 2.7 percent this year as the drag from external developments
diminishes. Domestic demand is set to remain solid—wage growth continues to be robust and
there still is pent-up demand for investment. Demand growth from export partners should be
somewhat higher than last year, with Russia’s recession easing and its importance for Lithuanian
exports already diminished. That said, risks remain tilted to the downside, reflecting the global
risks to which Lithuania’s small open economy is highly exposed.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the recent gains in macroeconomic
management, which have helped Lithuania advance income convergence with Western Europe
and weather a difficult external environment in 2015. While medium-term growth prospects are

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

favorable, continued economic progress will hinge on structural reforms geared toward
productivity enhancement, safeguarding competitiveness in a tightening labor market, and
addressing high income inequality while preserving fiscal gains.
Directors welcomed the completion of the multi-year fiscal consolidation effort, with the
structural fiscal position reaching balance in 2015. It will be important to preserve these hardwon gains and to build fiscal buffers while supporting growth. In this regard, Directors cautioned
against new unfunded spending initiatives or tax cuts. On the revenue side, they called for efforts
to strengthen tax administration.
Directors underscored the importance of continued productivity gains for a sustainable
improvement in living standards. They welcomed the steps taken to improve the business
environment and the authorities’ intention to modernize labor relations in a new labor code. In
particular, Directors emphasized the need to improve the employability of labor by boosting
training, addressing labor market mismatches, and lowering the tax wedge for low-income
earners. Innovation policies, with a key focus on company upgrading, would also be essential to
raise long-run growth.
Directors agreed that external competiveness remains intact, but underscored the need for
vigilance in view of emerging pressures. While boosting productivity is the priority, containing
wage growth until these efforts bear fruit is also critical. In this context, Directors recommended
a cautious approach in minimum wage policies given the potential negative impact on
competitiveness. The sharp increases since 2012 have significantly narrowed the gap between
minimum and average wages, which could harm employment prospects for the low-skilled.
Directors also urged close monitoring of non-price competiveness given the recent stagnation in
export market shares.
Directors considered high income inequality as weighing on macroeconomic prospects. They
urged the authorities to push ahead with measures that serve the dual purposes of boosting
growth and helping the disadvantaged, with an emphasis on measures to improve the
employability of labor. Redistribution policies, in the form of a more progressive tax system and
higher social spending could also be considered, to the extent they are consistent with social
preferences. Directors considered the “new social model” to be a step in the right direction, while
calling for careful consideration of its social and financial implications.
Directors acknowledged that the financial system is sound and welcomed the nascent credit
recovery. They urged the authorities to continue cooperating closely with banks’ home-country
authorities, adopt quickly legislation to address weaknesses in the small credit union sector, and
continue to support credit to SMEs.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook. Thanks to sound macroeconomic management and an overall
favorable business climate, income convergence with Western Europe is advancing. In
2015, sharply contracting exports to Russia temporarily dragged down growth. Ensuring
good economic progress over the medium term requires continued productivity
improvements, safeguarding competitiveness in a tightening labor market, and
beginning to address high income inequality.
Key policy issues. The Article IV discussions focused on policies to support inclusive
income convergence with Western Europe.


Productivity growth. Advance structural reforms, with a focus on improving the
employability of labor, company upgrading, and further improvements in the
business environment.



Securing continued competitiveness in a tightening labor market. Containing
wage pressures is critical for preserving price competitiveness in the near term.
Minimum wage hikes should be paused for now, following large increases since
2012.



Protecting fiscal gains. Thanks to a multi-year effort, the fiscal deficit has declined
by almost 10 ppt of GDP to close to balance in 2015. Going forward, the structural
deficit should be capped at ½ percent of GDP to ensure the gradual rebuilding of
fiscal buffers.



Improving equity. The initial focus should be on dual-purpose measures that
redress income inequality, but also boost growth. Redistributive tax and expenditure
measures should also be put on the agenda to strengthen economic opportunities
for all.

CONTEXT
1.
Good policies and favorable business conditions have helped put Lithuania back on
the convergence path with Western European living standards. After the setback from the
2008/09 crisis, Lithuania’s per capita income is advancing solidly again, reaching 75 percent of the
EU average in PPP terms. But the income gap narrowed within a context of slower GDP growth in
both Lithuania and the EU, breeding some discontent amongst low-wage earners and spurring
emigration. Years of fiscal consolidation, financial deleveraging, and policy upgrades led to strong
public and private balance sheets, and underpin internal and external balance. The financial sector
is comfortably capitalized, debt servicing burdens of households, and companies are low, and
public debt is relatively small (42.7 percent of GDP). Unemployment is close to its historical average
(9.1 percent), core inflation is low (1.9 percent), and the current account deficit is moderate
(1.7 percent of GDP). Euro area membership since 2015 has reinforced stability further.

2.
The main policy challenge remains to step up the advancement of living standards,
while ensuring that benefits are broadly shared throughout society. In addition to maintaining
sound macroeconomic conditions, this requires pushing ahead with a comprehensive supply-side
reform agenda to support productivity, protecting competitiveness in the face of mounting wage
pressures, and improving economic opportunities and outcomes for all.
3.
Many reform elements are in train or under consideration, but the definition and
implementation of a comprehensive package of measures will likely have to await the
appointment of a new government after the elections in October. The current administration
led by the Social Democrats is focused on getting new labor legislation, along with adjustments to
social benefits and pensions, through Parliament and containing populist pressures. Many of the

required reforms will be multi-year endeavors and will thus more likely need to be considered by
the government that will take office in December.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Last year, growth took a temporary hit from the difficult external environment. It fell
to 1.6 percent, less than half its 2010–14 average. Exports to Russia contracted by some 40 percent,
due to ruble depreciation, recession, and sanctions on selected EU exports—a shock of over
1½ percent of GDP, which was somewhat alleviated by export reorientation, primarily in the
transport sector. Economic growth was driven by a 4.9 percent expansion of private consumption

External factors caused the price level to fall in 2015, but deflation is unlikely to take
root. The fall in global energy prices pushed down fuel and heating prices. And food prices, which

6.
The external current account moved into moderate deficit in 2015 due to weak export
markets and strong domestic demand. Plummeting exports to Russia, as well as to the CIS more
generally, and imports buoyed by strong machinery and equipment investment made for the first
trade deficit in several years despite improving terms of trade. The income account also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

deteriorated because of higher profits of foreign-owned companies and lower remittances. But
thanks to the inflow of EU-funds, the capital account surplus more than fully covered the deficit in
the current account. Accordingly, the Net International Investment Position improved somewhat to
-45 percent of GDP.1 The external balance assessment finds Lithuania’s current account and
exchange rate to be broadly aligned with fundamentals (Box 1).
7.
The fiscal deficit declined further last year, reaching structural balance and
undershooting for the first time the level of ½ percent of GDP for the structural deficit long
advocated by staff. Despite the economic slowdown, the headline fiscal deficit declined from
0.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.2 percent of GDP, about one percentage point of GDP less than
planned in the budget. The revenue-friendly growth composition—key tax bases such as wage
income and retail sales grew much faster than GDP—together with incipient results from better tax
administration were chiefly responsible. Correcting for one-off and cyclical effects suggests a
negative fiscal impulse of ¾ percent of GDP. But, on the other hand, the government’s prefinancing
of European Structural and Investment Funds for the private sector provided a sizable boost to the
economy, which is not captured by fiscal stance and impulse calculations. Financing conditions
continued to be favorable with spreads on long-term government bonds vis-à-vis Germany
narrowing to less than 50 bps.
8.
Lithuania’s largely Nordic-owned financial system is stable. The CAR rose to
24.8 percent, the NPL ratio declined to 5.5 percent, the loan-to-deposit ratio has been halved since
its 2008 peak, falling to 100 percent, and net parent bank funding is down to less than 4 percent of
GDP. Thanks to cost-cutting measures, bank profitability has so far proven resilient despite revenue
losses from euro adoption and negative interest rates, although performance varies across financial
institutions. Recent capital injections into smaller domestic banks are welcome, but close
monitoring of these institutions remains important. Measures to contain weaknesses in the small
credit union sector are in place, but more fundamental reform still awaits parliamentary approval.
9.
Credit growth is resuming at a moderate pace. For the first time since the 2008/09 crisis,
private-sector credit growth moved convincingly back into positive territory, reaching 4.1 percent
last year. A pickup in credit demand and strong borrower balance sheets rather than a material
loosening of credit standards were responsible. Higher credit growth in support of investment is
welcome, but lending is not typically reaching SMEs, where forays of banks remain exploratory.
Continued support through government sponsored schemes using EU funds to improve SMEs’
access to financing, remains therefore important. With credit growth moderate, real housing prices
some 30 percent below their 2008 peak, and low financial depth, there is no evidence of imminent
financial risks emerging. Were they to do so, a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit in now in
place to address them. To maximize its traction, cooperation with banks’ home-country authorities
needs to be strong. It might take coordinated moral suasion to address run-away consumer loans

Gross external debt would have also fallen in 2015 had it not been for accounting operations related to euro
adoption that added some 10 percent of GDP in Bank of Lithuania external debt.

when banks are overcapitalized. Support from home-country authorities is also critical in the case of
cross-border loans to corporates.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
A moderate current account deficit of around 2½ percent of GDP seems appropriate for the
medium term. After registering mostly surpluses during the adjustment period following the 2008/09
crisis, the current account moved to a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP last year, as a result of collapsing
Russian import demand. While ongoing trade diversification should erase most of this effect over time,
other forces point to a widening of the external deficit. In particular, investment should rise as the
recovery from the compressed post-crisis levels fully unwinds. However, current account deterioration
must not go too far. Reasonable savings are required ahead of demographic aging and large EU funds
will eventually run out. Elevated external debt (75 percent of GDP) and a sizable negative Net
International Investment Position (-45 percent of GDP) also need to be taken into account, even
though relatively large FDI and inter-company loan components mean that there are no immediate
external stability concerns.
The exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Direct estimation of the REER,
through the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate approach (ERER) indicates that Lithuania’s REER is close to
equilibrium, marginally overvalued at 3 percent. The External Sustainability Approach (ES) shows that
compared to the current account that would stabilize Lithuania’s net foreign asset position
(-3.3 percent of GDP), the actual current account is somewhat better and the exchange rate is slightly
undervalued by 2.6 percent.
The EBA-lite methodology indicates that Lithuania’s policies are broadly appropriate, but finds a
moderate real exchange rate undervaluation. The current account norm is estimated as -4.3 percent
of GDP—a larger deficit than the -1.7 percent of GDP recorded for 2015. This result should be
interpreted with caution. The

account the current period of

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
With external drag diminishing, the near term outlook is favorable. Growth is projected
to be domestic demand driven again and to rise to 2.7 percent this year. Consumption should
benefit from solid wage growth and declining energy prices. Pent-up demand, high capacity

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

utilization, and low interest rates should spur investment. In contrast to last year, the drag from
weak exports to Russia is set to be smaller, with Russia’s recession projected to ease and its
importance as an export market already diminished. High frequency indicators for the first few
months of 2016 also point to a growth pickup. Consumer inflation is projected to rise to 0.6 percent
as the decline of import prices lessens. With imports growing faster than exports, the external
current account will deteriorate somewhat.
11.
Growth could climb to some 3½ percent over the medium run.2 This would still be
about 1 percentage point below the historical trend on account of worsening demographics and
the narrower income gap relative to the global economic frontier. Still, these medium-term
projections assume continued structural reforms supporting productivity and human capital
development, as well as measures to safeguard competitiveness. As the output gap narrows and
commodity prices begin to recover, inflation should rise and run again at a small premium over the
euro area target of 2 percent, reflecting Balassa-Samuelson effects.3 As a catching-up country,
Lithuania is expected to run a moderate current account deficit.
12.
Downside risks to the outlook dominate and mostly relate to external factors. Adverse
developments in the global economy would spill over primarily through trade channels. Volatile
financial conditions abroad could reach Lithuania indirectly via the foreign banks that dominate its
financial system, curtailing credit supply. Regarding home grown risks, wage growth in excess of
productivity gains could undermine external competitiveness going forward. On the upside,
improving domestic prospects could trigger increased reverse migration, setting a virtuous circle of
demand, productivity, and employment growth in motion.
13.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the outlook and risks. The authorities
were marginally more cautious about the prospects for a quick recovery this year. Like staff, they
saw medium-term growth somewhat above 3 percent. As downside risks they highlighted
developments in the euro area and Russia, as well as in China, which could affect Lithuania through
third countries. But they also saw a fair amount of upside risk, including faster progress on trade
diversification, bigger payoffs from current reforms, a jolt from the Juncker plan, and still lower
energy prices. Because of energy prices, inflation could undershoot projections. Neither European
supervisors nor the national competent authorities saw immediate risks to financial stability from
spillovers of potential financial volatility abroad through the cross-border banks, pointing to healthy
capitalization, ample liquidity, and much reduced parent bank funding. Potential risks to
competitiveness are on the authorities’ radar screen, but to some extent high wage growth is the
natural outcome of labor market tightness, underscoring the need to boost productivity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The overriding objective for Lithuania is to raise living standards through income convergence with
Western Europe. In this context, the discussions focused on three main issues: (i) raising productivity
growth through structural reforms; (ii) securing continued competitiveness as the labor market
tightens; and (iii) going beyond structural policies to reduce income inequality through fiscal measures
while maintaining a prudent policy stance. The authorities carefully consider all Fund analysis and
advice at the highest political level, and have implemented many past recommendations (Box 2).
Box 2. Implementation of Past Fund Advice


Fiscal policy. Fund advice focused on repairing public finances following the setback from the
2008/09 crisis. The authorities successfully reduced the deficit to a level consistent with the gradual
restoration of fiscal buffers. They are increasingly pushing ahead with recommended tax
administration reform. Calls for rebalancing taxation from labor to capital and improved spending
quality have resonated, but action is still at an early stage due to the complexity of such reforms.



Structural reforms. The authorities implemented a comprehensive list of recommended
improvements to the business environment over the years. The long advocated overhaul of labor
legislation is now underway. The authorities appreciated the Fund highlighting deficiencies in
education, health care, and innovation policies, but related reforms are longer term in nature and
mostly still at an early stage.



Financial sector policy. The authorities and the Fund saw eye to eye regarding the need to improve
oversight and macroprudential policies after the crisis. Related reforms have been implemented. There
is also consensus on credit union reform, which is now under discussion in parliament.

There is room to improve the employability of labor. Upgrading skills, right grading
skills, and lowering the tax wedge would help reduce still high structural unemployment, foster
efficient use of talent, and combat the shadow economy.4,5 Productivity would rise and economic
opportunities would improve, especially for currently disadvantage parts of society.


Upgrading skills. Resources devoted to active labor market programs (ALMPs) are less than half
the EU average and seven times less than in leading Denmark. There is accordingly ample scope
to ramp up spending while ensuring quality, and coverage should be extended to include those
at risk of job loss. A program for life-long learning would be a valuable preventative
complement.



Right grading skills. Lithuania’s tertiary education attainment rate (56 percent) is the highest in
the EU, yet skill shortages are a key concern for employers. Chosen fields of study do not accord
well with labor market needs and vocational training is underdeveloped. Building on the
recently launched “job barometer,” mandatory orientation for students that are provided
government-paid study places could be considered. Government should also review the mix of
the study places that it pays for to ensure value-for-money. The profile of vocational training
should be raised and made less school-based.



Reducing the tax wedge. The personal income tax rate of 15 percent seems low, but applies to
all income above the basic allowance rather than being phased in. More importantly, social
security contributions run at some 40 percent and apply from the first euro earned. Incentives
for low-wage earners to go informal are accordingly high. There is also a risk of benefit traps
even at modest benefit levels. A basic allowance for social security contributions could be
considered. Phasing it out as incomes rise would contain its fiscal costs.

16.
Company upgrading is instrumental for improved productivity. Lithuania ranks poorly
on innovation indicators, occupying the forth place from the bottom on the European Innovation
Score Board. The fragmentation of the innovation system and excessive emphasis on physical
infrastructure needs addressing. More cross-border clusters and competence centers promise
efficiency gains. Above all, more focus should be put on the promotion of more sophisticated
products, better processes, better branding and marketing, new markets, etc. rather than on
scientific breakthroughs that are difficult to commercialize. While supporting programs are already
in place, these remain limited in size and scope.

4

Structural unemployment was estimated as close to the double digits. See “Unemployment in the Baltics,” IMF
Country Report No. 14/117.
5

Estimates of the share of the shadow economy vary between 13 and 26 percent. See “Shadow Economy Index for
the Baltic Countries 2009–14,” The Centre for Sustainable Business at SSE Riga, 2015; and F. Schneider, 2015, “Size
and Development of the Shadow Economy of 31 European and 5 other OECD Countries from 2003 to 2015:
Different Developments,” respectively. Around the world, informal players are found to operate at just half the
average productivity level of formal companies in the same sector. See D. Farrell, 2004, “The Hidden Dangers of the
Informal Economy,” McKinsey Quarterly, June 2004.

17.
Lithuania’s favorable business climate can be further improved. Lithuania ranks 20 out
of 189 countries in the Doing Business Report’s assessment of regulatory quality and efficiency—
second only to Estonia in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). An important remaining shortcoming is
the outmoded labor code, which deters job creation and FDI. The new labor code proposed as part
of the “New Social Model” currently before parliament is welcome. It would modernize labor
relations. Key features include an up-to-date set of contracts; shorter notice periods and less
severance pay; more wage transparency; better labor representation in firms; and more training
opportunities. But the original proposal should not be unduly diluted—the establishment of a
payroll tax financed severance pay fund would be counterproductive, considering Lithuania’s
already high labor tax wedge. Other areas for improvement in the business environment are
bankruptcy procedures, which are lengthy with low recovery rates, and tight restrictions on
immigration from non-EU countries. Government proposals for accelerated procedures to grant
temporary resident permits for applicants with desirable occupations are welcome. “Labor market
tests” could be dropped altogether for those with pertinent skills.
18.
The authorities strongly agreed with staff’s diagnoses and the thrust of the proposed
reforms, but also underscored the complexity of the task. They were keenly aware that the
education system must be better geared toward labor market needs. Some reforms are already in
train, such as new curriculums in vocational training and initiation of apprentice programs, and, in
higher education, better connected universities and streamlined study programs. But the reform
process is complex because of the multitude of stakeholders that need to be brought on board.
Passage of the new labor code is a key priority. The authorities took note with interest of the idea to
introduce a basic social security contribution allowance, although a recent constitutional court
ruling to make social security more insurance-based complicated matters. They saw the economic
merits of streamlined bankruptcy procedures and more liberal rules for immigration from non-EU
countries, but both issues were politically and socially sensitive.

B. Securing Continued Competitiveness in a Tightening Labor Market
19.
Price competitiveness remains intact for now, but will come under pressure on current
wage and productivity trends. Because of fast wage growth and modest productivity gains in
recent years, unit labor costs (ULCs) have risen much faster than in the EU. In the tradable sector, a
cushion had built up in the post-crisis adjustment period when wages fell and productivity soared.
Moreover, company profits recently received a windfall from lower input prices for raw materials,
helping offset sharply higher wage costs. But these cushions now appear to have been largely
exhausted, putting future price competitiveness at risk unless wage growth decelerates and
productivity growth picks up substantially.

Wage pressures could persist over the
medium term. With much smaller cohorts born in the
post-Soviet period entering the labor market,
competition among employers for suitable workers is
bound to remain intense, pushing up wages. On the
other hand, recent fast real wage growth could also to
some extent be the result of downward inflation
surprises, meaning that real wages would decelerate
when inflation picks up. Fortunately, Lithuania’s labor
market appears historically to have worked well, with
wage and productivity developments aligned over
longer periods, self-correcting transitory deviations.6

Source: Eurostat. Reduced migration scenario assumes 28,000 net
emigrations per year through 2025. This is close to the historical
average of 25,000.

21.
At this juncture, minimum wage increases should be paused following their sharp
hikes in the past few years so as not to further fuel broader wage growth. Successive hikes
since August 2012 have lifted the minimum wage by over 50 percent and it now stands at
47 percent of the average wage. A further increase for mid-2016 is under discussion. While wages in
Lithuania are largely market determined, the government sets the minimum wage after nonbinding tripartite consultations. Historically, a minimum wage hike of 10 percent has tended to
push up overall wages by 3 percent. With the minimum wage incidence now significantly higher
than in the past, this pass-through has likely increased. With wage growth already problematic from
a competitiveness point of view, this is not the time for forceful minimum wage policies. Moreover,
the level of the minimum wage relative to average wages is now unusually high by international

standards. Adverse effects on job opportunities, especially for marginal workers, are likely much
stronger than historical experience would suggest. In general, economic considerations need to
come into starker focus in minimum wage setting, while the limitations of minimum wages in
addressing income inequality concerns need to be recognized. This could be achieved by
depoliticizing the process and giving independent experts a formal role.

Developments in non-price competitiveness
warrant more attention. Despite ULC-based price
competitiveness remaining intact thus far, Lithuania’s
export market shares have started to stagnate in recent
years, even excluding the Russian market. While
exporters have demonstrated nimbleness in
maneuvering a difficult external environment, stagnating
market shares suggest that the prices that Lithuania’s
exports command are no longer rising faster than those
of competitors. This in turn could well be an indication
of stalled catching up with the frontier as far as product
quality, mix, and sophistication is concerned. This
underscores the urgency of the productivity enhancing
agenda laid out above.

23.
The authorities agreed that competiveness warranted close monitoring and were
appreciative of staff’s emphasis on non-price competitiveness. The minimum wage was still
lower than in neighboring countries and significant adverse side effects had not materialized, but
the authorities agreed that it should not decouple from productivity developments, and intend to
carefully weigh all the pros and cons before going ahead with further hikes. They shared concerns
about recent disappointing productivity growth, though it could prove a temporary effect from
weak external demand, which generated slack in some companies. Lithuanians should not be
complacent about competitiveness—improving non-price competitivenss was particularly
important as the country’s future lay in producing higher value products rather than being simply a
low-cost producer.

Lithuania: Minimum Wage Pass-through
Minimum wage hikes are contributing to overall
wage growth, which could hurt competitiveness.
Minimum wage hikes are estimated to account for
one third of overall wage growth during 2012–15.
Economy wide, the elasticity of the average wages
with respect to minimum wages stood at some
30 percent, with considerably larger effects in sectors
with high minimum wage incidence. Analysis for
CESEE shows that minimum wages tend to weigh on
export performance of labor intensive sectors, as well
as on profits and employment growth in the tradable
sector.

low-skilled and young. At low levels, employment
effects are small and statistically difficult to detect. But once minimum wages start to substantially
exceed 40 percent of average wages, negative employment effects start to bite. For example, at a
minimum wage ratio of 30 percent, a 10 percent minimum wage hike reduces youth employment by
0.4 percent, but at a ratio of 50 percent the reduction rises to 2.8 percent.

80

Minimum wage policy alone improves the income distribution by less than is commonly
believed and needs to be supplemented by other policy tools. Minimum wage hikes may not raise
actual remuneration as under-the-table wage supplements (“envelope payments”) are regularized or
official working hours reduced in response. Moreover, minimum-wage recipients may be secondincome earners in relatively well-to-do households and the people truly at the bottom of the income
distribution are likely not to be employed at all. Addressing legitimate inequality concerns, other
policies need to be brought into play.

C. Preserving Fiscal Gains and Tackling High Income Inequality
24.
Based on the 2016 budget, the structural deficit is projected to be at a broadly
appropriate level, but there is no room for new unfunded tax cuts or spending initiatives.
Headline and structural deficits should reach 1.1 and 0.6 percent of GDP, respectively, essentially
achieving the staff-recommended ½ percent of GDP for the structural deficit. This level would
ensure a reliable gradual decline of the public debt ratio, beginning to reverse its sharp increase
since the 2008/09 crisis and building fiscal buffers critical for a small open economy in a currency
union.7 It would also provide for a moderate fiscal stimulus of some ½ percent of GDP to help close
the output gap. In addition, the government should allow automatic stabilizers to operate freely.
25.
The policy focus should now be squarely on fiscal structural reforms to generate fiscal
space. There is room to increase the quality of spending, notably in the areas of health and
education where the infrastructure is oversized.8 Tax administration is another area with ample
scope for further improvements—Lithuania’s overall revenue take relative to GDP is among the
lowest in the EU and this is not only due to low income tax rates and limited wealth taxation.9 The
resulting fiscal space should be used for growth promotion and lowering income inequality.
26.
Income inequality in Lithuania is among the highest in the EU and likely weighs on
economic performance (Box 4). Over 20 percent of the population is estimated to be at-risk-ofpoverty—a rate around 11 percent higher than the EU average, and considerably higher than other
CEE countries. The Gini coefficient and wages earned in the top decile relative to the bottom decile
also place Lithuania amongst the most unequal European societies. High income inequality may not
only be socially undesirable, but can also undermine macroeconomic performance: low income
households do not have the means to appropriately develop their potential and adverse shocks can
easily derail their efforts. Furthermore, it can spur emigration if people see their opportunities
curtailed at home. This weighs on potential growth and exacerbates output volatility.10
27.
In addition to dual purpose measures that are also desirable in their own right,
Lithuania should also begin to consider redistribution-focused fiscal measures depending on
social preferences.

Gross public debt as a percent of GDP did not yet decline in 2015 because of projects eligible for EU funding under
the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014–20 were pre-financed from domestic sources, adding to debt but not the
deficit, which is recorded in accrual terms.



Dual purpose measures. This agenda largely coincides with that to enhance the employability of
labor, which would disproportionately benefit the less well off (¶15).



Redistribution-focused fiscal measures. In Lithuania, the progressivity of the tax system is
relatively low, reflecting strong reliance on indirect taxes and flat income taxes. Social
protection spending is modest, because low revenues constrain all spending and also because
its share in total expenditure is relatively small. Fiscal policy thus redresses market inequality by
less than in most other countries. Rebalancing the tax system from indirect and labor taxes
toward wealth and capital taxation, and higher income tax rates for high-income earners would
improve income distribution. So would higher social protection spending, especially if directed
at unemployment benefits to allow for proper job search, active labor market programs, and
old-age pensions. These additional outlays could be covered by the space generated by fiscal
structural reform and potential revenue gains from tax rebalancing, so as not to undermine
overall fiscal performance.

The “New Social Model” addresses distributional issues to some extent, but the
financial and social implications of proposed measures need to be carefully considered. Apart
from Labor Code reform, the legislative package under discussion in Parliament comprises social
benefit and social security reform (¶17).


Social benefit reform. The principal change is a welcome improvement in the unemployment
insurance system—an extension of the benefit period from six months to nine and a higher cap
on benefits. There are also small adjustments to parental benefits, sickness pay, and the
accident insurance. Changes to social assistance are not envisaged.



Social security reform. Here the proposal would increase coverage to more of the selfemployed, small farmers, and heads of micro companies, all of whom would become subject to

contributions and eligible for benefits. This should reduce inequality. But at the heart of social
security reform is a wide-ranging reorganization of the old-age pension system: a new pension
formula, linking the statutory retirement age to life expectancy, indexing pensions to
developments in the overall wage bill of the economy rather than relying on discretionary
adjustments, shifting responsibility for basic pensions—the part of retirement benefits that is
not earnings related—from the Social Security Fund to the State Budget, introducing a cap on
social security contributions, and cutting contributions rates. The social and financial
sustainability and distributional consequences of the original proposal and any amendments in
the context of the parliamentary deliberations need to be considered with utmost care. Any
agreed new arrangement should be subjected to careful scrutiny before it takes effect, even if
this means that social security reform moves ahead more slowly than the other elements of the
“New Social Model.”
29.
The authorities agreed that more focus on income inequality issues is warranted, but
pointed to a number of constraints. They agreed that fiscal consolidation had been successful,
but cautioned that further efforts might still be necessary under EU rules, because of a different
take on the business cycle position and hence the fiscal structural balance. Moreover, aiming for
fiscal surpluses in the longer run may be prudent. Regarding income inequality, the authorities were
most concerned about the low absolute level of income of those at the bottom of the distribution
rather than their position relative to those well off. Accordingly, they largely subscribed to the
desirability of the dual purpose measures suggested by staff, but were not ready for a major
redistributive overhaul of the tax system. Smaller tax changes had already been implemented and
there was scope for further strengthening capital and wealth taxation in the medium term. They
also saw constraints on the ability to expand social protection spending significantly, because of
limited scope for further expenditure cuts in other areas and for raising additional revenue, other
than through better tax administration. Regarding the “New Social Model,” they considered pension
indexation beneficial for reducing income equality. They agreed on the need for careful analysis of
the effects of pension reform, including after amendments by Parliament, and for phased
implementation to contain costs.

Box 4. Income Inequality in Lithuania1
Transition to a market economy increased income
inequality by more in Lithuania than in other Central
and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Income
inequality kept rising through the mid-2000s until the
economic boom and the associated fall in unemployment
briefly reduced it. But the 2008/09 crisis erased the gains
and inequality has hovered around high levels since then.
Today, Lithuania is the fourth most unequal country in the
EU, after Bulgaria, Estonia, and Latvia. Upward social
mobility is also relatively low while downward mobility is
higher than elsewhere.

Income inequality pervades all sources of income. Income from dependent employment, selfemployment income, and earnings from wealth and capital are all more unequally distributed than the
EU or CEE average. However, income from wealth and capital accounts for a smaller share of total
income than elsewhere and, because it is typically the most unequally distributed income component,
contributes relatively less to overall inequality.
Lithuania’s income inequality is concentrated at the tail ends of the distribution and particularly
pronounced among the unemployed, retired, and unskilled. Comparing income deciles shows that
the contrast between what the top 20 percent earn relative to the bottom 20 percent is particularly
stark in Lithuania. The rest of income distribution is less out of line with peers. Dissecting by various
population characteristics reveals a concentration of income inequality among the unemployed,
retired, and less educated that is stronger than in the EU and CEE. Gender and age also make a
difference. These population characteristics jointly account for a larger share of inequality that
elsewhere, although they are not the full story of inequality by far. They jointly explain only about a
third of Lithuania’s income inequality.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Strong economic fundamentals and a favorable business environment should ensure
solid growth going forward. Growth is projected to rebound to 2.7 percent this year as the
external drag, notably from trade with Russia, eases and the expansion of domestic demand
remains strong. Risks are tilted to the downside, reflecting primarily the global risk balance.
Assuming the maintenance of sound macroeconomic and business conditions, and counting on
continued structural reforms supporting productivity and human capital development, growth
should rise to some 3½ percent over the medium-term.
31.
Multi-year fiscal consolidation has come to fruition with the structural fiscal deficit
reaching balance in 2015. These gains should be protected by capping the structural fiscal deficit
at ½ percent of GDP going forward, to begin reversing the sharp rise in the public debt ratio since
2008, thereby reliably rebuilding fiscal buffers critical for a small open economy in a currency union.
The 2016 budget essentially achieves this goal, but new unfunded spending initiatives or tax cuts
should be avoided. Public finances are strong enough to let automatic stabilizers operate freely.
32.
Productivity enhancing reforms remain the principal vehicle for sustainably raising
living standards and should be framed in a coherent package to leverage their impact. The
focus should be on improving the employability of labor by boosting training, addressing labor
market mismatches, and lowering the tax wedge for low-income earners. Innovation policies should
emphasize company upgrading more. As drafted, the proposed new Labor Code would address a
key shortcoming in Lithuania’s otherwise favorable business environment. The authorities should
guard against amendments that would weaken it.
33.
External competitiveness is intact, but could come under pressure. Productivity gains
have fallen short of fast real wage growth in recent years, unwinding previous competitiveness
gains. Buffers in the tradable sector have now been all but exhausted up. While boosting
productivity growth is the priority, wage growth will also have to slow. In this context, minimum
wage hikes should be paused for now. The apparent recent stagnation of non-price
competitiveness also needs monitoring.
34.
Lithuania’s high income inequality needs to be addressed. Beyond its social
implications, high inequality is also likely to weigh on macroeconomic prospects. Dual purpose
measures that boost growth and especially benefit the disadvantaged should be pursued.
Depending on social preferences, more redistributive fiscal policies could also be considered, which
would aim making the tax system more progressive and lifting low social protection spending.
Reforms proposed under the “New Social Model” initiative would the improve distribution to some
extent, but far-reaching changes to old age pensions need more scrutiny before becoming law.
Minimum wages have their role to play in income distribution. At current levels though further
increases risk compromising employment and competitiveness.

35.
The financial system is sound and the resumption of credit growth is a welcome
development. Financial soundness indicators are solid and access to ECB liquidity since euro
adoption in 2015 further reduced vulnerabilities. Legislation to fundamentally address weaknesses
in the (small) credit union sector is now overdue. The recent revival of credit growth is a boon for
the economic outlook, even though SMEs will continue to require support from government
sponsored schemes. There are currently no signs of financial excess on the horizon. Should they
emerge a comprehensive macroprudential toolkit is in place to address them. Close cooperation
with banks’ home-country authorities increases the traction of potential measures.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

2/ Total profits (losses) after tax. Interim quarterly results are annualised.
3/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans overdue more than 60 days. Untill 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
4/ Starting June 2008, non-performing loans are defined as the sum of impaired loans and non-impaired loans that are overdue more than 60 days.
5/ According to Nace 1 up to Sept 2011. Data according to Nace 2 thereafter.
6/ Composition of liquid assets and current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
7/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 138 of 9 November 2006.
8/ The large majority of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in euros, to which the national currency is pegged via a currency board arrangement.
9/ Specific provisions include provisions against general portfolio risk until end-2004. From end-2005, due to the change in definition of NPLs, specific
provisions are not directly attributable to the NPLs. Therefore, the ratio may be negative.
10/ Specific provisions include allowances for both individually and collectively assessed loans.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of January 1, 2015, the currency of Lithuania is the euro, which floats freely and independently
against other currencies. Prior to 2015, the currency of Lithuania was the litas. From April 1, 1994 to
February 1, 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at LTL 4 per U.S. dollar under a currency
board arrangement. From February 2, 2002 to Dec 31, 2014, the litas was pegged to the euro at
LTL 3.4528 per euro. Lithuania joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, and ERM II on June
28, 2004. Lithuania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payment and transfers for
current international transactions except for those maintained solely for the preservation of national
or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Previous Article IV Consultation:
Lithuania is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
May 28, 2015. The Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15246.htm and the staff report and other mission
documents at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=42970.0.
Safeguards Assessment:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) was subject to and
completed a safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, (the SBA was
approved on August 30, 2001 and expired on March 29, 2003) on December 10, 2001. The
assessment identified certain weaknesses and proposed appropriate recommendations as reported
in EBS/01/211. The BOL has implemented these recommendations.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP Update mission was completed on November 19, 2007. Fiscal and statistics ROSCs were
completed in November 2002 and December 2002, respectively.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT): Lithuania’s
compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, was last assessed by MONEYVAL,
the FATF-style regional body of which it is a member, in April 2012. The assessment report was
published in December 2012. Lithuania was rated partially compliant on nineteen FATF
Recommendations, leading to the application of the first stage of the Compliance Enhancing
Procedure (CEP). In response, the authorities amended the Criminal Code and the AML/CFT Law and
put in place secondary legislation and guidelines. This extended the list of punishable activities,
criminalized financing of terrorism, reorganized the suspicious transactions reporting system,
strengthened customer due diligence, and extended record keeping requirements. Lithuania has
submitted to date three compliance reports under the CEP procedure. In recognition of the progress
achieved in the key areas of concern, MONEYVAL ended the CEP at step 1 in April 2015, but
recommended that the authorities address the remaining deficiencies and ensure effective
implementation of its AML/CFT framework in order to exit the regular follow-up procedures. At the
50th Plenary meeting in April 2016, the Moneyval Secretariat acknowledged progress made by
Lithuania but noted that further progress is needed with respect to R.5, R.13/SR.IV and SR.III. A
decision to exit follow-up procedures is now expected in December 2016. Lithuania is scheduled to
undergo the fifth round of mutual evaluation under the revised FATF methodology in the second
quarter of 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a macroeconomic
database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes. Lithuania subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and its metadata have been posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS
specifications for coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance
release calendars. A significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various
websites through the Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC data module was
published in November 2002. Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is considered adequate.
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) in accordance with the
guidelines of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) from 2005 data onwards (data before
2005 still follow the European System of Accounts 1995, ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at
constant prices are compiled using the production, expenditure and income approaches. GDP estimates by
production are considered to be more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure and
income, but no statistical discrepancies between these three estimates are shown separately in the
published figures as the discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories (expenditure
approach) and operating surplus and mixed income (income approach). The annual and the quarterly
national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2010. In general, good data
sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national accounts, but measuring activity
during the volatile environment of the 2008/09 crisis proved challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain in
measuring the non-observed economy. These estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic
activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006, and in 2011. According to the most recent updates, the non-observed economy was
estimated to be 28.5 percent of GDP in 2012.
Price Statistics: The main statistical data source for the production of the CPI is a monthly statistical survey
on prices for consumer goods and services. Information published in the legal acts of state institutions,
catalogues, pricelists, and on enterprises’ websites is also used. The price survey covers the entire territory
of the country, and data is collected in small, medium, and large towns. The CPI covers consumption
expenditure of the residents of the country and is the main instrument of indexation. The authorities also
produce the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which is used to measure inflation in the EU and
is fully comparable across countries. In addition to the consumption expenditure of residents, the HICP
covers also consumption expenditure of non-residents and foreign visitors but excludes financial
intermediation services and games of chance. Differences in coverage and hence weighting account for
most of the differences in the value of the CPI and HICP. Since December 1998, CPI weights have been
updated annually. The base period for the CPI is 2010 and for the HICP is 2005 (first year of data
availability). The monthly CPI and HICP are available in the second week following the reference month. The
producer price index is calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated
every year.

Government Finance Statistics: Data on the central government budget execution are available at a
monthly and quarterly frequency. The ongoing treasury project is expected to improve fiscal data quality
substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment of public health care providers and
of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for government operations. A new methodology,
incorporating the GFSM 2014, was adopted in October 2014. Annual and quarterly historical data have
been converted into the GFSM 2014 format back to 2010, with data before 2010 still in the GFSM 2001
format. Administrative data sources include the Ministry of Finance, State Social Insurance Fund Board
(Sodra), Compulsory Health Insurance Fund, Employment Fund, and financial statements of enterprises. The
MoF is reporting to STA general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). In addition, the MoF is reporting quarterly and
monthly data for publication in the IFS.
Monetary Statistics: The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on
a timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line with the
guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following Lithuania’s accession to the
European Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for compiling and reporting monetary data
reflecting the ECB regulations and ESA 2010 on sectorization, valuation and classification of financial
instruments.
Balance of Payments: The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment
position (IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on balance
of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular basis. Balance of
payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the format recommended in the
Balance of Payments Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) from 2004 data onwards (data before 2004 still follow
the BPM5 methodology). The monthly data correspond to several key balance of payments components,
compiled on the basis of a sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some
nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked to the Fund’s
DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in the World Bank’s Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Data Standards and Quality: The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data is available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on
the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt/statistical_data_tree) provides data on monetary statistics,
treasury bill auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic
indicators;



the SL website (http://osp.stat.gov.lt) provides monthly and quarterly information on economic
and social development indicators;

Statement by Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for the Repulic of Lithuania
and Rimtautas Bartkus, Senior Advisor
May 13, 2016

The Lithuanian authorities highly appreciate the engaging discussions with the IMF
staff and their well-articulated policy advice that is taken into consideration in policy design.
The authorities have made significant progress over the recent years in enhancing the
economic and financial resilience, correcting the past imbalances, and upgrading the policy
frameworks. The macroeconomic stability has been restored and Lithuania has joined the
euro area from a position of strength. The authorities have subscribed to the enhanced
economic policy coordination of the euro area, anchoring their commitments to policy
prudence that is of essence for successful functioning in the currency union.
Economic outlook
Due to the unfavourable external environment, the economic growth decelerated to
1.6 percent in 2015, though it is expected to improve going forward. Low energy prices had
an overall positive effect on the economy, but the recessional environment in the CIS region,
together with the sanctions applied by the Russian Federation took a toll on the export
performance. In 2015, the merchandise export to the CIS region contracted by almost a third
and the services export shrunk by a fourth. A successful export reorientation somewhat
mitigated the external demand shock and the real exports of goods and services turned out
even higher than a year ago, though the domestic demand remained the principle driver of the
economy.
The business sentiment fluctuated through the year, but did not deteriorate.
Investment has been encouraged by high capacity utilization, increased absorption of EU
structural funds, and activity in the real-estate sector. Higher real disposable income and
improvement in the labour market boosted consumer confidence. Wages have increased by
5.1 percent as a result of higher minimum wage and increasing wage pressures in some
sectors. The unemployment rate has declined to 9.1 percent in 2015 and is projected to
improve by further 0.6 percentage points in 2016. The inflation forecast has been revised
downwards due to stronger than anticipated decline in energy prices and only a modest
0.5 percent increase in prices is expected this year.
As the external drag softens, economic growth is expected to reach 2.5 percent in
2016, narrowing the output gap. The risks to the outlook, however, remain tilted to the
downside and mostly relate to the external side, notably a possible increase in the commodity
prices and developments in the key export markets. The entrenchment of low inflation
environment in the euro area, higher volatility in global financial markets, renewed pressures
in the Schengen area, and political instability in the EU are other risk factors. On the upside,
possible depreciation of the euro would support exports and the external demand may turn

2
out generally stronger. The shrinking labour force is a more inherent policy challenge. The
authorities contemplate measures that should contribute to raising economic growth
potential, will strengthen the long-term fiscal sustainability and alleviate effects of current
demographic trends.
Economic policies
The fiscal outturn over-performed the 2015 budget plan by a significant margin as the
key tax bases grew faster than the GDP. The headline deficit declined to 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2015 and is expected to increase to around 0.8 percent of GDP this year. The 2016 budget
includes measures supporting the low income earners – an increase in the minimum wage,
the basic income tax allowance, pensions and public sector wages. In fulfilling external
obligations, the authorities have also reached a broad political agreement on the accelerated
increase in the defence expenditure. On the revenue side, the authorities increased excise
taxes, adjusted the capital taxation, and made progress in tax administration.
Close-to-balanced public finances facilitate implementation of structural reforms.
Lithuania maintains one of the lowest levels of tax revenue to GDP in the EU, though some
of the public functions are underfinanced and the income inequality is high. The authorities
aim to alter this balance over the medium term, shifting towards a more appropriate level of
redistribution that is sufficient to provide adequate social services and reduce income
inequality. In addition, Lithuania has accelerated accumulation of the fiscal buffer based on
the amended State Treasury Law and respective parliamentary resolution, enforced since the
beginning of 2016. From this year onwards, half of the state budget revenue generated from
assets-related transactions will be transferred to the Reserve Fund.
Smart implementation of fiscal structural reforms requires well-sequenced,
multifaceted policy efforts that, among other things, reallocate resources towards a more
productive use, for example by addressing the oversized infrastructure in the health care and
education sectors. At the current juncture, the authorities’ attention is focused on the labour
market, education, and social security reforms that aim to improve labour market flexibility,
non-price competitiveness, develop higher productivity sectors, address skill mismatches,
and increase social inclusion. The 2016 stability program and the national reform agenda also
recognize the need to gradually increase the environmental taxation.
In June 2015, the Government approved the legislative reforms of the social sector,
the so-called New Social Model. The reform package that is currently under consideration by
the Parliament proposes amendments to the Labour Code, the Employment Law, the
Unemployment Social Insurance Law, the State Social Insurance Pensions Law, and other
laws. These reforms aim to balance the multiple objectives: increase the adequacy of social
safety nets, enhance labour market flexibility, facilitate integration in the labour market
through better use of active labour market policies, and reduce incentives for informal work.
The New Social Model also aims to amend the pension formula, introducing the well-defined

3
pension indexation, strengthening the link between benefits and contributions, separating the
basic pension from the social insurance and transferring it to the state budget. The authorities
estimate that the envisaged reform measures should allow for securing a long-term balance in
the pension system.
Financial sector
The Lithuanian banking sector is well capitalized and liquid, profitability remains
stable, and the prudential requirements are met with comfortable margins. The statutory
liquidity requirement is exceeded by nearly a third, at 24.8 percent the capital adequacy ratio
is also more than twice the regulatory requirement. Even under the severe shock scenario the
banking sector would stay above the capital requirement. The quality of the banks’ capital is
high, consisting almost entirely of the core tier one capital. Banks have limited external
exposures and are predominantly funded through domestic deposits, with the loan-to-deposit
ratio at 100 percent. Since joining the euro area, the banks have also gained access to the
Eurosystem liquidity. The banking sector’s profitability has been supported by further cost
optimization, offsetting the changeover related losses in the commission income and falling
net interest income. Despite the low interest rate environment, the net interest rate margins
have remained stable.
The credit growth has resumed in 2015 and the quality of the loan portfolio continued
to improve. During the five years of deleveraging the private sector loan portfolio shrunk by
25 percentage points to 41 percent of GDP – the lowest level in the euro area. The level of
NPLs has been reduced almost fourfold from its peak in 2010 and currently stands at
5.5 percent. The recognition of previous losses is largely complete and the quality of the loan
portfolio is further enhanced by the improved financial standing of the borrowers. The credit
to private sector increased by 4.1 percent in 2015. The results of the lending surveys, high
capacity utilization in the corporate sector, and an increasing demand for durable goods
among the households allow expecting the positive trends in crediting to be sustained in
2016. The situation in the housing sector is viewed as balanced; the average prices have
increased by 3.4 percent on an annual basis. There are no signs of pressures or imbalances;
most of the transactions are financed from own funds, with only less than a third of the
transactions requiring credit financing.
In implementing its macro-prudential mandate, the Bank of Lithuania (BoL)
approved the macro-prudential policy strategy, clarifying the policy objectives and the
decision making processes. Aiming to safeguard the borrowers from excessive debt
accumulation in the low interest rate environment, the BoL amended the Responsible
Lending Regulations. The maximum loan maturity was shortened from 40 to 30 years. The
interest rate sensitivity of the DSTI requirement has been reduced, while providing limited
flexibility to apply a higher DSTI ratio under specific circumstances without compromising
the macro-prudential objectives. After transposing the CRD IV directive into the national
law, the BoL activated a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer and set the countercyclical

4
capital buffer. Given the absence of the cyclical imbalances in the credit market, the
countercyclical capital buffer was set at 0 percent. The BoL also calibrated the O-SII buffers
for the 4 systemically important banks that will come into force in December 2016.
A comprehensive systemic reform of the credit union sector has been prepared and
currently awaits the final approval by the Parliament. The BoL has also introduced the capital
requirement for the credit unions highly exposed to the corporate sector, strengthened the
liquidity requirements for the fast growing entities, and adopted a regulation limiting the
market risk associated with investment in debt securities.
