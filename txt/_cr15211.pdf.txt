IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the
Russian Federation
On July 29, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Russian Federation.
Russia entered 2014 with declining potential growth owing to the stabilization of oil prices,
stalled structural reforms, weak investment, declining total factor productivity and adverse
population dynamics. In addition, the ongoing slowdown was exacerbated by the dual
external shocks from the sharp decline in oil prices and sanctions.
The authorities took measures to stabilize the economy and the financial system. The sharp
decline in oil prices and sanctions led to severe pressure on the ruble, a surge in inflation,
market turbulence, and concerns over financial stability. In response, the authorities
(i) accelerated the move to a floating exchange rate, raised policy rates and increased FX
liquidity; (ii) introduced temporary regulatory forbearance and a capital support program;
and (iii) provided some fiscal stimulus and limited wage indexation to support the
disinflationary process.
Russia is expected to be in recession in 2015 due to the sharp drop in oil prices and sanctions.
GDP is expected to decline by 3.4 percent driven by a contraction in domestic demand
weighed down by falling real wages, higher cost of capital, and weakened confidence. The
external position will remain challenging due to deleveraging in the face of limited market
access. Inflation is expected to come down due to the dissipating impact of the ruble
depreciation, the limited wage indexation in the budget and the recession. Growth should
resume in 2016 while inflation continues to decline. However, the recovery is unlikely to be
strong as the limiting factors behind decelerating potential growth will take time to be
addressed, leading to medium-term growth of 1.5 percent per year. An increase in
geopolitical tensions is the main risk to the outlook.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the policy actions taken by the authorities to stabilize the
economy in light of the significant stress created by lower oil prices and sanctions.
Pre-existing structural weaknesses also contributed to this difficult situation. Directors
concurred that continued prudent policies and reforms will be necessary to ensure
macroeconomic stability and boost potential growth.
Directors agreed that a supportive fiscal stance is appropriate at present, given cyclical
considerations and available fiscal space. However, they highlighted that quasi-fiscal
operations should be limited and coordinated to avoid an overly stimulative impulse. For the
medium term, Directors called for a gradual fiscal tightening to adjust to lower oil prices and
rebuild buffers. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to revisit the fiscal
rule so that the oil price benchmark better reflects market developments. Directors also
underscored the need for permanent and credible fiscal measures, including pension reform,
reduction of energy subsidies, and better targeting of social transfers.
Directors concurred that monetary easing should continue at a pace commensurate with the
decline in underlying inflation and inflation expectations as external and financial stability
risks abate. Noting the foreign exchange purchase program to rebuild precautionary buffers,
they encouraged the authorities to ensure that it is consistent with inflation targeting.
Directors noted that policies have been successful in stabilizing the banking system. They
highlighted the need to support individual banks according to their specific capital needs
while adjusting the parameters of the capital support program to strengthen incentives and
minimize cost to the public sector. Directors encouraged the authorities to phase-out
regulatory forbearance along with the implementation of the capital support program and
better align Russia’s resolution framework to best international practices. They also saw a
need for reducing banking sector fragmentation and encouraging competition among banks,
by stepping up supervision and moving toward the adoption of Basel III capital standards.
Directors emphasized that accelerating the pace of structural reforms is key to raising
Russia’s potential growth. In this context, they noted that priority should be given to further
measures aimed at strengthening governance and property rights and streamlining regulation.
Directors also emphasized the need to reduce trade barriers, improve the transparency and
efficiency of public investment, and increase competition in domestic markets. They noted
that reinvigorating the privatization agenda, as soon as market conditions permit, would
enhance economic efficiency. In addition, Directors highlighted that a deeper and more
efficient financial system would improve the allocation of capital and boost potential growth.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

RUSSIAN FEDERATION
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 2, 2015

KEY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Context. Growth was anemic in 2014, reflecting preexisting structural bottlenecks
exacerbated by geopolitical uncertainty and sanctions. The ruble depreciated for the
most part of 2014 and came under severe pressures at the end of the year due to the
sharp decline in oil prices and the intensification of sanctions. As a result, inflation
accelerated sharply. In response, the shift to a flexible exchange rate was accelerated and
monetary policy was tightened significantly. Measures to stabilize the banking system
were introduced, including a bank capital support plan. The authorities’ policy response
stabilized the economy. However, structural reforms have remained stalled.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. The fiscal policy stance for 2015 appropriately
allows for limited stimulus. Monetary policy normalization should continue at a prudent
pace, commensurate with the decline in underlying inflation and inflation expectations.
The size of the bank capital support program appears to be sufficiently large, but the
parameters of the program should be adjusted to strengthen incentives for banks to seek
private capital and reduce cost to the public sector.
Medium-term policy challenges. An ambitious and credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation program is necessary to adjust to lower oil prices. Changes to the fiscal rule
should be considered to support medium-term fiscal sustainability. Boosting potential
growth will require implementation of structural reforms. This would include
(i) strengthening governance and protection of property rights; (ii) lowering
administrative barriers and regulation; (iii) increasing competition in domestic markets;
(iv) enhancing customs administration and reducing trade barriers; and (v) improving the
transparency and efficiency of public investment procedures. Reinvigorating the
privatization agenda, as soon as market conditions permit, would enhance economic
efficiency. A deeper and more efficient financial system would improve the allocation of
capital thereby enhancing economic growth.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

CONTEXT
1.
Russia entered 2014 with declining potential growth. Over 2011–14, Russia’s growth
decelerated more (relative to pre-crisis
performance) than in most other countries and
comparator groups. While some of Russia’s growth
deceleration is attributable to the stabilization of oil
prices, it also reflects stalled structural reforms,
weak investment, declining total factor productivity
(TFP), and adverse population dynamics.1 In
particular, excessive regulation, weak governance,
and a large government footprint in the economy
have discouraged efficiency-enhancing investment.
2.
In the second half of 2014, the dual
external shock from oil prices and sanctions
exacerbated the slowdown. Sanctions triggered a
sudden stop as Russian firms’ access to
international markets was impaired while geopolitical tensions increased uncertainty and weakened
confidence (Box 1). In late 2014, the economy was also affected by the sharp decline in terms of
trade due to falling oil prices2. These shocks combined to make growth anemic in 2014 (Figure 1).
The growth slowdown in 2014 occurred amidst record-low unemployment, above-target inflation,
and an economy operating slightly above full capacity.
3.
The ruble came under severe pressure at end-2014, reflecting the balance of payments
shocks from lower oil prices, limited access to international capital markets, and concerns about the
large external debt redemptions in December. These led to large net capital outflows (USD154 billion
or about 8 percent of GDP, the highest level since 1999–2000) and a significant decline in FX reserves
(Figure 2). Also, inflation accelerated sharply following the exchange rate depreciation and Russia’s
countersanctions (ban on imports of food products).
4.
Sanctions and market turbulence raised concerns over financial stability (Figure 3 and
4). Prior to the sharp ruble depreciation, banks’ capital and income positions were already
deteriorating due to the economic slowdown. The situation worsened in mid-December 2014 as
retail deposit outflows created liquidity pressures, asset prices declined and the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR) raised policy interest rates, worsening banks’ net interest margins. Finally, the ruble
depreciation put pressure on banks’ risk-weighted capital.

The annualized terms-of-trade shock is equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

5.
The authorities took steps to stabilize the financial system and the economy (Box 2). The
CBR allowed the exchange rate to float, tightened monetary policy significantly and expanded its FX
liquidity facilities. The government introduced an anti-crisis plan, including a 2 percent of GDP bank
capital support program, and revised its 2015 budget to reallocate spending to priority sectors.
Box 1. Impact of Sanctions

The United States (US), the European Union (EU), Japan, Switzerland, and other countries, imposed sanctions against
Ukrainian and Russian individuals and entities in response to Russia’s actions in Crimea and developments in Eastern
1
Ukraine. In particular, the US and EU sanctions prohibit US and EU persons and transactions conducted in the US
and EU that involve providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in new debt with maturity of more than 30 days, by
major state-owned Russian banks and energy companies. Sanctions also include a ban on exports of
th
high-technology goods for use in the energy sector. On August 7 , Russia introduced a one year ban and limits on
imports of agricultural and food products from countries that imposed sanctions on Russia. Russia and the EU have
subsequently extended the duration of sanctions.
Sanctions will impact growth negatively in the short-run via weaker investment and consumption. Model-based
estimates suggest that sanctions and counter-sanctions could initially reduce real GDP by 1 to 1½ percent.
Prolonged sanctions, could lead to a cumulative output loss over the medium term of up to 9 percent of GDP, as
lower capital accumulation and technological transfers weakens already declining productivity growth.

_________
1

Switzerland has taken measures to prevent the circumvention of international sanctions through its territory.

Box 2. Authorities’ Policy Response

The authorities put together a comprehensive policy package around three main pillars: (i) accelerating the move to
a floating exchange rate regime and provision of FX liquidity; (ii) stabilizing the banking system; and (iii) providing
some fiscal stimulus while limiting wage indexation in order to contain second-round effects of the depreciation on
inflation.
The CBR floated the ruble when market pressures intensified in November 2014 to facilitate a more rapid
adjustment to external shocks and curb reserve losses. Subsequently, the CBR raised the policy rate to 17 percent,
th
including by 650 bps on December 16 to limit financial stability risks and respond to a worsening inflation outlook.
In addition, the CBR expanded its FX liquidity facilities, as new maturities were added to CBR’s FX auctions and the
definition of eligible collateral was broadened. Finally, the government issued a directive requesting five large SOEs
st
to ensure that by March 1 2015, the size of their net foreign asset holdings is no greater than the level as of
st
1
October 1 , 2014.
The authorities introduced temporary regulatory forbearance, a capital support program, and doubled the level of
insured deposits to support the banking system, to secure financial stability and avoid a credit crunch. Under
forbearance, banks were (i) granted a moratorium on recognizing negative valuation changes for securities
st
portfolios; (ii) allowed to price FX-denominated assets and liabilities at October 1 2014 exchange rates; and
(iii) allowed flexibility in loan classification and provisioning. CBR estimates that regulatory forbearance sheltered
bank’s capital position by up to 2 percentage points. The plan is to start lifting the temporary regulatory forbearance
in July 2015. Funds initially worth about 2 percent of GDP—Rub 1 trillion from the 2014 Federal Budget and Rub
400 billion from the National Wealth Fund (NWF)—were allocated for the recapitalization of 27 large banks
2
(43 percent of system assets), smaller banks affected by the sanctions and selected regional banks. In addition, the
CBR undertook to recapitalize the largest bank (Sberbank which accounts for 30 percent of system assets) if needed.
Finally, the government revised the 2015 budget by reallocating expenditures to increase spending on pension and
support specific sectors and employment. Additional measures included budget credit to regions, federal credit
guarantees, and use of the National Wealth Fund to support systemically important enterprises and banks.

_________

This measure would be a Capital Flow Management measure in the institutional view (see The Liberalization and Management of
Capital Flows: An Institutional View, IMF, November 2012). Staff assesses that it had limited implications for domestic and BOP
stability with no implications on the effective operations of the International Monetary System.
2

The capital support program was subsequently reduced to Rub 830 billion, as estimates of capital needs were decreased. Up to
10 percent of NWF’ assets (Rub 400 billion) could be used to capitalize banks for the purpose of implementing infrastructure
projects. In addition, up to Rub 300 billion from the NWF could be used to finance real sector projects through Vnesheconombank
(VEB), Russia’s Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
In early 2015, the economy contracted,
the ruble strengthened, and inflation peaked.
GDP contracted by 2.2 percent y-o-y (-2.5 percent
q/q) in 2015Q1, owing to declining private
consumption and investment, and despite rising
government spending. The ruble strengthened
significantly, supported by higher oil prices,
tentative easing of geopolitical tensions,
improvements in confidence due to the
authorities’ policy response and lower external
debt redemptions by Russian corporates. Weekly
inflation (annualized) decelerated sharply,
suggesting that the impact of the depreciation and countersanctions largely dissipated by May 2015.
7.
The external sector adjustment is underway. In the first quarter of 2015, imports declined
sharply reflecting both weak domestic demand and expenditure switching due to the ruble
depreciation. Export fell with global oil prices but volumes remained broadly constant. External
deleveraging continued in the face of limited market access, with external debt falling to
USD560 billion at end-2015Q1 from USD730 billion at end-2013. The exchange rate depreciation has
moved the real exchange rate towards a level closer to medium-term fundamentals (Annex 2).
However, the possible structural implications of sanctions create exceptional uncertainty about
assessing the external position.
8.
A banking crisis was avoided but weaknesses persist. Higher deposit interest rates and
ruble stabilization resulted in an increase in retail deposits from February 2015 and reduced the
liquidity pressures the system faced. The 650 bps policy rate hike was accompanied by a temporary
drying up of liquidity in the interbank market (Figure 2), which abated after the authorities
announced measures to stabilize the financial system. The strengthening of the ruble, improvements
in asset prices and declining spreads have reduced pressure on bank capital, which has been further
supported by the authorities’ bank capital support program and regulatory forbearance. However,
the banks’ profitability has continued to deteriorate as credit growth has declined sharply, interest
margins have fallen, and credit quality has deteriorated. The CBR has continued closing banks, most
of them very small in size, involved in dubious transactions or excessive credit risk. Since January
2014, the number of banks has declined by about 115 to around 815, with 27 licenses revoked
between January–June 2015.
9.
Sanctions have forced banks and corporations to deleverage their external debt (Figure
5). Companies have turned to the local market and banks for FX funding given impaired access to
international markets. As a result, external debt has been declining. Moreover, the net FX position of
banks has remained positive and all sectors have continued to exhibit higher short-term external

6

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

assets than liabilities (Figure 7). Some corporates have been successful in rolling over part of their
external intra-company liabilities.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
A recession is projected for 2015 due to sanctions and the sharp drop in oil prices
(Table 1, Figure 6). Real GDP is expected to contract by 3.4 percent in 2015, as real wages and credit
growth fall, and private consumption declines. Investment is expected to continue falling due to low
confidence and tight financial conditions. Net exports will support growth as imports decline on the
back of falling domestic demand and ruble depreciation. The current account balance (in USD) is
expected to remain broadly unchanged as a sharp fall in imports and an improvement in the services
balance will mostly offset the negative impact of oil prices on exports. In 2015, net capital outflows
are likely to remain elevated due to Russia’s limited access to international capital markets. As a
result, FX reserves are expected to decline to about USD360 billion (13.6 months of imports). In the
baseline, external and public debts remain low and manageable.
11.
The recovery in 2016 will be muted and medium-term prospects are weak. The more
competitive exchange rate, increasing external demand and normalization of financial conditions will
support the recovery in 2016. However, private consumption and investment are likely to remain
subdued as real income growth remains slow, households continue to deleverage, and external
financing is constrained. 3 Moreover, unlike in 2008–09, when oil prices rebounded sharply and
Russia’s recovery was rapid, staff’s medium-term projection is based on persistently low oil prices,
suggesting a muted recovery. Coupled with the lingering effects of sanctions, negative population
dynamics and slowing productivity due to the lack of structural reforms, this is expected to result in
weak potential growth in the medium term (around 1.5 percent).
12.
Inflation should decline rapidly over the next two years. The recession in 2015 is
expected to open an output gap of about 1 percent of potential GDP.4 This, together with the
dissipating one-off effect of the exchange rate depreciation in late 2014–early 2015, the recent ruble
appreciation, and the partial public wage indexation, will set the stage for inflation to fall to about
12 percent at end-2015 and close to 8 percent at end-2016.
13.
An increase in geopolitical tensions is the main risk to the outlook. The baseline scenario
is predicated on the absence of additional external shocks. However, an escalation of geopolitical
3

The terms-of-trade shock should be mitigated by the ruble depreciation and sharp reduction in real imports and
expenditure switching. In addition, oil prices are expected to gradually increase over the medium term, but to remain
well below their 2014 level. As a result, the net effect from the fall in oil prices over the medium term results in a
decline in consumption and investment, but less than the initial shock.
4

Potential output is expected to decline during the next two years due to the transition costs related to re-allocating
resources across the economy following the terms-of-trade shock. The decline also reflects the impact of sanctions on
domestic investment through the limited availability of financing and increased uncertainty. However, there is
significant uncertainty about the evolution of potential output and hence the output gap.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

tensions could create additional balance-of-payment pressures and a significant deterioration in
confidence. The ruble could depreciate as capital outflows surge and inflation would increase further.
Elevated uncertainty would cause investment to contract and precautionary savings to increase
further, putting additional downward pressure on domestic demand. The ensuing contraction in
economic activity would have a negative effect on the fiscal position and could create additional
capital needs for banks.
14.
But other risks also cloud the outlook (Annex 3). Lower and/or more volatile oil prices
could further dampen the economic outlook. In addition, the positive effect from a more competitive
exchange rate is likely to be limited should the authorities pursue inward-looking policies. Although
most corporations have enough cash on hand to finance their external debt coming due over the
next 1-2 years, and have natural hedges due to energy exports, rapid deleveraging could entail
reducing investment, which if sustained would further affect potential output. Possible spillovers
from Ukraine could also adversely affect Russian banks, although they have already reported large
provisioning against their Ukrainian exposure. A faster-than-expected end to sanctions, while
positive, would pose some macroeconomic challenges, as Russia could face large and volatile capital
inflows.
15.
Against these risks and uncertainties, Russia has large buffers (Figure 7). Russia has a
positive and large net IIP (18 percent of GDP), a sizable current account surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP
in 2015, low public debt and no need to access international markets for government financing in
the short term due to the Reserve Fund (RF) buffer. In addition, while access to international capital
markets has been impaired, Russian companies are expected to gradually regain access, as sanctions
are lifted. Moreover, the CBR’s reserves remain adequate but could be increased somewhat to reflect
Russia’s vulnerability to tail risks stemming from commodity-price shocks and the heightened level
of uncertainty related to sanctions.5 Finally, balance-sheet currency mismatches are low and do not
limit exchange rate flexibility. Thus, existing buffers reduce the likelihood of a systemic event.
16.
Sizeable outward regional spillovers from Russia are unfolding (Figure 8, Box 3).
However, the Russian authorities’ policy response, which stabilized its economy, helped to mitigate
outward spillovers. Despite this, Commonwealth of Independent States, Ukraine and Baltic countries,
closely linked to Russia mostly through trade, remittances and FDI channels, are facing significant
spillovers. Eastern Europe’s links to Russia are generally weaker though for some countries’ trade and
FDI exposures are still significant (Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Czech and Slovak republics). Some
Western European countries, such as Austria and Cyprus, have direct financial exposures to Russia
but trade links, beyond energy, are limited.

On May 20th 2015, CBR’s reserves stood at USD 360 billion. Under the Fund’s basic reserve adequacy metric, reserves
within a range of USD 190–280 billion would be deemed appropriate. However, taking into account Russia’s
vulnerability to commodity shocks would increase the range of appropriate reserves to USD 240–350 billion. Finally,
additional reserves could be justified given that Russia’s access to international capital markets is impaired. See
“Assessing Reserve Adequacy – Further Considerations”, IMF, November 2013 and “Assessing Reserve Adequacy –
Specific Proposals” IMF, April 2015.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities are more optimistic about Russia’s growth prospects but broadly
agreed with staff’s risk assessment. The Ministries of Finance (MoF) and Economic Development
(MED) expect the contraction in economic activity to be milder in 2015 and forecast positive growth
of about 2.5 percent in 2016.6 In their assessment, the more competitive real exchange rate and the
bank capital support program will have a larger impact on growth than staff estimates. Moreover,
they believe that with the stabilization of confidence and rapid decline in inflation, real income
growth will be higher and lead to an earlier and faster recovery in private consumption. Their
medium-term outlook envisages higher potential output growth (at around 2.5 percent) than staff’s
(at around 1.5 percent), as they expect import substitution to deliver higher investment growth.
However, they recognized that this will require implementing structural reforms. They underscored
the risks of long-lasting sanctions and lower oil prices, and emphasized the importance of preserving
and rebuilding buffers. The authorities remain committed to deepen Russia’s links to CIS countries
and Asia, and recognized that a long period of sanctions against Russia may disrupt further
integration to the world economy.
Box 3. Regional Spillovers

In the face of sharply lower oil prices and geopolitical tensions, Russia has entered into a recession. This has
resulted in significant spillovers to many Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Ukraine and Baltic
countries. The spillovers to Eastern Europe have been more limited. The degree of impact is commensurate with
the level of countries’ trade, remittances, and FDI links to Russia.
Trade, remittances, and FDI are the main channels of economic spillovers from Russia to neighboring countries,
particularly the CIS (Figure 8). Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine and Turkmenistan have the largest share of exports to
Russia (over 9 percent of GDP). The remittances channel is particularly prominent for CIS oil importers, which
are among the most remittance-dependent economies in the world. In 2014, remittances constituted close to
20 percent of GDP in Armenia, 24 percent of GDP in Moldova, 30 percent of GDP in the Kyrgyz Republic and
45 percent of GDP in Tajikistan, mainly sourced out of Russia. The FDI channel is also important for a number of
CIS countries (Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, and Tajikistan), Bulgaria and Montenegro. The financial sector
channel is more limited, given the relatively small presence of Russian banks, although exchange rate
depreciations have impacted local banks, especially in highly dollarized economies.
The negative spillovers have contributed to sizable downward revisions to growth forecasts across the CIS. In
particular, for Belarus, Moldova, and Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) oil importers, adverse spillovers from
Russia’s recession in 2015 account for more than 2.5 percentage points of the downward growth revision
relative to April 2014 forecast. For CCA oil exporters, negative spillovers from Russia contributed to about
1.4 percentage point of the downward revision in the growth forecast. The slower medium-term growth in
Russia is expected to negatively impact the medium-term outlook of both CIS and Baltic countries.
Currencies of most CIS countries depreciated (or were devalued) sharply relative to the US dollar following the
ruble’s depreciation (in some cases accompanied by large interventions), reflecting confidence effects and
expected decline in foreign currency inflows from Russia. Countries with significant trade and remittance links
to Russia experienced larger currency depreciation. Rising dollarization in the region, particularly in the CCA
countries, where the share of dollar deposits rose to around 60 percent in most countries, points to weak
confidence and expectation of devaluations. At the same time, the sharp depreciation of the ruble and the
appreciation of the US dollar (to which some CIS currencies are pegged) have put upward pressure on nominal
effective exchange rates.
6

The CBR is less optimistic, forecasting a decline of 3.2 percent in 2015, and growth of between -1.2 and 0.7 in 2016.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The difficult economic conditions require a prudent macroeconomic policy response, especially in view
of the elevated external risks. Thus, the discussions focused on (i) providing a limited fiscal stimulus in
the context of needed medium-term fiscal consolidation; (ii) bringing inflation down to target over the
medium term while avoiding overly tight conditions in the short term; (iii) ensuring financial stability;
and (iv) advancing structural reforms that can leverage the more competitive exchange rate to
rebalance growth.

A. Fiscal Policy: Short-term Stimulus, Medium-term Consolidation
18.
Parliament approved a new
2015 federal budget based on more
realistic oil prices and macroeconomic
assumptions. Under the new budget, the
non-oil deficit is expected to deteriorate by
2 percentage points of GDP compared to
2014, (excluding the one-off bank capital
support program). Compared to the initial
budget, nominal spending was cut slightly,
despite higher inflation in 2015, in an effort to
recognize the new economic reality of lower oil
prices and economic slowdown. Spending was
re-allocated to priority areas such as support to
the manufacturing sector (in line with the
anti-crisis plan) and social payments, while some
programs were cut by 10 percent, and public
wages were only partially indexed to inflation.
The budget also included limited tax cuts (about
0.2 percent of GDP). It assumes gross financing
from the RF of about Rub 3 trillion (4 percent of
GDP) in 2015, reducing considerably fiscal buffers
for the future.

19.
Staff supported a slightly expansionary
fiscal stance for 2015. The structural non-oil deficit of the general government (federal and regional
governments, and extra budgetary funds) is expected to deteriorate by 0.4 percent of GDP, as the
federal stimulus is expected to be offset by ongoing consolidation at other levels of government
(Table 4). Fiscal policy would thus appropriately provide some stimulus given cyclical considerations,
available fiscal space and a measured normalization of monetary policy, while partial wage
indexation would support the disinflationary process. However, this may understate the ultimate level
of fiscal stimulus as quasi-fiscal stimulus will be provided through the National Wealth Fund and the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

issuance of guarantees. Staff recommended that the use of quasi-fiscal operations should be limited
and coordinated to avoid an overly stimulative fiscal stance.
20.
However, staff noted that medium-term fiscal consolidation is required to adjust to
lower oil prices and rebuild buffers. Assuming the maximum spending allowed under the federal
fiscal rule, staff expects some stimulus in 2016 followed by fiscal consolidation, as the impact of
lower oil prices is only gradually captured by the fiscal rule and therefore expenditures.7 This
consolidation path would result in a relatively large non-oil primary deficit (almost 7 percent of GDP)
and a low Reserve Fund buffer (only 1.0 percent of GDP) by 2020 (Figure 9, Table 4). Indeed, these
deficits are above medium-term benchmarks estimated by staff which take into consideration
intergenerational equity (Box 4). Reaching these benchmarks would entail additional adjustment,
relative to the baseline, of 2–3 percent of GDP over the medium term. Accordingly, a limited fiscal
adjusment could begin in 2016. Ultimately, the pace of fiscal consolidation may need to be adjusted
to protect the nascent recovery or in the event of a more prolonged or protracted recession.
21.
Staff cautioned that current rigidities create a challenge to achieving fiscal adjustment.
In particular, the application of the fiscal rule and pension indexation could make it difficult to
achieve the necessary fiscal adjustment. Under the fiscal rule, the oil price benchmark is a
backward-looking average, thus requiring only a gradual consolidation despite the expected
persistence of the oil price shock. This could be exacerbated by the conversion of benchmark
revenues into rubles using a much depreciated exchange rate.8 Furthermore, full indexation of
pension benefits (to 2015 inflation) could permanently increase spending by about 1.1 percent of
GDP in 2016, which would need to be offset by reducing other spending to comply with the fiscal
rule.
22.
Staff recommended changes to the fiscal rule to help support medium-term fiscal
sustainability. In particular, staff discussed a menu of options to improve two operational aspects of
the rule: (i) increasing the pace of adjustment of the oil price benchmark to allow for a more timely
fiscal adjustment; and (ii) gradually raising the amount of savings generated by the fiscal rule to a
surplus of 1–2 percent of GDP, as the projected non-oil primary deficits are above the medium-term
benchmarks estimated by staff which take into consideration intergenerational equity (Box 4).
Improvements along these two dimensions could be made without a significant reform of the
principles governing the fiscal rule. Other changes to the fiscal rule could also be considered such as
(i) expressing the rule in terms of minimum savings instead of maximum spending to focus the policy
debate on savings; (ii) including a limit on spending growth, to avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policy when
there is a revenue windfall; and (iii) adjusting non-oil revenues to the economic cycle, and using
potential GDP to calculate net financing. However, adjusting for the economic cycle is complicated

7

Under the fiscal rule, federal expenditures are capped, ex ante, as the sum of (i) projected non-oil revenues; (ii) oil
revenues at a benchmark price (in USD) converted to rubles; and (iii) net financing of one percent of GDP.
8
However, in contrast to previous years, the authorities are considering converting oil revenues using a historical
average of the exchange rate, instead of the projected exchange rate, which could result in lower spending than
assumed by staff.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

and subject to great uncertainty, as cyclically adjusted balances are often revised ex post due to
revisions to potential GDP.
23.
Detailed fiscal measures will also be
critical for the credibility of the consolidation
program. In particular, a reform of the pension
system could deliver substantial fiscal savings
over time. Other possible areas for fiscal
consolidation include (i) better targeting of
social transfers; (ii) reducing energy subsidies;
and (iii) cutting tax expenditures. Fiscal
consolidation should safeguard public
investment, education and health care spending
while improving the efficiency of capital
budgeting to increase returns on public
investment.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed with the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation. In their
view, the recent oil price decline should be treated as permanent, requiring fiscal adjustment based
on permanent measures. They believed that a balanced budget by 2018 would be consistent with
medium-term fiscal sustainability and are considering tightening fiscal policy by limiting spending
starting in 2016. They also recognized the challenges created by the current fiscal rule and pension
benefit indexation. In that context, the authorities agreed that there is a need to revisit the fiscal rule
and welcomed the set of possible modifications suggested by staff.9 Following the workshop on
pension reform delivered by IMF experts in March, the authorities are seeking politically feasible
reforms to ensure the system’s viability. They argued that a combination of fewer early retirement
benefits, and an increase and equalization of statutory retirement ages would bring about a
significant improvement in the pension system’s balance.

At the request of the authorities, IMF staff delivered a workshop on fiscal rules on June 22–23, 2015.

Box 4. Russia’s Fiscal Rule1

Resource-rich countries face two important fiscal challenges: (i) conducting a prudent fiscal policy consistent
with the long-term value of their resource wealth; and (ii) managing the impact of short-term resource-revenue
volatility. The recent sharp oil price decline has exacerbated these challenges. Having an appropriate fiscal
framework helps to manage these challenges, reduces “Dutch disease” effects, and limits the risks of large and
disruptive adjustments in the future i.e. fiscal sustainability risks.
Russia introduced an oil-price based fiscal rule in December 2012, but it could be further improved. Under the
rule, the oil-price benchmark is set as the minimum of (i) a backward-looking moving average of up to ten
years of Urals oil prices (USD/barrel); and (ii) a three-year backward looking average. The fiscal rule could be
modified to: (i) allow for a faster adjustment in fiscal policy in response to oil-price developments; and
(ii) generate more savings as Russia’s current and projected non-oil primary deficits are larger than suggested
by typical long-term fiscal benchmarks. Improvements along these two dimensions could be made without a
significant reform of the principles governing the fiscal rule.
In particular, the oil price benchmark could adjust more rapidly to developments in the oil market. To adjust
more rapidly to perceived changes in the long-term price of oil, the calculation of the oil-price benchmark
could usefully include future oil prices, as is done in other countries such as Mexico and Mongolia. An
alternative to including future oil prices could be to convert revenues to rubles using an exchange rate that is
more consistent with the oil price benchmark, instead of the projected exchange rate (as was done in the past)
i.e. the projected exchange rate assumes lower oil prices than the oil price benchmark. However, determining
the appropriate exchange rate for conversion is complicated by the fact that (i) the ruble has not been floating
until recently; (ii) the level of the exchange rate reflects a number of non-oil factors, including inflation
differentials and, recently, the impact of sanctions against Russia. Furthermore, converting revenues using such
an exchange rate could complicate communications with the public and markets, as the exchange rate used to
convert revenues would be different than the projected one.
The fiscal rule could generate more savings to safeguard intergenerational equity. Estimates of long-term fiscal
benchmarks consistent with intergenerational equity points to a federal non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) in the
range of 3-4.5 percent of GDP. Generating such NOPDs could be achieved by changing the “net financing” of
1 percent of GDP allowed under the fiscal rule, which increases the maximum level of spending and the deficit,
to “net savings” of 1–2 percent of GDP.

B. Monetary Policy: Measured Normalization
25.
The CBR initiated an easing cycle, introduced changes to its FX facilities and set up an
FX purchase program (Figure 2). Since the end of January, the CBR started unwinding the December
16th emergency rate hike, reducing its policy rate by 550 bps. Banks have relied primarily on the FX
repos to ease dollar funding pressures in the interbank market and support a smooth external
deleveraging. In March 2015, the CBR started to increase the cost of these facilities as the FX market
normalized. In May, the CBR suspended the 1-year FX repo facility and announced a program of daily
FX purchases of between USD 100–200 million.
26.
In staff’s view, the ongoing monetary policy normalization is appropriate and should
continue at a prudent pace. The acceleration in inflation (y-o-y) over December 2014–April
2015 reflected, to a large extent, the one-off impact of the ruble depreciation and countersanctions.
Thereafter, disinflation should be driven by the recession underway, the stabilization of the ruble, and
partial wage indexation in the budget. Therefore, a gradual reduction in the policy rate,
commensurate with the decline in underlying inflation and inflation expectations, would be
appropriate. In addition, if the authorities implement a tighter budget in 2016 than assumed by staff,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

this could support a faster normalization of monetary policy. Nevertheless, there are a number of
factors arguing for a prudent pace of monetary easing including the uncertainty over the external
outlook, the potential for second-round effects given the magnitude of the exchange rate
depreciation (Box 5), and the CBR’s need to build credibility under the recently introduced inflation
targeting regime. As inflation expectations appear to be mainly adaptive, surveys of inflation
expectations should be used cautiously in assessing underlying inflation (Figure 10). Finally, the
easing of policy rates should be conditional on a reduction in external and financial stability risks.
Box 5. Exchange Rate Pass-through1

Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on the evolution of inflation and inflation
expectations. As such, central banks should carefully estimate the exchange rate pass through to inflation.
This is difficult in the case of Russia because nominal exchange rate fluctuations have been relatively
limited in the recent past. Therefore, exchange rate pass through to consumer prices has been estimated
using data for emerging markets. The analysis suggests that:
i.

ii.
iii.

The size of the exchange rate fluctuation matters. In particular, a larger exchange rate depreciation
tends to lead to a greater impact on inflation (a larger exchange rate pass through). For example,
the typical exchange rate pass through in emerging markets is estimated at 20 percent after
12 months. However, the pass though increases up to 45 percent after 6 months when the
depreciation is greater than 20 percent.
Episodes of depreciation are associated with greater exchange rate pass through than episodes of
appreciation. In particular, the estimated pass through during periods of depreciation is five times
greater than during episodes of appreciation.
Inflation-targeting countries typically have lower pass through. However, this result holds only in
countries where the central bank has built sufficient credibility to anchor inflation expectations.

Given these results, the CBR should be careful when normalizing monetary policy. First, the ruble
depreciated significantly in late 2014-early 2015, suggesting that the inflation pass through was large and
relatively fast. Second, the recent appreciation of the ruble, while helpful in bringing inflation down, may
not produce a large disinflationary effect. Third, introducing flexibility in the exchange rate regime is often
accompanied by higher-than-normal volatility, hence it is important for the CBR to establish credibility by
anchoring inflation and inflation expectations under the new regime.

_________

For more details, see the Selected Issues Paper “Exchange Rate Pass-through to Inflation. Is Russia Different?”

27.
Staff agreed that the changes to the FX liquidity facilities and the introduction of an FX
purchase program were broadly adequate. The normalization in the FX interbank market and the
end of large FX debt redemptions called for a repricing and rationalization of these facilities. The
central bank could consider limiting further the FX allotments to ensure that the facilities remain
sufficient for emergency purposes. The pre-announced daily FX purchase program to build
precautionary buffers would help guard against tail risks presented by the exceptional external
conditions, given Russia’s limited access to international capital markets and vulnerability to
commodity shocks. However the strategy should be strengthened by indicating the time-frame the
central bank expects to be conducting these operations, thereby avoiding an open-ended policy that
may be misconstrued as targeting an exchange rate level.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities agreed that monetary policy normalization should proceed at a
cautious pace. The CBR noted that the exchange rate pass-through was greater and faster than
expected but that disinflationary pressures are now firmly in place given the latest inflation readings,
the ruble appreciation and partial wage indexation. As a result, the CBR expects inflation to come
down to about 12–14 percent by the end-2015 and between 5.5–7.5 percent by end-2016, provided
there are no additional shocks. This should allow further easing to avoid an overly tight monetary
stance. The CBR concurred with staff that the pace of interest rate normalization should be cautious
and viewed its inflation target of 4 percent as realistically achievable by 2017.
29.
The CBR believes there is a need to rebuild reserve buffers. They argued that given the
exceptional circumstances and uncertainty regarding the external outlook, there is scope to increase
reserves, especially given the evolution of the ruble in the first half of the year. The CBR indicated
that the goal of the new FX purchasing program is to rebuild precautionary buffers. They agreed with
staff that it was critical to ensure that the program is not seen as targeting a specific exchange rate
and noted that they remain committed to the floating exchange rate regime. The authorities also
indicated that the parameters of the FX facilities would be adjusted according to market conditions.

C. Financial Sector: A Tailored Policy Response
30.
The banking system is facing challenging times (Figure 3). The sector reported after-tax
losses in December 2014 and during the first five months of 2015. At end-April, the sector’s reported
capital was comparable to a year ago, at 12.9 percent, owing to capital support from the NWF and
the government (Rub 236 billion) and regulatory forbearance. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have
increased by only 1.5 percentage points to 8.0 percent compared to April 2014 (Figure 4), again
helped by regulatory forbearance.
31.
Staff acknowledged that anti-crisis measures helped stabilize the banking system. The
acute ruble depreciation in December caused regulatory compliance challenges due to the impact on
risk-weighted assets from the revaluation of FX-denominated assets. The forbearance measures
insulated prudential reports from the depreciation and helped avoid regulatory triggers. The strategy
was appropriately combined with intensified supervision, although staff noted that it should be
strengthened by increasing transparency with regards to asset quality to improve market confidence.
Moreover, staff argued for the prompt elimination of forbearance, along with the implementation of
the capital support program, to avoid the emergence of additional financial stability risks in the
medium term.
32.
The size of the capital support program appears to be sufficiently large (Box 6).
Although profitability and capital will continue to be under pressure, recent CBR’s stress tests
suggest that the government support for all the large eligible banks—before owners’ mandatory
contribution—is sufficient to cover loan-loss provisioning and market losses under an adverse
scenario (including an increase in NPLs to 18 percent). However, staff noted that the capital support

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

should be better tailored to the specific needs of individual banks and based on stress tests that are
sufficiently conservative, instead of being arbitrarily set at 25 percent of a bank’s total capital.
Box 6. Features of the Government’s Bank Capital Support Program

In December 2014, the government launched a Rub 1 trillion1 (1.2 percent of GDP) bank capital support
program. The main features of the program as of mid-June 2015 are:
Eligibility: The program targets three categories of commercial banks: (i) Banks with at least Rub 25 billion
in capital – 27 banks meet this requirement (excluding Sberbank).2, (ii) Banks that are directly or indirectly
affected by economic sanctions; and (iii) top regional lenders (up to 13 banks).
Type of capital support: Under the program, the DIA offers government bonds (OFZ) in exchange for
banks’ subordinated Tier 2 debt and, for (partly) state-owned and sanctioned banks, in exchange for Tier
1 debt and preferred shares. The subordinated debt should be remunerated above the OFZ rate, but below
market rates. Support is set at 25 percent of a bank’s total capital, irrespective of current or prospective
capital needs, if any.
Conditions: Banks receiving support must be in full compliance with CBR’s prudential requirements at the
time of the capital injection. With the exception of (partly) state-owned banks, banks must raise their own
funds equal to at least 50 percent of the government’s support. Owners’ contributions can be in the form
of retained earnings over the duration of the subordinated debt. Other conditions include increased
monitoring, a commitment to increase credit to selected sectors by 1 percent monthly for three years, and
a three-year ban on increasing management salaries and the overall wage bill of the bank. Failure to
comply with these conditions would result in penalties that worth up to 2 percent per year of the capital
support.
Procedures: Eligible banks, other than regional banks, had until June 1, 2015 to accept DIA’s offer and the
process should be finalized by November 1, 2015. Thereafter, the CBR performs a due diligence to verify
that banks are in compliance with the program conditions. Onsite asset quality reviews are performed at
banks that have not had an onsite supervisory inspection in the preceding 12 months. In the event that a
bank does not meet all the program conditions, remedial actions need to be implemented. Finally, requests
for support are subject DIA board approval.
In addition to the government’s capital support program, up to 10 percent of the assets of the NWF
(0.5 percent of GDP) could be used to support bank’s financing of large infrastructure projects. NWF
financing would be provided through subordinated deposits or purchases of subordinated debt with a
maturity of up to 30 years. Resources from the NWF would be on-lent by banks (with the lending rate
equal to the financing costs from the NWF). Finally, the CBR has been authorized to support Sberbank with
subordinated credits (deposits, loans, bonds) amounting to up to 100 percent of its capital, if needed.

_________
1

The program has subsequently been reduced to Rub 830 billion as estimates for capital needs have been reduced.

2

Sberbank also meet this requirement but is excluded from the program as it is majority-owned by the CBR. Eight of the
27 banks are partly state-owned, with total capital amounting to 64 percent of the group.

33.
However, staff recommended adjustments to the program to minimize the cost to the
public sector:


Tighter eligibility criteria. Only banks identified ex ante as systemically important should be
eligible, while allowing weak non-systemic banks to be resolved in an orderly fashion.



Higher cost of capital, to ensure stronger efforts by banks to seek private capital before resorting
to public funds. Given that markets are not currently functioning properly, the cost could be
benchmarked against historical and/or international experience for similar capital instruments.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

This would create incentives to repay the government support, as soon as banks regain access to
capital markets. Finally, when requiring the private sector to co-finance the capital injection, the
authorities should aim at achieving a level playing field between private and partly state-owned
banks.


Eliminate credit growth targets as forced lending could increase credit risks and potential
inefficient credit allocation. While the capital support may facilitate credit growth, credit
underwriting should best be based on banks’ commercial assessment of risk and remuneration.

34.
Staff noted that the bank resolution framework has been upgraded, but further work is
needed to fully address past FSAP recommendations (Annex 4). Legislation adopted in late
December 2014 revokes, replaces and consolidates into one law the General Bank Insolvency Law
and the 2008 Temporary Law for resolution of banks posing a threat to financial stability. The new
law makes notable improvements, such as (i) more timely exchange of information between the DIA
and the CBR on failing institutions; (ii) mandatory imposition of losses on shareholders prior to the
use of public funds provisions; (iii) greater powers to sanction managers of failing institutions; and
(iv) provisions for the bidding procedures of the assets and liabilities of a failed bank. However, staff
noted that the new legislation does not provide for a number of tools contemplated in the Key
Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes, including the powers to use a bridge bank and to bail-in
all unsecured uninsured liabilities. Finally, staff recommended that supervision of banks heavily
dependent on CBR liquidity should be stepped up, including by requesting funding and liquidity
plans that makes their business model independent of CBR support.

Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities believe the package was key to stabilizing confidence in the banking
system and avoiding a credit crunch. The authorities acknowledged the need for a timely lifting of
forbearance and plan to start eliminating these measures in July 2015. They emphasized that capital
support provided to banks was aimed at supporting credit growth rather than to cover losses. In
their view, this justifies the large number of eligible banks, the relatively low cost of capital, and the
requirement that banks increase lending. The authorities also noted that the list of systemically
important banks is still under discussion and is expected to include a number of regional banks in
addition to the 19 banks already supervised by CBR’s SIB unit. The risk to public funds is seen as
minimal as capital support is only granted to banks after CBR’s inspection. Furthermore, the wage bill
restrictions are considered to be a sufficient incentive for banks to seek private sector capital. The
authorities agreed that private capital would have been preferable, but argued that even if greater
incentives were in place, it would be difficult to attract capital given the sanctions. The authorities
agreed that over time they should reconcile the current bank resolution framework with the Key
Attributes.

D. Structural Policies: Re-invigorate the Reform Agenda
36.
Structural challenges have slowed potential growth. Adverse population dynamics have
contributed to the decline in the labor force, while low statutory retirement ages have reduced

workers’ incentives to extend their working life. Administrative barriers, high regulation, weak
governance (including perceptions of corruption and weak property rights protection), and poor
infrastructure have limited investment and growth (Figure 11).10 The significant presence of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in key sectors of the economy has also made it difficult to increase
competition and efficiency. Several new anti-crisis initiatives aimed at supporting different sectors
through subsidies, guarantees, restrictions on the participation of foreign producers in public
procurement, and import substitution-like polices, have introduced additional distortions which will
put a drag on growth. Finally, the banking system is highly concentrated, lacks depth, and is
inefficient at channeling savings to investment.
37.
Effective implementation of a structural reform agenda is needed to boost growth.
There is an excess of savings over investment in Russia, as evidenced by its large current account
surplus. How to retain these savings and channel them into efficient investment is paramount.
Improving governance and the protection of property rights, and increasing competition in domestic
markets would contribute to improving investors’ confidence, increasing output in the non-energy
tradable sector, and attracting investment. Specific reforms that could be introduced in the short
term include: (i) strengthening mechanisms to protect property rights; (ii) enhancing customs
administration, reducing trade barriers and promote trade; (iii) empowering the Federal
Antimonopoly Service (FAS) to eliminate entry barriers to several sectors/markets; and (iv) ensuring
mandatory public technology and price audits of all major investment projects with government
participation. A deeper and more efficient financial system would improve the allocation of capital
thereby enhancing economic growth (Box 7). The privatization program should be revamped as soon
as market conditions permit, and SOEs should be managed on a commercial basis. Reforms related
to OECD accession should be rekindled despite the suspension of accession talks. Finally, pension
reform, especially increasing the statutory retirement age, could increase future labor supply and
potential growth.

Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities broadly agreed with the diagnosis and noted their commitment to
implement structural reforms. They noted that sanctions and adverse terms of trade are affecting
potential growth, on top of pre-existing structural bottlenecks, hence the need to accelerate
structural reforms. They see pension reforms as important to increase labor force. The authorities
noted that improving property rights, revamping transport infrastructure and enhancing competition
in goods and services markets is needed to improve the business climate and boost investment.
Moreover, the authorities remain committed to support the manufacturing sector through various
programs, ensuring effective support for SMEs. In addition, the MED will continue implementing its
reform agenda based on roadmaps, including in the following areas: reducing trade barriers,
facilitating the acquisition of construction permits, and improving access to electricity. The Ministry

interpreting these indicators.

of Agriculture will implement several programs where they see significant scope for efficiency gains
and import-substitution.

Box 7. Russian Banking System and Growth
Russia’s financial sector is analyzed through the lenses of a broad-based measure of financial development
(FD).1 Financial development is defined as a combination of depth (size and liquidity of markets), access
(ability of individuals to access financial services), and efficiency (ability of institutions to provide financial
services at low cost and with sustainable revenues, and the level of activity of capital markets).2
Russia’s financial markets (FM) are found to be
relatively developed but financial institutions (FI) lag
behind in terms of efficiency and depth. Russia’s FD
index (0.58) is higher than the average EM (0.37) and
slightly lower than the average BTICS (0.64), a group
of countries composed of Brazil, Turkey, India, China,
and South Africa. Nonetheless, the components of
the index show large disparities between levels of
development of FM versus FI. Russia scores much
higher than the comparator groups for FM
developments as it features higher degrees of access
and efficiency in the operations of its financial
markets. Although the depth of financial markets is
slightly lower than BTICS countries, it remains much
higher than the average EM. Nonetheless, along the
dimension of FI, Russia lags behind both comparator
groups in terms of efficiency and depth while access to financial institutions is about the same.
Intermediation and efficiency are hampered by the structure of the banking system. With some 850 banks
operating, the Russian banking system is highly concentrated at the top, and fragmented at the bottom. The
top three banks (state-owned) accounted for more than 50 percent of total sector assets at year-end
2014 while the top 20 banks accounted for 75 percent of total sector assets. Lending is highly concentrated
among the top 10 bank groups making about 850 banks contribute only 15 percent of total lending. Some
indicators of efficiency, including lending-deposit spreads, are close to the average observed in comparator
groups. However, most other indicators of efficiency, in particular non-interest income to total income and
overhead costs to total assets, show that the banking system is much less efficient in its operations than
comparator countries. In addition, concentration indices point to a moderate concentration on the deposit
side.
Financial development dividend could be large. Estimates suggest that annual growth could increase by an
average of 1 percentage point should Russia move to the maximum level of the FI index. Policies towards
this outcome include reducing banking sector fragmentation through consolidation via the continuation of
the policies of increased supervision, and tightening capital standards via the adoption of Basel III standards.
In addition, strengthening the role of credit bureaus and collateral registries to reduce information
asymmetries could foster and improve credit allocation. Finally, the authorities should consider removing
interest rate rigidities, in particular by allowing deposit rates to adjust freely while designing in parallel an
incentive mechanism that prevents predatory bank lending.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Russian economy is in a recession in 2015 due to lower oil prices and sanctions. The
external position will remain challenging due to deleveraging in the face of limited market access.
Growth should resume in 2016 due in part to the authorities’ policy response and higher oil prices.
However, the recovery is likely to be hampered by unaddressed structural bottlenecks and adverse
population dynamics, leading to weak medium-term growth prospects.
40.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ policy response to stabilize the economy. However there
remain significant uncertainties regarding oil prices and geopolitical risks. Given these risks, the
macroeconomic policy stance must remain prudent.
41.
The short-term fiscal stimulus in the 2015 budget is appropriate but medium-term
consolidation is required. A slightly expansionary fiscal stance is adequate for 2015 given cyclical
considerations and available fiscal space. However, the use of off-budget measures—investment by
the NWF and issuance of guarantees—should be coordinated to avoid an overly stimulative fiscal
stance. Fiscal consolidation is required over the medium term to adjust to lower oil prices, rebuild
buffers and safeguard intergenerational equity. The needed fiscal adjustment should protect public
investment, education and health care spending, and could be anchored by revisiting the fiscal rule.
In addition, it should be accompanied by permanent and credible fiscal measures which could
include (i) pension reform, (ii) reducing energy subsidies, and (iii) better targeting social transfers.
42.
Monetary policy normalization should continue at a cautious pace. The dissipating
one-off effect of the exchange rate depreciation in late 2014–early 2015, the economic contraction,
the partial wage indexation in the 2015 budget, and the recent ruble appreciation will support
disinflation. However, the pace of easing should be commensurate with the decline in underlying
inflation and inflation expectations. External risks, the potential for second-round effects, and the
central bank’s need to build credibility call for cautious monetary easing. The normalization in the FX
interbank market and the end of large FX debt redemptions appropriately led to an adjustment of
the parameters of FX liquidity facilities, but limiting allotments could be considered. The FX purchase
program to rebuild precautionary buffers is understandable but an open-ended policy should be
avoided to prevent the perception that the CBR is targeting a specific exchange rate level.
43.
The anti-crisis package comprising temporary forbearance and public support has been
successful in stabilizing the banking system. The forbearance strategy was appropriately
combined with intensified supervision, but should be strengthened by increasing asset-quality
transparency to further improve market confidence. The size of the capital support program appears
to be sufficiently large, but support to individual banks should be tailored to their specific capital
needs. Furthermore, the parameters of the program should be adjusted to strengthen incentives and
reduce cost to the public sector. Forbearance should be lifted promptly by end-2015 along with the
implementation of the capital support program.

44.
Despite progress in improving the bank resolution framework, additional steps should
be considered to better align the new legislation, over time, with the Key Attributes for Effective
Resolution Regimes, including the powers to use a bridge bank and to bail-in unsecured uninsured
liabilities.
45.
Boosting medium term growth requires re-invigorating the reform agenda. Avoiding
global de-integration, improving governance and property rights protection, increasing competition
in domestic markets, reducing the government’s footprint in the economy and limiting regulations
remain crucial to foster efficiency, confidence and investment. Initiatives in these areas would also be
critical to support the non-energy tradable sector and diversify the economy. In addition, pension
reform would help improve labor force dynamics in the face of negative demographic trends. Finally,
financial deepening and a more efficient banking system are needed to support long-term growth.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

adaptive and above observed inflation.

Over the past few months, one-year ahead inflation
expectations have come down, although they remain high.

In the very short term, a lower proportion of consumers
expect prices to increase...

... with an increasing proportion of respondents expect prices
to stop accelerating.

Price expectations of producers are starting to level off for
the very short term...

...and fewer producers are now expecting higher prices over
the next three months than before.

Annex I. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
During the 2014 Article IV consultation, Directors noted that while the immediate priority—in the
context of ongoing geopolitical tensions—was to preserve macroeconomic stability, it was essential
to boost investment and thus increase potential output growth by enhancing the policy framework
and undertaking further structural reforms.
Key recommendations

Implemented policies

Fiscal Policy
Consider flexibility in the event of a
more severe cyclical downturn.

The budget for 2015 is consistent with cyclical considerations
and available fiscal space. Quasi-fiscal spending via NWF and
issuance of guarantees may provide further stimulus.

Adhere to the fiscal rule to support
its credibility and the medium-term
fiscal consolidation.

Adopted fiscal rule is followed in the budget for 2015–17.
Possible enhancements to the fiscal rule, to better account for
oil-price changes and to anchor needed medium-term fiscal
consolidation, are currently being discussed.

Take additional measures to ensure
long-term viability of the public
pension system.

A renewed public debate is ongoing on further changes to the
pension system, including gradually increasing the statutory
retirement age.

Reduce spending pressures and
increase efficiency gains to create
space for infrastructure development.

NWF investments—via recapping commercial banks and
VEB—and state loan guarantees are to be used to support
infrastructure investments and lending to the real sector.
However, anti-crisis measures have crowded out budgeted
investment expenditures.

Monetary Policy
Tighten monetary policy stance to
achieve the 2015 inflation target and
anchor inflation expectations.

Policy rates were increased. The CBR has maintained its
medium-term inflation target of 4 percent.

Continue moving to an inflationtargeting regime and a fully flexible
exchange rate once the current
uncertainty subsides.

The inflation targeting regime was formally adopted on
schedule, at end 2014. The move to further exchange rate
flexibility was accelerated amidst market turbulence in late
2014, with the CBR removing its intervention bands to
facilitate a more rapid adjustment to external shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Financial Sector Policy
Monitor build-up of systemic risks
through regular stress testing
exercises and increased oversight.

Supervision of banks was intensified through additional CBR
representatives at banks (165, as of April 1, 2015, compared
to 57 on July 1, 2014). Amidst market stress, in December
2014, the CBR introduced temporary regulatory forbearance
on loan classification, provisioning, and valuation
accounting. A bank recapitalization program is being
implemented; the government has also approved the use of
up to 10 percent (400 billion rubles) of the NWF resources
to support banks.

Implement the remaining Financial
Sector Assessment Program
recommendations.

The recently passed legal reforms on bank resolution do
not fully incorporate the recommendations of the
2011 FSAP and Financial Stability Board Peer Review. In
particular, it does not provide for a number of tools
contemplated in the Key Attributes for Effective Resolution
Regimes such as bridge banks and bail-in of all unsecured
uninsured liabilities.
To support financial stability, the CBR has revoked over
114 banking licenses since January 1, 2014, mostly from
small banks, following established resolution procedures.

Take steps to reduce banking sector
fragmentation through
consolidation and enhancing
competition among banks.
Structural Policies
Curtail state involvement in the
economy, reduce price distortions,
take further measures to increase
investment and productivity, and
revive the nearly-stalled privatization
program.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

State involvement in economic activity has increased, with a
shift to locally produced goods and services in procurement
for local and municipal needs, and state support to import
substitution in the real sector. Countersanctions increased
price distortions by banning food imports from many
countries. A part of the government anti-crisis package is
aimed at supporting small and medium enterprises by
reducing their financial and administrative costs. The
privatization agenda remains stalled, given current market
conditions.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Overall Assessment
Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) was positive at end-December 2014 at about 18 percent
GDP (up from 6 percent in 2013); with gross assets of 70 percent of GDP and liabilities of 52 percent of GDP. Total external
debt was 36 percent of GDP. Historically, the NIIP position has not kept pace with the CA surpluses due to unfavorable
valuation changes and the treatment of “disguised” capital outflows. 1/
Assessment. The projected current account surpluses mean that Russia will continue to maintain a positive international
investment position, which minimizes risks to external stability. Recent deleveraging reduces risks further.

Current
account

Background. From 2000 to 2013, the current account (CA) surplus fell from 18 to 2 percent of GDP despite increasing oil
prices, as consumption increased rapidly. A correction, however, is underway with the CA improving to 3.21 percent in
2014 and 4.5 percent in 2015. This improvement took place despite the negative terms of trade shock, as reduced oil
export revenue (approximately 5 percent of GDP) was offset by falling absorption due to the real depreciation of the ruble,
and tightening of financial conditions.
Assessment. There are particular uncertainties with the external assessment when oil plays such a dominant role in the
economy, compounded now by the uncertain long-term impact of sanctions in saving-investment decisions and therefore
the normative external position. 2/Staff believes higher uncertainty warrants higher savings, hence a stronger current
account norm than implied by the model. Against this background, staff assesses that the 2014 CA gap was between -3 to
0 percent of GDP. In the medium term, fiscal policy should be tightened to rebuild buffers, save more of the oil wealth for
future generations, and counter Dutch disease.

Real
exchange
rate

47

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Net private capital outflows have picked-up, as the non-bank sector has increasingly found it difficult to
rollover existing debt and confidence has deteriorated. Geopolitical tensions and lower oil prices will continue to weigh on
the outlook. Over the medium term, structural outflows are expected to decline if Russia improves its investment climate.
Assessment. While Russia is exposed to risks of accelerated capital outflows and sudden stop of external funding because
of the exceptional current geopolitical tensions, large international reserves provide substantial buffers and the new
floating exchange rate regime help absorb these shocks.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The CBR intervened according to its FX intervention rule in large volumes in 2014 dampening the pace of
depreciation before abandoning its managed float policy. The CBR has since moved to a floating exchange rate regime
and limited intervention, and in May 2015, started rebuilding reserves as uncertainty remains elevated.
Assessment. The current level of foreign reserves is adequate according to a range of reserve coverage indicators and is
above 150 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric. Accumulation of fiscal savings in the oil funds should
continue and the current policy of small regular reserve purchases to replenish reserves could be justified by the
heightened level of uncertainty related to sanctions and as a buffer given Russia’s vulnerability to oil shocks. Large FX
interventions should be limited to episodes of market distress.

Relative to the 2014 assessment period,
the REER has depreciated. This in part
reflects the adjustment to a new norm
with substantially lower oil prices and
sanctions that are affecting medium
term growth. The structural implications
of the sanctions create exceptional
uncertainty when assessing the external
position. Nevertheless, staff’s initial view
is that the depreciation has moved the
REER toward a level closer to
medium-term fundamentals that have
changed materially since the last ESR.
Potential policy responses:
The nonoil fiscal deficit remains
significantly higher than its long-term
desirable level and needs to adjust to
facilitate a rebalancing from public to
private activity, and a re-allocation of
government expenditure from current
to capital spending. This rebalancing—
coupled with a renewed emphasis on
structural reforms to invigorate the
private sector—would help increase
public saving that would be matched
by both higher private and public
sector investment over the mediumterm.

Background. The sustained oil price boom and related expansion of domestic demand led to a strong real effective
exchange rate (REER) appreciation between 2000 and 2013. The REER has since depreciated 8 percent between 2013 and
2014, and through May 2015, by a further 2 percent on average relative to the average for 2014, despite significant
inflation differentials with trading partners. This reflects lower oil prices, sanctions, and the move to a floating exchange
rate regime in November 2014.
Assessment. EBA estimates that the average REER in 2014 was 7 percent overvalued based on the CA regression approach
and 10 percent undervalued based on the REER level regression approach (and 13 percent based on the index approach).
The latter approach, however, is less reliable in commodity-exporting countries over a period in which commodity prices
have been exceptionally high and is discarded from the staff assessment. Based on the current account gap, and taking
into account the uncertainties discussed in the current account assessment, staff assesses that the REER was overvalued by
0-10 percent on average during 2014. Staff assess that the recent depreciation has moved the REER toward a level closer
to medium-term fundamentals.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2014 was
moderately weaker than the level
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy
settings.

1/ Unfavorable valuation changes arise because the Russian stock market has performed very well in the last 15 years as
the oil price soared, boosting the valuation of foreign-owned assets. “Disguised” capital outflows include transactions such
as pre-payments on import contracts where the goods are not delivered, repeated large transfers abroad that deviate from
standard remittances behavior, or securities transactions at inflated prices. The Central Bank of Russia includes estimates of
“disguised” capital outflows in the financial account but not in the foreign asset position of the reported NIIP. Hence, the
actual NIIP position could be higher than the reported level and this treatment of “disguised” outflows may explain part of
the discrepancy between accumulated CA surpluses and the reported NIIP position.
2/ EBA-estimated 2014 CA norm was 5 percent of GDP; and the cyclically adjusted CA was 2.9 percent. The lower modelbased gap relative to 2013 reflects both an improvement in the 2014 CA (from 1.6 percent in 2013) and a small reduction
in the estimated current account norm (from 5.2 percent in 2013). This change in the norm broadly reflects two offsetting
factors, with lower oil prices reducing the norm by 1 percent and lower medium-term growth increasing the norm by 0.5
percent. The EBA estimated CA norm of 4.8 percent of GDP, rests mostly on the need to save out of income from nonrenewable oil exports. Staff’s assessment shares this basic logic in also calling for a CA surplus for Russia, but
acknowledges that such saving (i.e., refraining from consumption) would not necessarily have to take a financial form, and
could in part take the form of productive investment spending, which could justify a somewhat lower CA surplus than the
EBA-estimated norm. Sanctions and geopolitical tensions have introduced an additional level of complexity in the external
assessment, as they introduce exceptional uncertainty in model based estimates.

Exchange Arrangements: Effective November 10, 2014, the CBR eliminated its exchange rate
corridor and canceled regular FX interventions, adopting a de jure and de facto floating exchange
rate regime, with FX interventions to be conducted only to safeguard financial stability. The de jure
and de facto exchange rate arrangement used to be categorized as other managed arrangement
until November 10, 2014—namely, a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value
of a bi-currency basket was used as the operating benchmark for transactions on the domestic
foreign exchange market. The basket was composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The value of the
bi-currency basket was determined under the influence of both market factors and exchange
interventions by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). The CBR did not set any quantitative limits on the
exchange rate level of the national currency, but its exchange rate policy aimed at keeping
short-term fluctuations within an acceptable range, as determined by the floating operating band.
Interventions took place both at the limits of the floating operating band and within it. They were
triggered once the exchange rate crossed the limits set by a nonintervention corridor, with
intervention amounts and intervals established in advance. The limits of the operating bands itself
shifted by 5 kopecks once a predetermined cumulative volume of interventions has been reached.
Effective October 13, 2010, the CBR eliminated the fixed trading band of Rub 26-41 against the
bi-currency basket, in force since January 2009. Since 2010 the CBR has widened the moving
intervention band from 3 to 7 rubles in four installments. Up until March 3, 2014, the CBR had
successively reduced the volume of cumulative interventions triggering a 5 kopeck shift in the
operational band from originally $700 million to $350 million and widened the non-intervention
band from 1 to 3.1 rubles. Following the heightened financial turmoil from the crisis in Ukraine, the
CBR decreased the sensitivity of the band to interventions, increasing the cumulative FX sales
required to shift the operational band to US$1.5bn. Effective May 22, 2014, the amount of
interventions in all sub-bands was reduced by US$100 million, from US$400 million to
US$300 million and from US$200 million to US$100 million, with the aim of reverting to greater
flexibility. Further, effective June 17, 2014, the cumulative volume of interventions leading to a shift
in the floating operational band was reduced from US$1.5 billion to US$1 billion; the US$100 million
intervention sub-band was eliminated leading to an increase in the non-intervention zone by
2 rubles; and the amount of interventions in the remaining sub-band was reduced from
US$300 million to US$200 million. Effective August 18, 2014, the exchange rate corridor was
widened to RUB 9 from RUB 7 and interventions were eliminated within the corridor. The cumulative
interventions to move the corridor by 5 kopeck were reduced to USD 350mn from USD 1bn.
Effective November 5, 2014, daily interventions were capped at US$350 million when the ruble
touches the exchange rate corridor or is outside of it. Effective November 10, 2014, the CBR adopted
a floating exchange rate regime by abandoning the exchange rate-based operational indicators of
its exchange rate policy. The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS1
The World Bank Group’s engagement with the Russian Federation is three-dimensional:
global, regional, and national. At the global level, Russia has increased its contributions to IDA
and supports the provision of global public goods through contributions to global funds. In
addition, the Bank offers its expertise to help prepare Russia for the presidency of international fora
such as APEC, G20, and BRICS. At the regional level, the World Bank Group supports Russia as an
emerging donor for less-developed countries in ECA. Russia is already a significant provider of
development assistance through a growing portfolio of IDA/IBRD-administered trust funds. At the
national level, the World Bank Group aims to maximize its development impact by reaching out to
the regions in Russia with the most development needs.
The current World Bank Group 2012–2016 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Russian
Federation was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors in December 2011. It is aligned
with government priorities and is organized around four strategic themes: (i) increasing growth
and diversification through better management of public finances, improved investment climate
and innovation, stronger financial sector, better infrastructure, and more effective protection of the
environment, (ii) expanding human potential by strengthening skills and social services through
improvements in education, health, and social protection, (iii) improving governance and
transparency through more accountability and better service standards in public administration,
procurement, and financial management, and (iv) deepening Russia’s role in global and regional
development related to the provision of global public goods and Russia’s growing role as a donor.
The CPS is being implemented largely as anticipated, with some delays in project preparation and
emerging modifications in the lending program. The strategy endorsed an envelope of up to
US$5 billion in IBRD lending to support the program over the CPS period. IFC committed to invest
between US$3.8 and US$4.8 billion for its own account, plus the significant mobilization of
counterpart funds. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) continues to support
foreign investors through the provision of political risk guarantees.

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The Russian Federation joined the World Bank (IBRD and IDA) in 1992. The Bank has provided
financing for 70 projects in different sectors totaling slightly over US$10.5 billion in IBRD loans.
About 95 percent of the total portfolio has already been disbursed. The IBRD active lending
portfolio amounts to US$668 million (as of April 2015) across ten projects in the areas of public
sector management, municipal infrastructure, land registration, cultural heritage preservation,
financial literacy, hydro-meteorology, and forestry. The undisbursed balance is US$353 million as of
April 2015. All of the Bank’s financing to Russia is provided in the form of investment project
financing.

Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) are an important part of IBRD’s engagement in Russia.
ASA products are helping to modernize public finance and administration and improve social service
delivery and the investment climate. The Bank also provides technical assistance in areas such as
early childhood development, indigenous people, social development, and social accountability. In
FY15, along with two traditional flagship Russia Economic Reports, the World Bank is finalizing a
report on Social Mobility and Opportunity and another on Aging.
Demand for Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) in Russia is steady, with continued interest
from the regions and growing demand from the federal government. Since 2007, the World
Bank has entered into more than 80 RAS agreements, which cover a wide range of activities that are
well aligned with Russia’s development challenges. RAS are also of increasing importance for
Russia’s regions, as more than 30 of Russia’s subnational governments have signed at least one RAS
with the World Bank (15 currently active in nine different regions).

B. International Finance Corporation
Russia became an IFC member in 1993. Since then, IFC’s long-term investments in Russia have
totaled US$10 billion,2 including US$3.5 billion in syndicated loans across 263 projects. IFC’s current
committed investment portfolio in Russia is US$1.5 billion in about 100 projects with roughly
70 clients. In FY14, IFC committed US$655 million for its own account and mobilized US$104 million
from partners. Since the beginning of FY15, IFC has committed about US$60 million for its own
account.
In line with the World Bank Group CPS, IFC continues to support economic diversification and
growth in Russia by helping its private sector clients realize long-term development potential, with
a particular focus on maximizing impact in less-developed regions. These efforts include the
creation of new high-skilled jobs; the expansion of high value-added manufacturing; and the
improvement of transport and social infrastructure to provide people and companies with better
access to goods and services. In addition, IFC provides Russian companies and banks with strategic
advice on achieving long-term sustainable growth, increasing energy and resource efficiency, and
improving corporate governance, and also advises Russian regions on structuring municipal
infrastructure projects.

C. Multilateral Guarantee Agency
MIGA’s gross exposure in Russia was US$804 million as of February 2015 (MIGA’s
third-largest gross and net exposure). MIGA is involved in eight projects in finance, infrastructure,
manufacturing, agribusiness, and services. In dollar terms, MIGA’s exposure is concentrated in
Russia’s financial sector (some 80 percent of MIGA’s gross exposure), supporting the investments of
global financial institutions in their banking, mortgage, and leasing subsidiaries in Russia. Five out of

Previously IFC reported the total volume of investments, including short-term and long-term. Due to changes in
accounting of short-term instruments, they are no longer included in the total investment volume.

MIGA’s eight projects are in non-financial sectors, some of them in Russia’s regions, such as
agribusiness in Russia’s “black earth” regions of Penza and Tambov and manufacturing in
Novocherkassk.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 18, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of emerging
data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data improvements exists.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there have been concerns
about the reliability and consistency of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide range of users,
including Fund staff. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national account
development plan for 2011–17, which will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP estimates
consistent with the annual GDP estimates. The Rosstat follows the 1993 SNA in general, although
scope exists for methodological improvements in the calculations of volume measures of the
production-based GDP estimates, including estimates of the output of financial intermediation
services indirectly measured (FISIM). The imputed rental services of owner-occupied dwellings may
be underestimated. Improvements in the coverage of source data are constrained by an inadequate
response to business surveys. The unavailability of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle to
analyzing balance sheet vulnerabilities; however, work is underway to disseminate the first quarterly
sectoral accounts and balance sheets for 2012–14 by 2016.
Price Statistics: Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled using the Two-Stage (Modified) Laspeyres
(2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian Federation. The weights reflect expenditures in the
12 months ended the previous September. Aggregate price indices are compiled for each good and
service item for the 89 regions, seven federal regions, and the Russian Federation as a whole.
However, population weights, as opposed to expenditure shares are applied to the individual
regional indices possibly biasing the CPI downwards if price increases are higher in regions with
higher per capita expenditures. Detailed data on total annual sales, which are used to develop
weights for the PPI, are published by economic activity on the Rosstat website. The detailed weights
are available only on the Russian version of the website, making it less accessible to some users.
Further efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the core inflation index and a new
household budget survey—which has been under consideration for some time—could significantly
strengthen data quality.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities compile comprehensive set of the general
government accounts based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on
annual basis. These data comprise the statement of sources and uses of cash as well as the accrual
based government operations (revenue, expenditure and transactions in assets and liabilities),
complete balance sheet (including non-financial assets), holding gains and losses and other changes
in volume of assets and liabilities, and outlays by functions of government (COFOG). Monthly GFSM
2001 based statement of sources of uses of cash is also compiled for the whole general government
sector. The main data gaps are due to the unavailability of quarterly primary data to compile the
accrual based general government operation statement, financial balance sheet, and gross debt (by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

instrument, maturity, residency, and currency). The actual split of annual debt into foreign and
domestic refers to the domestic/foreign currency rather than residency. Additional gaps remain that
affect the data quality for surveillance, for example the lack of historical quarterly data, unexplained
data breaks (for instance the reclassification of some wage expenses from the budgetary central
government accounts to the regional government accounts (following 2011 reforms ), unavailability
of monthly data on ruble guarantees prior to 2011, no integrated debt monitoring and reporting
system, and the lack of reconciliation between different datasets of fiscal reporting (budget
execution, cash flow statement, economic versus functional classification, fiscal statistics data).
Monetary and Financial Statistics: In the context of the recent global turmoil, analysis of balance
sheet effects has been hindered by a lack of comparable data on the currency and maturity
breakdown of banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in the full detail of
the framework for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an STA mission in
2007 (and re-affirmed by the ROSC mission in 2010), would provide comprehensive information on
the currency and instrument breakdowns of the assets and liabilities of the central bank, credit
institutions, and other financial corporations. Since March 2011, the Banking System Survey (which is
equivalent to the Depository Corporations/Broad Money Survey) published by the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR) has included a breakdown of positions by national and foreign currency. Publication of
a similar breakdown of positions by national and foreign currency in the central bank and the credit
institutions surveys would be useful for analysis.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance, and
significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality. The CBR has recently published
the gross capital flow data for the private sector, which would facilitate the analysis of relatively
complex flows. Starting from 2012, the balance of payments is compiled according to the framework
of the Fund’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition
(BPM6) and the CBR has revised historical data (going back to 2005Q1 for BOP, and to 2011Q1 for
IIP), consistent with BPM6.
Partial data from a variety of sources are supplemented by the use of estimates and adjustments to
improve data coverage. In particular, the CBR makes adjustments to merchandise import data
published by the Federal Customs Service to account for “shuttle trade,” smuggling, and
undervaluation. Statistical techniques are also used to estimate transactions and positions of
foreign-owned enterprises with production sharing agreements, and these techniques are
continuously being improved. At the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile their
data with those of partner countries. Improvements have been made in the coverage and quality of
surveys on direct investment, and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS) and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Russia is an SDDS subscriber.
Russia participates in the G-20 Data Gap
Initiative.
Russia reports data for the Fund’s statistical
publications.
