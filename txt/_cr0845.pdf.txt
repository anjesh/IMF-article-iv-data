•

Scope and focus. A key topic of the discussion was the policy mix to address rising
inflation in the wake of vigorous growth and capital inflows. This year’s consultation
discussions gave special prominence to financial sector linkages. Thus, background
studies include work on monetary credibility, determinants of sovereign spreads, bank
lending behavior, the optimal level of reserves, and measuring credit risk of the banking
sector (see the Selected Issues paper).

•

Near-term policy mix. To increase the effectiveness of recent money tightening, the
exchange rate should be allowed to appreciate. Some tightening of the fiscal stance would
also ease the burden on monetary policy.

•

The monetary framework. A priority is to clarify the objectives and instruments of
monetary policy, including foreign exchange intervention.

•

Financial sector. There is a need to reduce further vulnerabilities from high dollarization
and deepen financial intermediation. Implementing the FSAP recommendations is key,
including reforming state banks and strengthening supervision. While reserve buildup
would be desirable to increase further the resilience of the financial system to external
shocks, reserve coverage is nearing adequate levels.

•

Fiscal sustainability. Large primary surpluses are still needed to trim public debt. To free
up resources for public investment, among the lowest in the region, nondiscretionary
spending should be reduced gradually. Private-public partnerships also provide a good
opportunity for upgrading infrastructure, provided that contingent liabilities are
contained. Reducing debt dollarization will help ensure debt sustainability.

•

Other reforms. There is scope for improving the business climate, including labor
relations and bureaucratic impediments to investment.

fiscal surpluses have helped reduce
debt ratios and debt management operations have improved the structure of the debt. Key
reforms have been implemented since the crisis, including a comprehensive tax reform, bank
restructuring and improved supervision. However, important elements of the government’s
reform agenda, which would further reduce vulnerabilities and help sustain high growth, still
need to be implemented.
2.
Near-term prospects are generally positive, but inflation has been on the rise. With
high momentum behind and strong domestic demand, real GDP growth could reach
5¼ percent in 2007. Higher growth and the recovery of the energy sector from the 2006
drought have improved fiscal prospects in 2007, with the 4 percent of GDP primary surplus
target likely to be met or surpassed. Inflation, however, has been rising and is likely to
exceed the target range (4½–6½).

B. Rising Inflation
3.
At 8.1 percent, inflation is now well above the target range. The authorities stressed
that the rise in inflation is largely due to temporary factors (drought in 2006 has given way to
floods in 2007) and likely to decline in the months ahead. Staff noted, however, that
underlying inflation has steadily increased―with one measure of core inflation above the
target range (Figure 2). The latest survey shows expected inflation near 7 percent by end2007, and declining to within the target range in 2008.
4.

Higher core inflation reflects both demand-pull and cost-push factors:

•

The authorities emphasized that imported inflation had become a significant factor.
With price increases of tradable goods running well above the inflation target, there
was agreement about the need to prevent second round effects.

•

After four years of high growth, capacity is becoming a constraint, in at least some
sectors. According to some measures, output is now above potential (Figure 3).
Growth in 2006 reached 7 percent, well above historical averages, with private
consumption as the main source of growth. GDP growth during the first quarter and
monthly indicators through May have shown few signs of slowing. Still, given the
high levels of foreign direct investment, capacity and productivity are likely to
expand over the medium term.

•

110

Real wages are still below pre-crisis levels.

•

Wage pressures have increased as
labor market conditions have
tightened. With the unemployment
rate at its lowest level in this decade,
wage pressures are gradually
mounting. Unit labor costs are now
growing at a rate above the inflation
target. Still, real wages have recovered
to only 90 percent of pre-crisis levels.

exchange rate policies too have
played a role. In late 2005, with inflation well below the target range and persistent
appreciation pressures, the central bank concluded that money growth rates above
25 percent signaled the remonetization of the economy. Negative short-term real
interest rates were deemed the result of excess bank liquid reserves (largely held
abroad or at the central bank) and weak credit demand. Following large foreign
exchange purchases by the central bank, currency appreciation was arrested.
However, since these purchases were not sterilized, money growth reached 35 percent
by mid-2006. Inflation has increased steadily since then (see Section C below).

Fiscal policy also contributed to an increase in aggregate demand in 2006, but the
fiscal impulse is set to ease in 2007. Despite substantial fiscal consolidation since the
crisis, on a cyclical basis, staff estimates point to a decrease in the primary balance in
2006, implying a fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of GDP. The 2007 primary balance
target of 4 percent of GDP, however, implies a lower impulse of 0.3 percent of GDP.

inertia, while higher than expected

C. Capital Inflows, Monetary Policy, and Competitiveness
6.
The current account moved into
deficit in 2006, reflecting FDI and oilrelated imports. The deterioration is largely
explained by vigorous import growth
(30 percent in US dollar terms), partly
associated with FDI-related imports, high oil
prices, and temporary oil needs to deal with
a severe drought. Still, despite a slight
slowdown, export growth remained robust
(17 percent in US dollar terms), supported
by higher export prices.

The current account deficit has deteriorated, but remains low.

Capital inflows have allowed a
significant increase in reserves, but have
complicated macroeconomic management. Sizable sovereign debt issues were used largely
to improve the debt profile, including by repaying all Fund obligations (US$2.4 billion) and,
more recently, by placing US$1.2 billion in inflation indexed bonds aimed at gradually
reducing dollarization. However, large FDI inflows (7 percent of GDP in 2006) have created
appreciation pressures and competitiveness concerns in some sectors. In late 2005 the

9
authorities effectively moved from the
free float adopted in the aftermath of the
2002 crisis to a managed float.
Significant exchange purchases have
reduced the appreciation and volatility of
the exchange rate. In 2007, foreign
exchange purchases have been largely
undertaken by the government, partly to
meet its foreign currency needs. Net
international reserves (excluding private
banks’ reserves at the central bank and
recent prefinancing operations) have
risen by US$2½ billion since early 2006
and are approaching adequate levels
(see ¶20).
8.
Despite an announced
tightening, monetary conditions have
been variable. In late 2005, the central
bank adopted M1 as the intermediate
objective of monetary policy, with the
associated base money serving as an
operational target. While M1 growth
slowed somewhat to about 20 percent
by end-2006, core inflation increased in
early 2007. In response, in March 2007,
the authorities announced a shift toward
a “contraction” phase, with the 12-month
ahead indicative M1 target sharply
lowered from 15 percent to 9 percent, i.e.,
well below nominal GDP growth.
Although M1 growth accelerated in May
to 26 percent, partly reflecting instability
in the money multiplier, base money
growth has been contained, at around
15 percent in mid-July. Sterilization
operations have helped offset central
bank’s foreign exchange purchases from
the government.

Large FDI inflows led to a steady increase in international
reserves.

9.
The lack of nominal exchange rate flexibility has limited the effectiveness of
monetary policy and prompted ambiguity in the policy framework. Exchange rate rigidity
has closed off an important channel from money to prices and has increased market
perceptions of an exchange rate ceiling. As discussed in Chapter II of the Selected Issues
paper, there is now some ambiguity about the monetary framework, with the central bank
appearing to target inflation and an implicit exchange rate (about Ur$ 24 per dollar). In
particular, announced targets for inflation and indicative ceilings for M1, combined with
intervention in the foreign exchange market partly to resist nominal appreciation, have
created ambiguity about the objectives and instruments of monetary policy.
10.
Uruguay remains competitive.
Uruguay remains competitive, though is one of the few countries
in the region that experienced a decline in the terms of trade.
The external current account (net of FDI

remain favorable. Staff’s models suggest
at most a mild undervaluation of the real effective exchange rate of around
5–10 percent, despite a deterioration in the terms of trade since 2005 (Figure 4) (the
equilibrium real exchange rate was estimated by evaluating the cointegrating relationship
between the real exchange rate and economic fundamentals―i.e., productivity differentials,
terms of trade, and net foreign assets). While agreeing that Uruguay remains competitive,
officials were skeptical about estimates of under or overvaluation.
D. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
11.
Despite low short-term risks and
improved performance indicators,
financial vulnerabilities are still
important because of high dollarization.
Since the crisis, soundness indicators have
strengthened considerably and are now
broadly in line with comparator countries;
banks are better capitalized, with only 2

while banks are now profitable, this largely reflects their ability to capture deposits and place
them abroad at higher rates, rather than a resumption of credit (Figure 5). Staff and officials
agreed that as the economic and credit recovery mature, banks’ liquidity buffers against
shocks will decline. More importantly, with high demand deposits, over 75 percent of credit
denominated in U.S. dollars, and significant currency and maturity mismatches in the
corporate sector, the banking system continues to be subject to exchange and credit risk.
12.
Uruguay also remains exposed to international spillover risks. Trade has been
diversifying away from the region. In addition, non-resident deposits —a key factor
triggering the 2002 crisis—have been halved to about 20 percent. At the same time, while
country spreads have declined substantially since the crisis, Uruguay has yet to recover the
investment grade it had before the crisis. As discussed in chapter III of the Selected Issues
paper, sovereign spreads behavior is now more closely linked to most Latin American
countries, compared with pre-crisis years (Figure 6). Officials broadly agreed with this
assessment. Staff also noted that the 2006 FSAP stressed the need to further reducing
financial vulnerabilities, including from high dollarization (Figure 7).

The fiscal accounts have improved
considerably since 2002, but important
structural issues remain to be addressed.
Expenditure reductions shifted a primary deficit
into a surplus approaching 4 percent of GDP,
and the overall fiscal deficit is now close to zero.
However, at 2½ percent of GDP, public
investment is significantly lower than in the
1990s. Also, reflecting demographics and social
preferences, spending on wages and social
security benefits are the highest in the region,
representing about 70 percent of total noninterest
spending. And, while the recently approved tax
reform is expected to improve the
efficiency of the system, the tax burden is
projected to remain largely unchanged
(Figure 8).

rollover and interest risk have also fallen: the government took advantage of strong market
access and low spreads to repay short-term, floating interest rate or more expensive debts and
raised the average maturity of public debt from about 7 years at end-2001 to almost 12 years
in 2006. Nevertheless, despite increased issuance of inflation-indexed bonds, about
70 percent of public debt remains denominated in foreign currency.
II. POLICY ISSUES FOR DISCUSSIONS
16.
Discussions focused on the policy mix to deal with inflation and appreciation
pressures and reforms to further reduce vulnerabilities and sustain growth. Beyond the
near term policy challenge of rising inflation and strong capital inflows, the focus was on
medium term reforms, including several initiated in recent years: reform of the monetary
framework; further strengthening the financial system and its resilience to shocks; sustaining
large primary surpluses, while enhancing the quality of fiscal policies; and improving further
the business climate. Key measures in these areas, which were part of the recently cancelled
SBA and expected to be completed in 2007, are facing further delays.
17.
In line with the Fund’s policy on exceptional access, a report on Uruguay’s 2005
SBA has been prepared and discussed with the authorities. While sharing the thrust of the
report regarding the success of the SBA, officials disagreed with the assessment that further
progress could have been made in advancing the reform agenda. The authorities argued that
these reforms were beyond their control as they required congressional approval and stressed
that substantial progress had been achieved on the structural reform agenda.”

A. Dealing with Inflation and Appreciation Pressures
18.
Staff saw scope for clarifying the objectives and instruments of monetary policy,
including foreign exchange intervention. With the authorities targeting the inflation rate and
market perceptions of an exchange rate ceiling (see ¶9), staff observed that the appearance of
multiple objectives, and insufficient clarity regarding the relative importance of these
objectives, could potentially leave the

volatile inflation since the mid1990s), thus enhancing the effectiveness of exchange rate as a shock absorber; and, the
lending channel, while still low, is increasing as the share of local currency credit grows.
19.
The authorities view much of the upward pressure on the peso as deriving from
temporary FDI (pulp mills) projects. While they agreed that all channels of monetary policy
should be allowed to work, they ruled out a rapid appreciation of the exchange rate noting
that this could encourage speculative flows. With inflation expectations for end-2007 above
the target range, staff recommended implementing a faster reduction in the growth rate of M1
and to achieve the 9 percent growth rate sooner that currently targeted for June 2008. This
should help control inflation and bring expectations to within the 2007 target range. Staff
also advised to let interest rates adjust freely and the nominal exchange rate to appreciate in
reaction to the monetary tightening. Staff underscored that a small nominal appreciation
should not lead to competitiveness concerns, as the ongoing large FDI levels are expected to
increase exports and the productivity of the tradable sector.
20.
It was agreed that reserve buildup was desirable, but subordinated to the inflation
objective. As discussed in chapter V of the Selected Issues paper, reserve coverage is nearing
adequate levels, given the significant increase in reserves of the central bank, the large

20
liquidity levels held by banks, and the
reduction in short term debt and nonresident deposits. Staff’s simulations
suggest that, while in 2002 the central
bank required substantial assistance, a
similar shock today could be nearly
covered by central bank reserves and
banks’ own liquidity. However, staff
noted that the coverage was still below
that of other dollarized economies and,
more importantly, the exceptionally
high liquidity levels held by banks
were likely to decline in the future as
lending picked up. At the same time,
the currently large levels of foreign
direct investment are likely to be
temporary. Against this background,
there was agreement that that an
opportunistic approach to reserve
accumulation would be appropriate.
Staff emphasized that foreign
exchange purchases should be
consistent with exchange rate
flexibility to avoid deviations from
the long-term equilibrium. Officials
agreed on the importance of
sterilizing these purchases as needed
to ensure meeting the monetary
targets.
21.
Staff also recommended that
the policy mix should include a
tightening of the fiscal stance to help
ease the burden on monetary policy.
Analytical work indicates that the
primary fiscal balance is important in
explaining inflation expectations and
that the 4.0 percent of GDP primary
surplus target for 2007 still implies a
0.3 percent of GDP positive fiscal
impulse, adjusted for the cycle. While
noting that fiscal impulse calculations

that uncertainty about the precise effect of the tax reform on revenues, and high spending
needs, prevented them from committing, ex-ante, to a higher primary surplus target.
B. Moving to Inflation Targeting
22.
There was agreement that the adoption of full-fledged inflation targeting should
proceed gradually. Moving toward inflation targeting has been an objective of the authorities
for some time, and the case for doing so has strengthened on account of the instability of
monetary aggregates and

but indicated their intention to further study other alternatives before committing to
operational modalities.
23.
Enhancing credibility will be
key, given the increased role of
expectations in the inflation process.
There was agreement that approval of
legislation now in congress to
increase the independence of the
central bank would be an important
step in this direction. Staff stressed
that it was also essential to raise
operational independence by limiting
foreign exchange purchases by the
state bank; capitalization of the

central bank envisaged in draft law in congress would also be important. Greater monetary
credibility, together with continued fiscal prudence and further improvements in the
composition of public debt, would help reduce dollarization over the medium-term, further
strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy. There was broad agreement that
improving transparency and communications with the markets was important to strengthen
the expectation channel of monetary policy. However, some officials argued that ambiguity
in the choice of instruments in a small market had benefits since more transparency could
lead to collusion against the central bank.
C. Financial System Soundness
24.
Deepening financial intermediation and reducing vulnerabilities would require
action in several areas. Implementing the key recommendations of the 2006 FSAP will be
important, including:
•

Strengthening state banks and increasing competition. There was agreement about
the need to continue strengthening credit procedures at the state bank. Staff
recommended to reduce government guarantees to state-owned institutions, eliminate
the privilege of the state bank on payroll deductions, and establish fit-and-proper
requirements for directors of state banks. Officials were skeptical that competition
would increase as a result of eliminating the monopoly of the state bank over payroll
deductions; and noted that implementing fit-and-proper criteria entailed legal
challenges, requiring a by-law regulating criteria included in the constitution.

•

BHU restructuring. Staff welcomed the establishment of a new agency to execute
housing policy and the transfer of all mortgage loans to a new information system.
Officials noted that further delays were expected because a new business plan and the
transfer of workers from BHU to other parts of the government were yet to be
implemented. Staff urged the authorities to swiftly complete BHU restructuring to
allow the resumption of sound mortgage lending.

•

Supervision and regulatory framework. Staff encouraged the authorities to help
ensure early passage of financial sector legislation aimed at increasing the
independence of the central bank, provide a bank resolution framework, and enhance
the structure of financial sector supervision. Staff also noted that increasing resources
and improving information systems would be key for effective supervision and to
maintain credit standards as credit picked up. Officials indicated that the revised 2008
budget contained resources for this purpose. Uruguay’s regulations on dollar lending
and nonresident deposits compare well to other countries, with liquidity requirements
differentiated by residency, maturity, and currency; banks are also required to stress
test individual loans for a significant depreciation to rate its credit quality. There was
agreement on the need to lower the requirements on foreign exchange open positions,
and make them fully consistent with recently approved legislation on the required
capital for exchange rate risk.

Developing domestic capital markets. The authorities were optimistic about
prospects for a passage of the bankruptcy law in Congress. They agreed on the
importance of improving corporate governance and disclosure practices and gradually
developing markets for hedging instruments through the establishment of a reference
yield curve for government debt. In this context, the Fund is sponsoring a conference
in Montevideo on the development of domestic capital markets in the region.

A modified contingency claims approach yields similar results. As discussed in
Chapter VI of the Selected Issues paper, a simulation of the 2002 crisis suggests that, in the
absence of external assistance, banks representing over 90 percent of banking sector’s total
assets were facing an estimated default probability (EDP) exceeding 25 percent; a similar

banks representing less than

Similarly, under the two extreme
FSAP’s stress tests, banks would
face today, on average, 24 and
14 percent EDP, compared with
a model estimate of 45 percent
in 2002.

The default probability for the banking sector has stabilized since 2002 and
remains at lower levels even when facing significant shocks.

(FLAR) was largely made to improve reserve management. While noting that their
membership to FLAR helps reduce risks, officials agreed that regional reserve pooling
arrangements are not a substitute of global arrangements, which provide added protection in
case of a regional crisis. Indeed, over the last 25 years, Uruguay has experienced two major
economic crises, both originating from regional shocks.

Debt sustainability analysis argues
for continued fiscal discipline and sound
debt management. Traditional
(deterministic) debt sustainability analysis
indicates that Uruguay’s debt will still
exceed 40 percent of GDP by 2012. Staff
research capturing the stochastic nature of
the projections through Monte Carlo
simulation, also suggests that, even if fiscal
policy remains on track, there would still be
a 38 percent probability that debt levels
exceed 50 percent of GDP by 2012
(Appendix I). The larger upside risks
reflected in the forecast stem from the
historically asymmetric impact of shocks on
debt levels. These results can be compared
with average debt-to-GDP ratio in countries
the year before entering the debt crisis of
57 percent (Occasional Paper 255). Despite a

significant decline in debt dollarization in recent years, officials agreed that the process has
further to go to reducing Uruguay’s exposure to exchange rate movements.
29.
Staff supported increased spending on projects to catalyze private investment, but
urged the authorities to resist pressures to relax the fiscal targets. Staff recommended
maintaining the medium term primary surplus target of 4 percent of GDP in support of debt
reduction, while agreeing that a small relaxation may be appropriate to allow for countercyclical policy in the event of a slowdown. However, to the extent that inflation concerns
persist and the economy remains vigorous, staff advised exceeding the medium-term target.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the stance associated with the 4 percent of
GDP primary surplus target, but noted their intention to shift the emphasis to the overall
balance as the “headline” fiscal objective. The tax reform started to be implemented on July 1
and progress has been made in the area of customs and tax administration reforms. There was
agreement that these reforms, together with the implementation of Private-Public
Partnerships (PPPs), would help deal with substantial nondiscretionary spending. Staff
encouraged the authorities to carefully assess the criterion to undertake PPPs, including
contingent liabilities, and to create a general legal and accounting framework for these
operations. Further strengthening of public financial management, including commitment
controls and audit functions, would also be important.
30.
Staff recommended to gradually reduce current spending in favor of capital
spending over the medium-to long-term. There was agreement that spending increases,
including those related to the new social equity plan, in the revised 2008 budget do not entail
significant risks to the medium-term outlook, with targets broadly in line with a 4 percent of
GDP surplus in the primary balance. Officials rightly noted that there was little scope for
large reductions in current spending, highlighting that their high levels were largely the result
of demographic factors and social preferences. Nevertheless, they stressed their plans to press
ahead with the reforms of the specialized pension schemes, particularly for banking
employees which entail significant fiscal risks beginning in 2009. Staff also pointed to the
importance of ensuring that the envisaged reform to the civil service helps increase budget
flexibility in the medium-term.
E. Improving the Business Climate
31.
The frequency of labor conflicts has fallen, but some concerns about the labor
climate remain. A law regulating the resolution of labor conflicts is still to be agreed on.
Business associations have resisted a new law on outsourcing that partly makes outsourcing
companies liable for labor code violations by subcontractors. There was agreement on the
importance of a well functioning and competitive labor market, particularly given Uruguay’s
high structural rates of unemployment.

26
32.
There is scope to reduce
bureaucratic impediments to
investment. While Uruguay compares
relatively well to other countries in the
region in the World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey, there is room for
improvements in several areas (e.g.,
starting a business and registering
property). The new private investment
office and the approval of the law on
competition are steps in the right
direction.

There is scope for im proving the business environm ent, particularly reagrding
staring a business and registing property.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Sound policies and a favorable global environment have contributed to the sharp
recovery since the 2002 crisis. Strong primary fiscal surpluses have helped reduce debt ratios
and sound debt management operations have improved the debt structure. Financial sector
restructuring has strengthened the resilience of the system to shocks. Prudent monetary
policy has been instrumental in reducing inflation to single digits and, with strong foreign
direct investment and access to capital markets, reserves have risen significantly.
34.
Uruguay’s near term economic prospects are generally favorable. Economic growth
could reach 5¼ percent in 2007, supported primarily by domestic demand. Higher growth has
improved fiscal prospects, with a large primary surplus expected to help trim public debt, and
substantial large foreign direct investment should allow for further reserve buildup. However,
there is a risk that inflation could exceed the target range (4½–6½).
35.
The main short-term challenge is to address rising inflation in the wake of vigorous
growth and capital inflows. The central bank has appropriately lowered monetary targets,
signaling its commitment to low inflation and should continue implementing a faster
reduction in money growth to achieve the end-year targets earlier in the year. Allowing the
exchange rate and interest rates to adjust freely in response to this tightening would help
increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. Tightening the fiscal stance would help ease
the burden on monetary policy.
36.
The reduction of vulnerabilities in recent years has been a major accomplishment,
but challenges remain. While declining, the public debt ratio is still high and debt is largely
denominated in dollars. The financial system too is highly dollarized, with a large share in
sight deposits, and currency mismatches in the corporate sector expose banks to exchange
rate risk. Given banks’ high liquidity levels, central bank reserves appear near adequate
levels; still, with banks’ liquidity likely to decrease in the future, further reserve buildup is

27
desirable. Completing reforms initiated in recent years in the monetary framework and public
finances would help reduce dollarization, thus increasing Uruguay’s resilience to shocks. It is
also essential to continue deepening financial sector reforms and implement the
recommendations of the 2006 FSAP, including further reforming state banks and
strengthening supervision.
37.
The objectives and instruments of monetary policy should be clarified. In the long
term, the appearance of multiple objectives could potentially leave the system without an
anchor. In the near term, the presence of large capital inflows and exchange rate rigidity is
reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Intervention in the foreign exchange market
should avoid hindering exchange rate movements and be subordinated to the inflation
objective. The exchange rate level appears broadly appropriate, certainly well within the
margins of analytical uncertainty, and the economy remains competitive. The adoption of
full-fledged inflation targeting should proceed gradually. Legislation in congress increasing
the independence of the central bank should enhance policy credibility of the monetary
framework, but it will also be important to capitalize the central bank and limit foreign
exchange intervention by the state bank.
38.
Maintaining high primary fiscal surpluses will be essential to further reduce the
debt burden. Fiscal performance in recent years has been commendable; however, exceeding
the medium-term target would be appropriate if inflation concerns persist and debt remains at
still high levels. The recent implementation of the tax reform and progress in the area of
customs and tax administration reforms is welcomed. The authorities are closely monitoring
them to ensure their success. With public investment below regional levels, improving the
quality of spending is important. This will require gradually reducing non discretionary
spending, including through reforming the banking pension scheme. PPPs are an opportunity
for upgrading infrastructure, provided that contingent liabilities are minimized. Reducing
debt dollarization is needed to help ensure debt sustainability.
39.
Further improving the business climate is key. The creation of a private investment
office and implementation of the competition law will help the business environment;
approval of the bankruptcy law will be also an important step. It is essential to continue
fostering good labor relations, enhance competition in labor markets, and reduce bureaucratic
impediments to investment.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Uruguay take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
1.
The authorities have made substantive changes in the debt profile in recent years.
The net present value of public debt declined and its structure improved after the 2003 debt
exchange. Further fundamental improvements have taken place since then. Vigorous growth,
the strengthened fiscal position, and currency appreciation have lowered the debt-to-GDP
ratio from above 100 to below 65 percent.
Gross financing needs have fallen in the medium term

1/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and
long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

2.
Recent efforts in the markets have succeeded in lowering gross financing
requirements over the medium term. The authorities have taken advantage of strong market
access and sharply lower spreads and have improved the debt profile by using long-term
bond issues to repay short-term, floating rate or more expensive debts. This includes the full
repayment of all remaining Fund obligations (SDR 726 million) in November 2006. Also, the
government increased issuance of inflation-indexed bonds (including two combined
placements in 2007 exceeding US$1.2 billion) and swapped US$1.1 billion in amortization
payments due mostly in 2011 and 2015 into longer maturity bonds (Figure 1). As a result, the
average maturity of public debt has risen from about 7 years at end-2004 to nearly 12 years.
Consequently, gross financing requirements have fallen in the medium term, from 10 percent
forecasted for 2007 a year ago to just over 3 percent.
3.
The strengthening of the portfolio has significantly reduced the debt vulnerability
as measured in dynamic simulations. Staff sought to capture inherent uncertainty contained
in debt forecasts by modeling 1,000 potential five-year economic scenarios through Monte
Carlo simulation. The debt forecast results from the authorities’ reaction to each economic
scenario. The economic scenarios are simulated using a vector autoregression of economic
fundamentals from approximately the past ten years, excluding the crisis period surrounding
2002. The crisis period is excluded since policy responses to such scenario can not be
sensibly modeled by a parsimonious fiscal reaction function. Instead, the fiscal reaction
function is estimated over almost fifty years of recorded data of the Uruguayan primary
balance, debt, and other economic aggregates. This function is intended to systematically

produce a fiscal response to the 1,000 simulated scenarios.1 The results suggest a median debt
path declining to approximately 46 percent, with significant upside risk. The probability of
exceeding 65 percent of GDP in the last year of the forecast is below 18 percent, while the
probability of the debt declining to below 40 percent is approximately 37 percent.
4.
Staff estimates that the current implicit fiscal rule of keeping a primary balance of
4 percent of GDP will ensure greater stability for Uruguay. The fiscal reaction function was
compared to a fiscal rule of maintaining a 4 percent of GDP primary surplus, which yields a
debt ratio declining to just below 40 percent of GDP by the last year of the forecast. This is
consistent with the deterministic approach to debt sustainability (Figure 2), which also
highlights the exposure to exchange rate risks and lower GDP growth.
The probability of observing a debt to GDP ratio above 50 percent in 2012 is less than 40 percent in
1,000 simulations.

Staff estimated the fiscal reaction using: pbt = α 0 + α1 Dt −1 + α 2 ΔREERt + α 3Ygapt + ε t ; pbt is the

primary balance in year t, Dt −1 represents lagged US dollar external debt, ΔREERt is an index that captures
the devaluation divided by the depreciation, and Ygapt represents the output gap (estimated via HodrickPrescott). The function is estimated using data from 1965 to 2006, and tests reject potential endogeneity in the
output gap, staff nevertheless instruments it using external factors and lagged values. Various robustness tests
indicated that the function fit the data well, including tests for non-linearity in debt levels, oil prices, regional
and trading partners, among others.

1/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
2/ Framework covers the public sector (net of free reserves and monetary policy instruments).
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II. SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
The full annexes to this report can be viewed in CyberDocs on the Fund’s intranet and on the
secure extranet for Executive Directors and member officials.
Fund Relations
On June 8, 2005, a three-year SBA was approved under the exceptional access procedures
(SDR 766.3 million, 250 percent of quota). Uruguay repurchased all remaining Fund
obligations (SDR 726.7 million, 237 percent of quota) on November 30, 2006, and cancelled
the arrangement on December 27, 2006. A safeguard assessment was completed in
September 2005. In April, 2006, Uruguay’s defacto exchange rate regime was reclassified
from an independent float to a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange
rate. The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 28,
2006 (Country Report No. 06/425).
Relations with the World Bank Group1
The current investment portfolio comprises six projects totaling US$181 million in
commitments, with an undisbursed amount of US$141 million as of May 17, 2007. The
performance of the investment portfolio improved significantly in CY04 and CY05, with
disbursements for investment operations aggregating to US$43.8 million and
US$58.6 million respectively. Disbursements from the investment portfolio in CY06 were
US$42.1 million, with a decrease with respect to previous years as a consequence of the
renewal of the portfolio and slow start-up of new operations. On November 21, 2006, the
Board of Executive Directors of the WB Group approved a loan of US$170 million by the
IFC, and a guarantee of US$350 million by MIGA, to the Finnish company Botnia for the
construction of a wood pulp plant in Fray Bentos.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank2
As of May 24, 2007 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing
of 18 investment projects; and two policy based operations, for the social sectors and for
improvements in competitiveness. The lending portfolio, which is largely aligned to the
administration’s priorities and consistent with the Bank’s country strategy, amounts to
US$1,017..5 million, of which US$604.8 million are pending disbursement. Portfolio
performance in the recent past was affected by the government’s fiscal constraint, which
entailed cuts in budgetary allocations to levels below the required amounts in order to
maintain a normal pace of project implementation. In line with the strengthening of the fiscal
accounts, the pace of project implementation in 2006 increased markedly.

VII. Safeguards Assessment. The authorities are in the process of addressing all
safeguards concerns raised in the safeguards assessment completed in September 2005, and
have already implemented many of the recommendations proposed by staff. Uruguay's total
obligations to the Fund are now included in the BCU's financial statements and the criteria
for the selection and appointment of the BCU's external audit firm have been amended in line
with the safeguards recommendation.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. The currency is the Uruguayan peso (Ur$). Uruguay
has followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002. In April
2006, Uruguay’s de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified from an independent float to
a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. On May 31, 2007, buying
and selling interbank rates for the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, were Ur$ 23,97 and
Ur$24.02, respectively. Uruguay’s exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The exchange restriction associated with the
reprogramming of time deposits at BROU and BHU during the 2002 crisis was removed
ahead of schedule in April 2005.
IX.
Article IV Consultation. The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on June 28 (Country Report No. 06/79). Uruguay is on the standard
consultation cycle governed by the provisions approved by the Executive Board on
July 15, 2002.
X.
Ex Post Assessment. The last Ex Post Assessment of Longer-Term Program
Engagement was considered by the Executive Board on March 18, 2005 (Country Report No.
05/202).
XI.
FSAP participation and ROSCs. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA)
was considered by the Executive Board on June 28, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/187). The
ROSC-module on fiscal transparency was published on March 5, 2001. A ROSC-module on
data dissemination practices was published on October 18, 2001. The ROSC on Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) was published on
December 2006 (Country Report No. 06/435)
XII. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance on tax, customs, and social security
administration was provided by FAD in February 2007, March 2006, June 2005, and July
2003, on tax policy in October 2005 and May 2003, and on public financial management in
March 2005 and July 2006. In April 2003, STA provided technical assistance on adequate
recording of loans funded by the FSBS. MFD has been providing substantial and continuous
technical assistance since 2002 in the resolution of intervened banks, the restructuring of the
public bank BROU, and recently on BHU, and in July 2005 jointly with ICM on debt
management. Further, MFD has also provided technical assistance to strengthen the
formulation and conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies, including in July 2006 and
May 2007. In February 2007, LEG provided technical assistance to develop a framework to
elaborate and implement a national AML/CFT strategy consistent with the recommendations
of the Fund’s 2005 AML/CFT assessment report.
XIII. Resident Representative. Mr. Gaston Gelos. Starting late August, the Resident
Representative will cover Uruguay from the Buenos Aires’ office.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 21, 2007)
The World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) on June 9, 2005. The CAS envisages a base case scenario of up to US$800 million in
new lending over the period FY05–10. The lending program will be modulated on the
strength of the Government’s program and its ability to implement it, as well as the
evolution in the country’s creditworthiness.
The Bank’s strategy outlined in the new CAS is anchored around a series of programmatic
development loans that are expected to be multi-sectoral in focus and support the
Government in key policy areas including public sector management, financial sector
reform, and reform of social programs. The CAS also proposes to rebuild the investment
portfolio with new operations planned to support priority investments in infrastructure,
social programs and innovation.
The previous CAS was approved on May 5, 2000 and a CAS Progress Report on July 25,
2002. Following the 2002 crisis, the Bank increased its financial support, shifting to a high
case lending scenario of US$550 million for fiscal years 2002–04, concentrated in
adjustment lending. A Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) and a Special Structural
Adjustment Loan (SSAL I) were approved with the CAS Progress Report, totaling
US$303 million, to assist Uruguay in addressing structural weaknesses and in managing the
economic crisis. On April 8, 2003, another structural adjustment package (SAL II and
SSAL II) was approved totaling US$252.5 million, focusing on improving public services
and human development policies. Progress in implementation of SAL I and SSAL I has
been satisfactory, and the last tranches in an aggregate amount of US$100 million
(US$50 million of SAL I and US$50 million of SSAL I) were released in October 2004.
Because of the 2003 referendum on petroleum and the 2004 constitutional amendment on
water, SAL II was restructured. In January 2007, a second tranche of US$40 million was
released and the third tranche was cancelled. With regard to SSAL II, the objectives of the
program have been achieved and, with the immediate crisis over and the beginning of a new
CAS period, the outstanding second and third tranches of this operation were cancelled at
the Government’s request. The social reform agenda continues to be supported by a series
of DPLs. The first DPL (DPL1), approved by the Board of Executive Directors together
with the CAS on June 9, 2005, in an amount of US$75 million, supported reform progress
in social policies as well as important measures taken by the new Government with respect
to health, education and social protection. The DPL1 has been fully disbursed. A subsequent
DPL, the First Programmatic Reform Implementation Development Policy Loan in the
amount of US$100 million, will be considered by the Board of Directors on May 30, 2007.
This operation will support the Government’s reform program in the areas of tax reform,
business climate and capital markets development, and in improving the social protection

5
system. On May 30, 2007 an Institution Building Technical Assistance Project in the
amount of US$15 million will also be presented to the Board for consideration. In addition,
the second phase of an APL for OSE Modernization and Rehabilitation Systems (US$50
million) will also be presented for approval before the end of the fiscal year.
Four investment operations have been approved since the beginning of the new CAS period.
These include two investment operations for Integrated Natural Resources and Transport
Infrastructure and Rural Access, in the amount of US$30 million and US$70 million
respectively, which were approved by the Board on June 9, 2005 together with the CAS. In
addition, in December 2006, the Board approved a Supplemental Financing for the Foot and
Mouth Disease Project in the amount of US$6.5 million. Another investment loan in
support of the Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project was approved on
May 1, 2007 in the amount of US$26 million.
The current investment portfolio comprises six projects totaling US$181 million in
commitments, with an undisbursed amount of US$141 million as of May 17, 2007. The
performance of the investment portfolio improved significantly in CY04 and CY05, with
disbursements for investment operations aggregating to US$43.8 million and
US$58.6 million respectively. This was a reflection of the substantially improved economic
situation, as well closer portfolio monitoring, with portfolio performance reviews being
conducted every six months. Disbursements from the investment portfolio in CY06 were
US$42.1 million, with a decrease with respect to previous years as a consequence of the
renewal of the portfolio and slow start-up of new operations.
On November 21, 2006, the Board of Executive Directors of the WB Group approved a
loan of US$170 million by the IFC, and a guarantee of US$350 million by MIGA, to the
Finnish company Botnia for the construction of a wood pulp plant in Fray Bentos.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 24, 2007)
The Inter-American Development Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country
Strategy for Uruguay on March 15, 2006. The Bank’s Country Strategy supports the
Government’s policy, which seeks to consolidate growth and improve the population’s social
welfare. In support of this longer-term goal, the Strategy focuses on the following priority
areas: (i) improving public sector management, to increase its efficiency and efficacy, while
supporting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) enhancing regional and international
competitiveness of domestic output and encouraging private investment in order to promote
sustainable growth; and (iii) reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion.
The implementation of the Bank’s strategy proposes a likely lending scenario of about
US$1.2 million for the five-year period 2005–09, which together with a normal execution of
the loan portfolio, mainly investment projects, will allow for the net lending flows to remain
relatively neutral. This program includes lending to support the Government in the key policy
areas of competitiveness, the social sectors and poverty reduction, and public sector
management. To this end, within the area of competitiveness, a loan for a program to support
the productivity and development of new livestock products, for US$15.8 million, was
approved in July 2005; an investment project to improve cluster competitiveness for
US$9 million was approved in July 2006; and a two-year programmatic loan to improve
competitiveness for a total of US$150 million––for US$75 million each––is under
preparation, with the first loan approved in January 2007 and expected approval of the
second loan in early 2008. In the social sector area, a sector loan, for US$250 million, was
approved in August 2005, to support the development and implementation of Government’s
social policy aimed at reducing poverty, improving the human resource base among the poor,
and strengthening the sector’s institutional framework; and a loan for sanitation, for
US$118.6 million, was approved in January 2006, to improve the standard of living of the
population in Montevideo by increasing the coverage of sanitation service and reducing
pollution in the bay. Within the public sector management area, a loan to support the public
debt management unit for US$2.45 million was approved in November 2005; and a threeyear programmatic loan to support improvements in tax administration and public sector
management is being prepared. The first loan for US$50 million was approved in October
2006; a second loan for an estimated US$150 million is likely to be approved in end-2007
while the amount for 2008 is to be determined. The lending program also includes
investment projects with new operations planned in the area of microfinance, to support
transport infrastructure, and social programs such as a neighborhood improvement programs.
As of May 24, 2007 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing
of 18 investment projects; and two policy based operations, for the social sectors and for
improvements in competitiveness. The lending portfolio, which is largely aligned to the

8
administration’s priorities and consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy, amounts to
US$1,017..5 million, of which US$604.8 million are pending disbursement. Portfolio
performance in the recent past was affected by the Government’s fiscal constraint, which
entailed cuts in budgetary allocations to levels below the required amounts in order to
maintain a normal pace of project implementation. In line with the strengthening of the fiscal
accounts, the pace of project implementation in 2006 increased markedly. A challenge ahead
in terms of portfolio management, for both the Bank and the authorities, will be to ensure that
the projects maintain the pace of project execution in 2007–08 while setting the stage for a
normal implementation of the new projects within the context of the budgetary allocations
approved in the five-year Budget Law, in the Budget Review Law for 2005 as well as in the
Budget Review Law for 2006, currently under discussion by Congress. As part of their debt
management strategy, the authorities paid in February 2006, US$100 million due and in
March, and pre paid the remaining US$300 million due in August 2006 and 2007,
corresponding to the Social Protection and Sustainability Program, which was approved in
August 2002.

ANNEX IV. URUGUAY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Uruguay’s economic and financial database is generally adequate for the assessment and
monitoring of macroeconomic policies. Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in February 2004,
and meets the SDDS specifications. However, Uruguay uses the flexibility option for
timeliness of central and general government operations, and the analytical accounts of the
banking sector.
Real sector statistics
National accounts statistics have a number of shortcomings, including the use of an outdated
benchmark year (1983), limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long publication lags,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. The
central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in current and constant
prices by the production and expenditure approaches, as well as quarterly constant price GDP
estimates by the production and expenditure approaches. Gross national income, gross
disposable income and gross savings are also available annually. A STA multisector mission
in November 1999 recommended a range of improvements including completing work on
revision of data and methods that had already been initiated, introduction of annually chained
volume measures, incorporation of new benchmark survey data, and compilation of quarterly
estimates of GDP at current prices.
Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the IFS. The consumer price index has a base period of March 1997 = 100, and
the base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Coverage of the CPI is
limited to the capital city. The authorities do not provide trade price and volume indices for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government finance statistics
Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises and the social security system
are complete and current, but there are problems with the timeliness of the data on local
governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of financing and debt data reported
for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly
basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website
from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector. The information
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions
on revenue and expense for the consolidated central government, and the general
government’s operations on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing)
and stocks (debt). However, data on revenue and expense for local governments have not
been reported since 1994.

10
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance with the IMF's Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities have yet to report monetary data using the
standardized reporting forms (SRF). In April 2003, an STA mission visited Montevideo to
assist the authorities in the adequate recording of the loans funded from the Fund for the
Stabilization of the Banking System (FSBS) in the Central Bank’s balance sheet. The
mission’s recommendations have been implemented and were reflected in the IFS June 2003
issue.
External sector statistics
Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a quarterly basis. Data are
compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the
IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The new surveys would also allow for
improved coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Fund’s external website in 2005 The BCU also disseminates quarterly
external debt statistics on its website, although not in the format envisaged by the SDDS.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Uruguay
August 29, 2007
Since the issuance of the staff report, the following information has become available. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Twelve-month inflation at end-July was 8.0 percent, only marginally lower than in
May and June. Thus, the risks of exceeding the authorities’ target range by end-2007
(4½–6½ percent) have increased. The latest survey shows expected inflation for end-2007
near 7½ percent, but still declining toward the target range in 2008.
2.
The recent financial turmoil had only moderate impact in Uruguay. The exchange
rate did not come under pressure and sovereign spreads widened only marginally (reaching
238 basis points in mid August, compared to 213 at end July).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 10, 2007

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Uruguay
On August 29, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Uruguay.1
Background
The Uruguayan economy continues to expand after the profound crisis experienced in 2002,
poverty rates have declined considerably, and unemployment is at its lowest level in a decade.
Growth has exceeded expectations supported by strong macroeconomic policies and renewed
market confidence, and economic vulnerabilities have been sharply reduced. Nevertheless, a
recent increase of inflation and the ongoing implementation of the structural reform agenda
remain key challenges.
Real GDP grew by 7 percent in 2006, continuing the strong performance following the crisis in
2002. The growth momentum remains solid this year, led by foreign investment and
consumption, and supported by an accommodative monetary policy stance. Inflation has
increased, fueled by pass-through from oil and other commodity prices and strong domestic
activity. Twelve-month inflation through July 2007 was 8 percent, above the upper limit of the
central bank’s target range (6.5 percent).
Fiscal performance has also been strong, with primary balances averaging near 4 percent of
GDP since 2004. Higher revenue collection and declining debt service going forward should

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

make room for priority social and capital expenditures while maintaining primary balances
consistent with the five-year budget approved in December 2005. To this end, it will be
important to continue to press ahead with the ongoing tax administration and customs reforms,
and to monitor carefully the implementation of the landmark tax reform which became effective
in July 2007. The public debt has declined from 110 percent of GDP in 2003 to a projected
62 percent of GDP by end 2007, with peso-denominated, inflation-indexed notes now
representing approximately 30 percent of the outstanding public debt stock.
Uruguay’s external sector remains strong, with buoyant exports and import growth driven by
large foreign direct investment projects. Measures of exchange rate competitiveness indicate
that the peso is broadly in line with fundamentals, while appreciation pressures may increase as
high capital inflows persist. Sovereign spreads are below pre-crisis levels, and the central bank
has accumulated US$3.6 billion in reserves to date, the equivalent of six months of imports or
three times short-term debt, with financing needs remaining moderate in the next few years.
Financial indicators have improved considerably, although vulnerabilities persist due mainly to
dollarization. Short-term debt has been sharply reduced through debt management operations.
Financial system soundness indicators have also improved, showing a well-capitalized banking
system, low non-performing-loan ratios, high liquidity levels, and improved profitability. In
addition, nonresident deposits—a key vulnerability at the time of the crisis—are much lower
than in 2002, and stress tests confirm the increased resilience of the financial system. Statedominance in the financial system remains large, and Uruguay remains one of the most
dollarized economies in the world (70 percent of public debt and over 80 percent of total
liabilities are denominated in dollars). Spillovers from regional shocks also remain a concern,
particularly in an environment of increasing financial risk.
Strong economic performance and policy reforms have sharply reduced vulnerabilities and
near-term risks since the 2002 crisis. Nevertheless, important structural reforms to the state
housing bank, the central bank, and state pension funds included in the agenda remain
unfinished. Also, the likelihood of less favorable global conditions has increased with the rapidly
changing liquidity environment, although the recent financial turmoil had only a moderate impact
on Uruguay.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound policies and progress on
structural reforms which, together with favorable external conditions, have led to a vigorous
economic recovery since the 2002 crisis and greatly reduced economic vulnerabilities. Sound
debt management has improved the debt structure, the financial sector has been strengthened,
and international reserves have increased significantly. While prospects are favorable, inflation
has risen above the target range and, together with the steadfast implementation of ongoing
structural reforms, is among the key challenges facing policymakers.

3
The central bank has acted appropriately to address rising inflation by substantially lowering its
monetary targets. Directors looked forward to continuing efforts to bring inflation and
expectations within the target range, including by allowing interest rates to adjust freely to the
monetary tightening. Directors generally saw scope for clarifying the objectives and instruments
of monetary policy, including foreign exchange intervention, to help enhance the effectiveness
of monetary policy in the face of large capital inflows. Directors recognized that with high
financial dollarization and banks’ liquidity likely to decline in the future, some additional reserve
buildup would be helpful. At the same time, most Directors considered that purchases in the
foreign exchange market should not hinder exchange rate movements and should be
subordinated to the inflation objective by allowing the currency to adjust more freely in response
to shocks. Directors agreed that the adoption of inflation targeting should proceed gradually, in
particular given the still high dollarization. Steps to further enhance the credibility of the
monetary framework should include capitalizing the central bank and strengthening its
autonomy. Directors welcomed the authorities’ assurances that inflation is the overriding
objective of monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the significant increase in the banking system’s resilience to shocks. To
address the remaining challenges, they stressed the importance of deepening financial sector
reforms and implementing the recommendations of the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment
Program. These include further strengthening state banks and banking supervision, and
completing the restructuring of the housing bank (BHU) to allow the resumption of sound
mortgage lending. Swift approval of the financial sector law will be key to enhancing central
bank independence and strengthening the supervisory and resolution frameworks. Several
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to join the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR).
Fiscal performance in recent years has been commendable. Directors underscored that it will be
essential to maintain large primary surpluses to further reduce the public debt ratio, which is still
at a high level. A number of Directors suggested that exceeding the medium-term targets to
help ease the burden on monetary policy would be appropriate if inflation concerns persist.
Directors also looked forward to continuing efforts to reduce debt dollarization in order to further
reduce vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed the recent implementation of the tax reform and progress in the area of
customs and tax administration. Freeing up resources for public investment, among the lowest
in the region, will require gradually reducing nondiscretionary spending. To this end, Directors
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with the reform of specialized pension funds. They
supported the authorities’ interest in public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a vehicle for
upgrading infrastructure, while emphasizing the importance of carefully assessing the criterion
to undertake PPPs, minimizing contingent liabilities, and strengthening the legal and accounting
framework for these operations.
Directors praised the authorities’ commitment to further improve the business climate. The
creation of a private investment office, the passage of the competition law, and the expected
approval of the bankruptcy law, are important steps to further enhance the business

4
environment. A few Directors also noted the need to enhance competition in labor markets and
reduce bureaucratic impediments to investment.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Uruguay's experience under the 2005–06 StandBy Arrangement. They noted that the arrangement was highly successful in helping strengthen
the economy, thereby paving the way for Uruguay’s exit from Fund financial support. Directors
supported the key messages of the ex post evaluation report, highlighting the important role that
the authorities’ steadfast pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and strong ownership had
played in contributing to the program’s success. Directors endorsed the report’s conclusion that
a further reduction of Uruguay’s vulnerabilities, building on the significant progress already
made, will hinge on the implementation of pending structural reforms to strengthen
macroeconomic and financial stability and maintain high growth over the medium term. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment in this regard, including to ensure the sustainability of
structural reforms.

for Uruguay and David Vogel, Advisor to Executive Director
August 29, 2007
Recent Developments
Uruguay's economy continues to show a satisfactory performance. Clearly, the Uruguayan
authorities' policies and reforms have led to positive and synergetic results. Among others,
economic activity continues to increase robustly; unemployment is currently below 9 percent
(the lowest rate in more than a decade); real wages have increased significantly - although they
have not yet fully recovered to pre-crisis levels; the poverty rate is five percentage points lower
than it was two and a half years ago; inflation -although it has increased in recent months due
to some temporary factors and a high imported inflation- is under control; investment relative
to GDP is at an inedited high level for the country; exports exhibit record levels and are highly
diversified; the average maturity of debt (currently at 14 years) has risen significantly; interest
payments represent around 4.1 percent of GDP (6 percent in 2004); the overall fiscal balance
will be close to the equilibrium at the end of 2007, which is absolutely unprecedented in
Uruguay; the debt-to-GDP ratio will finish this year somewhat higher than 60 percent
(approximately 40 percentage points below the ratio in 2004); and international reserves have
increased substantially.
The Authorities' Unalterable Ownership
After many years, this Article IV Consultation is no longer in the context of an IMF supported
program. Regarding the developments of the last program, the Ex Post Evaluation points out
the critical contribution of the Stand-By Arrangement, and Uruguay's efforts and achievements
made so far.
In 2004, Uruguay's debt to the Fund was very high (SDR 1,728 million, representing 564
percent of Uruguay's quota or 20 percent of the country's GDP). Hence, one of our authorities'
most immediate actions was to reach a new arrangement with the Fund in order to significantly
mitigate financial pressures over the short-term.
The Board approval of the Stand-By Arrangement in June 2005 was key for Uruguay to regain
access to international financial markets, in a process which has obviously been fed by the
confidence instilled by the authorities' policies and reinforced by the creation of a Debt
Management Unit at the Ministry of Finance - one of the program's conditionalities. The Debt
Unit's professional work contributed to reducing Uruguay's debt cost, lengthening its maturity,

2
and improving its currency structure (although much remains to be done in this area, the
current structure -71 percent in external currency and 29 percent in domestic currency and
inflation linked- is substantially different from the one observed in 2004 - 83 percent and 17
percent respectively).
After a significant change in the financial situation, at the end of 2006, and in the context of the
program's fifth and sixth reviews, the government formalized the cancellation of the Stand-By
Arrangement and the early repayment of the outstanding debt to the Fund. The latter allowed
the country to fulfill its commitment of establishing a well-articulated exit strategy from the
Fund's financial support. It is worth noting that all along the Stand-By Arrangement and perhaps more telling- even after the early cancellation in December 2006, our authorities have
demonstrated their strong ownership of the program - Uruguay's program. The fact that
Uruguay has no outstanding obligations with the Fund has not meant any change in the
envisaged reforms or targets, but simply a rescheduling of certain reforms in order to better fit
the program with financial, social, and political aspects.
Key Aspects of the Reform Agenda
During recent years, the Fund has increasingly taken political economy considerations into
account in its analysis and reports. These considerations are particularly important when a
country, like Uruguay, has to face delicate equilibriums among substantial social, economic,
and financial needs, some of which may -at least in the short term- imply trade-off situations.
As usual, trade-off situations bring out different preferences, conflicts, and collateral effects
that require in-depth analysis and discussions, which should obviously be handled with due
respect to democratic process. It is worth underscoring that Uruguay enjoys a wellestablished democratic system and, of course, this requires investing time in building up
consensus before making decisions.[1]
Decisions always involve time considerations. In this regard, the Uruguayan authorities have
put special emphasis on the sustainability of reforms. As depicted by the cited phrase
(footnote 1), bringing people around takes more time than establishing a reform by decree, but
it is worth the trouble as reforms are long-lasting only when society understands the need for
them. Furthermore, it is worth recalling that citizen's involvement in public discussions and
decisions is often associated with less corruption. Moreover, our authorities have kept in mind
the importance that each reform provides proper incentives and habits as well as promoting
better institutions as the pillars on which Uruguay's social and economic developments should
be based.
In this kind of ambitious reform agenda, it is impossible to undertake all reforms at the same
time. Establishing priorities is critical to the reform agenda and, in this regard, an adequate
assessment of the macro criticality of each reform has been key in the reform process.

3

Years of Reforms
Having underscored the key aspects of the reform agenda, we turn now to specific comments
on some of the most significant achievements.
Reinforcing financial institutions: Just days after the current administration took place, the
authorities had to face the insolvency of a cooperative bank (Cofac). The government resisted
pressures to bail out depositors. Far from that, the government introduced a limited deposit
insurance scheme and established a clear precedent that no public money would be used to bail
out private creditors. Furthermore, the government successfully privatized the Nuevo Banco
Comercial (NBC), which was acquired by a partnership of foreign financial institutions. The
Government also improved the supervision and prudential policies of the financial sector so as
to reduce vulnerabilities, for instance, by creating incentives to lessen the still high
dollarization in the financial system. Admittedly, BHU's reform is not yet completed but the
Government is relentlessly working on it. In fact, the legal framework for BHU's reform has
already been approved and it is at the implementation stage.
Diversifying trade and investment: Uruguay's Congress has approved an Investment Treaty
with the United States. This agreement was complemented early this year by the signing of a
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), which sets a blueprint to enhance
economic relations between Uruguay and the United States. Beyond this, Uruguay's
government is also making progress in diversifying its trading partners, so as to avoid too much
concentration of trade within our region.
Establishing and reforming key offices: In addition to the Debt Management Unit which was
established at the Ministry of Finance, a new Private Investment Office was created and the
Tax Agency (DGI) has been decisively transformed, thus enhancing transparency and
accountability while reducing incentives to evasion and rent-seeking activities. Following the
same objective, the customs agency and the social security bank (BPS) are undergoing a vital
transformation.
The tax reform as the centerpiece of the authorities' reform agenda: It is interesting to recall
that in order to invite Uruguayan citizens to participate in this reform, a draft version of the tax
bill was first posted on the Ministry's website. Later on, a refined version was subject to indepth discussions in Congress. Throughout the whole process, our authorities have clearly
underscored that, whereas they would not compromise with pressure groups, they were open to
introducing improvements aimed at strengthening the reform's objectives (efficiency, equity,
and coherence with the government's aim of promoting investment).
Improving the business climate: A law aimed at promoting and defending competence was
recently issued and a bankruptcy bill is currently under Congress' consideration. The

4
Uruguayan authorities have also made it clear that it is absolutely crucial to further increase
social inclusiveness to promote stability in a global sense.
Looking forward: Our authorities have underlined that until the end of this year, they will
focus on the approval of the financial sector laws and the reform of the police pension fund.
Fiscal Issues
Fiscal policies have successfully contributed to the authorities' envisaged targets: ensuring
fiscal sustainability (as noted, overall fiscal balance and public debt relative to GDP show
substantial improvements); mitigating poverty conditions (although growth is a pre-condition
to reducing poverty, the social deterioration coming from the 2002 crisis required active
policies - namely the Social Emergency Plan); revamping public infrastructure (the limited
resources led to foster a modality of Private-Public Partnership, which will be carried out in a
transparent manner and following the best international practices in this area); and significantly
increasing and better targeting social expenditures (which was undertaken without putting
fiscal prudence at risk).
Precisely, during recent discussions on the budget in Congress, Uruguay's Minister of Finance
stressed that effective social policies require prudential fiscal management. The government
has discussed at length with Congress on the budget composition, which shows a clear interest
in improving social expenditure without compromising Uruguay's financial program in any
way.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Some factors have posed substantial challenges for the monetary policy. First, the inflation
"imported" through the booming of commodity prices and particularly with recent increases
affecting Uruguay's agricultural exports, which weigh heavily in its CPI as they constitute the
staple food of its population. Secondly, the increase in international oil prices which also has a
direct impact on Uruguay's CPI as there is a full pass-through into domestic fuel prices. Finally,
the country was hit by climate vagaries as during the past year a drought was followed by a
flood and a severe cold. Fortunately, the tax reform (which involves a reduction of VAT rates
and the elimination of certain other indirect taxes that were largely inefficient and distortive i.e., Cofis or Impuesto de Contribución para el Financiamiento de la Seguridad Social) has
helped to partially offset the above-referred pressures.
Another challenge to Uruguay's monetary policy comes from large capital inflows, which tend
to generate some difficulties related to volatility and eventual distortions of the competitiveness
in the short term. The Central Bank grasped the opportunity to make opportunistic foreign
currency purchases that helped both to increase international reserves (Chapter V of the
Selected Issues Paper underscores that "reserves are nearing optimal prudential levels, although

5
further accumulation is desirable going forward") and smooth volatility and reduce the
distortions on the exchange rate. Having said this, it is important to remark that the authorities
fully agree with the staff's comments (Chapter II of the Selected Issue Paper) that "the
exchange rate should be allowed to float more freely in response to normal shocks". Whereas it
is not yet clear whether Uruguay will continue to enjoy such strong capital inflows, our
authorities prefer to smooth some volatility associated with short-term capital inflows which,
by their nature, are quite unpredictable.
In conclusion, the BCU's target-range is expected to decrease in the future (4-6 percent in
2008) and, as usual, the authorities will continue to face the mentioned challenges with a
combination of fiscal and monetary instruments, which, if necessary, could be pragmatically
tuned-up to meet the inflation target. Our Central Bank authorities are strongly committed to
continue improving the functioning of the financial and monetary systems, whereas giving
clear signals that keeping inflation at check is the overriding objective of monetary policy.
Market Access and Sovereign Spreads
As noted above, Uruguay has taken advantage of the global financial conditions and regained
important and relatively inexpensive access to the international financial markets. This has
been possible thanks to the authorities' prudent policies and their outstanding debt strategy.[2]
Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper deserves an in-depth analysis. This study notes that
since the loss of investment grade, Uruguay's spreads are mostly associated with those of other
emerging market economies - particularly neighboring countries. Evidently, almost every
country in the world is affected by deeper links to the global financial markets established by a
high integration and more sophisticated products. Uruguay is no exception; however, the
specificities of its case are made apparent by noting that whereas during 2004 and 2005 the
average of EMBI global bond spreads for emerging markets were noticeably lower than
Uruguay's, the current situation is showing a positive change for the country in absolute and
relative terms.
It is also interesting to underline that during the period of market turbulences in recent weeks,
Uruguay's rating was upgraded, which is an arms-length recognition to the authorities' fiscal
policies and debt strategy, firmly settled on Uruguay's long and unalterable tradition of
honoring its debts, as was fully recognized by many outstanding international policymakers
during a recent conference on Uruguay's 2002 crisis and its aftermath.[3]
Conclusion
The authorities are satisfied with the positive results achieved so far, as well as the encouraging
prospects based on sound policies and the reform advances undertaken in two and a half years.
However, this is not bringing complacency but rather reinforcing their determination to
continue making progress to fully implement the government's policies and reform agenda,

setting the basis for Uruguay's sustainable growth and human development.
Finally, this Article IV consultation ratifies once again the excellent relation between Uruguay
and the IMF. Our authorities very much value the candid and fruitful discussions on different
issues, even in those where both sides had different approaches.

[1] A good illustration of the these kinds of considerations is provided by the former Chilean Minister of Finance
Alejandro Foxley (cited by Allan Drazen in Political Economy in Macroeconomics, Princeton University Press,
2000), underscoring that "economists must not only know their economic models, but also understand politics,
interests, conflicts, passions -the essence of collective life. For a brief period of time you could make changes by
decree; but to let them persist, you have to build coalitions and bring people around."
