I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
The sharp fiscal consolidation and current account improvement in 2007 are
welcome, but government debt and the net external liability position are still large. The
combination of high vulnerabilities and the deterioration in global financial conditions over
the past year has led to a large increase in government bond yields. Moreover, financial
system risks—especially credit and liquidity risks—have risen.
2.
Looking forward, economic growth is expected to pick up in 2008–09, but risks
to external stability remain high. Following the sharp fiscal consolidation in 2007, private
consumption is projected to rise gently, while investment should be supported by EU
transfers and the need to expand capacity in manufacturing. The current account deficit is
expected to remain stable in 2008 but then widen in 2009–10, reflecting the real exchange
rate appreciation in recent months and the projected pick up in domestic demand. Indeed,
the real effective exchange rate is assessed to be somewhat above the value implied by
fundamentals. Gross external financing needs in 2008–09 are high, though short-term debt
is roughly covered by net international reserves.
3.
Given the high risks to external stability, the key policy priority is to reduce
vulnerabilities. To put the government debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path and narrow
the current account deficit, further fiscal consolidation is needed. To preserve domestic
stability and confidence in the currency, monetary policy should aim to reduce inflation to
the 3 percent target over two years. Financial sector policies need to focus on improving
banks’ risk management and reviewing safety nets.
4.
Further fiscal consolidation in line with the targets in the latest Convergence
Program is essential. For 2008, the fiscal deficit target seems attainable, and any revenue
overperformance should be saved and devoted to reducing public debt. Achieving the 2009
target will require strict spending restraint and continued strong revenue growth, so there is
no room for tax relief unless it is offset by spending cuts. Given the uncertainties about the
economic outlook, the 2009 budget should include sizable contingency reserves. Introducing
a rules-based fiscal framework would help deliver the required further fiscal consolidation.
To boost potential GDP growth, a smaller size of government (and corresponding overall
tax burden) and a shift in the tax burden would help. Further reforms of the pension, health,
and education sectors are needed to reduce the ratio of government spending to GDP. A
revenue-neutral shift in the tax burden away from labor and to consumption and wealth
would improve work incentives and increase employment.
5.
Monetary policy should aim to reduce CPI inflation to the 3 percent target over
two years. The elimination of the exchange rate band in early 2008 is welcome, as this
removes a potential conflict between monetary policy objectives. In the new floating
exchange rate regime, monetary policy is able to focus exclusively on the inflation target.
Given the rise in inflationary pressures in the first half of 2008, the tightening of monetary
policy has been appropriate. Looking forward, the policy interest rate may need to rise
further, depending on the effects of the recent exchange rate appreciation and the evolution

4
of underlying inflationary pressures. Policymakers should be prepared to react quickly
and—if necessary—forcefully to inflationary shocks.
6.
Further policy action to improve banks’ risk management is crucial. Regarding
credit risks, the priorities are to establish a credit registry for households and to strengthen
stress testing, including of households’ foreign currency exposures. If the Hungarian
Supervisory Authority judges that banks are not adequately capitalized, it should not hesitate
to use its supervisory tools to require increases in capital. Turning to liquidity risks, the
priorities are to expedite the review of banks’ liquidity management practices, develop
liquidity management guidelines, and—in the meantime—ensure that banks have effective
contingency arrangements. In addition, the review of financial safety nets should be
accelerated.
7.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.
II. CONTEXT
8.
The fiscal deficit and the current account deficit narrowed in 2007, but
vulnerabilities are still high at a time when global financial conditions remain
unsettled. Macroeconomic and financial policies over the past year have been broadly in
line with Fund advice (Box 1). However, following a decade of large fiscal and current
account deficits, government debt and the net external liability position (relative to GDP) in
Hungary are by far the largest among new EU member states. As a result, the fall in global
risk appetite over the past year has led to a relatively large widening of government bond
spreads. Moreover, financial system risks have risen, especially credit and liquidity risks.

Box 1. Surveillance and Policies
Fiscal Policy: Substantial fiscal consolidation since mid-2006 has been in line with Fund
advice. Indicative expenditure ceilings were introduced with the 2008 budget, as a step toward
implementing a medium-term budget framework. Improvements in tax administration have been
supported by Fund technical assistance.
Monetary Policy: The elimination of the exchange rate band in early 2008 was in line with
Fund advice. The design and implementation of the inflation targeting framework have been
consistent with Fund recommendations.
Financial Sector: In line with the 2005 FSAP Update recommendations, the authorities have
published guidelines on banks’ risk management and consumer protection related to foreign
currency loans. The authorities are also working on the implementation of bottom-up stress
testing.

9.
Against this background, the Article IV discussions focused on the
macroeconomic and financial policies needed to reduce risks to external stability.
Specifically:
•
•
•

How much additional fiscal consolidation is needed to put the government debt-toGDP ratio on a downward path? How could changes to the fiscal framework help?
What tax and spending reforms would promote growth while preserving stability?
How should monetary policy be set so as to lower inflation to the 3 percent target over
two years? How should policymakers respond to weak GDP growth and higher food
and energy prices? What are the main risks to inflation going forward?
In the financial sector, what policies are needed to encourage improvements in banks’
management of credit and liquidity risks? What can be done to ensure the resilience
of financial safety nets?

10. Following the breakup of the governing coalition in March 2008, political
uncertainty has increased. After the government’s defeat in a referendum on fees on

6
medical care and university education, the junior coalition partner (the Free Democrats),
which spearheaded the health care reforms, pulled out of the ruling coalition, leaving the
senior coalition partner (the Socialists) short of a majority in parliament. The next
parliamentary elections are scheduled for mid-2010.
11. Staff welcome Hungary’s participation in the HIPC Initiative. Hungary is one of eight
non-Paris Club creditors that have provided full HIPC debt relief to all of its debtors.
III. OUTLOOK—RISKS TO EXTERNAL STABILITY REMAIN HIGH
12. Real GDP growth slowed from 4 percent in 2006 to 1¼ percent in 2007,
reflecting mainly the impact of fiscal consolidation on domestic demand (Tables 1
and 2). Private consumption fell by 2 percent, reflecting anemic growth of real disposable
income (due to weak real wage growth, lower social transfers, and higher indirect taxes).
Fixed investment increased by just 1 percent, as subdued public investment and propertyrelated investment more than offset robust investment in export-oriented sectors (such as
manufacturing, transport, and communication). Weak domestic demand growth led to some
easing of pressures on resource constraints. The unemployment rate has drifted up and
staff’s estimate of the output gap decreased from 1½ percent of potential output in 2006 to
slightly above zero in 2007.

13. Despite the economic slowdown in 2007, credit growth remained robust,
reflecting investment in export-oriented industries and some consumption-smoothing.
Private sector credit growth (adjusted for changes in the exchange rate) stayed well above
nominal GDP growth. As a result, households’ debt service burden kept rising, though
mortgage debt as a share of GDP is still well below the EU average. With most new
borrowing in foreign currency, both the household and the corporate sectors’ net foreign
currency liabilities increased, raising indirect credit risk to the banking system. With the
growth of nominal house prices remaining below CPI inflation in 2007, real house prices are
lower than they were in 2002.

(Table 3).1 By expanding into faster-growing emerging market countries, Hungarian
exporters managed to increase their share of global imports. In particular, exports of
machinery and equipment (the largest export category) continued to grow strongly. The
combination of solid export growth and an easing of import growth led to an increase in the
trade surplus, which was partly offset by a deterioration in net income, due largely to higher
earnings of export-oriented non-resident companies. In the first quarter of 2008, the current
account deficit remained at 5 percent of GDP.

15. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appears to be somewhat above its
equilibrium value, though large uncertainties surround such assessments. Consistent
1

The central bank and the central statistical office are working to identify the reasons behind the persistently
large errors and omissions in the balance of payments (2½ percent of GDP in 2007). The Hungarian authorities
have consulted with Eurostat and other central banks and central statistical agencies in the EU.

9
with Hungary’s solid but now slowing export performance, the latest multilaterally consistent
estimates suggest that the REER may now be about 10 percent above equilibrium, within the
usual margins of uncertainty. However, some of the current overvaluation may be in line with
monetary tightening to curb inflationary pressures.

•

The CGER macrobalance approach suggests an equilibrium CAD of 5 percent of
GDP (the standard error of the estimate is 2-3½ percent of GDP).3 The gap between
the underlying CAD and the equilibrium CAD is 4½ percent of GDP. After taking
into account medium-term EU capital transfers of 1½ percent of GDP, which are a
stable and predictable source of financing, the gap is 3 percent of GDP, which implies
an exchange rate overvaluation of 5½ percent.

•

The external sustainability approach suggests an NFA-stabilizing CAD of 3½ percent
of GDP.4 Taking into account EU capital transfers, the gap is 4½ percent of GDP,
which implies a real exchange rate overvaluation of 8½ percent.

•

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the actual REER is about
12½ percent more appreciated than the equilibrium REER. The forecast error is
10-15 percent.

2

This may overstate the underlying current account deficit to the extent that some of the recent sharp
appreciation of the REER may prove to be temporary. Also, even a permanent real appreciation may have a
smaller impact on the current account balance than the trade balance, because foreign-owned exporters’ profits
would fall. Conversely, the underlying current account deficit may be understated to the extent that some of the
large errors and omissions could represent current account transactions.

3

The relatively high current account deficit norm reflects the recent history of high current account deficits and
projected fiscal deficits.

4

To reduce net external liabilities to a less vulnerable level, a smaller current account deficit (and hence a more
depreciated REER) would be needed. However, given Hungary’s high degree of trade openness (and implied
high elasticity of the current account balance with respect to the REER), a change to the NFA benchmark itself
has only a small effect on the estimated misalignment. For example, a reduction in the NFA benchmark by
30 percentage points of GDP only changes the estimated misalignment by 1 percentage point.

10
•

The authorities broadly agreed that the REER is probably on the strong side, though
officials at the central bank (MNB) observed that this is appropriate in light of the
need to reduce inflation.

16. Although external financing needs declined in 2007, the composition of financing
remained largely debt-creating. Net non-debt-creating flows were negative, but this was
mostly due to one-off transactions related to the change in ownership of Budapest airport
(which replaced inward FDI with debt financing) and share buybacks by the state-owned oil
company (which reduced portfolio equity inflows). At the same time, outward FDI and
portfolio equity outflows remained strong. In 2008Q1, increased EU capital transfers
lowered external financing needs, and non-debt-creating flows bounced back.

17. The large negative net
international investment position (IIP)
represents an important vulnerability.
The net external liability position stabilized
in 2007 as improvements in the net FDI and
net portfolio positions offset a decline in the
other investment position (mostly bank
lending), but is still about 100 percent of
GDP (Table 4). With gross external debt
amounting to 97 percent of GDP, gross

external financing needs are high, especially in 2008–09 (Appendix III). The authorities
observed that vulnerabilities are mitigated by the fact that the largest share of net external
liabilities is due either to FDI or bank borrowing from parent banks. They added that shortterm debt on a residual maturity basis (18 percent of GDP) is roughly covered by net
international reserves.
18. Following the sharp fiscal consolidation in 2007, economic growth is expected to
pick up in 2008–09 (Table 5). Private consumption is projected to rise gently, as real
disposable income growth increases. High capacity utilization in manufacturing and
increasing EU transfers are expected to underpin an acceleration of investment. Altogether,
staff project that real GDP growth will increase to 2 percent in 2008 and to 2¾ percent
in 2009, slightly below the forecasts of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the MNB. Over
the medium term, staff estimate potential GDP growth at about 3–3½ percent, based in part
on the cross-country empirical analysis reported in the April 2008 Regional Economic
Outlook. To raise potential GDP growth, reductions in the size of government (and the
corresponding overall tax burden) and in the administrative burden on business are needed.
For example, while Hungary ranks roughly in the middle of the new EU member states in
the World Bank’s Doing Business index, it scores relatively poorly in terms of the costs of
starting a new business.

19. The financing need associated with the current account deficit, which is expected
to widen gradually to 6½ percent of GDP by 2013, is also a vulnerability. In 2008, the
trade balance, net income, and current transfers are all projected to remain roughly stable.
Thereafter, the deterioration in the trade balance (due to the real exchange rate appreciation,
the pick up in domestic demand, and the slowdown in partner country demand) is expected
to exceed the improvements net income (due to the higher level of outward FDI) and EU
current transfers. EU capital transfers are also projected to rise over the medium term. As a

12
result, both the net IIP position and external debt (relative to GDP) would remain broadly
stable in 2008–09 but then rise gently over the medium term.
20. Uncertainties surrounding the outlook for 2008–09 are significant. On the upside,
better-than-projected agricultural production could spur stronger GDP growth. On the
downside, a worsening of external financing conditions, precipitated by either global or
domestic developments, would raise borrowing costs and complicate debt rollovers. A large
depreciation of the forint could temporarily improve competitiveness but would hurt
household balance sheets, given large foreign-currency denominated liabilities. Wealth
effects could dampen economic growth and thus worsen credit quality, potentially leading to
banking system stress.
IV. FISCAL POLICY—FURTHER CONSOLIDATION REQUIRED
21. Fiscal adjustment in 2007 was substantial but government debt remains high.
The general government deficit narrowed from 9¼ percent of GDP in 2006 to 5½ percent of
GDP in 2007, reflecting a broadly balanced mix of higher revenue and lower expenditure
(Table 6). The increase in revenue came from tax hikes and improvements in tax
administration (the latter contributing ¼–⅓ percent of GDP). On the expenditure side, most
of the reduction came from a lower wage bill (reflecting a nominal wage freeze and a
10 percent fall in public sector employment), lower capital expenditure (due to unusually
high motorway spending in 2006), improved means-testing of energy and housing subsidies,
and lower health spending (due to reform of pharmaceutical subsidies and limits on
inpatient healthcare). However, even with the sharp decline in the fiscal deficit, government
debt only stabilized at 66 percent of GDP. With substantial amortization due in 2008–09,
the government’s gross financing needs are high (Appendix IV). Given high financing
needs, unsettled global financial markets, a shift in pension funds’ asset allocations, and
increased political uncertainty, there was some turmoil in the government bond market in
early 2008 (Box 2).

Box 2. Government Securities Market Turmoil
In early 2008, bid-ask spreads in the government securities market widened sharply and an auction
was less than fully subscribed. Against the background of the government’s large gross financing
needs, the most important factors behind the turmoil were the deterioration in global financial
market conditions, a more-rapid-than-expected shift in pension funds’ asset allocations toward
equities, and doubts about future fiscal consolidation in light of increased political uncertainty.
Since early 2008, bid-ask spreads have narrowed and auctions have been fully subscribed, though
government bond yields have remained elevated, in part because primary dealers have been
gradually selling their overhang of government bonds.
In response to the turmoil, the Hungarian debt management agency (AKK) announced that it would
issue relatively more short-term bills, and—looking ahead—it plans to remain responsive to market
participants’ preferences across maturities. To improve market liquidity by facilitating foreign
entry, the AKK plans to abolish the requirement that primary dealers have a physical presence in
Hungary. In addition, legislative changes to accounting rules—which would deepen bond market
liquidity by improving the functioning of the repo market—are being studied.

22. The authorities and staff agreed that further fiscal consolidation in 2008–09 is
essential. With the trailing four-quarter fiscal deficit amounting to 4¼ percent of GDP in
2008Q2, the deficit target for 2008 as a whole of 4 percent of GDP seems attainable. Most
of the adjustment is on the spending side (1¾ percentage points of GDP), reflecting the
absence of one-off expenditures recorded in 2007 (the recapitalization of the state-owned
railroad company and the leasing of defense equipment), the decline in the wage bill (due to
a further reduction in public sector employment and a real wage freeze), and lower subsidies
to households (to rail and road passengers, and to gas and heating). Given below-potential
growth, the structural fiscal adjustment is nevertheless appreciable (¾ percentage points of

14
GDP). Against the backdrop of cautious revenue forecasts and continued progress in tax
administration, revenue is likely to be slightly stronger than targeted. The authorities and
staff agreed that any revenue overperformance should be saved and devoted to reducing
government debt.

23. For 2009, the authorities expressed their strong commitment to the fiscal deficit
target of 3.2 percent of GDP in the Convergence Program. They acknowledged that
there is no room for measures that lead to a net increase in the projected fiscal deficit, as
achieving the target will require strict spending restraint (especially on wages and transfers,
in line with the announced spending ceilings) and continued strong revenue growth (in line
with the government’s forecast for real GDP growth of 3½ percent). Based on a more
conservative growth forecast, staff project a fiscal deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP. Staff
consider the implied improvement in the structural fiscal balance of ½ percentage point of
GDP to be appropriately ambitious, especially given below-potential growth.
24. Given the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for 2009, there was agreement
on the importance of having sizable contingency reserves (½ percent of GDP) in the
budget. High government debt makes debt service vulnerable to higher interest rates and
exchange rate depreciation. High inflation puts upward pressure on certain spending items,
such as wages, social transfers, transfers to local governments, and subsidies to state-owned
enterprises. Moreover, the loss-making state-owned railroad company remains a significant
source of fiscal risk. Another concern is the increasing debt of local governments.
25. For 2010, staff supported further fiscal consolidation in line with the
Convergence Program, which implies adjustment of ½ percentage point of GDP. While
already-enacted reforms will yield some fiscal savings (primarily from further
improvements in the targeting of social benefits and a further increase in the retirement age),
measures to fully achieve the target have not yet been outlined. Thus, staff projections
assume only very small reductions in the fiscal deficit in 2010 and beyond. In this scenario,
public debt would fall modestly from 66 percent of GDP in 2007 to 61 percent of GDP in
2013.

15
26. The government has proposed a rules-based fiscal framework to support fiscal
consolidation. The proposed fiscal responsibility law (FRL) would establish fiscal rules (a
ceiling on central government debt in real terms, a floor of zero on the primary balance, and
a pay-as-you-go constraint on discretionary budget items) and strengthen the medium-term
expenditure framework by making the currently indicative ceilings binding. The proposed
parliamentary budget office would provide independent and expert scrutiny of compliance
with the fiscal rules. Proposed amendments to the constitution would provide a role for the
constitutional court in enforcing the fiscal rules and tighten constraints on local government
borrowing. Staff supported the introduction of a rules-based fiscal framework, as this would
help deliver the needed further fiscal consolidation and lower borrowing costs for the
government (Box 3). As prospects for parliamentary approval of the constitutional changes
(which require a two-thirds majority) are uncertain, staff suggested that passage of the FRL
without the constitutional changes would still provide a valuable signal of the government’s
commitment to fiscal discipline.
Box 3. Numerical Fiscal Rules and Government Bond Yields
The Hungarian parliament is currently considering a rules-based fiscal framework, which is
intended to signal commitment to sound public finances. Staff empirical analysis of numerical
fiscal rules—using a quantitative index designed to capture the extent to which they are likely to
promote fiscal discipline—indicates that such a framework could lower the government’s longrun borrowing costs by improving the fiscal balance and possibly by providing assurance
regarding future fiscal policies (“credibility effect”).1 The key results are as follows:
•

In EU-25 countries over the period 1990–2005, the adoption (or tightening) of a fiscal
rule typically led to an increase in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance by about
0.4 percent of GDP, yielding a reduction in government bond yields by about 5 bps on
impact and about 30 bps in the long run.

•

Fiscal rules are not automatically credible. Rather, the credibility effect appears to be
limited to countries with better fiscal track records and stronger institutional
frameworks. When it exists, the credibility effect overshadows the impact of the current
fiscal balance, suggesting that a credible rule is sufficiently informative about both
future and current fiscal policy. In this case, the adoption (or tightening) of a fiscal rule
typically reduced bond yields by about 10–40 bps on impact and up to 65 bps in the
long run.

•

The institutional underpinning of the fiscal rule matters, with higher credibility effects
observed when the fiscal rule is accompanied by an independent body mandated to
monitor the rule’s implementation and contribute to its enforcement.

Investigation,” in Hungary—Selected Issues.

27. The authorities and staff discussed revenue-neutral tax measures that could
enhance economic growth over the medium term. A shift of the tax burden away from
labor and to consumption and wealth would improve work incentives and boost
employment. One possibility would be to combine a cut in labor taxes with increases in the
value-added tax (VAT) rate and excise duties. This could be accompanied by a reduction of
exemptions, which would broaden the tax base. More generally, further simplification of the
tax system and improvement in tax administration would cut compliance costs and limit
opportunities for tax evasion. Staff also suggested the eventual introduction of a property
tax accompanied by cuts in labor taxes, but the authorities noted the strong popular
opposition to a property tax.
28. Over the medium term, further reforms of the pension, health, and education
sectors are necessary to reduce the ratio of government spending to GDP. In the
pension system, the recently-enacted measures go in the right direction and will be
strengthened by steps already legislated to take effect by 2013; looking ahead, the most
important parametric change is a further increase in the effective retirement age. In health
care, the key tasks are to improve the governance of hospitals and increase efficiency by
adopting a sound regulatory framework. In education, enhanced coordination between local
governments, expanded performance-based financing, and greater autonomy of higher
education institutions would increase efficiency. In addition, social transfers could be better
targeted by increasing means testing and tightening eligibility criteria. The authorities
agreed on the importance of restraining the growth of government spending, but pointed to
the need for gradual changes to maintain social cohesion.
V. MONETARY POLICY—HIGHER INTEREST RATES MAY BE NECESSARY
29. The exchange rate band was removed in early 2008, moving Hungary to a
floating exchange rate regime. Monetary policy is now able to focus exclusively on the
inflation target, with exchange rate movements factored into the setting of the policy interest
rate to the extent that they affect the outlook for inflation. In addition, the elimination of the
band has removed the possibility of a one-way bet against the forint in a period of financial
market turmoil, and may help to increase awareness of the risks associated with lending and
borrowing in foreign currency.
30. Monetary policy has been tightened over the past half year in response to an
increase in inflationary pressures. CPI inflation has fallen over the past year, to
6¾ percent in June 2008, though high food and energy price inflation has prevented a more
rapid decline. The weights of food and energy in the CPI basket in Hungary are slightly

31. Looking forward, the authorities and staff agreed that the policy interest rate
may need to rise further, depending on the evolution of inflationary pressures. In
staff’s baseline scenario, which is similar to that of the MNB, the appreciation of the
nominal effective exchange rate in recent months and projected below-potential growth in
2008–09 (which opens a negative output gap) are expected to reduce inflation to the
3 percent target by the first half of 2010. However, risks to the outlook for inflation are
significant (Box 4), and tilted to the upside. On the downside, a sharper-than-projected
slowdown in external demand (for example, stemming from the euro area) would dampen

18

Box 4. Monetary Policy Responses to Global Financial Shocks
The outlook for inflation is surrounded by important risks, two of which are related to the ongoing
turbulence in global financial markets: a possible increase in the risk premium on forint-denominated
assets and a sharper-than-projected slowdown in euro area GDP growth. Using a small, two-economy
macroeconomic model, staff have simulated the effects of these two shocks on Hungarian GDP,
inflation, real exchange rate, and policy interest rate.1 Subject to the usual caveats due to the model’s
parsimony, the results illustrate that substantial policy responses may be needed if these risks are
realized:
•

If the risk premium on forint-denominated assets increases, resulting in a depreciation of the
exchange rate, then the central bank may need to raise interest rates. Simulation results suggest
that a 10 percent exchange rate depreciation could require a higher policy rate over time by as
much as 300 bps, depending on the size of the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation to
inflation. One important uncertainty relates to the impact of exchange rate depreciation on
households’ spending, given their large (and rising) foreign-currency denominated liabilities.

•

Conversely, if external demand falls more sharply than currently envisaged, then the central
bank may need to cut interest rates. Simulation results suggest that a large adverse shock to
euro area aggregate demand that results in euro area GDP growth falling by ½ percentage
point below baseline could imply a cut in the policy rate in Hungary over time by as much as
125 bps.

inflation. On the upside, further increases
in global food and energy prices would
boost inflation, which could affect
inflation expectations and thus wage
pressures. Also, an increase in the risk
premium on forint-denominated assets—
reflecting, for example, a further
tightening of global financial market
conditions or increased political
uncertainty in Hungary—would put
downward pressure on the exchange rate
and thereby tend to boost inflation.

VI. FINANCIAL STABILITY—RISKS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
32. Financial system risks have increased over the past year, reflecting both the
global financial market turbulence and continued rapid credit growth. High-quality
assessments of risks to the financial system are published by the MNB—the Financial
Stability Report—and the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA)—the
Financial Risk Outlook.
•

The banking system is well-capitalized and profitable, though these indicators
deteriorated in 2007 (Table 7). The banking system’s capital adequacy ratio is close
to 11 percent, but has fallen every year since 2004. Return on equity fell to 18 percent,
due in part to lower interest margins, in turn reflecting increased competition. The
nonperforming loan ratio has been stable in part because banks have sold overdue
loans to work-out companies.

•

Credit risks have increased. Rapid credit growth has been driven in part by the easing
of lending standards for households, including longer maturities, higher loan-to-value
ratios for mortgages, and new products with higher risk profiles (such as yen-based
loans). To address households’ large and increasing foreign currency exposures, the
MNB and the HFSA recently announced prudential guidelines on foreign currency
risk management and consumer protection. Also, the HFSA recently published the
criteria it will use to implement Pillar II assessments. Hungarian banks have no direct
exposure to the U.S. subprime market.

•

Liquidity risks have increased too. Robust credit growth has led to a rise in banks’
loan-to-deposit ratios, a decline in liquid asset ratios, and an increase in external
funding to 30 percent of total liabilities. The decline in global risk appetite has
increased banks’ external funding costs and shortened maturities. External funding
from non-parent sources, which amounts to about half of total external funding, is
potentially more volatile than funding from parent banks. Financial strains in mature
markets are driving a slowdown in parent banks’ lending growth, which will likely

20
affect emerging market countries. With global financial conditions still unsettled, the
magnitude and timing of any additional spillover effects on Hungary are uncertain.
33. The authorities are taking additional measures to address these risks. Regarding
credit risks, the MNB conducts top-down stress tests and, with the HFSA, is working on the
implementation of bottom-up stress-testing. A full-list credit registry for corporate
borrowers already exists. Officials and staff agreed that a mandatory, full-list credit registry
for households would not only improve banks’ credit risk management but also enhance
consumer protection by discouraging the build-up of excessive household debt, though
officials pointed to privacy concerns. Turning to liquidity risks, the HFSA is conducting a
review of banks’ liquidity management practices, which will strengthen the HFSA’s
capacity to supervise liquidity management. Staff suggested that the HFSA develop and
publish explicit recommendations on banks’ liquidity management as soon as possible and
that, in the meantime, the HFSA ensure that banks have effective contingency arrangements.
34. The authorities are reviewing and testing financial safety nets. The HFSA has the
necessary supervisory tools to encourage banks to take corrective action, such as the
authority to order a cessation of activities, a replacement of management, or an increase in
capital. Staff suggested that the introduction of a formal system of early remedial action
could be considered. Domestic crisis management arrangements between the MNB, the
HFSA, and the MOF have been established and tested. While the deposit insurance scheme
is already in compliance with the relevant EU directive, the authorities are reviewing the
co-insurance rules and the procedures to ensure rapid payments to depositors. Given
Hungary’s important cross-border linkages, both to parent banks in western Europe and to
subsidiary banks in southeastern Europe, the Hungarian authorities recognize the
importance of effective communication and collaboration with financial authorities in other
countries. Cross-border MOUs are already in place and a crisis simulation exercise is being
planned.

APPENDIX II. HUNGARY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Significant progress has been made in
improving the coverage, periodicity, and other aspects of quality of the economic and
financial statistics. Most data quality issues noted in the data module of the 2001 Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) have been satisfactorily addressed, but some
are pending.5
2.
Hungary subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). Hungary meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars.
A. Real Sector Statistics
3.
To implement Eurostat regulations, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO)
started to use chain-linked volume measures of GDP from the third quarter of 2006 and made
corresponding backward calculations to the year 2001. Quarterly GDP is estimated using the
production and expenditure approach. A first preliminary estimate of GDP volume indices is
released 45 days after the reference period. Detailed estimates are released 70 days after the
end of the reference period. Prior to the introduction of chain-linked estimates, GDP volume
indices based on the production approach were compiled at constant prices of 2000. Since
the third quarter of 2006, the HCSO has also been compiling current price estimations. In
addition, as of September 2006, the HCSO introduced direct output volume measurement for
some government services (education and healthcare). Furthermore, the HCSO refined its
method to indirectly measure financial intermediation services by introducing two separate
reference rates for transactions in local and in foreign currencies. Also, the HCSO started to
include illegal activities into the national accounts.
4.
The consumer price index (CPI) is compiled as an annual chained Laspeyres index
using for weights the expenditure patterns of two years prior to the current period. The
computation of imputed rent for owner-occupied housing is based on the average price
changes of different repair items and does not cover all elements of costs to the user.
B. External Sector Statistics
5.
In 2005, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) launched a project to set up a new data
collection system for balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP)
5

The original 2001 ROSC Data Module and updates are available on the IMF internet web site. The latest
update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (July
2004).

5

statistics, with a view to replace the international transaction reporting system (ITRS) with
direct reporting (DR) of respondents. This change in data collection system became effective
in January 2008. The move from ITRS to DR is in line with the recent trends concerning
BOP data collection systems in other EU Member States. Under the new system, resident
economic entities report directly their transactions and positions vis-à-vis nonresident
entities.
6.
The extent of cooperation between the HCSO and the MNB in the production of
external statistics—the “Rest of the World” in the National Accounts framework on the one
hand, and the BOP and IIP on the other hand—has also been significantly enhanced. In
addition to data sharing already existing—data on trade in goods (since 2003), on FDI (since
2004), on travel and business services (since 2005), and on other services such as
transportation, insurance, financial and government services (since 2006) —cooperation has
been extended to new areas of non-financial accounts (such as compensation of employees
and EU transfers). Nevertheless, the full responsibility for the compilation and publication of
BOP and IIP statistics still rests with the MNB.
7.
Furthermore, the MNB changed the reporting of stock and flow data of specialpurpose entities (SPEs) as of January 1, 2006. According to the international statistical
standards, an offshore firm is resident of the country in which it is registered. The off-shore
status of SPEs ceased to exist on December 31, 2005, and from January 2006, the MNB has
been compiling the BOP including data on SPEs. Nevertheless, the MNB continues to treat
the statistics that exclude the flow and stock data of SPEs as readily interpretable in
economic terms. In defining the range of SPEs, the MNB cooperates with the HCSO.
8.
The HCSO, the MNB and the Ministry of Finance are presently looking into
addressing the high level of errors and omissions in the BOP. Within the General Framework
of Cooperation between the HCSO and the MNB, effective since 2002, a joint task force was
established in the 2007 annual work program to investigate possible flaws in the Foreign
Trade Statistics (FTS) data. Issues under investigation include:
•
•

the possibly wrong attribution in FTS of Hungarian residence to foreign, nonresident
companies importing and exporting goods to/from Hungary with a Hungarian VAT
number; and
possible VAT fraud (so-called “carousel fraud”), which has also led to
underestimation of goods imports in other EU countries (e.g., the UK).

9.
With regard to the “VAT resident issue,” the task force has explored its possible
impact on trade in goods data according to the National Accounts and BOP concept versus
the FTS concept. The final conclusion and decision of the interested parties in February 2008
was to address this issue by revising the trade data back to 2004 in both NA and BOP
statistics in a concerted way in September 2008. In implementing this, the Eurostat's relevant
future recommendations, if any, will be respected.

6

10.
As for the second (VAT fraud) issue, HCSO and MNB first have to agree on a
proposal to redesign the information system of tax and customs authorities to facilitate better
provision of necessary details on explored frauds that can be used to compile the NA and
BOP statistics. This task has been put on the agenda in the HCSO-MNB 2008 work program.
C. Monetary and Financial Statistics
11.
Starting with the release of data for January 2003, the MNB has been compiling and
publishing data based on a new methodology consistent with the European Central Bank’s
framework for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. In addition to the
central bank and credit institutions, monetary statistics now also cover money market funds.
12.
The Hungarian authorities have reported that they have addressed all
recommendations in the area of monetary and financial statistics made in the context of the
2001 data ROSC report. Following Statistics Department (STA) recommendation that
securities on the balance sheets of depository corporations be valued at market prices, the
authorities have pursued improvement. From 2004, depository corporations were encouraged
to use market valuation for securities in their trading portfolio. From 2005, this requirement
was made compulsory for those depository corporations that are listed on the stock exchange.
D. Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
13.
In January 2004, STA conducted a substantive update of the GFS dataset using the
July 2003 Data Quality Assessment Framework. The mission reported that, overall,
significant progress has been made in addressing the shortcomings of budget execution data
and GFS identified in the 2001 ROSC Data Module. These improvements relate mainly to
institutional coverage of general government, consolidation of data and reconciliation of
deficit and financing. However, plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an
economic basis have yet to come to fruition.
14.
The latest data reported for publication in the 2007 GFS Yearbook are for 2006.
These data now cover the operations of the consolidated central government and consolidated
general government sectors, as well as their corresponding subsectors. The data for 2000
onwards have been compiled on an accrual basis and reported in the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 format.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

The government has proposed a package of tax measures, which—if enacted—
would likely increase the fiscal deficit (see text table). While the reduction in the tax
burden—especially the lowering of taxes on labor—would be welcome, the lack of specific
offsets on the expenditure side is inconsistent with staff advice, as it could increase the fiscal
deficit by up to ½ percentage point of GDP. Thus, if the tax package is enacted, it could take
away the fiscal consolidation originally envisaged for 2009 that staff see as necessary to
reduce vulnerabilities. Prospects for enactment are uncertain, however, because the
government does not have a majority in parliament.

Otherwise, economic developments have been largely as anticipated in the staff
report. GDP growth accelerated from 1 percent year-on-year in 2008Q1 to 2 percent year-onyear in 2008Q2, reflecting primarily an increase in private consumption growth. With both
employment and labor force participation falling, the unemployment rate has been broadly
stable. CPI inflation in July was unchanged at 6¾ percent, and private sector wage growth
(excluding bonuses) in June was 9 percent, the same as in April. The central bank left the

2
policy interest rate unchanged in August. Also, the government and the central bank agreed to
keep the inflation target at 3 percent (with a +/- 1 percent tolerance band) for the next three
years (or until ERM2 entry).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Hungary
On September 17, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Hungary. 1
Background
The current account deficit narrowed in 2007, but the net external liability position is still very
large. Reflecting mainly the impact of fiscal consolidation on domestic demand, real GDP
growth slowed to 1¼ percent in 2007 and the current account deficit narrowed to 5 percent of
GDP. Although external financing needs declined, the composition of financing remained largely
debt-creating and net external liabilities amounted to about 100 percent of GDP. Despite the
economic slowdown, private sector credit growth remained robust, raising debt burdens. With
most new borrowing in foreign currency, the private sector’s net foreign currency liabilities
increased.
Fiscal adjustment in 2007 was substantial, but the budget deficit and government debt are still
high. The general government deficit narrowed from 9¼ percent of GDP in 2006 to 5½ percent
of GDP in 2007, reflecting a broadly balanced mix of higher revenue—partly due to improved
tax administration—and lower expenditure. However, even with the sharp decline in the fiscal
deficit, government debt only stabilized at 66 percent of GDP. With substantial amortization due

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
in 2008–09, gross financing needs are high. Indicative expenditure ceilings were introduced with
the 2008 budget.
The exchange rate band was removed in early 2008, moving Hungary to a floating exchange
rate regime. Monetary policy is now able to focus exclusively on the inflation target of 3 percent
over two years. In response to higher inflationary pressures, the policy interest rate was raised
over the past half year. Higher global prices of food and energy have prevented a decline in CPI
inflation, which was 7 percent in May 2008. At the same time, underlying inflationary pressures,
including core inflation and wage growth, have risen.
Financial system risks have increased over the past year, reflecting both the global financial
market turbulence and continued rapid credit growth. The banking system is well-capitalized
and profitable, though these indicators deteriorated in 2007. The authorities are taking
measures to address risks, including further development of stress testing, publication of
guidelines on foreign currency risk exposures, publication of criteria for Pillar II assessments,
review of banks’ liquidity management practices, and testing of financial safety nets. The
authorities also aim to improve liquidity in the government bond market.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Hungary’s substantial fiscal consolidation since mid-2006 and
the associated narrowing of the current account deficit. Monetary policy has been appropriately
tightened, and the elimination of the exchange rate band has removed a potential conflict
between monetary policy objectives. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ publication of
guidelines on banks’ risk management and consumer protection related to foreign currency
loans.
Directors noted that risks to external stability would remain high in the period ahead. In
particular, they raised concerns about the high level of government debt, the large net external
liability position, and financial system risks, especially in light of unsettled global financial market
conditions. Pressures on the current account deficit could intensify from 2009 if economic
growth picks up as expected because of strengthening domestic demand, and if real exchange
rate appreciation continues. Directors noted the assessment that the real effective exchange
rate is somewhat above the value implied by fundamentals, while pointing to the uncertainties
surrounding this assessment and observing that Hungary does not appear to have suffered a
loss of external competitiveness. They believed that the strength of the currency may reflect in
part appropriately tight monetary policy. Directors noted that Hungary’s gross external financing
needs in 2008–09 are high, though short-term debt is roughly covered by net international
reserves.
Directors considered that the key policy priority for the authorities is to continue to reduce
vulnerabilities. This will involve sustained further efforts to put the government debt-to-GDP ratio
firmly on a downward path, preserve domestic stability and confidence in the currency, and
strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. Continued improvements in the business

3
environment will help to preserve Hungary’s external competitiveness and attractiveness for
foreign direct investment.
Directors welcomed the fiscal tightening under way in 2008 and urged further fiscal
consolidation in 2009 in line with the Convergence Program. They observed that expenditure
restraint and buoyant revenue made the fiscal deficit target for 2008 attainable, and supported
the authorities’ intention to use any revenue overperformance for public debt reduction. To
achieve further consolidation in 2009, continued strict spending restraint is needed. Tax cuts
should be avoided unless they are offset by specific spending cuts. Given the uncertainties in
the economic outlook, it would be helpful for the 2009 budget to include sizable contingency
reserves. Directors supported the planned introduction of a rules-based fiscal framework; if
underpinned by credible policies, this would signal the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
discipline and help deliver the needed consolidation. Directors suggested reducing the size of
government, and the corresponding tax burden, through further reform of pension, health, and
education expenditures. They also favored improving work incentives and increasing
employment by shifting the tax burden away from labor and toward consumption and by
broadening the tax base.
Directors recommended that monetary policy aim to reduce inflation to the 3 percent target over
two years. They noted that, in the new floating exchange rate regime, monetary policy is able to
focus exclusively on the inflation target. Given the rise in inflationary pressures in the first half of
2008, Directors considered that the tightening of monetary policy had been appropriate. Looking
forward, they observed that the policy interest rate would need to respond to the effects of
exchange rate developments and the evolution of underlying inflationary pressures. They
underscored that the central bank should be prepared to react quickly and forcefully to
inflationary shocks.
Directors noted that while the banking system remains profitable and well-capitalized, financial
soundness indicators have deteriorated recently. They urged further policy action to improve
banks’ risk management. Regarding credit risks, the priorities are to establish a credit registry
for households and to strengthen stress testing, including of households’ foreign currency
exposures. It will also be important to ensure that banks remain adequately capitalized.
Regarding liquidity risks, the priorities are to expedite the review of banks’ liquidity management
practices, develop liquidity management guidelines, and ensure that banks have effective
contingency arrangements in place. In addition, Directors recommended that the review of
financial safety nets be accelerated. They also called for enhanced collaboration with foreign
supervisory authorities given Hungarian banks’ close links with financial institutions abroad.
