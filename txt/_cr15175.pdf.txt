IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth PSI Review for Uganda
and Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund today completed the fourth review
of Uganda’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy Support
Instrument (PSI)1 and also concluded the 2015 Article IV consultation2 with Uganda.
The PSI for Uganda was approved by the Executive Board on June 28, 2013 (see Press
Release No: 13/239).
Following the Board discussion, Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
made the following statement:
“Economic performance has been positive, underpinned by sound policies and strong
implementation of the program supported by the Policy Support Instrument. In particular, tax
revenue has been higher than expected; inflation has remained low despite global and
regional shocks; and exchange rate flexibility has been preserved. GDP growth is picking up,
the financial sector remains sound, and international reserves and public debt remain at
comfortable levels.
“The economic policy mix is expected to remain focused on attaining growth and inflation
objectives. The authorities are urged to maintain fiscal discipline in the pre-electoral period,
by adhering to a budget that contains large infrastructure investment and higher tax
collections, while keeping domestic financing at a moderate level. The Bank of Uganda is

The IMF’s framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or want, IMF
financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary
and demand driven (see Public Information Notice No. 02/145).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

encouraged to remain firmly focused on the maintenance of price stability. Preserving the
banking system’s soundness and promoting financial deepening and access would contribute
to economic growth.
“Further increasing tax revenue collection; ensuring that the infrastructure investment
program is well sequenced, with project selection based on commercial viability; enhancing
regional integration; and strengthening social protection are important steps to attain
medium-term inclusive growth and poverty reduction.
“The authorities are to be commended for the progress achieved on the structural front. The
Public Financial Management (PFM) Act was adopted, the accounting and payments systems
upgraded, the stock of domestic arrears reduced, and the inflation targeting framework
improved. Enacting regulations to implement the new PFM Act and a charter of fiscal
responsibility, and improving cash management are critical remaining reforms. Amending
the Bank of Uganda Act and enacting financial institutions legislation are key steps to further
enhance central bank independence and strengthen financial resilience. Reforms are also
needed to strengthen the business climate and public institutions in order to promote
diversified, inclusive growth through enhanced competitiveness, foreign investment, and
regional integration.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2015 Article IV Consultation with Uganda.
Uganda’s recent economic performance has been favorable. Real GDP growth is projected at
5¼ percent for FY2014/15 supported by a fiscal stimulus and a recovery in private
consumption. Annual core inflation increased to 4¾ percent in May, from very depressed
levels, mainly fueled by the shilling depreciation pass-through. The current account deficit is
set to widen to about 9 percent of GDP reflecting increasing capital goods imports, but
international reserves remain adequate. A sound banking system resumed lending to finance
trade and construction activities.
Economic policies in FY2014/15 have supported growth and stability objectives. The fiscal
deficit is estimated at 4½ percent of GDP, below previous projections, on account of a sharp
tax revenue increase (the package in force is expected to yield 1 percent of GDP compared to
a target of ½ percent), savings from improvements in the payment and payroll systems, and
delays in the implementation of infrastructure projects. Following the recent large
depreciation—driven by the dollar strengthening, subdued exports, and profit repatriations—
the Bank of Uganda tightened the monetary policy stance to keep inflation low. Risk-based
supervision has kept bank vulnerabilities low.
The outlook is promising. Growth is estimated at 5¾ percent in FY2015/16 and an average
6¼ percent over the medium-term, driven by scaled-up public investment and a rebound in
private demand. Core inflation is projected to remain within the 5 percent medium-term

3

target range. Despite the planned ambitious infrastructure investment package, total debt is
expected to remain at low risk of distress and reserves to remain at comfortable levels. Risks
to the outlook emanate from regional geo-political uncertainties and potential unbudgeted
election-related spending.
Executive Board Assessment3
Directors commended Uganda’s positive economic performance supported by sound policies
amid a challenging external environment. Growth has rebounded, inflation has remained
moderate, policy buffers are adequate, and the banking system remains sound. Directors
stressed the importance of continued strong policies to foster resilience and competitiveness,
maintain macroeconomic stability, and promote diversified, inclusive growth.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ fiscal policy stance focused on enhanced revenue
mobilization and public spending efficiency, to create room for priority social and
infrastructure investment. They welcomed the tax reform package, and endorsed plans to
extend the tax net to the informal sector, strengthen tax compliance and enforcement, and
eliminate discretionary tax exemptions. Directors stressed the need for continued fiscal
discipline in the pre-electoral environment, and recommended strengthened communication
with the markets.
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to scale up infrastructure spending, underpinned by
new public investment management guidelines. They stressed the importance of ensuring the
consistency of infrastructure investment with absorptive and implementation capacity;
transparent selection of projects that are commercially viable; and contracting debt on
favorable terms. Well-designed public-private partnerships should help to curtail contingent
liabilities. Fund technical assistance would be helpful in supporting the authorities’ efforts in
these areas.
Directors welcomed the adoption of the Public Financial Management Act, and advised
prompt enactment of its regulations. They looked forward to the adoption of the Charter of
Fiscal Responsibility, and recommended sustained efforts to reduce domestic arrears.
Directors considered the tight monetary stance appropriate, in view of recent price and
exchange rate developments and rising domestic spending. They welcomed the strengthened
inflation targeting framework, and called for further efforts to improve monetary policy
transmission and coordination. Interventions in the foreign exchange market should continue
to be limited to smoothing excessive volatility. Directors encouraged measures to enhance

the central banks’ independence, including timely passage of amendments to the Bank of
Uganda Act and the central bank’s continued recapitalization.
Directors noted that the financial sector is well capitalized and profitable. To further enhance
financial stability, they advised enactment of the financial institutions legislation, and
strengthening the risk assessment of foreign currency lending and credit concentration.
Directors supported efforts to promote financial inclusion and deepening, including the
strengthening of financial literacy. They welcomed the recent passage of the Anti-Terrorism
Amendment Bill, and encouraged the authorities to address remaining deficiencies in the
AML/CFT framework.
Directors commended the significant progress on structural reforms, and recommended
sustained efforts to strengthen the business climate and public institutions in order to enhance
competitiveness and promote diversified, inclusive growth. Efforts are needed to attract
foreign investment and enhance regional integration, while a stronger social protection
system should contribute to reducing poverty and inequality.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE
POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT

KEY ISSUES
Backed by sound policies, economic performance since the 2013 Article IV
Consultation has been positive. In response to fiscal stimuli and credit recovery, growth
is picking up from the low levels that followed the credit-boom-and-bust-cycle. Careful
central bank policies kept inflation low and the financial sector stable, despite shilling
volatility. Lower export demand and high infrastructure-related imports widened the
current account deficit, but reserves and debt remain at comfortable levels.
Performance under the PSI is on track. All end-December 2014 quantitative
assessment criteria and most indicative targets and structural benchmarks were met. Key
highlights include an exceptionally strong revenue performance and progress in public
financial management. The inflation targeting mechanism triggered consultations with
staff as average core inflation fell below the inner limit of the band. Risks to the program
stem from the upcoming election, regional unrest, and capacity constraints.
The envisaged policy mix should achieve further economic gains in the fiscal year
starting in July. Despite the election, the authorities are committed to keeping fiscal
policy within a budget that favors large infrastructure investment and sustains tax
revenue collections in the context of low inflation. They also intend to closely oversee the
spillovers and feedback loops between the real economy and the financial sector.1
The planned oil production, infrastructure upgrades, and regional integration bring
encouraging medium-term prospects for growth and employment. The strategy will
be supported by foreign direct investment; enhanced domestic revenue mobilization
through additional tax collection and efforts to improve access to bank services; and
increased borrowing at non-concessional but favorable terms.
Staff recommends conclusion of the 2015 Article IV Consultation and supports the
authorities’ request to complete the fourth PSI review. It also supports the
authorities’ decision to modify two end-June 2015 ACs and to increase the continuous
ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional debt.

CONTEXT
1.
A challenging geo-political situation over the last two years has not disrupted
economic and financial stability. Security concerns following unrest in neighboring countries and
terrorist attacks in the region have weighed on Uganda’s spending needs, exports, and remittances.
Declining donor support in reaction to concerns about governance and human rights and reduced
development partners’ aid budgets have spurred domestic borrowing requirements. Moreover, the
proximity of the February 2016 presidential and parliamentary elections has generated uncertainty.
Despite these challenges, the authorities have succeeded in preserving economic and financial
stability, helped by a resilient economy—characterized by low inflation, sustainable debt, and ample
international reserves.
2.
Economic developments and performance under the PSI have been positive. During a
period of moderate growth, inflation has come down significantly from its 33 percent peak in 2011;
and despite a decline in international reserves and a pickup in public debt, both remain at
comfortable levels. Policies have strongly responded to the last Article IV recommendations (Box 1).
Recent program performance has been positive, with all end-December 2014 quantitative
assessment criteria (QAC) met. However, the lower inner limit of the inflation consultation clause
was breached triggering consultations with staff. The indicative target (IT) on tax revenue was met
by a substantial margin. The reduction in the stock of domestic arrears was smaller than targeted
reflecting a decision to backload intra-year repayments, but the annual target is expected to be met.
Contracting of nonconcessional borrowing (NCB) for hydropower plants (HPPs), roads, and
electrification was within the $2.2 billion limit. Most end-March ITs were met.
3.
Structural reforms have progressed steadily. The approval of the Public Financial
Management (PFM) Act in November 2014 was a major milestone, and structural benchmarks on
finalizing preparation on its regulations and the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility (CFR) were observed.
The Treasury Single Account (TSA) set-up has laid the stage for improved cash management
although more time will be needed to eliminate movements of cash and incorporate donor accounts
in the system. The submission to parliament of amendments to the Bank of Uganda (BoU) Act was
postponed.
4.
Over the medium term, the government is committed to boosting sustainable growth
to generate employment. This will require bolstering public and private investment with a more
targeted focus on inclusiveness. To this end, the government has started the implementation of an
ambitious investment package aimed at narrowing the infrastructure gap, enhancing regional
integration, and preparing for oil production. The acceleration of private investment is expected to
entail PPP schemes for strategic projects; and reforms to deepen financial markets, encourage credit
growth, and make bank credit more accessible and affordable. Improvements in governance and the
business environment are set to support this framework.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Box 1. Response to 2013 Article IV Consultation’s Key Recommendations
Preserving macroeconomic stability. Moderate growth, low inflation, and comfortable reserves have
underpinned favorable economic conditions.
Strengthening public financial management. The legal framework for improving budget credibility and
execution, and a TSA to boost cash controls were set up. Payment and payroll systems were upgraded.
Domestic arrears are declining.
Enhancing tax revenue. The authorities eliminated many tax exemptions, and efforts are ongoing to
modernize tax administration. Additional action is needed to raise tax collection.
Refining the inflation targeting framework. With the use of better forecasting techniques, monetary
policy formulation has improved. The government has recapitalized the BoU with marketable securities
reinforcing its instrument independence. Further operational and institutional reforms are being considered.
Improving the business environment to better prepare the economy for oil production. Public sector
operations are more transparent. Clearer tax and licensing rules bring favorable oil production prospects.
Shortcomings in doing business and governance indicators remain.
Strengthening implementation capacity. Capacity constraints still limit execution of public investment
projects, and delays are frequent. Guidelines to improve investment decisions are being prepared.
Deepening the financial sector and making it more inclusive. The system is sound and dominated by
banks. Private sector credit has recovered, but a structurally low deposit base is insufficient to contribute to
development financing.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
In the context of moderate growth and exchange rate depreciation, inflation is
coming up from depressed levels:


According to rebased estimates (Box 2), real GDP growth was 4½ percent in FY2013/14,
driven by services, trade, construction, and manufacturing—below the estimated potential of
about 6 percent.2 More recently, economic activity is picking up, led by public investment
and a recovery in private consumption driven by higher real incomes and stronger credit
growth.



The nominal exchange rate against the US dollar appreciated by 7 percent in the year
through February 2014, and since then depreciated by 20-25 percent. Sharp pressures were
felt in early 2015 reflecting 1) a portfolio rebalancing in response to the dollar appreciation;
2) increased foreign exchange demand from corporations to repatriate their profits; 3) lower
exports to and remittances from South Sudan; 4) some decline in FDI linked to oil

2

Potential growth is estimated on the basis of the rebased series using HP filters and a Kalman filter applied to a
simple semi-structural model. However, given that growth prior to FY2009/10 was not revised when the rebasing
took place, results should be taken with caution.

investment plan deferrals; and 5) election-related market nervousness as memories of the
2011 elections—when rapid credit expansion and expenditure overruns drove inflation out
of control—reverberated. The real effective exchange rate appreciated by about 4 percent in
2014, mainly reflecting the weakening of Uganda’s main trading partners’ currencies, and it
is close to the level implied by the estimated current account norm (Annex I).


Inflation has been contained in the context of declining food crops and oil prices, the 2013
shilling appreciation, and moderate economic activity. Nonetheless, the recent exchange
rate depreciation has started to pass through to core inflation despite the mitigating impact
of declining fuel prices (Box 3). Annual core inflation fell to 2.7 percent in December 2014
and rebounded to 4.8 percent in May 2015.
Box 2. Effects of Rebasing Gross Domestic Product

The rebasing exercise. In November 2014, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics rebased the GDP series from
calendar year 2002 to FY2009/10 to better reflect the dynamism of economic activity and improve the
quality of statistics. The new estimates incorporate more comprehensive survey data; compile production
by industry supply and use tables; and introduce methodological changes to improve accuracy and
coverage (e.g. compilation of intermediate consumption, and inclusion of the informal sector and nonprofit institutions in the national accounts). GDP was revised upwards by 17¼ percent in FY2009/10, the
base year. The services sector and to a lesser extent the agricultural sector increased their share in GDP,
while the share of industry and construction declined.
Implications for economic analysis. Some indicators
experienced significant change, including the debt-to-GDP
ratio, almost 4 percentage points lower, at 29 percent in
FY2013/14; and the tax-to GDP ratio, about 1 percentage
point lower, at 11½ percent. There are also implications for
policy analysis. The impact of the credit boom-and-bust
cycle that started in 2011, for example, looks now more
pronounced, with GDP growing by almost 10 percent in
FY2010/11 (6½ percent estimated earlier) and decelerating
more significantly in the following years. The slower
economic recovery looks now more consistent with the
behavior of banks’ nonperforming loans (NPLs) and tax
collections of the past two years.

Box 3. Impact of the Decline in International Oil Prices
In the short term. Lower oil prices represent a positive supply shock, resulting in foreign exchange savings
and a slight growth stimulus. A one percent reduction in international oil prices is estimated to lead to a
0.2 percent decline in total nominal imports in US dollars, implying that the expected average price for the
current fiscal year would lead to a 10 percent reduction in the total import bill. With pump prices fully
liberalized, lower prices allow consumers to divert income to other purposes. In the absence of fuel subsidies,
the fiscal impact is also positive, as the government saves in the energy bill and collects slightly higher excise
taxes (which are based on quantities and not prices). In the first nine months of the fiscal year, revenue from
petroleum duties increased by around 18 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. The
decline in oil prices is also expected to feed into lower electricity prices.

Short-term benefits of the oil price decline
have been less pronounced in Uganda than
in other countries in the region.1 In the past
nine months, petrol average pump prices
have declined by 10 percent in domestic
currency (21 percent in US dollar terms) on
account of the shilling depreciation; the
taxation modality; the oligopolistic nature
of suppliers; and the lags between
purchases and distribution.

In the medium term. The impact would likely be less benign. Oil investments might be delayed in the
context of lower profitability. Moreover, many interrelated investment decisions are dependent on the oil
price, including granting production licenses; signing commercial and financial arrangements; developing
engineering, procurement and construction plans; and agreeing on transnational infrastructure works.

According to standardized calculations for the whole sub-Saharan region, the pass-through from the oil price decline to pump
prices in Uganda was about 14 percent, compared to a regional average of about 36 percent (IMF Sub-Saharan Africa Regional

International reserves declined reflecting the spike in dollar demand for financial
transactions in the context of depressed exports, but continue to be adequate. The current
account deficit remained large owing to structurally high trade deficits. Imports of capital goods and
petroleum products are increasing, while both coffee and non-coffee exports have stagnated since
mid-2013 reflecting depressed food exports to South Sudan. Temporarily, strong travel receipts
partially offset the impact of the large trade deficit. FDI, loans, and portfolio inflows have financed
the deficit. However, since late 2014 total net financial inflows have slowed down.
7.
Recent indicators show that the banking sector remains sound. Banks are well
capitalized, liquid, and profitable. As of March-2015, the core capital-to-asset ratio averaged
20.8 percent, well above the minimum requirement of 8 percent. At over 29 percent, the statutory
liquidity requirement (minimum 20 percent) was met. Consistent with the rebound in private sector
activity, NPLs declined from the March 2014 peak of 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent of total loans in
March 2015—getting closer to the 5-year historical average of 3.8 percent—boosting average
profitability. Credit and liquidity risks related to loan quality and currency mismatches remained low.
8.
Private sector credit recovered as lending rates declined and credit risks dissipated.
The strong monetary tightening that followed the 2011 credit boom led to a sharp decline in credit
and growth as lending rates picked up with a short lag. Once inflation stabilized, the significant drop
in the central bank rate (CBR) in 2013 led to a similar fall in interbank rates (reflecting the
functioning first stage in the interest rate transmission mechanism), although the decline in lending
rates was more sluggish, revealing a longer lag in monetary transmission than in the tightening
period, leading to a gradual credit recovery. The monetary policy transmission asymmetry is
explained by the banks’ cautious focus on loan recovery and their high operating costs, coupled
with some crowding out effects as government’s domestic borrowing requirements increased at that
time. Now at 16 percent year on year, credit growth—mainly to manufacturing, trade and
construction—is significantly higher than the 10 percent average of the previous two years,
reflecting an improvement in the bank lending monetary transmission channel. However, lending
rates remain relatively high.

Despite significant banking sector growth, financial intermediation is limited and
access to bank services low. The number of commercial banks has increased from 14 to 25 with a
large influx of foreign banks, which currently hold 80 percent of assets. However, the system is small

(total assets equal 27 percent of GDP) and highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding
50 percent of assets. In a cash-based economy that suffers from a low savings rate, the deposit base
(about 18 percent of GDP) is limited, and credit to the private sector stands at just 14 percent of
GDP. Financial access is low with only 28 percent of adults owning a formal bank account.
10.
Over the last year, economic policies had to respond to volatile foreign exchange
flows, declining commodity prices, and the complex geopolitical environment.


On monetary policy, the BoU kept a tight policy stance, holding the CBR constant at
11 percent from June 2014 to April 2015, and then raising it to 12 percent, on account of
global developments and the ongoing and expected exchange rate pass-through. The BoU’s
intervention in the foreign exchange market has been focused on its program of announced
dollar purchases for reserve build-up, but in the last few months it has been intervening on
the sale side to smooth the fast-paced shilling depreciation. This intervention, along with
increased infrastructure-related government imports, drove reserves down from $3.2 billion
in end-December to $2.9 billion in mid-May (about 4 months of imports).



Regarding the financial sector, to shield banks’ balance sheets from the impact of ongoing
shocks and mitigate short-term liquidity risks, the BoU further integrated risk-based analysis
into its supervision work; introduced a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure that banks hold
sufficient high quality liquid assets to cover 100 percent of net cash flows over a 30-day
period (well above international standards); and advanced efforts to improve regulation of
mobile money payments and financial literacy.



On fiscal policy, in FY2014/15 the authorities embarked on an ambitious revenue
enhancing program that yielded tax revenue beyond expectations, and kept expenditures
below the budget level due to delays in external disbursements for HPPs. A supplementary
budget, needed to reallocate resources, did not add expenses to the budget, but together
with the delays in HPPs, tilted it towards current spending.

The rebound in private activity will be
supported by an expected expansion in credit to the private sector of about 10 percent per year in
real terms—gradually boosting the credit-to-GDP ratio to about 17 percent by FY2019/20. This
pace—expected to prevent a reoccurrence of credit boom-and-bust cycles and preserve economic
stability—is consistent with real GDP, consumption, and investment growth estimates, as judged by
observed trends in other low-income countries.3 Low consumer prices—with average core inflation
projected to remain within the PSI consultation inner band at 3½ and 6¼ percent for end
FY2014/15 and FY2015/16—will underpin the encouraging outlook.

12.
Risks to the outlook reflect economic and political vulnerabilities. Uganda has ample
buffers and a flexible policy framework to respond to potential shocks—including low inflation,
healthy international reserves, low levels of debt, a resilient financial system, a flexible exchange rate,
and an improved PFM system. Nonetheless, the economy is vulnerable and risks are tilted to the
downside. In the short run, expenditure overruns could materialize in the pre-electoral environment,
potentially leading to a hike in inflation or to tight domestic credit conditions that could crowd out
the private sector, affect banks’ balance sheets, and hamper growth. Slower growth in key trading
partners and further spillovers from lower global liquidity could trigger capital outflows, squeezing
liquidity and generating currency mismatches for banks and corporations. In the medium term, the
complex commercial and legal aspects surrounding FDI in the oil sector could delay the planned
investments. Other risks stem from postponements or cost overruns in the planned infrastructure
projects. Security issues in the region pose additional challenges (Annexes II and III).

SUPPORTING MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH
13.
The authorities are committed to supporting sustainable growth and socioeconomic
transformation. Key objectives of their medium-term development plan include enhancing
sustainable production and productivity; strengthening public service delivery; improving education
and health; and reducing the infrastructure deficit to strengthen competitiveness. The latter has
been at the center of the authorities’ economic agenda as infrastructure investments of around
$11 billion—including PPPs—are expected over the next ten years (Box 4). Discussions centered on
policies to support the medium-term strategy, including by preserving the hard-won price and
financial sector stability; increasing revenue collection; improving spending efficiency; enhancing
financial intermediation and access to bank services; and ensuring a stable regulatory environment,
in which contracts and medium-term commitments are fully honored and procurement rules are
transparently observed.
14.
Oil production will be an important component of the medium-term economic
horizon. With recoverable crude oil reserves of 1.7 billion barrels out of potential reserves of
6.5 billion, oil production would start in FY2020/21 under a model that entails a crude export
pipeline and a domestic refinery. While the government has identified a lead investor for the
refinery, decisions on the pipeline’s route are still subject to economic and geopolitical
considerations. Significant steps have been taken to speed-up investments in the sector including
(i) granting one of the production licenses; (ii) announcing a bidding process for operations in six
new blocks; (iii) starting to set up the institutions that will govern oil operations; and (iv) proposing
parliament to remove the value-added tax (VAT) on capital equipment used in exploration and
production activities. Despite the oil price decline, companies remain optimistic about the mediumterm prospects. While operations will be largely externally financed, their domestic content is
expected to have positive spillovers on employment and domestic banks’ operations.

Box 4. Developing Infrastructure
Overview. In line with the National Development Plan (NDP II), the government has embarked on an
ambitious infrastructure investment program to revamp the transport network and alleviate bottlenecks
emanating from electricity shortfalls. The program will be gradually implemented during the next 10 years;
financed through NCB, PPPs, and use of government savings (the oil, energy, and infrastructure funds):
and accompanied by capacity building in project preparation, appraisal, monitoring, and execution. Key
projects include:


Electricity projects. A total of $4.6 billion is estimated. Besides the Karuma and Isimba dams and
related substations—already under construction and financed by China’s Export Import Bank with
government’s contributions—other plans include the construction of smaller HPPs and several
transmission lines for rural electrification.



Oil and oil-related infrastructure. The plan includes the construction of the Hoima oil refinery and
a product pipeline to Kampala to be run as a PPP, and the Albertine region airport and roads, with
a total investment of $1.8 billion. The crude oil pipeline is not included in these estimates, as it is
expected to be privately financed.



Transport infrastructure. Projects, worth $4.7 billion, include (i) the Kampala-Jinja highway and
several other roads serving the Greater Kampala area under PPP arrangements; (ii) the upgraded
Entebbe International Airport, financed by China’s Export Import Bank; and (iii) the initial phase of
the standard gauge railway from Kampala to the Kenyan border.

Economic Impact.


A multiplier analysis points to a positive impact on growth during construction—about
1½ percent over the next five years—and an increase in potential output once projects come on
stream.



The projects are expected to have an import component of about 80 percent, thus limiting their
impact on aggregate demand and inflation.



Private sector credit growth will not be compromised because current spending and domestic
borrowing will remain constrained, providing space for credit expansion.



Capital spending is set to pick up by an average 4¼ percent of GDP during the period.



Imports are expected to rise by about 3½ percent of GDP per year, leading to an equal expansion
of the current account deficit over the period.



The impact on reserves is determined by the domestic component of the financing, which
amounts to $515 million over the construction period.



The total impact on external debt will be about 14 percent of GDP.

15.
Progress towards East African Community (EAC) regional integration is gradually
taking place and has the potential to further enhance trade and structural transformation.
Uganda ratified the Monetary Union Protocol, and has been actively participating in work to
establish EAC regional institutions and to create a fiscal surveillance process. The Ugandan
authorities plan to achieve greater integration by continuing progress towards the reduction of nontariff barriers; implementing common-market agreements; integrating payment systems; and
harmonizing policies in the context of the medium-term convergence program. These
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

UGANDA

improvements would allow Uganda to reap its comparative advantages and maximize efficiency of
production, raising prospects for attracting investors.
16.
Financing the medium-term development strategy requires domestic revenue
mobilization and external borrowing.


Domestic revenue mobilization will entail gains in public and private savings.
 On the public sector side, the government plans to use savings in the oil an energy
funds to finance part of the infrastructure program. Bold action is needed, however, to
raise tax revenue as this is the most sustainable and reliable source of development
financing. Welcome steps are being taken by the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) to
improve enforcement and compliance, but a sustained increase in the ratio will require
incorporating the large informal sector into the tax-paying portion of the economy and
ensuring that large taxpayers comply with their obligations—no simple task. Although
many statutory tax exemptions were removed, loopholes remain on the policy front.
Taxpayer-specific exemptions still exist, and the government is under near constant
pressure to provide tax breaks (Box 5). Continued diligence is required to resist these
pressures and create a tax system that is efficient and fair for everyone.
 On the private sector side, deepening the financial sector and improving bank
access are essential for making private sector credit an engine for growth. Sustainable
financial deepening will largely rely on making steady progress on financial inclusion,
which will in turn depend on actions to boost the bank deposit base; enhance the
intermediation role of non-bank financial institutions, including the National Social
Security Fund (NSSF); and develop the money and capital markets. To this end, there is
scope for simplifying procedures to open bank accounts, locating outlets in remote
areas, upgrading trading and settlement systems, improving investors’ literacy, and
leveraging regional opportunities for the local stock exchange. The current massive use
of mobile money is a clear demonstration of the population’s demand to move away
from cash transactions (Annex IV). FDI flows will add to domestic credit within this
financing strategy.



14

External borrowing will complement the financing needs. With insufficient domestic
savings and ample space for borrowing, external financing is a key requirement. The
authorities remain committed to pursuing concessional loans as the preferred means of
financing, when available. For infrastructure projects, however, they have started to secure
NCB, still on favorable terms, within levels that would allow total debt to remain at low risk
of distress. Staff’s debt sustainability analysis, which includes the infrastructure package as a
whole, concludes that the public and publicly guaranteed external debt-to-GDP ratio in net
present value (NPV) terms would peak at about 25 percent in FY2020/21. Even combined
with domestic borrowing plans, total public debt would remain well below the benchmark
associated with heightened vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, the relatively short average maturity
of domestic debt and the high debt service-to-revenue ratio are matters of concern (Debt
Sustainability Analysis).

related to deficiencies in data integrity and
operational weaknesses in tax administration.
Successful concerted efforts. Many statutory VAT and income tax exemptions were eliminated in
FY2014/15, and improvements in coordination between the URA and local governments have paid off. As a
result, the tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase substantially. An additional increase is expected next
year as focus begins to shift from tax policy changes to tax administration improvements. Planned
improvements include URA’s efforts to assess income from rental properties and identify businesses that are
accessing local services but not filing national tax returns. Use of enhanced controls and creation of a single
central processing center for all customs clearances should boost customs revenue.
Changing the tax-paying culture. As part of the EAC convergence criteria, Uganda has targeted a tax-toGDP ratio of 25 percent by 2021. Although some of the increase is expected to come from oil revenues, an
effort far beyond what has been achieved in the last ten years is needed. While URA’s audit and
enforcement efforts—an expensive way to collect taxes—will bear fruit, sustained improvement in tax
collections will only be possible if the citizens of Uganda pay tax voluntarily. For this to happen, they need
to be convinced that their tax payments are being put to good use and that corruption is being eliminated.

17.
Strengthening social protection is another key ingredient for accomplishing the
medium-term development agenda. Although progress on poverty reduction has been significant,
inequality remains high, suggesting that investments in infrastructure and service delivery are not
sufficient for attaining inclusive growth. While there is evidence that fiscal policy has played a key
role in boosting growth and addressing inequality, there is a clear need for enhancing the social
support system (Box 6 and Annex V).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Box 6. Strengthening Social Protection
Poverty and vulnerability. Uganda has made impressive progress on poverty reduction over the past two
decades, with poverty declining from 56 percent in the early 1990s to 19.7 percent in 2013, allowing for
early achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty by 2015. However,
vulnerability remains widespread, rural and urban inequality has increased, and still about 7 million
Ugandans live below the poverty line. While accelerating growth and upgrading infrastructure will
contribute to further reductions of poverty and vulnerability, the most vulnerable segments of the
population are not likely to fully share the benefits. Furthermore, the traditional social protection system
(family support and other community self-help initiatives) has weakened in the last few decades.
Benefits of well-targeted protection. Experience in other countries in the world and the region show that
the establishment of a comprehensive, well-targeted, and well-defined social protection system can
improve productivity through health and education enhancements; function as a shock-absorber to various
forms of economic instability; benefit the wider local economy; and contribute to achieving inclusive
growth, creating employment, and building community assets. Social protection systems do not have to be
costly. Average spending in safety nets in low income countries in Africa is 1.1 percent of GDP, and 2.8 when
considering social protection in a broader sense1. Donors finance almost 75 percent of social safety nets in
low income Africa.
Revamping social protection in Uganda. Social protection in Uganda is entrenched in the Constitution,
Vision 2040 and the NDP II. Interventions have nonetheless been limited and fragmented—with only
0.4 percent of GDP a year devoted to direct income support and 1.2 percent of GDP to total social
protection—and donors played an important role. A new policy framework is being developed to scale up
interventions, covering the areas of direct income support, contributory social assistance, and social care
services.

MAINTAINING FISCAL RESTRAINT WHILE RAISING
PUBLIC INVESTMENT
18.
In the last few years, the fiscal deficit has widened and has been largely domestically
financed. The overall deficit increased by 2 percent of GDP between FY2011/12 and FY2014/15.
While grants declined by ¾ percentage points, tax and non-tax revenue picked up by
1¾ percentage points, and total spending by 3 percentage points (with significantly larger increases
in capital than current outlays). Given the substantial decline in concessionally financed external
loans, the deficit was financed almost exclusively from domestic sources, mainly through issuances
of securities in the market and use of government savings. This illustrates the falling importance of
external support in deficit financing. Only 12 percent of total expenditure and net lending is
expected to be financed by loans and grants this year, compared to 45-50 percent a decade earlier.

19.
Over the medium term, the deficit is set to expand further, with spending tilted more
towards capital outlays, and the bulk of financing coming from external sources. The overall
deficit is projected to increase by an additional 2½ percentage points by FY2017/18 fueled by a
continued expansion in capital spending (3¾ percentage points) and a small increase in current
spending (¼ percentage point), and curtailed by a further improvement in revenues of at least
½ percent of GDP each year. Financing of the deficit is expected to pivot away from domestic
sources towards external borrowing on non-concessional but favorable terms. Staff welcomed the
changing deficit structure and financing, which will result in a higher fiscal multiplier, and will create
space for private sector credit growth.
20.
For FY2014/15, buoyant revenues, savings from the elimination of ghost workers, and
delays in HPP implementation should keep the overall deficit well below the budget limit. The
strong revenue measures, alongside tax administration enhancements, are likely to result in a
1 percent increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio (½ percent in

percent of GDP (6¾ percent in the program) and
issuances of securities in the domestic market should remain within the target.4 While supporting
efforts to keep domestic financing contained, staff expressed concern about investment delays,
which can be costly, and about reallocating spending away from development expenditure. The
authorities indicated that more time was needed to get assurances on the commercial viability of
the projects, and committed to preserving spending in social sectors in the future.
21.
The FY2015/16 budget will increase the overall fiscal deficit to 7 percent of GDP,
largely financed by NCB on favorable terms. The budget was approved on May 30 in line with the
provisions of the PFM Act that call for approval before the fiscal year starts. The deficit expansion is
explained by the boost in public investment, mainly for infrastructure financed by NCB with a grant
element of about 11½ percent, and an increase in interest payments, partially offset by additional
tax revenue gains. The revenue-to-GDP ratio is set to rise by 0.6 percentage points through policy
measures and efficiency gains, including an increase in excise taxes (0.2 percent); an expansion in the
scope of withholding taxes (0.1 percent); the imposition of the VAT on discounted taxable supply of
services at fair market value (0.1 percent); an increase in fees and stamp duties (0.1 percent), and
improved use of compliance data and better collaboration among ministries and the private sector
(0.1 percent).
4

If HPPs and BoU recapitalization outlays are excluded, the deficit at 2¾ percent of GDP will be 1 percent of GDP
lower than last year’s.

Staff urged the authorities to resist current spending pressures and implement
infrastructure investment efficiently. The FY2015/16 budget is consistent with program
objectives, but its successful implementation would require strong efforts to keep current
expenditures within the budgeted amounts and proceed without further delays with the
infrastructure plan. The contingency provision was reduced by 0.2 percent of GDP at the time of
budget approval to facilitate one-off spending on police activities linked to the election and
allowances to parliamentarians, leaving little budget flexibility and requiring prudent execution in
the year ahead. The authorities agreed that the projected deficit expansion will be contingent on the
materialization of the planned infrastructure projects, and committed to refrain from substituting
them by other types of spending in case of delays. On the infrastructure program, staff reiterated
the need to properly sequence projects while ensuring that they are selected on the basis of
commercial viability and with awareness of implementation constraints. The authorities agreed and
are developing new public investment management guidelines and procedures for this purpose.

PROTECTING THE INFLATION OBJECTIVE
23.
The inflation targeting framework has been successful, although a few challenges
need to be addressed to ensure its long-term efficiency. Underpinned by a strong commitment
to the inflation target, clear arrangements for monetary policy formulation, revamped policy
instruments, and continuous learning from past experiences, the framework has been effective in
keeping inflation low. The monetary transmission has worked well in spite of the shallowness of
financial markets. Nonetheless, some challenges remain, including insufficient institutional
arrangements to prevent government’s use of deposits in BoU accounts beyond agreed levels, and
shortcomings in inflation forecasting capabilities and fiscal-monetary policy coordination (Annex VI).
The authorities have committed to taking action to address these shortcomings, including by
agreeing on a floor below which the balances in the Uganda Consolidated Fund—the main
government’s account—would not decline, and upgrading the BoU’s technical capacity. Both will
result in improved decision making.
24.
Recent inflation volatility has complicated monetary policy decisions. Inflation and

stance in the first half of 2014 were constrained by (i) the start of a shilling depreciation trend that
threatened to persist in the context of weakening trade; (ii) an expected increase of food prices; and
(iii) unclear fiscal prospects amid mounting spending promises by politicians.
25.
The depreciation risk materialized, at higher-than-anticipated rates, driving the BoU’s
decision to tighten the stance by 100 basis points in April. Given the high share of imported
goods in the CPI, import prices play a key role in inflation behavior, with an estimated pass-through
factor of 0.4–0.5. In view of this and of the narrowing output gap, the authorities’ decision to tighten
the stance was appropriate. Staff inquired whether some monetary easing last year could have
possibly helped reduce inflation volatility and limit the interest rate hike given the monetary
transmission lags. The authorities indicated their preference not to allow for swings in the policy
stance, as frequent changes could jeopardize signaling and confuse the markets. Going forward, the
BoU intends to continue to adapt monetary policy to evolving conditions to ensure that core
inflation remains within the target range.
26.
The BoU has managed the tradeoffs between interest rates and exchange rate
behavior well, but has faced difficulties in times of market turbulence. Since the adoption of
inflation targeting, the BoU has let the shilling find its market price while preserving international
reserves. Foreign exchange interventions have been limited to smoothing excessive variations that
would generate unfounded nervousness or threaten the inflation objective, and have been sterilized.
In mid-March, however, the BoU intervened strongly on the sale side (gross sales amounted to
$375 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to around $10 million in 2013 and $140 million in
2014). In doing so, the BoU was successful in calming the markets, but to stop speculation, it
intentionally allowed a liquidity shortage for a few days (by incomplete sterilization), temporarily
pushing the 7-day interbank rate above the upper 3 percent band around the CBR, and forcing
banks to borrow needed liquidity (through the Lombard facility) at high rates. Staff recommended
dealing with speculation by building policy credibility rather than by allowing discrepancies between
the CBR and the 7-day interbank rate. Fully sterilizing all market interventions will provide clear
monetary policy signals, while ensuring that price stability remains the BoU’s primary objective.
27.
The authorities’ program of foreign exchange reserve build up will continue albeit
with a different modality. Relatively high FDI and portfolio inflows, partly related to the presence
of foreign-owned businesses in Uganda’s banking, telecommunications and retail sectors, allow for
continued reserve accumulation in preparation for the expected rise in government’s import needs.
Until April, the BoU carried out a program of pre-announced BoU purchases through daily auctions,
which was only interrupted during days when the BoU intervened on the sale side. More recently the
BoU reached agreement with seven banks to buy a fixed daily amount from each of them. Staff
expressed preference for market-based competitive foreign exchange auctions to allow for clarity of
objectives, promote market deepening, and prevent market distortions. The authorities explained
that the new system is well understood by all parties, introduces predictability, and is being used on
a pilot basis to assess its effectiveness.

Several actions to improve monetary policy effectiveness are underway. The BoU has
taken steps to reduce volatility in overnight market rates by allowing all banks (previously only
primary dealers) to access BoU operations. It is also strengthening its inflation forecasting skills,
institutionalizing procedures to improve the decision making process, and studying the possibility of
rearranging the reserve requirement cycle to smooth liquidity conditions. The latter would enhance
operational effectiveness, potentially reducing speculation exacerbated by insufficient BoU shortterm liquidity management facilities.

SECURING A MORE EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THE
FINANCIAL SECTOR TO GROWTH
29.
The banking sector is broadly resilient to key adverse shocks. Stress tests regularly
conducted by the BoU and those carried out with staff—including one to assess resilience to a
combination of shocks—confirm the banking sector’s relative strength. Specifically, the system can
tolerate shocks such as increased NPLs, deposit withdrawals, and a large shilling depreciation,
suggesting that credit, liquidity, and foreign exchange risks are well contained (Box 7). The BoU does
not stress test banks’ resilience to lending rate hikes because of insufficient data availability. Staff
welcomed ongoing efforts to collect granular data on interest bearing assets and liabilities classified
by maturity buckets, which would allow better measurement of the impact of interest rates changes
on banks’ solvency.
30.
Despite bank stability reassurances, there are some sources of vulnerability that call
for caution. Staff acknowledged that existing prudential requirements and risk-based supervision
provide assurances of banks’ strength to deal with shocks. Noting that stress test results usually
mask diverse impacts on individual banks, the authorities agreed that further efforts to deter any
negative impact of real sector developments on bank balance sheets—mainly due to potential
interest rate and exchange rate volatility—are needed. Discussions covered the following issues:

22



High dollarization. 37 percent of deposits and 43 percent of loans are denominated in
foreign currency. These shares have increased, possibly reflecting depositors’ inclination to
protect the real value of their funds and borrowers’ preference for lower financing costs.
Regulations in place—banks’ required net open position in foreign currency is 25 percent of
capital; foreign exchange loans are mainly granted to hedged borrowers; and an 80 percent
loan-to-deposit ratio is in place for operations in foreign currency—mitigate risks associated
with foreign currency operations. Staff acknowledged that liquidity risks from banks’ balance
sheet mismatches seem to be contained, but called for guarding against credit risks
associated with possible currency mismatches in borrowers’ balance sheets. To complement
current assessments on the effects of shilling depreciation on banks’ net open positions and
transaction costs, it would be advisable to revamp on-site inspections to examine more
closely the quality of foreign currency loans.



Concentration and related-party risks. Given that the largest borrowers operate with all
systemic banks, their default would seriously harm the system’s capital. There is a need to
strengthen data verification and monitoring, and ensure strict compliance with the
regulations to avoid the risks posed by credit concentration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA



Provisioning of bad loans. Provisions as a share of NPLs stand at 55 percent, and the general
provisioning ratio for watch loans—those that have been past due for 30 to 89 days—at
1 percent. While the loan write-off and collateral policies are strict, staff encouraged the
authorities to consider an increase in the general provisioning ratio for watch loans as
recommended in the 2011 FSAP update.



Cross–border transactions. The dominant presence of subsidiaries of foreign banks in the
system involves transactions with nonresidents. While risks of cross-border flow reversals do
not seem too high—a sudden withdrawal of nonresident funds would only affect 1.5 percent
of bank liabilities—more detailed monitoring of offshore investor activities is warranted.



Consolidated supervision. Cooperation with foreign regulators through supervisory colleges
with regional presence is gradually enhancing the quality of consolidated supervision.
Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to exchange information, address financial group
issues more systematically, and prevent regulatory arbitrage.

31.
While financially sound, the banking system’s role in credit intermediation is weak,
hampered by high operational costs, insufficient competition, and low policy credibility. The

thus jeopardizing credit growth. Although there is some evidence that the lending channel is
functioning well, improved bank efficiency and competition would result in better monetary policy
transmission.
32.
The BoU has made progress in implementing the FSAP update recommendations, but
many are waiting for the approval of supporting legislation (Text Table 4). Reforms contained
in the Financial Institutions Act (FIA), currently before parliament, (i) require banks to maintain a
capital buffer in addition to the minimum capital requirements; (ii) allow for agent banking (licenses
to carry out financial institutions business through an agent); and (iii) permit operations of Islamic
banking (license to operate financial businesses under Islamic procedures).
5

An exercise to decompose spreads confirms that high operating costs and profits are the main drivers of high
spreads in Uganda (Mugume, A. Apaa, J. and Ojwiya, C. “Interest Spreads in Uganda: Bank Specific Characteristics or
Policy Changes?” Bank of Uganda Staff Papers, vol 3. No.2, 2009).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 7. Uganda: Banking Sector Stress Tests
Based on the Cihak model, the BoU regularly conducts stress tests (STs) to measure credit and liquidity risks
on the banking sector and publishes the results annually. In its most recent STs exercise, the BoU assessed
sensitivity to single-factor shocks on the basis of end-2014 bank-by-bank data. In addition, BoU and IMF
staff carried up ad-hoc STs to assess foreign exchange risk and to test the system’s sensitivity to a
combined set of shocks.
On credit risk, the BoU assesses the impact on the core-tier-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of a
deterioration in loan quality by applying:


A uniform shock to total performing loans: a “breaking point” approach is used to find the NPL
ratio that would trigger a large bank to fail CAR compliance. The trigger is then applied to all other
banks.



A uniform shock to sectoral performing loans: the same “breaking point” approach is used to find
the NPL ratio that would trigger a large bank to stop complying with the CAR due to the portfolio
deterioration of business sectors exceeding 25 percent of the total loan portfolio.



A proportional increase in NPLs to large borrowers (concentration risk): to measure the impact on
the CAR of the default of three or the five largest borrowers of each bank.

Results suggest that the first large bank’s CAR would fall below the required level when 19.6 percent of its
loans become nonperforming. A total of seven banks would get undercapitalized, with the system’s CAR
falling from 19.7 percent to 12.6 percent. When the five largest borrowers of each bank default, the system’s
capital would fall to 11.6 percent. In both cases, the CAR would remain above the threshold.
On liquidity risk, BoU’s simulations to measure the impact on the liquidity ratio include:


A bank run with daily deposit withdrawals of 6 percent of total deposits for five consecutive days.



A sudden withdrawal of all deposits of the NSSF, a big player in the market.



A sudden withdrawal of all funds held by offshore clients.

Results suggest that the liquidity ratio would decline from 43 percent to 26, 41, and 37 percent, respectively,
as a result of each of the above shocks. Therefore, the system as a whole would continue to meet the
threshold of 20 percent even though for a few banks, the ratio would fall below the floor.
On foreign exchange (FX) risk, BoU and IMF staff analyzed the impact on the net open foreign exchange
position from:


A depreciation of the shilling against US dollar by up to 50 percent.

Results show that both the net open position in foreign currency and the system’s CAR would remain within
the required thresholds after the shock.
On combined credit, liquidity, and FX risks, BoU and IMF staff measured the impact on solvency and
liquidity of:


The NPL ratio rising to 19.6 percent (consistent with the trigger to assess credit risk) combined with
50 percent depreciation, and 3-day successive withdrawals of 6 percent of deposits.

Results show that banks’ capital is vulnerable to multiple risks. The system’s core CAR would fall to
11.9 percent with seven undercapitalized banks presenting a capital shortfall equivalent to 1.8 percent of
GDP. Further, the system’s liquid asset ratio would fall to 18.2 percent (below the regulatory requirement of
20 percent), and five banks would suffer liquidity shortages.

BUILDING INSTITUTIONS AND IMPROVING THE
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
33.
Progress on PFM reforms has been strong and is set to continue. The reduction of the
stock of domestic arrears to a projected ½ percent of GDP by the end of the current fiscal year—
about a third of the June 2013 level—is welcome. The new PFM Act incorporates good budget
practices; prepares the economy for oil revenue management; and institutionalizes the preparation
of a fiscal risks statement and the CFR (Box 8). Staff urged progress on issuing the PFM Act
regulations and eliminating cash movements within the TSA sub-account structure.
Box 8. Enacting the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility
The authorities are working on the enactment of the CFR, which in line with the PFM Act needs to be
published at the start of each new parliamentary cycle. The CFR has the following main features:
Core fiscal targets. These targets are based on the EAC convergence criteria, and consist of an overall
deficit target of 3 percent of GDP by FY2020/21 and an annual debt ceiling of 50 percent of GDP in NPV
terms. The targets enjoy political support; are clear and simple; are achievable under the current mediumterm framework; and provide ample scope for avoiding pro-cyclicality. Pursuing a gradual and sustainable
convergence path will be important to avoid the need for unrealistic adjustments to meet the targets.
Interim targets. To counterbalance the need for flexibility with the risk of unsustainable deficit and debt
paths, potential interim targets will be introduced, including on the tax-to-GDP ratio and net domestic
financing.
Deviations from fiscal objectives. Although the PFM Act specifies circumstances under which the
government can deviate from fiscal objectives, the CFR will establish strict and transparent procedures for
when these ‘escape clauses’ can be used and how objectives will be reestablished afterwards.
Management of oil revenues. Fiscal objectives should govern outflows from the oil fund and their use.
This would require building capacity in oil revenue forecasting and public investment management.
Fiscal reporting requirements. To strengthen the budget process, the CFR will provide definitions and
data sources for key fiscal objectives and establish robust and transparent forecasting practices including
the provision of a fiscal risk statement.

34.
The completion and approval of several pieces of legislation will be crucial in moving
reforms forward. The submission to parliament of the planned amendments to the BoU Act to
improve central bank governance and independence has been delayed, but the authorities are
confident they will be able to do so immediately after the election. Similarly, the FIA and the
Microfinance Development Institutions (MDI) Act, which allow for important improvements in
supervision of financial institutions and create the legal framework for development of non-banks,
have been before parliament for a long period. Staff encouraged their prompt approval.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35.
Staff called for strengthened communications between the Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) and the BoU and with market players. Aware
that policies have been misunderstood by economic agents and opinion makers, MoFPED
authorities agreed to overhaul their communication strategy to better influence economic
expectations, and prevent market confusion or misperceptions. They also agreed to coordinate
policies more closely with the BoU, so that messages from the fiscal authorities and central bank
policy statements are better aligned. While credibility will be strengthened by continuous sound
policy implementation, better communication would facilitate closer alignment of banks’ and
households’ behavior with the economic incentives.

Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) shortcomings. The Financial
Action Task Force has included Uganda in its list of jurisdictions with serious deficiencies in the
AML/CFT framework and placed the country under its review process. The authorities have designed
an action plan to address deficiencies, but its implementation has been slow, posing risks to
Uganda’s business climate. The Board of Directors of the Financial Intelligence Unit has been
constituted, which will allow its functioning, and procedures to secure approval of the Anti-Terrorism
Act (ATA) are being advanced. Further actions to be taken include (i) compelling financial institutions
to file suspicious transaction reports (a stipulation to this end is included in the FIA); (ii) properly
criminalizing terrorist financing (a provision for this included in the ATA before parliament); and (iii)
enforcing adequate and effective AML/CFT supervisory and oversight program for all financial sector
institutions.
37.
Further upgrades of statistics compilation and dissemination remain a critical
objective. On the real sector, staff discussed planned efforts to improve the quality and coverage of
surveys—including compiling GDP from the expenditure side and on a quarterly basis. In the fiscal
area, staff emphasized the importance of overcoming the coordination difficulties that prevent the
straightforward collection and dissemination of arrears data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Supported by comfortable buffers and a sound policy mix, Uganda’s economic
performance over the last two years has been favorable. Real GDP growth has gradually
rebounded from a low of 3.3 percent in FY2012/13 slowly narrowing the output gap. The BoU has
reigned in inflation while keeping a comfortable international reserve level, preserving financial
sector stability, and encouraging credit recovery. Nonetheless, the external current account deficit
has widened reflecting stubbornly high negative trade positions. Fiscal policy has stimulated growth
with an emphasis on public investment, unprecedented action to boost tax collections, and
maintenance of debt at low risk of distress. Monetary policy formulation and implementation have
noticeably matured with improved forecasting techniques, revamped policy instruments, and more
professional policy signaling.
39.
Program performance has been positive. Key program objectives have been
accomplished, notably by maintaining inflation within the outer bands of the consultation
mechanism; eliminating many tax exemptions and improving tax administration; prudently

managing domestic debt issuances; and reducing domestic arrears. Progress in PFM has been
impressive and is already bearing fruit. The upgrade in payments and payroll systems and the TSA
set-up are generating savings through the elimination of ghost workers and pensioners and better
cash controls. The authorities are to be commended for these achievements.
40.
Maintaining fiscal discipline in the pre-electoral period will be essential. The expected
growth recovery is critically contingent on the maintenance of price stability, which is being
threatened not only by the decline in the shilling and possible increases in food prices, but by
unanchored expectations related to perceived election-related spending. Reassuring the markets
soon—through an overhauled communication strategy—that fiscal policy decisions will be strictly
aligned to the budget is essential to influencing banks’, corporations’, and households’ behavior.
Even more critical, however, is that policy implementation adheres to the budget to build a track
record of fiscal discipline during pre-electoral periods and preserve the economic objectives. The
authorities are therefore urged to keep the overall deficit and domestic financing within the planned
limits, find savings to replenish the upfront appropriation of the contingency provision, and refrain
from reallocating expenses to less productive activities.
41.
Monetary policy needs to remain vigilant of evolving conditions. Against the backdrop
of the dollar appreciation, depressed exports and remittances, and impaired policy credibility, the
BoU was effective in calming the markets and preserving low inflation by tightening policies and
stepping up interventions. Nonetheless, the associated decline in international reserves to deal with
this temporary shock was sizeable. A build up of this critical buffer is ongoing, and should help
address the projected government import needs. Preserving low and stable inflation will require a
monetary policy stance that continues to carefully calibrate trade-offs between interest rates and
exchange rates, and allows the shilling to reflect market conditions. The inflation targeting
framework, which has been successful to date, should support these efforts. The approval of the
amendments to the BoU Act; and additional operational and institutional improvements to upgrade
the inflation forecasting quality, enhance policy coordination with the government and fully insulate
the BoU against fiscal dominance, and further improve the monetary transmission mechanism are
critical actions to improve the inflation targeting framework.
42.
The banking system’s stability needs to be maintained, while increasing its
contribution to growth. The credit-to-GDP ratio needs to increase over the medium term by
improved bank efficiency and higher access of the population to bank services. An expanded
deposit base along with lower operational costs, and enhanced policy credibility will be necessary to
achieve the needed contraction in bank spreads and lending rates, and foster financial deepening.
Bank regulation and supervision have been effective, and would be further enhanced by the prompt
approval of the FIA and MDI Act. To deal with ongoing vulnerabilities while preserving bank
soundness, the BoU is encouraged to further strengthen its risk assessment of foreign currency
lending and credit concentration, and revamp its loan provisioning policy. Interest rates and
exchange rates are subject to volatility in Uganda—as in any small and open economy with large
current account deficits and a focus on targeting inflation—and their impact on banks’ balance
sheets should be continuously assessed.

28

43.
Sustaining recent gains in domestic revenue mobilization and PFM reform and
securing efficient infrastructure spending will be critical priorities. Despite an increase of
1½ percent of GDP in the past two years, the tax-to-GDP ratio remains low by international and
regional standards. Its further improvement critically depends on securing the political will for
removing the remaining discretionary tax exemptions, ensuring taxpayer compliance, and bolstering
government efforts to enforce obligations. PFM reforms need to be complemented by the
enactment of regulations to implement the new law, improvements in cash management, enactment
of a CFR, and continued reductions in the stock of arrears. The infrastructure investment program
needs to be based on good project selection to ensure commercial viability, and efficient
implementation to avoid overheating or cost overruns.
44.
Supported by oil production, infrastructure upgrades, and regional integration,
medium-term growth prospects are encouraging. The weak export performance in the context of
structurally large external current account deficits is a matter of concern, and needs to be addressed
by improvements in productivity and competitiveness. Future oil production, infrastructure
upgrades, and regional integration will support these efforts, particularly if accompanied by stronger
governance, improvements in conditions for doing business, addressing AML/CFT shortcomings,
and a decisive fight against poverty and inequality. Financing of the development strategy
comprises higher domestic revenue mobilization and prudent borrowing. A more targeted focus on
employment creation and inclusiveness, including by strengthening social protection, would raise
policy efficacy.
45.
Staff recommends completing the fourth review under the PSI-supported program.
The attached LoI and MEFP outline policies for the rest of FY2014/15 and propose alignment of
program conditionality with the updated macroeconomic framework. In particular, the authorities
propose reductions in the end-June 2015 ceiling on net domestic financing of the central
government in line with the lower-than-projected deficit, and in the reserve accumulation target to
take account of the impact of shocks, which staff support. The planned start of a few key
infrastructure projects—including the Entebbe Airport rehabilitation, the purchase of road
construction equipments, and other electricity and rural electrification projects—underpins the
request to raise the NCB ceiling from $2.2 to $3.0 billion. Finally, the authorities also request
incorporating a new overall deficit IT in preparation for the transition to the application of the new
debt limits policy expected at the time of the fifth PSI review.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held in accordance with
Decision No. 14747, as amended.

Annex I. Uganda: External Stability Assessment
Current Account Sustainability and Exchange Rate Assessment
Uganda’s high external current account deficits reflect structural factors. Ongoing economic
development requires large investment-related imports, which alongside a narrow export base leads
to structurally negative trade deficits. High deficits also reflect a slower pace of aging in the
population and higher aid flows than the rest of the world. The deficits are mostly financed by
foreign direct investment (FDI), public loans and use of government savings. Increased portfolio
investment flows provide an additional source of foreign exchange.
An estimated current account norm indicates no need for adjustment in the real effective
exchange rate in the near term. The norm is estimated at a deficit of 9.0 percent of GDP for
CY2015, which reflects the above-mentioned Uganda’s fundamentals and the rest of the world’s
fiscal expansion relative to its desirable level (Chart 1).1 The estimated gap implies a slight
overvaluation of 1.1 percent in the real effective exchange rate that is not likely to create difficulties
in the near term because imports related to large infrastructure projects are associated with
identified external financing. The evolution of the real effective exchange rate does not indicate any
misalignment (Chart 2).

Nonetheless, the high current account deficit warrants adjustment over the medium to long
term. The deficit is projected to widen during the period when the expected oil-related and public
investment scale-up takes place, and will continue to be financed by FDI and external loans.
Thereafter, the envisaged oil production would help narrow the deficit by 2½ percent of GDP on
average, although there is uncertainty stemming from oil price fluctuations. The weak performance
of exports is a matter of concern that needs to be addressed over the medium term through
structural transformation to increase economic productivity and competitiveness, and improve the
quality of domestic production to partly substitute imports. The new hydropower plants will
generate a welcome electricity surplus that can be exported to neighboring countries.

These calculations are based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) methodology (IMF Working Paper, WP/13/272), and
assume an elasticity of 0.22 of the current account balance to the exchange rate (IMF Working Paper, WP/10/180). The results do
not differ from those obtained by using other methodologies, such as the Macroeconomic Balance Approach and the External
Sustainability Approach.

Adequacy of International Reserves
Despite the recent decline, international reserves keep their comfortable levels. Since
FY2012/13, strong financial inflows had allowed for a significant reserve accumulation, with its level
reaching 5 months of imports at end-FY2013/14. This provided a welcome cushion when the
demand for foreign exchange spiked in late 2014. The Bank of Uganda intervened only when the
exchange rate showed excessive volatility, allowing for exchange rate adjustment to fundamentals.
Reserves at end-FY2014/15 are still projected at 4 months of next year’s imports, over 70 percent of
broad money (M2), and 350 percent of debt maturing in the next year.
The adequate level of reserves for Uganda is estimated at 3½ to 4 months of next year’s
imports, considering precautionary and non-precautionary motives for holding reserves. First,
a level of 1.2-2.5 months of next year’s imports will be adequate for precautionary motives to
prevent and mitigate crises, taking into account the high costs of holding reserves in the range of
5.3-10.6 percent. These costs include the external financing cost, sterilization cost, and marginal
product from foregone physical investment.2 The optimal reserve level would be somewhat higher
—up to ½ months of next year’s imports—over the medium term considering the increasing fiscal
deficits in the coming years. Second, non-precautionary motives justify further reserve accumulation,
including dealing with volatile capital flows, preparing for import payment needs for public and
private investment projects, and ensuring intergenerational equity by managing the proceeds from
the country’s non-renewable resources such as prospective oil revenues. Such considerations lead to
an estimate of 0.8 months of next year’s imports of additional reserve holding, implying that a level
about 3½ to 4 months of next year’s imports is adequate overall.

Staff projections indicate that international reserves will remain adequate over the medium
term (Chart 3). Reserves are projected to be higher than required by traditional adequacy measures
and on track to fulfill commitments under the EAC convergence criteria. The traditional import cover
measurement of reserves fluctuates over the medium term as high imports related to large
investment projects fade out. In fact, this measurement may understate reserve adequacy because
increased imports are tied to external financing

Annex III. Uganda: Economic Resilience Analysis1
An analysis of the resilience of the Ugandan economy to a pre-identified set of external and domestic
shocks, based on impulse-response functions, finds that the economy can withstand the impact of the
shocks relatively well.2 A prolonged slowdown in growth in main trading partners would have a strong
impact on growth in Uganda. Importantly, a lax fiscal policy stance could compromise fiscal
sustainability and medium-term growth in Uganda.

A.

External Shocks

Global liquidity shock
Hypothesis: Higher-than-anticipated foreign interest rates would curtail portfolio and possibly
FDI flows to Uganda—a small and open economy—driving a shilling depreciation and fueling
inflation and inflationary expectations. Heightened country risk and inflation pressures would
push interest rates up as the BoU responds with monetary tightening. Increases in domestic
prices and the cost of credit would hurt private investment and consumption, and would impact
banks’, companies’ and households’ balance sheets.
Results: Staff econometric estimates show that high foreign interest rates (as measured by the 6month LIBOR) would raise domestic inflation and reduce GDP growth in Uganda, although the
impact was not found statistically significant at the 5 percent confidence level (Chart 1).

This benign results suggest that the economy would cope relatively well with a global liquidity
shock supported by (i) its strong external buffer with international reserves covering over
70 percent of broad money; and (ii) the relative low foreign holdings of government securities
(about 13 percent of total securities or 13¼ percent of international reserves). However, results

The shocks are consistent with those identified in the Risk Assessment Matrix. The analysis is based on the
estimation of vector auto regressions (VARs) using quarterly data from 1997 to 2014. Separate models were used
to assess the impact of each shock on growth, inflation and the exchange rate. The number of selected lags,
guided by standard statistical inference, is two for all models, except for the oil price shock where the number of
lags is five.

are driven by historical data that do not reflect the increasing importance of FDI and portfolio
flows. Therefore, a potential negative impact of foreign exchange flow volatility on growth and
inflation cannot be ruled out, particularly considering the recent increase in deposit and swap
operations in foreign currency and the large profits of foreign firms operating in Uganda. With a
shallow foreign exchange market and low daily turnover (about $50 million), a sharp unwinding
of households’ or corporates’ foreign exchange positions or unusually large profit repatriation
could have a significant impact on the exchange rate and pose risks to banks, which would see
their open position widen and their credit quality deteriorate.

Protracted slow economic growth in main trading partners
Hypothesis: Slower-than-expected growth in economies trading with Uganda would hurt
exports and widen the trade deficit, hampering economic growth and posing threats to BoP
financing. The impact on inflation would be ambiguous as depreciation forces would push
domestic prices up, but lower exports would weaken aggregate demand mitigating an eventual
exchange rate pass-through.
Results: A one percentage point decline in main trading partners’ growth would result in a
0.7 percentage reduction in Ugandan GDP growth (Chart 2). The impact on inflation is muted.
Regarding BOP financing needs, a severe shock on neighboring countries that would wipe out
their demand for Ugandan exports would result in a significant decline in international reserves if
these exports would not find alternative destinations. Given that about 20 percent of Ugandan
exports are directed to neighboring countries a severe shock would result in a shortage in export
earnings of 4 percent of GDP that would require additional financing, with an impact on
international reserves of about $1.1 billion.

Oil price shock
Hypothesis: A reduction in oil prices would improve the trade balance by reducing imports, and
given that domestic fuel prices are liberalized, the shock would push prices down. The impact on
growth would be ambiguous depending on the interaction of supply-side cost savings and
possible exchange rate appreciation that could hurt exports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

UGANDA

Results: A one percentage point decline of international oil prices would reduce nominal import
growth by 0.2 percentage points since oil imports are inelastic on impact (Chart 3). The effects on
growth and inflation are not statistically significant. Econometric estimates suggest that a
reduction in oil prices is associated with exchange rate depreciation in Uganda, possibly
reflecting a general worsening of BoP flows from oil producing neighboring countries (exports
and remittances). The depreciation may mitigate the effect of oil prices on core inflation. With no
impact on inflation, real incomes are virtually unchanged without pronounced effect on private
consumption and growth.

B.

Domestic Shocks

Food price shock
Hypothesis: Large increases in food prices could raise core inflation through second round
effects. The impact on growth would be ambiguous as higher food prices would reduce
disposable income, negatively affecting households’ consumption, but agricultural production
could benefit. Since Uganda is a net food exporter, exports could increase and the exchange rate
could appreciate.

Lax fiscal policy shock
Hypothesis: The impact on growth of a laxer than anticipated fiscal policy would depend on the
nature of the expansion. Ceteris paribus, higher capital expenditures would have a stronger
impact on growth than higher current expenditures.3 The impact on inflation would depend on
the cyclical position of the economy prior to the fiscal boost and the potential crowding out
effects on private activity due to higher interest rates or appreciated exchange rate (exports).
Results: One dollar increase in real fiscal expenditure would raise real GDP by $0.15 a year, in line
with fiscal multipliers observed, on average, for low-income countries (Chart 5).4 While a lax fiscal
policy could benefit growth in the short run, it could compromise fiscal sustainability given that
the fiscal expansion would be over and above current projections. If a fiscal consolidation is later
required, any short term positive impact on growth would quickly dissipate. The boost to
aggregate demand would not raise core inflation immediately but with a lag of about 5 quarters.

Annex IV. Uganda: Achieving Financial Deepening and Financial
Inclusion1
Uganda has significantly developed its banking sector over the past decade. Nonetheless, the degree of
financial depth and financial access remains low. Further efforts are needed to boost credit expansion
and efficiently allocate domestic savings to activities that support economic growth. It is critical,
however, to ensure that credit expansion occurs at a gradual and sustainable pace to avoid risking
financial stability. To fully harvest the economic benefits of financial deepening, an increase in financial
access is needed through improvements in financial literacy, consumer protection, and well-regulated
financial innovations.

A. Financial Deepening: A Shallow System
The banking sector has achieved significant deepening in the past years, but still remains
relatively shallow.2 Total bank assets have increased from 22 percent of GDP in 2001 to
31 percent in 2014. The increase has

has doubled from 6½ percent in 2001 to

13¼ percent in 2014, with a setback from
its 2011 peak of 18½ percent at a time of

EAC countries, the ratio is still lower than

in the rest of the region.

are still small and immature, and only partly

market, penetration of insurance is only 0.85 percent of GDP—below the average rates in SSA
(3½ percent in 2013). Combined assets of credit companies and both deposit and non-deposit
taking MFIs amount to only 1¼ percent of GDP. Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) and
MFIs still experience sustainability weaknesses, due to low savings mobilization, overdependence
on government, lack of regulation, and fraudulent activities.
The development of capital markets also faces constraints that hamper long-term
financing. The Uganda Securities Exchange (USE), established in 1997, has provided a platform
for transaction of domestic and foreign shares,

listings in the last three years, the turnover ratio is
low and liquidity limited. The size of the government bond primary market has increased, but the
corporate bond market has remained depressed, with only five issuances outstanding in 2014.
Consequently, the overall capital market’s contribution to savings and investment is limited.

B. Financial Inclusion: Low Access to Financial Services
Financial access remains low, although it has improved over the last few years. Only
28 percent of the adult population owns an account at a formal financial institution,3 with access
of those at the bottom 40 percent of income being significantly lower (13 percent). Access to
agricultural credit by the rural communities remains small.
There are also distributional differences in access to credit. Despite a small improvement in
financial inclusion of women over the last three years, the gender gap remains larger than in the
rest of the region. There has been a sustained expansion of access points to the banking system
(with bank branches increasing from only 167 in 2004 to 658 in 2013), but these remain low in
proportion to population; and their distribution is uneven, with bank branches concentrated in
the central region of the country.

Formal finance channels are less widely used than non-formal channels and bank
penetration is low. Recent statistics show that less than 20 percent of the population borrowed
or saved in a financial institution, while about 70 percent had borrowed money from family and
friends. Similarly, bank penetration lags behind SSA countries. Although 85 percent of companies
own a checking or saving account, less than 10 percent has obtained a loan or used bank
services to finance their investments. Furthermore, the proportion of loans that require collateral

Against this background, Uganda has witnessed a dynamic growth in mobile banking. The
use of mobile money accounts is more prevalent than the use of ATMs. About 40 percent of the
population and 76 percent of the adult population (87 percent in EAC and 18 percent in SSA) has
access to mobile money accounts. In the last two years the number of registered users for mobile
transactions has increased by 110 percent to reach 18.8 million, with an expansion of 75 percent
in the value of transactions. Credit companies and microfinance institutions have offered an array
of innovative financial products in this area. Furthermore, the recourse to village savings and
other voluntary groups has provided further access to savings for the rural population.

The establishment of the Credit Reference Bureau in 2008 (CRB) is facilitating access to
finance. The CRB improves information sharing between financial institutions and borrowers,
reducing default rates and protecting borrowers against over-indebtedness, and builds clients’
reputational collateral. Its introduction resulted in a significant improvement in Uganda´s
ranking under the “getting credit” category of the World Bank Doing Business Indicators.

C. Improving Financial Deepening and Financial Inclusion: A Big
Challenge
International experience shows that financial development is positively correlated with
high growth and reduced inequality. Financial development increases economic resilience;
improves resource allocation; facilitates diversification and management of risk; and promotes
information sharing. Financial development also improves the efficiency of fiscal and monetary
policies by strengthening policy transmission and generating growth-financing opportunities.
Moreover, financial development allows for a productive allocation of capital and investment
with positive effects on total factor productivity. Evidence also confirms that income inequality is
lower in countries with deeper and more accessible financial markets, and that financial
development exerts a disproportionately positive impact on the relatively poor (Beck et al, 2007).

To improve the deposit base and other banks funding sources, a wide array of financial
sector administrative actions and institutional improvements are needed. The switch from
the cash-based system that currently prevails for most economic transactions to the use of bank
accounts and credit cards will be slow. However, in the meantime, there are ways of encouraging
the use of bank services. Expanded account ownership could be achieved by simplifying opening
documentation requirements; offering basic low-fee accounts and other attractive products; and
locating outlets in more remote areas on a more cost-effective basis. By upgrading trading and
settlement systems; reducing listing and trading costs; and improving investors’ literacy, the USE
could enhance market attractiveness and support longer-term financing needs through more
developed corporate bond and stock markets. The USE would also need to leverage regional
opportunities through the EAC financial market integration process.
There are ongoing and prospective actions to improve financial inclusion. A project
launched by the BoU in 2012,5 which includes work along key initiatives with the goal of
increasing the percentage of adult population financially included to at least 70 percent by 2017,
should be helpful in this regard. Financial inclusion is expected to benefit from the following
actions:
Introducing financial innovations. This mainly includes optimizing the use of mobile and agent
banking:



Mobile banking is functioning well, supported by existing guidelines that stipulate roles
and responsibilities of all participants and regulate activities carried out under this
mechanism. Given the fast growth of mobile transactions, however, the institutional
capacity to oversee operations needs to be overhauled, an overarching national
payments system law needs to be enacted, and better coordination between the
telecommunications regulator and the BoU is needed.



Agent banking is also expected to contribute significantly to step up financial inclusion,
but parliamentary approval of the supporting legal framework, contained in the Financial
Institutions Act, has been delayed. BoU is however ready with guidelines to start
implementing it as soon as the Act is passed. Agent banking will foster competition and
improve access by allowing commercial banks to offer financial services through an
agency network.

Reforming the pension system. Ongoing reforms in the pension sector are expected to
contribute to financial inclusion by expanding the coverage of the population that contribute to
or are part of a pension scheme—now only an estimated 5 percent of the working age
population, or 29 percent of wage earners. The reform agenda consists in turning the public
service pension scheme into an independently and professionally managed contributory fund.
This would ensure the system’s long-term financial sustainability, while introducing transparency
and discipline.
Improving access of small farmers to bank services. With the majority of the population living
in rural areas and having farming as their main activity, the availability of bank credit to
agriculture, at 11 percent, is low and mainly directed to the larger farmers. Programs to boost
agricultural financing in rural areas can play a role in contributing to enhancing agricultural
productivity.
Improving financial literacy and ensuring financial consumer protection. Actions on this
front are contributing to increase transparency and efficiency of financial operations. Workshops
to enhance financial literacy have been ongoing. Financial institutions are now required to
provide key facts to clients before agreeing on any deposit or loan product, and to disclose
information on the terms and conditions of financial products. These and other similar efforts will
address existing gaps in financial education.
Enhancing the production of financial services data. Actions under this pillar are deemed to
improve data availability related to access, usage, and quality, through coordination of the BoU
with the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, the Uganda Cooperative Savings and Credit Union, the
Insurance Regulatory Authority, and the Association of Microfinance Institutions in Uganda.
Improving and expanding land registration. With only 20 percent of total land titled, the use
of land as collateral remains low. Interventions to improve land use regulation and development
and the recent digitalization of the land registry can allow for more broad-based and efficient
registration of transactions.

Annex V. Uganda: Fiscal Policy, Inequality and Inclusive Growth1
Fiscal policy can play a role in supporting growth and reducing inequality. The synthetic control method
shows marked improvement in long-run growth in Uganda after the fiscal policy reform episode that took
place in the 1990s. A general equilibrium model demonstrates that the impact of fiscal policy on inequality
varies depending on the type of tax adjusted and on how the revenue gains are spent, and that increases in
VAT are the most effective means of raising revenues without large negative consequences for inequality.

A. Background
Uganda has experienced high growth and declining poverty rates. For the last two decades,
Uganda’s growth has been consistently higher than average growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The
poverty headcount declined to below 20 percent of the population in FY2012/13, from close to
40 percent in FY2002/03 (Figure 1). However, the recent GDP rebasing revealed a more moderate
path of growth for the last few years. Poverty remains high, particularly in certain parts of the
country. In northern Uganda, high youth unemployment, gender inequality, lack of access to basic
services, and low economic development explain high levels of poverty.
Despite recent improvements, inequality remains a key concern. Although the Gini coefficient
has declined in recent years (Figure 2), inequality is high mostly in urban areas. The uneven
distribution of public services—particularly in education and infrastructure—limited access to
financing, low agricultural sector productivity, and high regulatory obstacles such as license fees and
permits are some of the factors behind the inequality trends.

can boost employment, investment, and productivity. Even budget neutral reforms aimed at
enhancing the efficiency of the tax system or reallocating expenditure in favor of public investment
have a positive impact on growth.2 Similarly, both the tax regime and expenditure policies have an
impact on disposable incomes and on income distribution. Empirical studies find that greater
reliance on income taxes and higher social spending reduces inequality, and that high inequality is
harmful for growth sustainability (IMF, 2014a; and Ostry et al., 2014).

B. Fiscal Policy and Growth
The authorities undertook important fiscal policy reforms during the 1990s.The first wave of
fiscal reforms aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability by reigning in deficits; reducing inflation;
and encouraging exports (including liberalizing the coffee market); moving towards a floating
exchange rate regime; and largely reducing expenditure following strengthened fiscal institutions
and improved public financial management. The second wave of reforms included tax reform and
targeted expenditure on poverty alleviation. Box 1 describes and summarizes the main reforms
carried out in the 1990s.3
Gains in trade, tax collection and poverty reduction were achieved. Trade increased from
10 percent of GDP in 1982 to around 60 percent of GDP in 2016. The tax-to-GDP ratio increased
from 5 percent in FY1997/98 to 12.5 percent in FY 2012/13. Spending on education, health, water
quality, and agriculture increased from 1.6 percent of GDP in 1998 to 5.3 percent in 2011, before
slowing to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The proportion of Ugandans living below the poverty line
decreased significantly, allowing Uganda to meet the MDG of halving the number of people living in
extreme poverty. However, the number of people living in extreme poverty remains high.
As a result of these reforms, economic growth increased and inflation declined as the
government became less reliant on deficit monetization. Real GDP growth averaged 6.5 percent
from 1991 to 2013, and real GDP per capita growth 3.2 percent over the same period. The overall
budget deficit, excluding grants, peaked in FY1991/92 at 14.7 percent of GDP; however, by
FY1995/96 the deficit was just over 6 percent of GDP and since then it has averaged about 7 percent
of GDP. Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, was nearly 200 percent in 1987 and 1988. Over
the period 1964 to 1986, it averaged 38 percent per year and since 1989, it has averaged around
16 percent. Since 1999, inflation has averaged 7.1 percent (Figure 3).

2

Improvements in tax efficiency as well as increases in investment spending with offsetting reduction in
unproductive spending could increase long-run growth by ½ percentage points and 0.15-0.2 percentage points,
respectively (IMF, 2015).
3
The analysis utilizes the reform episode in the 1990s so that there are sufficient data post-reform, to provide a
comparison. The selected period corresponds to a period during which substantial reforms took place and purposely
begins four years after conflict has ceased so as not to attribute any post-conflict boost in growth to fiscal policy. For
comparison purposes also , the analysis uses GDP statistics prior to the rebasing that took place in late 2014 and that
went back only to 2002.

Box 1. Major Fiscal Reforms in the 90s
On trade, export duties, mainly on coffee, were phased out in the early 1990s. Import duties, (350 percent
in the early 1990s), were reduced to a maximum of 20 percent by 2000. The unification of the parallel and
official exchange rates put the Ugandan shilling on the path to a floating rate regime, reducing distortions
and encouraging trade. Finally, the monopoly on coffee exports was terminated in 1991.
On public financial management, strengthened public service institutions helped reduce deficits and kept
inflation low. A newly created Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development used cash
management to ensure compliance with planned spending targets. The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA)
was created in 1991, the second of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa, consolidating tax and customs collection
management and operations. It was given the clear objective of increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio by
1 percent per year.
On taxes, (i) a VAT replaced a distortionary sales tax in 1996, set at 17 percent to keep tax revenue neutral
in the short term and ease transition into the new tax regime, and (ii) a new Income Tax Act was introduced
in 1997, clarifying existing laws and expanding the income tax base by repealing non-taxable allowances,
redefining gross income to worldwide concept, and eliminating tax holidays granted under the Investment
Code. Public sector incomes became taxable and the discretionary powers given to the Minister of Finance
to grant exemptions were eliminated.
On expenditure prioritization, the government began targeting high-priority spending areas including
education, health, agriculture, and water quality to focus efforts on the reduction of poverty, as there was a
concern that the increase in economic growth was not benefitting the most vulnerable. This process was
fully incorporated into the Medium-Term Economic Framework (MTEF), which increased the efficiency of
spending and allowed for closer monitoring of its effectiveness.

This result is supported by comparing post-reform growth with an estimated counterfactual
growth series that would have prevailed in the absence of reforms. The analysis is based on a
2015 IMF paper for Uganda. Using the synthetic control method (SCM)—a data-driven technique to
quantify the impact of an event on an outcome variable of interest—a counterfactual, or “synthetic”
country, is constructed as a weighted average of a large number of countries that have similar
characteristics to the country of interest, but are unaffected by the reform. Once the counterfactual
is created, the post-reform growth performance in the country of interest is compared to the growth
performance in the counterfactual and the estimated impact of the fiscal reform is then the
difference between the two series.4 When Uganda’s post-reform growth rates are compared to its
synthetic counterpart, the results show that average real GDP growth during the five-year period
following the reform was about 5.2 percentage points higher than the average growth generated by
the synthetic control group (Figure 5). The relatively superior performance narrowed over the
second five-year period to 2.5 percentage points of GDP.
The exercise was repeated using real GDP per capita growth. Real GDP per capita growth in
Uganda exceeded growth in the synthetic control group by 4.3 percentage points during the first
five-year post-reform period—similar to results found using real GDP growth. However, growth in
Uganda during the second five-year period (2002–06), was actually lower than growth in synthetic
Uganda by 1.8 percentage points.

The limitations of the SCM method suggest interpreting the results with caution. It is difficult to disentangle the
growth impact of reforms from that of various other factors affecting growth.

C. Fiscal Policy and Inequality5
To assess the impact of fiscal policy on inequality, a simple general equilibrium model to
conduct counter-factual analyses of fiscal policy changes is used. The purpose is to estimate the
quantitative impact of tax policy and administration improvements on inequality. The exercise,
consequently, does not intend to quantify the revenue gains/losses obtained as a result of the
introduction of fiscal measures. A small-open economy model is developed where two types of
goods—agriculture and non-agriculture—are produced in the urban and rural sectors, respectively.
5

This section is based on a model developed by Adrian Peralta-Alva (SPR), Marina Mendes Tavares (SPR, Instituto
Tecnológico Autónomo de México), and Irina Telyukova (SPR, University of California, San Diego) as part of a project
to study income inequality in low income countries with financial support by the U.K.’s Department for International
Development (DFID).

Households with different skill levels in each sector choose whether to work for a formal employer
or to work informally by themselves. Key parameters of the model are calibrated to include detailed
tax system information; the size of the informal sector; and relevant distributional household-level
data, including Gini coefficients for rural and urban areas, and share of food consumption
conditional on income levels taken from the 2011/12 Uganda National Panel Survey (Table 2). Using
“compensating variation”—a measure of welfare gain/cost—for each group of households, the
distributional impacts are assessed.

Changes in effective tax rates are used as a measure of fiscal policy action. The effective tax
rate is obtained as a product of tax efficiency coefficients for various taxes—value added tax (VAT),
personal income tax (PIT), and corporate income tax (CIT)—and the statutory tax rates. Tax efficiency
coefficients reflect the impact of tax policy and the effectiveness of tax administration. The
coefficients are calibrated so that model data generate tax-to-GDP ratios that match historical data
for each type of tax for FY2011/12—the year covered by the micro-data. Then, the effective tax rates
are modified to indirectly assess the effect of reductions in tax exemptions and/or improvements in
tax administration, as well as the actual changes in statutory rates.
The calibrated tax efficiency coefficients highlight a large scope for tax revenue gains through
improvements in efficiency. Tax efficiency coefficients in the formal sector are found to be very
low, in particular for PIT (Figure 6). The overall tax efficiency is even lower because tax efficiency
coefficients are assumed to be zero in the informal sector, and the size of the informal sector is
roughly 50 percent of the total economy. This suggests that expanding the tax base to the untaxed
informal sector and also improving tax administration and compliance could significantly raise
Uganda’s low tax collection relatively to its peers.
Increasing the effective VAT rate can raise tax revenue more effectively than increasing PIT
and CIT. Raising the effective VAT rate from 66 to 76 percent could lead to a one percent increase
in the total tax-to-GDP ratio. On the other hand, it would not be possible to obtain the same
amount of revenue from an increase in the CIT effective rate because the tax base is much smaller.
In order to raise one percent of GDP in revenue through changes in CIT, the statutory rate would
need to increase by 3.6 percentage points in addition to 100 percent administrative efficiency. An
increase in the effective PIT rate from 37 to 55 percent would result in an increase in the total tax-toGDP ratio of 0.3 percent. However, any increase beyond this amount would start to reduce tax

revenue because economic activity would be shifted to the informal sector, making it impossible to
achieve a one percent increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.

Note: Statuatory (marginal) tax rates are shown at the top of bar graphs. For PIT, uniform tax
efficiency coefficients are assumed across incomre brackets.

The implications for inequality and the welfare costs vary for each tax reform. The
distributional implications of VAT, CIT, and PIT increases are compared in a situation where a
0.3 percent increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio is achieved. For all tax categories, the welfare cost of the
tax change is disproportionally borne by poorer households (Figure 7). The overall welfare cost is
lowest for changes in CIT and highest for changes in PIT. In terms of the Gini coefficient, changes in
PIT have the largest positive impact—although they disproportionally reduce the welfare of rural
households—while changes in VAT actually increases the coefficient slightly.
On balance, a VAT increase would be more effective than CIT and PIT increases in achieving
revenue gains while limiting welfare costs. The required change in the effective tax rate is much
lower for VAT (3 percent) than CIT (19 percent) and PIT (18 percent). Although the welfare cost is
lower for CIT than VAT by about 0.1 percent of households’ annual consumption, the size of the CIT
required change would make it much harder to implement. The welfare cost from VAT increases is
less than half of the welfare cost from PIT increases. The increase in the Gini coefficient resulting
from VAT increases is positive but almost zero.
Overall, the results highlight the role of the informal sector in the distributional consequences
of fiscal measures. As a large part of the economy is untaxed, changes in tax policy do not
significantly affect income distribution. Moreover, there are offsetting impacts for each type of tax.
VAT is less regressive than expected because relatively rich households consume more goods in the
formal sector—where consumers pay VAT—than relatively poor households. This result is consistent
with empirical studies for developing countries that show that VAT is mildly progressive, partly due

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

to informality (Bird and Gendron, 2007; Keen, 2009). Results show that PIT is less progressive than
expected because relatively poor households shift to the untaxed but unproductive informal sector,
ending up earning low income.6
The results depend on how the increased revenue will be spent. In this exercise, the increased
revenue is assumed to be spent on non-agriculture goods, for simplicity, which may be considered
as an increase in public investment. This assumption is, however, not innocuous. If the government
spends more on non-agriculture goods, the relative price of non-agriculture goods would increase,
which benefits the producers of those goods—i.e., urban households in this model.7 If the increase
in revenues were assumed to be spent on agriculture goods the improvement in inequality would be
greater.

Note: Compensating variation is a measure of welfare costs upon a change in fiscal policy. It is a
required percentage increase in annual consumption that can compensate the utility loss caused
by the policy change, and thus, a higher value means a higher welfare cost. The chart shows a
simple average of calculated values for each type of households.

The results of this analysis differ from the ones obtained in a previous study that shows that the personal tax
system is neutral from a redistributive point of view as the Gini coefficient was practically the same before tax and
once personal taxes were excluded (IMF, 2013).
7

Peralta-Alva (2014) discusses the same mechanism in the context of infrastructure expansions. Infrastructure
expansions may affect inequality by changing the relative price of agriculture and non-agriculture goods.

D. Policy Implications
Closing the infrastructure gap in Uganda could play an important role in stimulating longterm growth. Public investment can have a significant impact on growth through its positive effects
on private investment and productivity, especially given that the initial level of the public capital
stock is low. Unlike labor and capital that can be substituted for each other when they are scarce,
infrastructure is an input into production that is difficult to replace and costly for private sector
participants to supply themselves (Selassie 2008). In countries where significant infrastructure
bottlenecks exist, like Uganda, public investment can lead to higher output in the short and long
term (WEO, Fall 2014). Unfortunately, before ongoing efforts to boost infrastructure investment,
public investment in Uganda has essentially been flat as a share of GDP over the last 20 years, and
significantly below that of its sub-Saharan peers (Fiscal Monitor, Spring 2014).
Taking into account the level of informality in the Ugandan economy is important when
designing fiscal policy measures. In the context of high inequality, the large share of the informal
sector and the tax disincentives of entering the formal sector play central roles in policy design. To
achieve the desired distributional impact, therefore, a comprehensive use of rich micro data within a
model that captures changing incentives of economic agents is important. The analysis in this annex
suggests that increases in VAT revenues—through the removal of tax exemptions and/or
improvements in tax administration—would have limited adverse impact on equality.
The modalities of expenditure of increased tax collections can also have significant
distributional implications. The use of windfall revenue on social transfers and pro-poor spending
can partially offset welfare taxation costs. International experience—including from several countries
in sub-Saharan Africa—shows that well-designed social protection systems can significantly reduce
poverty and inequality, create employment and stimulate local economies by improving access of
children to school, providing better nutrition, building community assets, and boosting trade within
communities.

Annex VI. Uganda: Lessons from the Implementation of
Inflation Targeting1
This annex reviews the lessons learned after nearly four years of implementation of the inflation targeting
framework in Uganda. It concludes that the experience has been successful, as it has allowed for a strengthened
monetary policy transmission mechanism and a more transparent monetary policy. Despite significant
improvements, further strengthening of the framework is needed. The annex addresses five issues, which may also
be relevant for other low income countries that may be considering modernizing their frameworks: (i) what are
the preconditions for the introduction of inflation targeting?; (ii) what sort of safeguards are needed to prevent
fiscal dominance?; (iii) what are the challenges for accurate inflation forecasting?; (iv) how can the central bank
attain its operating target?; and (v) how strong is the monetary policy transmission mechanism?

A.

Introduction

The Bank of Uganda (BOU) introduced inflation targeting (IT) in July 2011 replacing its
previous monetary targeting framework (MTF). The BOU’s motive for this move was the
recognition that the efficacy of the MTF used since the early 1990s was being undermined because
money demand and the money multiplier were becoming unstable and unpredictable as a result of
the development of the financial sector and its increasing integration with the global economy. An
IT framework offered better opportunities for signaling the monetary policy stance through the
announcement of a policy interest rate and greater scope for short-term monetary policy fine
tuning.
The main features of the new IT framework in Uganda, compared to the MTF, are illustrated
in Table 1. The primary policy objective of controlling core inflation and the numerical 5 percent
core inflation medium-term target remained unchanged. The BOU added a secondary objective—
stabilizing real output as close as possible to estimated potential output—modifying a previous
view, no longer valid, that real output was exogenous to demand management policies. A new
operating target—the 7-day interbank interest rate—replaced the MTF’s operating target of reserve
money. There is no explicit need for an intermediate target under IT, although the inflation forecast
can be viewed as such. Because good communication with the public is essential to influencing
inflationary expectations and building monetary policy credibility, the BOU overhauled its
communications policy, with the centerpiece being the monetary policy statement provided by the
Governor after each Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.

Preconditions for Introducing an IT Framework

The BOU paid careful consideration to whether Uganda was ready to implement IT before its
introduction. The prevalent view in the early 2000s was that a long list of institutional, structural,
and technical preconditions had to be met for IT to be feasible, including well-functioning financial
markets and strong technical capacities in the central bank; preconditions which are not likely to be
fully met in LICs. Subsequent research showed that many countries that successfully adopted IT did
so without having first met all of these preconditions (Gemayel et al, 2011). After reviewing the
experience of IT adoption in developing countries, Freedman and Otker-Robe (2009) identified three
essential preconditions (i) the central bank must have inflation as its primary policy target; (ii) it must
have instrument independence, and (iii) there must be no fiscal dominance.
The BOU took the view that it met these relevant preconditions to introduce IT. Controlling
core inflation with a publicly announced target had been the BOU’s priority since the 1990s. The
BOU’s operational independence is enshrined in the Constitution and has never been challenged in
practice. Compliance with the third condition—absence of fiscal dominance—is more complex.
While both public debt levels and government domestic borrowing were relatively low, explicit
institutional arrangements to prevent government borrowing from the BOU were not in place.

C.

Safeguards Against Fiscal Dominance

Under the MTF, fiscal and monetary policies were intertwined, with the distribution of
domestic financing between the BOU and market participants determined passively. The
government did not explicitly issue securities to fund its domestic financing requirement; the BOU
issued them through primary auctions to mop up liquidity to meet its reserve money target. From
the standpoint of an IT central bank, this was problematic for two reasons. First, it was an obstacle to
the transparency of monetary policy, one of the essential ingredients of a successful IT framework.
Second, there were no watertight institutional safeguards against government borrowing from the
BOU, despite the limit on advances for cash management of 18 percent of recurrent revenues on
borrowing established in the BoU Act.
In 2012, the authorities clearly separated the domestic financing of the budget through
issuances of securities in primary auctions from monetary policy operations, now conducted
in the secondary market. While this separation enhanced transparency, there are still no automatic
institutional constraints, such as explicit rules, on the BOU providing financing to the government
through a drawdown of funds from government accounts in the central bank. This is complicated by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

UGANDA

the existence of several government accounts at the central bank, including the Uganda
Consolidated Fund (UCF)—through which most government day-to-day transactions take place—
project accounts, and the oil, energy, and infrastructure funds. Resources in project accounts and the
funds have specific and at times earmarked uses. The net government position—all accounts
considered—is positive, but the UCF has a negative balance. While net financing of the budget from
the BOU has not been a usual practice in the recent past, it nonetheless happened when other
sources of financing faltered, including in FYs 2011/12 and 2012/13, when donor support sharply
declined.
Two key reforms are needed to strengthen institutional safeguards against unplanned use of
government deposits from the BOU. First, an explicit floor below which the balance on the UCF
cannot fall should be put in place. Second, the legal restrictions on government borrowing from the
central bank, stipulated in the BOU Act, should be clarified and tightened up. Both reforms are being
discussed. The first one will be facilitated by the ongoing TSA implementation, although it will
require enhanced fiscal discipline and improved cash management practices. The second one is
included in the amendments being prepared to the BOU Act.

D.

Monetary Policy Formulation: The Importance of Inflation Forecasts

A robust inflation forecast is essential for monetary policy formulation in an IT framework.
The policy interest rate—the Central Bank Rate (CBR)—is set bi-monthly by the BOU’s MPC2 on the
basis of a medium-term core inflation forecast conditional on unchanged monetary policy. The VAR
model initially used by the BOU was suitable for short term but less so for medium-term forecasts
because of the volatility in inflation—on average core inflation showed a variance of 2.6 percentage
points over a 3-month period but this rose to 7.5 percentage points over a 12-month period (table
2). More recently, the VAR model was replaced with a more forward-looking model, the Forecasting
and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which incorporates forecasts of exogenous variables.3 In addition
to the use of the FPAS, the BOU uses expert judgment, private sector forecasts and market
intelligence when making its decisions.

Initially it was set on a monthly basis. The switch at the start of FY2014/15 was motivated by increased stability of
inflation forecasts (Tumusiime-Mutebile, 2014).

A good understanding of the determinants of inflation, and the capacity to project mediumterm changes to the exogenous drivers of inflation are essential for forecasting inflation and
monetary policy formulation. In Uganda, much of the volatility of inflation emanates from the
important role of:
o

The exchange rate. Opolot and Kyeyune (2012) find that, in the long run, the exchange rate,
the terms of trade, and foreign inflation all have an impact on inflation, along with the
money supply and output. The openness of the Ugandan economy—imports of goods and
services account for 31 percent of GDP—explain a high long run pass-through of the
exchange rate to inflation, estimated at about 0.5 (Bwire et al (2013) and Apaa Okello and
Brownbridge (2013)). The exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices in SSA countries is
also on average about 0.4, with the full impact dissipating after four quarters (Razafimahefa,
2012).

o

Agricultural supply shocks.4 Even though the BOU targets core inflation—excluding food
crop prices—agricultural price shocks affect core inflation through their direct impact on the
price of processed food crops, meat and dairy products as well as the indirect effects on the
cost of other goods and services. The very steep rise in inflation in 2011 in Uganda was
driven initially by the rapid rise in food prices.

o

Domestic demand factors. Mayanja and Mawejje (2014) find that there is a causal
relationship between budget deficits and inflation, a finding which is consistent with
research on other developing countries (Catao and Terrones, 2003). Using cross-country
data for Africa, Barnichon and Peiris (2007) find that output gaps create demand pressures
that generate inflation, with a cumulative elasticity of about 0.4 percentage points and that
the real money gap, measured as excess money supply, also impacts inflation with an
elasticity of 0.6 percentage points.

All in all, the determinants of inflation in Uganda and other LICs are multidimensional, entailing both
supply side and demand side shocks. Figure 1 shows the key determinants of inflation in Uganda
from the FPAS model. In the last months of 2014, the lagged impact of the exchange rate
appreciation and lower food prices were behind the reduction in core inflation. Given the
importance of a good understanding of the inflation process for building robust forecasting models
and formulating monetary policy, this is an issue for which more research would be very useful.

Monetary Policy Implementation: Achieving the Operating Target

Policy implementation—aligning a short-term risk-free interest rate with the CBR to set a
benchmark for other interest rates in the economy—takes place through regular interventions
in the money market. The BOU offers repos or reverse repos to commercial banks, depending on
whether it wants to withdraw or inject liquidity, with all bids at the CBR accepted (i.e. the BOU fixes
the price of liquidity and allows the market to determine the quantity).5 Until May 2012, the BOU
had auctioned a fixed quantity of repos or reverse repos. The switch to the current modalities
ensures that the repo/reverse repo rate matches the CBR at every issue, and obviates the need for
the BOU to make precise liquidity forecasts before issuing a repo or reverse repo.
The optimal management of liquidity through money market operations requires the central
bank to have an adequate quantum and range of marketable instruments. Because repos are
short term instruments, they become less effective for liquidity management when it is necessary to
lock up large volumes of liquidity for longer than a few weeks. In such circumstances a longer term
instrument is required. The ongoing recapitalization of the BOU with Treasury bills and bonds has
provided the central bank with a useful policy instrument to mop up structural liquidity, as the BOU
can now sell these securities on the secondary market for this purpose.
Changes in the policy rate are transmitted to other rates in the economy. The transmission
mechanism between the CBR and the 7-day interbank rate works better than the one between the
interbank rate and longer-term interest rates. The first stage in the transmission mechanism —the

74

UGANDA

link between the CBR and the 7-day interbank rate—works well in Uganda. Since April 2012, the
average monthly 7-day interbank rate has been close to the CBR, deviating in absolute terms on
average by only 41 basis points over this 36-month period. The months in which there were larger
deviations were mostly those in which the exchange rate was under strong pressure, and the BOU
bought dollars to smooth excessive volatility without immediately sterilizing the operations.
Regarding the impact of changes in the 7-day interbank rate on longer-term interest rates—the
second stage in the interest rate transmission mechanism—average time deposit rates have been
slightly more volatile, but they have tracked the CBR quite closely.6 The BOU has been less successful
so far in influencing bank lending rates, which are stickier than deposit rates. Sande and Apaa Okello
(2013) find that the bank lending rate responds to a 100 basis point change in the CBR by slightly
less than 50 basis points.

F.

How Strong is the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism?

Empirical evidence indicates that the adoption of IT has strengthened the monetary policy
transmission mechanism in Uganda. Mishra et al (2010) note that the rudimentary nature of financial
systems in LICs imply that the traditional channels of monetary transmission—interest rate, bank
lending, and asset channels—are likely to be impaired. Nonetheless, Davoodi et al (2013) find that
monetary policy shocks affect both prices and output in Uganda. They also find that the policy
interest rate has more impact on prices in Kenya and Uganda than in other EAC countries, because
of their deeper financial markets and more competitive banking systems. Berg et al (2013) compare
the impact of the monetary policy response to the inflationary shock that hit EAC countries in 2011,
and find clear evidence of a working transmission mechanism. They argue that the monetary policy
framework has a significant impact on the strength of the transmission mechanism, and that in
Kenya and Uganda, a coherent monetary policy framework and clear signaling of the monetary
policy stance has strengthened the standard features of the transmission mechanism.
There is also evidence of functioning bank lending and interest rate channels in Uganda.
Abuka et al (2015) find evidence that the bank lending channel works relatively well in Uganda,
although the transmission is moderate compared to that in advanced economies. Banks’ excess
holdings of capital above regulatory requirements dampen the transmission mechanism. Opolot
(2013) finds evidence of an interest rate channel in Uganda: increases in the 91-day Treasury bill
yield lead to decreases in the banks’ loan supply. On the other hand, Mugume (2011) finds that
important channels of the transmission mechanism, notably the interest rate channel, are not fully
functional in Uganda, although his research predates the introduction of IT, and hence may not
capture improvements brought about by the change in the monetary policy framework. Montiel
(2013) argues that the small size of the stock market in Uganda undermines the asset price channel
of the transmission mechanism.

Since April 2012, the average absolute deviation between the average monthly time deposit rate and the CBR was
97 basis points.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The introduction of IT has strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy. The BOU has
been able to clearly signal its monetary policy stance and its inflation forecast for inflation through
the CBR setting and its public announcements. Monetary policy formulation has been significantly
strengthened by the use of inflation forecasting techniques. Recent experience, together with
econometric studies, provides evidence that the interest rate, bank lending, the exchange rate, and
possibly also inflationary expectations play a key role in monetary policy transmission in Uganda.
The transparency of monetary policy has been enhanced by the clear separation of monetary policy
operations from those to finance the budget. Economic commentaries from sophisticated market
participants and analysts suggest that the BOU has gained credibility as an “inflation hawk” since the
introduction of IT. The Ugandan experience over the past four years supports the contention that
even if not all preconditions for successful introduction of IT are present, LICs could benefit from the
use of the regime to efficiently implement monetary policy.
Work under way to address the remaining challenges will further strengthen the IT
framework. On the institutional side, it is important to provide explicit safeguards against
automatic overdrafts of government accounts at the BOU. This can be achieved in the short term by
formalizing an agreement to establish a predetermined floor in the UCF. In the medium-term,
reforms to the legal framework are needed to reduce the existing limits for intra-year advances to
the government borrowing and to eliminate the possibility of automatic overdrafts. The ongoing
central bank recapitalization will continue to provide the BOU with marketable instruments for
longer-term open market operations. On the operational side, there is a need to better understand
the quantitative importance of key inflation drivers that show high volatility, such as exchange rate
and food prices, to achieve more robust medium-term inflation forecasts. This is a matter that
deserves more research. Finally, as the BOU’s monetary policy gains further credibility through time,
and as the financial system deepens, the monetary policy transmission mechanism is expected to
become more effective.

Dear Madame Lagarde:
On behalf of the Government of Uganda, we would like to provide you with an update on the
progress we have achieved under our economic program supported by the IMF’s Policy Support
Instrument (PSI). In FY2014/15 economic growth has been relatively high and expected to pick up
led by our public investment program and a recovery in private sector activity supported by stronger
credit growth. In the context of our inflation targeting framework, we have successfully kept inflation
under control. Despite a slowdown in exports and the recent exchange rate depreciation, we have
maintained our international reserves at adequate levels.
Performance under the PSI-supported program remains positive. In particular, we observed all of
December 2014 quantitative assessment criteria and most indicative targets. Because our inflation
was lower than the inner limit of the consultation clause, we conducted consultations with IMF staff.
Inflation is now picking up, reflecting the depreciation pass-through, and will be contained within
the target bands. The reduction in domestic arrears was lower than targeted in December, but we
have speeded it up since then.
We are pleased to share with you that the indicative target on tax revenue was met with a
substantial margin, helped by the implementation and strict enforcement of the strong revenue
enhancing measures. We remain committed to further implementing tax policy and administration
measures with a view to increasing tax revenue by at least ½percent of GDP per year in the medium
term.
Reducing the infrastructure gap remains at the center of our growth and development strategy. This
will boost growth, generate employment and address inequality in Uganda. We will ensure that our
infrastructure plan is gradually and efficiently implemented, consistent with macroeconomic stability,
debt sustainability and the absorption capacity of the economy.
For FY2015/16 we will make sure to adhere to the budget, and will keep the overall deficit and its
composition of financing fully aligned with PSI understandings.

These and other important details of our economic program are set out in the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU), which extend our commitments to end-March 2016. Consistent with our plan
to add a few infrastructure projects to the agreed package, we request raising the non-concessional
debt ceiling from $2.2 to $3.0 billion. Given that Uganda is a strong performer, the ceiling will be
requested to be dropped at the time of the next review once the new debt limits policy comes in
force. We also propose introducing an overall deficit ceiling in anticipation of the coming in force of
the new policy.
In light of this satisfactory performance and our continued commitment to and ownership of the
program, we request completion of the fourth review under our PSI-supported program. We also
request modification of the June 2015 quantitative assessment criteria and indicative targets in line
with recent developments.
We intend to work with the IMF and other development partners on the implementation of our
program, and will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any further measures, and in advance of
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultation. We will provide the IMF with such information as the Fund requests in connection with
our progress implementing the policies and reaching the objectives of the program. We also
consent to publication of the staff report, the letter of intent, the MEFP and the TMU for the fourth
review under the PSI.
Sincerely yours

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
A.

Introduction

1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies complements the previously agreed
policies under the June and December 2013 and the June and December 2014 Memoranda of
Economic and Financial Policies. It presents an update on the economic performance in FY2013/14
and the first half of FY2014/15, and provides details of the policies Government intends to
implement over the period ahead to preserve price stability and fiscal sustainability and, in general,
to achieve Uganda’s macroeconomic objectives. The memorandum requests extension of
quantitative targets, structural benchmarks, and other reform commitments to end-March 2016.

B.

Recent Economic and Policy Developments

2.
Growth continues to be relatively high. According to rebased estimates released in
November 2014, GDP in FY2009/10 was 17 percent higher than earlier thought. Real GDP growth
was 4½ percent in FY2013/14 driven by construction, tourism, and telecommunications. On the
expenditure side, public investment in infrastructure and human capital (education and health) was a
major contributor of growth. There has also been an upturn in private investment supported by a
rapid recovery in private sector credit. Improved business sentiment is evidenced by higher capital
equipment imports and above-target revenue collections. Improved profitability of the banking
sector was evident in the tax returns posted in December 2014. Economic activity seems to be
picking up and is projected to improve further during the course of the year ending June 2015, led
by higher construction and manufacturing activities.
3.
Inflation remained subdued trending below the 5 percent Bank of Uganda’s (BOU) average
core inflation target. In December 2014, the 12-month average was 3.1 percent. Low inflation was
largely on account of subdued food crop prices due to the good harvests and low import prices.
Inflation seems to have bottomed out and the trend began to reverse in February 2015 due to
increasing prices of food crops as well as the pass through of exchange rate depreciation.
4.
The recent oil price decline lowered the import bill and gradually passed through to
domestic fuel prices. This was partially offset by the global strengthening of the United States dollar,
which led to a weakened shilling and consequently higher domestic prices for many imported
goods.
5.
The current account deficit including grants is projected to remain large at 8.5 percent of
GDP in FY2014/15, owing mostly to subdued exports amidst strong import demand. The stock of
reserves at the end of February 2015 amounted to $2,972.4 million, equivalent to 4.2 months of
future imports of goods and services.
6.
The financial system remained sound and well placed to support economic growth. The
banking system is liquid and well capitalized with all banks meeting the regulatory capital adequacy

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

81

UGANDA

requirements. During the course of the financial year, notable growth was registered in commercial
banks’ balance sheets. Their total assets grew by 9.0 percent between June 2014 and March 2015.
The banks’ asset quality improved, with the ratio of nonperforming loans to total gross loans falling
from 5.8 per cent in June 2014 to 4.2 per cent in March 2015.
7.
On the legal framework of the financial sector, Government remains committed to address
all deficiencies in Uganda’s Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
regime identified through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) review. In this regard, the bill on
the amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act has been submitted to Parliament. Furthermore,
proposed amendments to the Financial Institutions Act 2004 are currently before Cabinet and once
passed will allow for Islamic banking and adoption of some of the Basel III recommendations
including improving liquidity coverage and introducing additional capital buffers.
8.
On the fiscal side, Government embarked on an ambitious revenue enhancing program. The
strong package of tax measures included in the FY2014/15 budget eliminated many VAT and
income tax exemptions and increased excise taxes on fuels, sugar and money transfers. The package
has so far yielded revenue beyond expectations, and the PSI target to increase tax revenue by
0.5 percent of GDP during the fiscal year is likely to be significantly surpassed. On the expenditure
side, Government has maintained its focus on infrastructure investment while improving the
efficiency of recurrent spending, for example through payroll reforms that yielded significant
savings. Government has kept total public debt significantly below standard sustainability
thresholds. Our debt sustainability analysis shows that Uganda remains at low risk of debt distress.
9.
Since January 2015, the BoU has had to respond to volatile foreign exchange rate
movements by intervening in the foreign exchange market and to some extent allowing tight
shilling liquidity conditions. The BoU is committed to avoiding excessive volatility in the exchange
rate without impeding the real exchange rate from reflecting market conditions.
10.
Over the medium term, Government plans to significantly advance the infrastructure
program through projects that are necessary to improve the business environment, enhance
regional integration, and develop Uganda’s oil sector. Project financing is anticipated to rely mainly
on external non-concessional borrowing, but also public-private partnerships, revenue enhancement
and the use of government’s savings.

C.

Performance under the PSI

11.
Performance under the PSI has been on track. Growth is high led by public investment and
consumption; inflation has come down significantly; and international reserves remain at
comfortable levels. All end-December 2014 quantitative assessment criteria (QACs) were met,
although the lower inner limit of the band of the inflation consultation clause was breached, with
average core inflation reaching 3.1 percent at end-December, against an inner band of 3.7 percent.
The indicative target (IT) on tax revenue was met with a large margin. The target on the net change
in the stock of domestic arrears was missed by a small margin; however, we expect the annual target
82

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

to be met, with a large reduction in FY2014/15 largely as a result of sustained efforts by Government
to reduce arrears in line with the debt strategy.
12.
Progress has been made on complying with structural benchmarks (SB).The planned
recapitalization of the Bank of Uganda with marketable securities amounting to Shs.250 billion was
done ahead of schedule (September 2014). The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
Development (MoFPED) published the report on the stock of unpaid bills of all government entities
contained in the central government votes on May 15, 2015 for the quarter ending March 31, 2015.
The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) registered, assessed and collected revenue using the trading
license regime in the municipalities of Arua, Gulu, Jinja, and Mukono meeting the structural
benchmark target. The regime should be in effect in Kampala by the end of the fiscal year while
Entebbe and Wakiso should be added next year. The municipalities of Hoima, Lira, Mbale, Mbarara
and will follow. Amendments to the Bank of Uganda Act were not sent to parliament within the
agreed timeline, but will be submitted by April 2016 (structural benchmark). The second phase of
TSA was partially met, as the TSA was converted into a head and subaccount structure, but progress
is ongoing regarding the elimination of movements of cash by giving votes appropriate level of
spending authority within cash limits consistent with the macro-framework. Furthermore, there were
delays in conducting the pilot exercise to include donor accounts due to extended discussions with
development partners regarding the inclusion of their accounts, though work is in progress
(requested to be rescheduled).
13.
In light of recent low inflation outturns, we held consultations with staff in accordance to the
rules governing the inflation consultation clause. Core inflation fell below the lower inner band of
the consultation clause for the reasons described in paragraph 3. Nonetheless, the forecast points to
an increase in average core inflation to 6.3 percent for FY2015/16, due to the upside risks posed by
the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation as well as the weak prospects for the external
current account. On account of this inflation outlook, in April 2015 the BoU tightened monetary
policy by raising the Central Bank Rate (CBR) to 12 percent from 11 percent, a level it had been at
since June 2014.

D.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks

14.
The short-term outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth is projected at 5.3 percent for
FY2014/15 and 5.8 percent for FY2015/16, driven by scaled-up public investment and a rebound in
private demand. Consumer prices are anticipated to increase gradually reflecting the exchange rate
pass-through and a strengthening of economic activity both at home and abroad. At about
3.5 percent and 6.3 percent for FY2014/15 and FY2015/16, respectively, average core inflation is
projected to remain within the inner bands of the inflation consultation clause.
15.
The current account deficit is projected to widen on account of higher non-oil private sector
imports and public infrastructure related imports; lower personal transfers; and weak exports, on
account of subdued global commodity prices and constrained aggregate demand from key trading
partners. Against this background, international reserves are projected to decline somewhat in
FY2014/15 to 4 months of the next year’s imports of goods and services. The ratio of reserve
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

83

UGANDA

adequacy will improve gradually from FY2015/16 to achieve 4.5 months of import of goods and
services cover by FY2020/21 in line with the requirements of the East African Community Monetary
Union Protocol.
16.
The medium-term outlook assumes that the oil price decline will halt and gradually reverse.
Prospects for the development of Uganda’s oil sector remain positive. A number of companies
whose exploration licenses expired have applied for renewal and new companies have applied for
licenses. Notwithstanding this positive outlook, potential investments in Uganda’s nascent oil and
gas sector could be negatively affected if crude oil prices do not improve.
There are some risks to the outlook related to domestic, regional and global developments.
17.
Domestically, the country heads into an election in February 2016 when the presidential and
parliamentary votes will be cast. Successful elections will boost investor confidence and reduce
speculative damage to the economy. Geopolitical developments and conflicts within the region risk
jeopardizing economic prospects of the countries concerned and spilling over to Uganda given the
high level of regional economic integration. Uganda’s trade and investment may also suffer if the
recovery in advanced countries is less than expected or emerging markets slow down by more than
projected.

E.

Economic Policies

National Development Plan
18.
The second five-year National Development Plan (NDP II) was presented to Parliament in
April 2015 and will come into force in July 2015. The plan prioritizes investment in three key growth
areas out of the nine areas identified in the Vision 2040. These are agriculture; tourism; and minerals,
oil and gas. It has also prioritized two out of the six fundamentals: infrastructure, and human capital
development. In light of the agreed strategic direction for the country’s development agenda, the
three prioritized growth areas and the two fundamentals for NDP II are justified based on the
assessment of the achievements of NDP I and the regional and international development context.
NDP II was the basis for the FY2015/16 budget.

Fiscal Policy
The Fiscal Stance
19.
Higher revenue collection and savings arising from the payroll and cash management
reforms will allow us to keep the FY2014/15 overall deficit within the budget limit and meet some
unexpected spending needs. During the second half of the financial year, we issued a supplementary
budget which was financed through the reallocation of expenditure savings and will not entail any
additions to the projected domestic borrowing.

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

20.
Spending on HPPs was lower than expected due to procedural delays in the disbursement of
funds. Conditions for disbursement relating to the repayment mechanisms will be finalized this
financial year.
21.
For FY2015/16, we are projecting an increase in the overall fiscal deficit to 7 percent of GDP.
The deficit expansion will mainly stem from the boost in public investment in infrastructure, partially
offset by additional tax revenue gains. Development expenditure is budgeted to grow by more than
40 percent in FY2015/16, mainly driven by externally financed projects, while current spending
excluding interest payments is expected to be flat as a share of GDP. PFM reforms in a number of
areas will continue to enhance the efficiency of public expenditures. In addition we will ensure that
the projected deficit expansion is contingent on the materialization of the planned infrastructure
projects.
22.
The deficit will largely be financed by external sources and, to a lesser extent, by issuance of
domestic debt. Compared to previous years, a larger share of the deficit will be financed by external
loans, allowing us to avoid an increase in relatively expensive domestic borrowing and reduce the
fiscal burden of interest payments over the medium term. We will continue to pursue concessional
loans as the preferred means of meeting our external financing requirements. Non-concessional
external borrowing will be considered only for the financing of highly productive fixed capital
investments. In addition, we will make sure to keep the current level of debt distress low while
ensuring there is no crowding out of the private sector caused by excessive domestic government
borrowing.
23.
We will ensure that any needed modifications to the FY2015/16 budget, for technical or
legal considerations, will keep the overall deficit and its composition of financing fully aligned with
PSI understandings.
Boosting Tax Revenue
24.
We plan to continue our efforts to further strengthen tax revenue mobilization. Successful
implementation of the FY2015/16 tax package will yield an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio of about
½ percent. This includes measures that focus on enhancing revenue mobilization and action to
maintain the momentum witnessed during FY2014/15. The major tax policies include raising the
excise duty on non-premium beers at 30 percent and spirits/wines at 80 percent; increasing excise
duty on petroleum products by Shs.50; and introducing excise duty on furniture and confectioneries
at 10 percent, and motor vehicle lubricants at 5 percent. In addition, Government has presented to
Parliament proposed amendments under the Income Tax Act and the VAT Law to generate
additional revenues. These include simplification of the presumptive tax regime and specification of
the amount of tax payable by small businesses; denial of income tax deductions on expenses
accrued from non-registered persons; limitation of carryover of losses in corporate reorganizations,
requirement that all passenger service vehicles and goods motor vehicles pay income tax before
renewal of annual license; compelling all regulators to make the Tax Identification Number a
mandatory requirement for issuance of licenses or permits; and introduction of a 6 percent
withholding tax on income of suppliers of agricultural produce and on the CIF value of all imports

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

85

UGANDA

except where the importers are tax compliant. Government has also made amendments to clarify
VAT application in the oil, gas and mining industry to facilitate investments. Finally adjustments on
fees and charges administered by Government Agencies were made, especially passport fees, visa
fees and vehicle licensing to generate additional non-tax revenue.
25.

We will pursue the following improvements in tax administration:
a) Strengthening and expanding the collaboration between government ministries,
departments, and agencies to encourage registering and sharing of tax related information
to bridge the compliance gap.
b) Creating an interface between customs and domestic taxes datasets to ensure
comprehensive analysis on the activities of multinational firms and other large taxpayers so
as to mitigate revenue eroding practices.
c) Sanctioning taxpayers who are registered but have not complied with issued assessments,
which will consequently ensure enforcement of the penalties within the law and improve
compliance.
d) Dedicating resources to the enforcement of motor vehicle registration, third party stamp
duty, and renewal of third party for motor vehicles.
e) Enhancing the business analysis function by reviewing the debt management processes and
procedures, ensuring real time analysis of data and real time segmentation to facilitate
control and monitor lane performance.
f)

Increasing the number of audits and also monitor vigorously the usage of duty remission
schemes.

g) Increasing the goods that are cleared under the EAC Single Customs Territory Platform to
include tyres, steel (coils, bars), bitumen, building glass, bulk paper, among others.
h) Expanding the implementation of the Automated Valuation Control to mitigate
misclassification and undervaluation of goods. In addition, create a single central processing
center for all customs clearances.
26.
For the medium term, we plan to enhance revenue by strengthening enforcement and
reviewing the management strategy and staffing levels of the URA to meet the increasing demands
of the growing economy. Government will also build capacity of URA’s staff to combat the
challenges associated with international taxation. Sufficient resources will be provided to build a
sustainable monitoring framework to ensure URA continues to meet its revenue collection targets.
Tax laws will continuously be reviewed to identify and close loopholes that undermine revenue
collection, and to further simplify the tax code to ease implementation and reduce the cost of
compliance.

Containing Current Spending Growth
27.
In order to accommodate the pressing needs in infrastructure investment contained in the
budget, Government will strictly manage current spending while ensuring that poverty-reducing
spending is preserved. Expenditure requirements related to the 2016 general election have been
fully incorporated in the budget. Any unforeseen spending requirements will be accommodated
within the Contingencies Fund established under the PFM Act (2015) or savings in other areas,
without jeopardizing spending on social sectors. Consequently, the budgeted level of domestic debt
issuances will be preserved.
Implementing Infrastructure Projects
28.
Successful implementation of infrastructure investment projects is a key priority. We note
that further delays in implementation will negatively impact our growth prospects. We also
recognize that executing planned projects too fast could risk overheating the economy. Therefore
we are committed to properly sequence the projects once their feasibility studies and commercial
viability have been confirmed. We are also strengthening our capacity in project planning and
implementation. A new Department within the Ministry of Finance has been established to analyze,
appraise, monitor and evaluate public investment projects and facilitate the implementation of PPP
initiatives. With technical assistance from the World Bank, we are in the process of developing Public
Investment Management Guidelines to strengthen the capacity of Government agencies in the
preparation of feasibility studies, project preparation and financing assessments (structural
benchmark requested to be rescheduled for December 2015).
29.
The non-concessional infrastructure projects that we will implement in FY2015/16 are 1)
continuation of the construction of the Karuma and Isimba HPPs, with spending amounting to
$733 million. The projects started in FY2014/15 using the government’s share of financing, and are
expected to proceed smoothly following the recent parliamentary approval of the loan agreements
and the expected prompt finalization of the repayment mechanisms; 2) road construction using
machinery acquired through a loan; 3) the upgrade of the Entebbe airport with a total value of
$200 million, with $80 million expected to be spent in FY2015/16; 4) the Kabale-Mirama
transmission line ($84 million); the construction of a small-sized HPP in Muzizi; and 5) the National
Transmission Backbone ($15 million) to improve information and communication technology.
30.
Other projects to commence over the medium term include the first stage of the Standard
Gauge Railway; roads and an airport serving the Albertine region, which are necessary for oil
development; and various other road projects and transmission lines. A feasibility study for the
680MW Ayago HPP is ongoing, but to ensure a smooth expansion of infrastructure investment
within the economy’s absorptive capacity, this project is not expected to begin until FY2020/21.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

87

UGANDA

31.
In addition, there are medium-term plans to advance PPP arrangements including for the
construction of the Kampala-Jinja expressway and several other roads serving the Greater Kampala
area (including Kibuye-Busega-Nabingo, the Kampala Southern bypass and the Kampala-Bombo
expressway). The oil refinery is also being discussed and will be a PPP.

F.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies

32.
BoU’s monetary policy will continue to focus primarily on the inflation objective. The BoU
will continue to carefully adapt the monetary policy stance to changing economic domestic and
external developments with the aim of maintaining core inflation within its target. The BoU remains
committed to limiting foreign exchange interventions to times of heightened volatility and fully
sterilizing them to avoid conflict with monetary policy signals.
33.
To preserve financial sector stability, the BoU will further strengthen its prudential oversight
to guard against potential market, liquidity and operational risks, as well as vulnerabilities emerging
from credit sector concentration and currency mismatches. Specifically, we plan to continue
monitoring banks’ foreign exchange exposure in relation to total capital and their liquidity coverage
ratio, and ensure adequate provisioning for non-performing loans.
34.
Compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) international standards plays an important role in enhancing the financial system’s
integrity. Government is committed to addressing the recent Financial Action Task Force’s concerns
on the shortcomings in Uganda’s AML/CFT. An action plan detailing steps to be taken will be
developed by June 2015.The amendments bill to the Anti-Terrorism Act is currently before
Parliament.

G.

Policy Coordination and Communication with the Markets

35.
The MoFPED and the BoU will upgrade their regular meetings to enhance information
sharing and better coordinate economic and financial policies with the purpose of ensuring
consistency and maintaining credibility of the policy mix.
36.
The MoFPED and BoU will continue to strengthen communication with the market to keep
economic agents and the general public aware of economic developments and provide efficient
policy signaling. This will be essential to manage expectations in the current electoral environment.
37.
The level of domestic financing received from the Bank of Uganda will not exceed amounts
prescribed in the PSI which are Shs 1,140 billion and Shs.385 billion for FY2014/15 and FY2015/16,
respectively. The MoFPED and BoU will institutionalize this arrangement within the next six months
and will coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to anchor public expectations regarding economic
management.
38.
Given that the NSSF is a significant player in the market, the Ministry of Finance will
coordinate with the NSSF the timing and the pace of its financial investments abroad to avoid undue

88

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

significant market volatility, while respecting their independent and market-based decision making.

H.

Social Protection

39.
Government is committed to further strengthening social protection to improve the quality
of life of the most vulnerable segments of the population. A comprehensive social protection system
will complement the significant progress made on poverty reduction and act as a shock-absorber,
benefiting the wider local economy, and enhancing inclusive growth.
40.
Government will review the national roll out plan for social protection in order to ensure
that the requirements for the first years of the plan are accommodated within the available
resources. The NDP II emphasizes interventions to reduce household poverty and increase access to
child protection and basic education services. Future budgets will continue to make provisions for
programs targeted at youth, women, elderly, disabled and other vulnerable groups, including the
Youth Livelihood Programme (YLP), the Youth Venture Capital Fund and the Social Assistance Grant
for the Elderly (SAGE). The development of regulatory and planning frameworks for social protection
shall be accelerated, including the National Policy on Older Persons; the National Policy on
Disability; and the regulations on elections of older persons.

I.

Structural Reforms

41.
Progress on PFM reforms has been significant. The new PFM Act (2015) incorporates good
practices; prepares the economy for oil revenue management; and institutionalizes the preparation
of a fiscal risks statement and a charter on fiscal responsibility. Government has prepared the PFM
regulations, which will come into force in July 2015 (structural benchmark). A Charter of Fiscal
Responsibility has also been developed, which presents Government’s overall strategy on the
formulation and implementation of fiscal policy, consistent with sustainable fiscal balance and debt
paths over the medium term. The Charter shall be sent for Parliamentary approval (structural
benchmark), in line with the timeline requirements of the PFM Act, and shall cover the period
FY2016/17 to FY2020/21.
42.
Efforts will be made towards the implementation of the next phase of the Treasury Single
Account, including the setting up of the pilot project to integrate donor-supported projects in the
TSA framework by March 2016 (structural benchmark).
43.
Government is rolling out the national identification project to support efforts to strengthen
revenue collection, promote unique identification of financial sector clients and combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. We have already issued a total of 753,610 ID cards in
Kampala and Wakiso and are on track to have issued a minimum of 3 million by July 2015 (structural
benchmark). A total of about 5.7 million cards had been printed as of April 2015 and 15.9 million
citizens have registered for cards.
44.
To facilitate the control and reduction of domestic arrears, the MoFPED will continue to
publish quarterly reports signed by the Permanent Secretary on the unpaid bills of all Government
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

89

UGANDA

entities contained under Central Government votes and an annual report on the stock of domestic
arrears (structural benchmarks).
45.
To further improve the inflation targeting regime, we seek to finalize the amendments to the
BoU Act, which will be tabled before parliament by April 2016 (structural benchmark). Government
will also continue to recapitalize the central bank with marketable securities to bring its capital to
the statutory level until amendments to the Bank of Uganda Act come into force (structural
benchmark). Continuous support from the IMF African and Research Departments on capacity
building for modeling and forecasting will help improve monetary policy formulation and
implementation.
46.
Despite recent progress spurred by the growth in the mobile money business, a large share
of the population and small and medium-sized businesses do not have access to financial services.
To improve this situation, the BoU has included in the amendments to the Financial Institutions Act
provisions for agent banking.
47.
Strengthening the compilation and dissemination of statistics remains one of our critical
objectives to help enhance economic management. On the real sector side, efforts to improve the
quality and coverage of surveys will be made—including compiling GDP from the expenditure side
and on a quarterly basis. In the fiscal area, there is a need to overcome the considerable
coordination difficulties that prevent the straightforward collection and dissemination of arrears
data.
48.
Progress towards EAC regional integration will continue and economic policies and
frameworks shall be oriented towards our integration agreements with other Partner States. Work is
ongoing to establish regional institutions required for the successful functioning of the East African
Community Monetary Union (EAMU) and to create a regional fiscal surveillance process. The EAMU
Protocol requires each Partner State to develop a Medium Term Convergence Programme (MTCP)
to facilitate attainment of the agreed convergence criteria. We have prepared the first annual MTCP
which outlines the medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives, strategies and policies to
ensure that the Ugandan economy attains a high degree of monetary and economic convergence
and compatibility with other EAC Partner States, and follows a stable and sound trajectory towards
meeting the convergence criteria. Greater intra-regional trade among EAC Partner States will reduce
the costs and increase the benefits of forming the single currency. Government is therefore
introducing various measures to further reduce the costs of trade, such as the implementation of
one stop border posts, joint infrastructure projects and integrated payment systems, and fast
tracking of the Common Market Protocol.

J.

Program Monitoring

49.
Progress in the implementation of the policies under this program will be monitored
through QAC, ITs, and SBs detailed in the attached Tables 1 and 2 and through semi-annual reviews.
The net domestic financing and the net international reserves QACs are proposed to be modified for
end–June 2015, and new QAC are proposed to be established for end-December 2015, to be
monitored at the fifth and sixth PSI reviews, respectively. To be able to accommodate our planned
investment projects, we request to increase the nonconcessional borrowing limit to $3.0 billion for
end-June. ITs are proposed for September 2015 and March 2016. A new IT on the overall fiscal
deficit of the central government is proposed to be established, which will comprehensively capture
debt-creating activities and will be fully consistent with the implementation of the infrastructure
plans. The fifth review is expected to be completed by end-December 2015 and the sixth by endJune 2016. The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding—which is an integral part of this
memorandum—contains the needed definitions.

Attachment I. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
A. Introduction
1.
This memorandum defines the quarterly quantitative assessment criteria (QAC) and indicative
targets (ITs) described in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for the
economic program supported by the IMF Policy Support Instrument (PSI) over the period June 30,
2015—March 30, 2016, and sets forth the reporting requirements under the instrument. The stock of
all foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into U.S. dollars at each test date using the cross
exchange rates referred to in the table below for the various currencies and then converted into
Uganda shillings using the program U.S. dollar-Uganda shilling exchange rate for end-March 2015,
unless otherwise indicated in the text.

B. Consultation Mechanism on Inflation
2.
The quarterly consultation bands for the twelve-month average rate of consumer price
inflation (as measured by the core consumer price index (CCPI) published by the Uganda Bureau of
Statistics (UBOS)) are specified in Text Table 1. The consultation bands specify the range of
admissible CCPI inflation. Projected CCPI inflation for end-June 2015 and end-December 2015 will
be subject to the consultation mechanism, while those for end-September 2015 and end-March
2016 are indicative targets.

3.
Should the observed average CCPI inflation for the test date linked to a PSI program review
(i.e., end-June 2015 for the fifth review and end-December 2015 for the sixth review) fall outside the
outer band as specified in the above table, the authorities will complete a consultation with the
Executive Board of the Fund on their proposed policy response before requesting completion of the
review under the program. The authorities will not be able to request completing a review under the
PSI-supported program if the average CCPI inflation has moved outside of the outer band as of the
test date linked to such review, until the consultation with the Executive Board has taken place. In
line with the accountability principles, the BoU will report to the public the reasons for any breach of
the outer bands, and its policy response. In addition, the BoU will conduct discussions with the Fund
staff when the observed average CCPI inflation falls outside the inner band as specified for the end
of June 2015 and December 2015 in Text Table 1.

C. Ceiling on the Cumulative Increase in Net Domestic Financing of
the Central Government1 (QAC)
4.
The cumulative increase in net domestic financing of the central government (NDF) is defined
from below the line on a cash basis as the sum of:
a. the change in net claims on the central government by the banking system: Net claims on the
central government by the banking system is defined as the difference between the outstanding
amount of bank credits to the central government and the central government's deposits with
deposit corporations, excluding deposits in administered accounts and project accounts with the
banking system, including the central bank. Credits comprise bank loans and advances to the
government and holdings of government securities and promissory notes. NDF by deposit
corporations will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary authority
and deposit corporations as per the deposit corporations’ survey (DCS).
b. the change in net claims on the central government of domestic nonbank institutions and
households: Net claims on the general government of domestic nonbank institutions and
households are defined as treasury bills, bonds or other government securities held by nonbank
institutions and households (including nonresidents and nonresident financial institutions), plus
any other liabilities of the central government to domestic nonbank institutions or households.
All changes will be calculated as the difference between end-of-period stocks, net of any valuation
changes resulting from currency movements.

The central government comprises the treasury and line ministries.

UGANDA

D. Floor on the Net International Reserves of the Bank of Uganda (QAC)
5.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Bank of Uganda (BoU) are defined for programmonitoring purposes as reserve assets of the BoU net of short-term external liabilities of the BoU.
Reserve assets are defined as external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the BoU and
exclude pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to, assets used
as collateral or guarantees for third-party liabilities. Short-term external liabilities are defined as
liabilities to nonresidents, of original maturities less than one year, contracted by the BoU and
include outstanding IMF purchases and loans.
6.
For program-monitoring purposes, reserve assets and short-term liabilities at the end of each
test period will be calculated in U.S. dollars by converting the stock from their original currency
denomination at program exchange rates (as specified in paragraph 1). The NIR limits are the
cumulative changes of the NIR stock from July 1 of the respective fiscal year to the specified dates.

E. Floor on Expenditures on Poverty Alleviating Sectors (IT)
7.
The indicative target on the floor on poverty alleviating expenditures includes domestic
expenditures inclusive of wages and salaries in the health, education, water and environment, and
agriculture sectors, as defined by the Government of Uganda’s (GOU) functional budget
classification, excluding those which are externally financed. Compliance with the indicative floor for
poverty alleviating expenditures will be verified on the basis of releases.

F. Ceiling on Issuance of Guarantees by the Government or Bank of
Uganda (IT)
8.
The indicative target on issuance of guarantees by the GoU or the BoU aims to prevent
accumulation of contingent liabilities by the GoU (including entities such as ministries, agencies and
authorities). Included against the ceiling are any direct, contingent liabilities of the GoU (including
entities that are part of the GoU such as ministries, agencies and authorities) issued after June 28,
2014, and including any guarantees issued prior to this date but which are extended after June 28,
2014. This excludes guarantee programs which have explicit budget appropriations.

G. Share of Oil Revenue Placed in Petroleum Fund (QAC)
9.
The purpose of this quantitative assessment criterion is to avoid a situation whereby
petroleum revenues bypass the Ugandan budget framework. The 2015 PFM Act has established a
petroleum fund; while it becomes operational, government has established a petroleum revenue
account in the BoU. This QAC will be deemed satisfied if 100 percent of petroleum revenues are
transferred to this account upon collection by URA. These resources may then be spent or saved as
governed by the 2015 PFM Act.

98

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

H. Tax Revenue (IT)
10.
A floor applies on tax revenue of central government measured cumulatively from the
beginning of the fiscal year. For program-monitoring purposes, tax revenue is defined as the sum of
direct domestic taxes (PAYE, corporate tax, presumptive tax, other direct taxes, withholding tax,
rental income tax, tax on bank interest, casino tax and unallocated receipts); excise duty and valueadded taxes net of refunds; infrastructure levy; and taxes on international trade minus temporary
road licenses and fees to hides and skins, as defined by the GoU’s revenue classification.

I. Net Accumulation of Domestic Arrears of the Government (IT)
11.
A ceiling applies to net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government as an
indicative target.2 The ceiling for each test date is measured cumulatively from July 1 of the
respective fiscal year.
12.
An unpaid bill is defined as any verified outstanding payment owed by any entity that forms
part of the central government votes for the following: utilities, rent, employee costs, other
recurrent, court awards, compensation, contributions to international organizations, development,
taxes, and other deductions. Domestic arrears are the total stock of unpaid bills as of June 30 of the
fiscal year as reported in the consolidated financial statements of the GoU.
13.
For quarters other than the one ending June 30, the net change in the stock of unpaid bills
will be used as the indicative target. For the quarter ending in June 30, the change in the total stock
of unpaid bills as reported in the consolidated financial statements of the GoU will be used as the
indicative target.

J. Ceiling on Withdrawals from the GoU Deposits from the Petroleum and
Energy Funds (IT)
14.
The indicative target on the ceiling on withdrawals from the GoU deposits from the
Petroleum Fund and the Energy Fund aims at channeling these resources to key infrastructure
projects while ensuring coordination on accompanying impact on liquidity. A ceiling applies on
withdrawals from the GoU deposits from the Petroleum Fund and the Energy Fund measured
cumulatively from the beginning of the fiscal year. Withdrawals will be restricted to meet the
following uses: (i) spending on Karuma and Isimba hydro-power projects and the associated
industrial substations, specifically related to the loan agreement between the GoU and China
Eximbank (the GoU’s share adds up to US$413 million covering 15 percent of total costs of projects,
loan insurance, and management fees); (ii) spending on land acquisition for Karuma and Isimba
HPPs (Ush20 billion), and (iii) a maximum of the domestic currency equivalent of US$64 million to
finance the government’s share of these projects, as stated in paragraph 19 below.
2

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

99

UGANDA

K. Ceiling on Overall Deficit of the Central Government (IT)
15.
The indicative target on the ceiling on the overall deficit of the Central Government is defined
as the cumulative sum, from July 1 of the relevant fiscal year, of:
a. NDF as defined in section C;
b. net external financing (NEF), defined as the sum of the difference between disbursements
and amortization of any loans (including budget support loans and project loans, both
concessional and nonconcessional), internationally-issued bonds, and any other forms of
liabilities by the Central Government to nonresidents, excluding nonresidents’ holdings of
domestically-issued government securities (which are covered under NDF), plus external
exceptional financing; and
c.

net proceeds from sales of non-financial assets including privatization receipts;

where any amounts in foreign currency are converted to Uganda shillings at the current exchange
rate as of the date of the transaction.
Changes in NEF will be measured using external financing (net) provided in the monthly government
financial statistics. These data, in turn, will be based on the reconciled donor disbursement figures
obtained by the central bank and by MoFPED through the Debt Management and Financial Analysis
System (DMFAS) and Aid Management System (AMS).

L. Adjusters
Adjustor related to budget support
16.
The NIR, the NDF, and the overall deficit targets are based on program assumptions
regarding budget support excluding assistance provided under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and the MDRI.
17.
The Uganda shilling equivalent of projected budget support (grants and loans) excluding
HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance in the form of grants on a cumulative basis from July 1 of the
relevant fiscal year is presented under Schedule A. The ceilings on the cumulative increase in NDF
will be adjusted downward (upward), and the floor on the cumulative increase in NIR of the BoU will
be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which budget support, grants and loans,
excluding HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance, exceeds (falls short of) the projected amounts. The
ceilings on the cumulative increase in overall deficit will be adjusted downward (upward) by the
amount by which budget support grants, excluding HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance, exceeds
(falls short of) the projected amounts.

Background on Hydropower Plant Projects and Energy and Petroleum Fund Stocks
18.
The GoU is cofinancing the Karuma and Isimba hydropower plant projects (HPPs) and the
associated industrial substations, in accordance to loan agreements with China’s Eximbank. By the
end of the second quarter of FY2013/14, the GoU had already spent US$338 million, coming from
the Energy Fund and temporarily the Uganda Consolidated Fund —as bridge financing while the
budget was approved and thus the Petroleum Fund could be used—with the stocks described in the
table below. The foreign currency-denominated deposits of the Petroleum Fund do not constitute
part of the BoU’s international reserves and as such are recorded under other foreign assets of the
BoU. Any further foreign currency denominated inflows to the Fund will continue to be recorded
outside of the reserves and under other foreign assets of the BoU.

M. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Non-concessional
External Debt by the Public Sector, and Ceiling on the Stock of External
Payments Arrears Incurred by the Public Sector3
24.
The assessment criterion on short-term debt refers to contracting or guaranteeing external
debt with original maturity of one year or less by the public sector. Excluded from this assessment
criterion are normal import-related credits and non-resident holdings of government securities and
government promissory notes.
25.
The program includes a ceiling on new non-concessional borrowing with maturities greater
than one year contracted or guaranteed by the public sector, measured cumulatively from June 28,

3

Public sector comprises the general government (which includes the central government, local governments, and monetary
authorities), and entities that are public corporations which are subject to ‘control by the government’, defined as the ability to
determine general corporate policy or by at least 50 percent government ownership.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

103

UGANDA

2013.4 Non-concessional borrowing is defined as debt with a grant element of less than 35 percent.
The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent. The ceiling on non-concessional external
borrowing or guarantees is to be observed on a continuous basis. Therefore, the limits, increased
with effect from end-June 2015, should be respected on a daily basis, until either lifted or modified
by a new Executive Board decision. External debt for the purpose of this assessment criterion means
borrowing giving rise to liabilities to non-residents. Excluded from the limits are changes in
indebtedness resulting from non-resident holdings of government securities and government
promissory notes, refinancing credits and rescheduling operations, and credits extended by the IMF.
For the purposes of the program, arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial
awards to external creditors that have not participated in the HIPC Initiative do not constitute nonconcessional external borrowing. Excluded from these limits are also non-concessional borrowing
within the limits specified in Table 1 of the MEFP. The ceiling also excludes the non-concessional
borrowing of one state-owned bank, Housing Finance Bank, which poses limited fiscal risk and is in
a position to borrow without a government guarantee.
26.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit, is set out in point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s Decision No. 6230-(79/140),
as amended by Decision No 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009). It not only applies to the
debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements reads as
follows:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term "debt" will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including
deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the
obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the
collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official
swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods
are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under
which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use for one or more
4

Contracting and guaranteeing is defined as approval by a resolution of Parliament as required in Section 36(5) and 39(1) of the
Public Finance and Management Act, 2015.

specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service
life of the property, while the lesser retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
27.
The ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears is zero. This limit, which is
to be observed on a continuous basis, applies to the change in the stock of overdue payments on
debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector from their level at end-December 2014. External
debt payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (reported by the Statistics
Department of the BoU, the Macro Department of the Ministry of Finance) that have not been paid
at the time they are due as specified in the contractual agreements but shall exclude arrears on
obligations subject to rescheduling.

N. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
28.
The GoU will submit information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time lag as
indicated in Table 1. The quality and timeliness of the data submission will be tracked and reported

Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards policy, assessments with respect to the PSI are voluntary. An update
assessment of the Bank of Uganda (BOU) was completed on April 10, 2007 and concluded that
the BOU had strengthened its safeguards framework since 2003 assessment. The main
developments included implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards,
publication of financial statements, establishment of an audit committee, and strengthening of
the internal audit function. Staff made recommendations to address remaining vulnerabilities in
the legal and internal control areas.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The official exchange rate is determined on the interbank foreign exchange market. As of end of
April, 2015, the official exchange rate was USh 2998.95 per US dollar. The exchange rate is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers of current international transactions.
Uganda’s de iure exchange rate is classified as free floating and its de facto arrangement is
floating.
Article IV Consultation:
The Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on June 28, 2013. Following
completion of the current Article IV, the next Article IV consultation with Uganda will be held in
accordance to the decision on consultation cycles adopted by Decision No. 14747, as amended.
Technical Assistance:
Uganda has continued to receive extensive technical assistance from the Fund in recent years in
the areas of public finance management, tax policy and tax administration, monetary policy
formulation and implementation, statistics and national accounts, among others.1
In February 2015, FAD provided a follow-up TA mission in tax and customs administration. The
objective of the mission was to further sharpen the focus of compliance actions targeted to the
various taxpayer segments; coordinate core functions across the URA, and strengthen audit and
enforcement actions; and improve the accuracy of taxpayer account information in the e-tax
system. In support of the new PFM Act, FAD also provided in March 2015 TA on the drafting of
the regulations to implement the Act and the preparation of a Charter for Fiscal Responsibility.
Furthermore, in order to assist in strengthening natural resource management in light of the
recent oil discoveries, a diagnostic assessment mission was conducted in February/March 2015 to
evaluate the existing fiscal regime, assess the present regulatory framework, and advise on
appropriate reforms, as well as other general tax policy and legal issues for the mining and
petroleum sectors.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 30, 2015)
I.
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Overall data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes, although some
shortcomings remain.
Real Sector Statistics: Since 2004 Uganda has been receiving technical assistance (TA) from the
EastAfrican Technical Assistance Center (East AFRITAC) on the compilation of annual and
quarterly national accounts and price statistics. With assistance from East AFRITAC and an
external consultant, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) developed supply and use tables
(SUT) that include preliminary product balances for 155 activities by 161 products. An East
AFRITAC mission in May 2014 assisted in finalizing the SUT and rebasing the annual and quarterly
GDP estimates at current and constant prices. The rebased GDP estimates (FY2009/10) were
released in November 2014. Efforts to improve the annual expenditure measure of GDP and new
quarterly expenditure measures in current and constant prices continue. STA has recently begun a
project to assist the authorities to improve financial transactions accounts and balance sheets by
institutional sector. Labor market indicators such as employment and wages/earnings are
infrequently compiled and disseminated. UBOS aims to compile and disseminate these data
categories on an annual basis, but due to resource and data unavailability, these data are
compiled with a two year lag. The consumer price index (CPI) series released in January 2010
were replaced in June 2014 by the new CPI series that use the expenditure weights from the
2009/2010 Uganda National Household Survey. UBOS compiles and disseminates a Producer Price
Index (PPI) for manufacturing (separately for imports and domestic output) and for hotels. East
AFRITAC has been providing TA to rebase and expand the coverage and quality of the PPI and to
commence development of export and import price indices.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS):
The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) compiles and reports
annual (GFSY) budgetary central and local government data and monthly (IFS) budgetary central
government data on a cash basis following the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM
2001). East AFRITAC provides technical assistance to the national authorities in expanding the
coverage and improving the quality of these statistics. The national GFS Technical Working Group,
comprising representatives from MOFPED, UBOS and the BOU are working on the implementation
of the GFSM development plan, which aims to meet East African Monetary Union (EAMU)
Protocol’s fiscal statistics requirements. Implementation of the plan will result in several important
improvements in the Uganda’s GFS, such as expansion of coverage to the general government
sector by 2015. The target date for adopting a modified cash basis of reporting is 2017. In
addition, according to the plan, Uganda will disseminate estimates of the stock of financial assets
and liabilities by 2017.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: TA in FY2015 aims at improving the institutional coverage
and classification of other depository corporations (ODCs) and initiation of the collection and
compilation of data for other financial corporations, mainly insurance companies and pension
funds. This would build on previous missions financed by DFID on the standardized report forms
(SRFs). Uganda began publishing SRF-based monetary data from 2002 in IFS beginning in early
2009. In addition, the TA also aimed at developing a system that would allow the Bank of Uganda
(BOU) to collect information on financial positions with non-residents in the other East African
Community (EAC) partner states, for the purpose of compiling union-wide MFS for the EAC. The
BOU compiles and submits to STA all core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and some FSIs for
deposit takers, households, and real estate markets
External Sector Statistics (ESS): The BOU, with the assistance of East AFRITAC has improved the
quality and timeliness of ESS and implemented Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6) standards. In May 2015, an STA technical assistance mission will visit
Uganda to finalize the compilation methods for the unit value based export and import price
indexes, as well as develop more reliable survey based export and import indexes.
II.
Data Standards and Quality
Uganda is participating in the IMF–DFID
Uganda has been GDDS participant since May
Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative,
2000. In February 2005, a STA mission prepared
Quarterly National Accounts (QNA) Statistics
a Report on the Observance of Standards and
Module. An initial mission was undertaken
Codes (ROSC), with results published in July
during November 2010 to review the data
2006. The ROSC mission assessed data
sources and compilation methodology used to compilation and dissemination practices against
compile QNA estimates and to make
international standards in national accounts,
recommendations for improvements. Followprices, government finance, and balance of
up missions were undertaken during May and
payments statistics. The monetary and financial
November 2011, May and November 2012,
statistics were not assessed.
and May and November 2013. CPI, PPI and
annual estimates of rebased GDP have been
released. Major improvements have been
made to the associated data sources, especially
benchmark surveys and the compilation
methodologies. Comprehensive supply and
use tables (SUTs) have been compiled; and
quarterly GDP by production approach (GDPP) at constant and current prices disseminated.
The quality and timeliness of the ESS has been
improved and the estimates are consistent with
the BPM6 standards.

III.
Reporting to STA
Uganda reports government finance statistics (GFS) data according to the GFSM 2001 framework
for the GFS Yearbook, but does not report any high frequency data for inclusion in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). The BoU reports regularly monetary data for the central bank
and other depository corporations (ODCs) in the format of Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). and
it also reports all core FSIs and some FSIs for deposit takers, households, and real estate markets

INSTRUMENT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

1

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that
Uganda’s risk of debt distress is low and will remain so
notwithstanding the planned infrastructure investment
program. Nonetheless, the debt service-to-revenue ratio is
high owing to the relatively low revenues and the short
maturity of domestic debt, posing some sustainability risks.
Uncertainty about oil production and related infrastructure
investments assumed in the baseline scenario also presents
some downside risks, albeit limited so far.

The last Debt Sustainability Analysis update was conducted at the time of the third PSI Review in December
2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/344). A full joint DSA is expected to be prepared once every three years for
PRGT-eligible IDA-only countries, according to the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (www.imf.org). Under the Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Uganda is rated as a strong performer. Therefore, the DSA uses the policydependent thresholds for strong performers. All data refers to the fiscal year which runs from July to June (e.g.,
FY2015 covers July 2014 to June 2015). External debt is defined as foreign-currency denominated debt.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The accumulation of new external public debt has been gradual since debt relief was
granted. The authorities have cautiously limited the increase in public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt at 4 percent of GDP since FY2007 (Chart 1). New borrowing was used to finance public
investment on infrastructure projects, including in energy and transportation. Uganda’s PPG debt mostly
comprises concessional multilateral debt, primarily from the World Bank and the African Development
Bank, which accounts for 80 percent of the total, slightly lower than their pre-debt relief level (Chart 2). The
share of non-Paris Club creditors has increased to 9 percent of the total, reflecting higher borrowing from
China.

2.
In the same period, the domestic public debt market has steadily developed. The share of
public domestic debt in total debt remains at less than 50 percent, with a moderate increase by 4 percent
of GDP since FY2007. Increased domestic debt reflects efforts to diversify funding sources, together with
the issuance of marketable securities for central bank recapitalization since May 2013, now being used for
the conduct of monetary policy. The maturity of government securities has been expanded to 15 years,
while securities with maturities lower than one-year constitute 48 percent of the total. Average yields
ranged from 12 to 17 percent in early 2015, depending on maturity. Foreign investors have increasingly
participated in the domestic debt market, holding about 13 percent of local-currency denominated
government securities (1½ percent of GDP at end-December 2014).
3.
Private external debt has also increased, reflecting steady foreign direct investment flows.
Private external debt has increased by 8 percent of GDP since FY2007, amounting to 15 percent of GDP at
end-December 2014. Half of the debt is classified as direct investment in the form of debt instruments and
the rest is also mostly long-term debt taken by the foreign-owned companies from partners other than
their owners’ group companies.
4.
The authorities plan to scale up infrastructure investment, mostly financed by
non-concessional borrowing (NCB). To address the country’s infrastructure gap, the authorities
formulated an ambitious package of medium-term infrastructure investment, including the construction of

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

hydropower plants, transmission networks, roads, and pipelines in preparation to envisaged oil production.
Financing of this package includes a scaling-up of public debt including NCB, neighbor countries’
government participations, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). A large part of the planned NCB is
expected to be provided by the Export-Import Bank of China, Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC), and the Islamic Development Bank, as well as traditional creditors.
5.
In preparing for the scaling-up of public investment, the authorities have taken steps to
enhance their institutional capacity. A centralized institutional body has been established, within the
Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, which takes care of all the aspects of
government debt—from planning to issuance to repayment regarding both external and domestic debt.
They have also strengthened the legal framework, including through the new 2015 PFM Act. To ensure that
investment is efficiently managed, Public Investment Management Guidelines and Procedures will be
developed by the end of FY2014/15 (structural benchmark).
6.
Statistically, the recent GDP rebasing results in lower debt-to-GDP ratios than earlier
thought. The national accounts have been rebased from calendar year 2002 to FY2009/10 to improve the
methodology and expand coverage, leading to higher nominal GDP estimates by 17 percent in the base
year. All the debt ratios relative to GDP are therefore lower than in the previous DSA, even without any
changes in the numerators.
Underlying Macroeconomic Assumptions
7.
Macroeconomic assumptions in this DSA are consistent with the authorities’ framework
supported by the PSI. The baseline scenario assumes implementation of the authorities’ economic and
structural policies. Expected gains in revenue mobilization, further deepening of domestic debt markets,
and greater availability of NCB with reasonable terms (i.e., a grant element of 15 percent over the long run)
are expected to create fiscal space for infrastructure investment. Revenues from the envisaged oil
production are assumed to come in FY2020/21, with significant uncertainty regarding the timing and
magnitude (Box 1). Compared to the previous DSA update, this version includes the expected oil revenues
as the framework now incorporates the oil-related medium-term infrastructure projects. Lower growth
projections reflect the GDP rebasing that revealed lower growth in the past few years (Text Table 1).
 Growth is projected at 6½ percent on average over the medium term, mainly supported by public
investment. The successful completion of infrastructure investment would help sustain private sector
development and boost the economy, bringing Uganda to middle-income status as envisaged in the
authorities’ National Development Plan. Therefore, the non-oil long-term growth assumption of
5¼ percent is anchored by the average per-capita growth among middle-income countries from
1990-2012 and UN’s population growth projections.
 The current account deficit is projected at 12 percent of GDP on average over the medium term,
reflecting Uganda’s structurally high deficits and large import demand associated with the
construction of large infrastructure projects. Project financing partly include foreign direct
investment, while PPPs are treated as contingent liabilities to the government. Once the projects are
completed, import demand would decline while export receipts would increase on account of
potential energy surpluses and better road and railway infrastructure, in addition to crude oil exports

and reduced fuel imports. As a result, the current account deficit is projected, on average, at
4 percent of GDP in the long term.
 The fiscal deficit is projected to widen to an average of 6½ percent of GDP in the medium term,
peaking at 7 percent in FY2016/17. This increase reflects the scaled-up investment, while current
spending is assumed to broadly stabilize in terms of GDP. The amount of investment is higher than
the previous DSA, leading to a higher overall deficit. After completion of the investment scale-up, the
fiscal deficit long-term average is expected to come down to 1½ percent of GDP.
 The envisaged NCB under the PSI would increase over the medium term. The original
$2.2 billion will finance part of the construction of the Karuma and Isimba dams, a road
project, and industrial substations with transmission lines. The NCB is expected to be broadly
$3.0 billion at end-December 2015. The additional $0.8 billion will finance the Entebbe Airport
rehabilitation, purchase of road construction equipments, and other electricity and rural
electrification projects. Over the medium term, NCB is projected to increase to about $8 billion
(cumulative from June 28, 2013), reflecting projects currently in the pipeline.

Box 1. Assumptions on Envisaged Oil Production
The baseline scenario reflects the impact of envisaged oil production on growth, trade, and revenue
projections. These assumptions are based on information currently available and subject to a high degree
of uncertainty, regarding the timing and volumes. In this regard, a customized alternative scenario is also
examined, where all flows from oil production are removed. Oil prices are taken from the Spring 2015 WEO
projections over the medium term (with $74 per barrel in 2020) and assumed to be constant in real terms
thereafter.
Oil production is projected to raise real GDP growth by 1½ percentage points on average during
FY2020/21-2024/25. The construction of oil-related infrastructure would also raise growth before
FY2020/21. Oil production is expected to account for 10 percent of Uganda’s GDP during the peak
extraction period, while its large direct contribution to growth is concentrated until production reaches its
full capacity in about FY2025/26. Oil reserves are anticipated to last for about 30 years.
Oil trade is projected to improve the current account balance by 2½ percent of GDP on average
during the 15 years after oil production starts. Oil exports would amount to 6 percent of GDP on
average. Fuel imports would decrease marginally, in line with the production capacity of the refinery.
Oil revenues are projected to add 4 percent of GDP on average after oil production reaches its full
capacity. Oil revenues would constitute about 25 percent of total revenue at the peak. The projection is
subject to uncertainty about fiscal regimes put in place.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
8.
PPG external debt is assessed to be sustainable over the projection period. The PV of external
debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at about 25 percent in FY2021, while nominal PPG external debt stays below
35 percent of GDP in the projection period. All debt burden indicators are projected to remain below
Uganda’s country-specific debt burden thresholds under the baseline scenario and the standardized stress
tests (Figure 1, Tables 1 and 3). Compared to the previous DSA update, the debt burden indicators have
increased because of the projected higher borrowing for scaling-up infrastructure investment.
9.
Alternative scenarios highlight the importance of improving revenue performance and
maintaining high quality policies and institutions. The most extreme stress tests indicate that the debt
burden indicators related to fiscal revenue are the closest to the thresholds. This highlights the importance
of improving domestic revenue collection for debt sustainability. As discussed in the previous DSA update,
there remains a risk of downgrading in the CPIA rating from “strong performer” to “medium performer” if
the three-year average CPIA index during 2012-2014 were to remain below 3.75. In this case, the thresholds
for debt sustainability indicators would become lower and the risk of debt distress higher (Text Table 2). It is
therefore important to retain the high quality of policies and institutions to maintain debt sustainability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UGANDA

10.
Uncertainty about oil production adds debt sustainability risks, albeit limited so far. A
customized alternative scenario, where no oil revenues or oil exports would materialize, shows a limited
increase in the debt burden indicators, reflecting the authorities’ prudent debt accumulation plan. Given the
high uncertainty regarding the timing and volumes of proceeds from oil production, keeping the prudent
planning without relying on oil proceeds is warranted. In addition, it is important to strengthen productivity
and competitiveness for non-oil exports, including through successful completion of scaled-up
infrastructure projects, not only because of the uncertainty about oil production, but also considering that
oil exports could potentially lead to real appreciation of the shilling and weaken competitiveness for nonoil exports (a symptom of “Dutch Disease”).

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
Total public debt (external and domestic debt) is also assessed to be sustainable over the
projection period. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at about 45 percent in FY2020,
well below the benchmark level of 74 percent associated with heightened public debt vulnerabilities for
strong performers. However, the relatively short average maturity of domestic debt (less than three years)
combined with a low revenue base leads to a debt service-to-revenue ratio of about 45 percent at its peak,
among the highest in low-income countries, and increases the rollover and interest rate risks. This is a
matter of concern. The risks need to be mitigated by a combination of stronger revenue mobilization and
deeper financial markets to extend average maturities over the medium term.
12.
Stress tests indicate the importance of fiscal consolidation over the long term. An illustrative
scenario with a fixed primary deficit over the projection period indicates a significantly high PV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio, about 55 percent of GDP by FY2035 (Figure 2, Tables 2 and 4). This highlights the
importance of reducing fiscal deficits after the temporary increase during the scaling up of public
investment. The customized alternative scenario without oil flows indicate higher but limited risks
stemming from uncertainty about oil revenues as is the case for the external debt analysis.

CONCLUSION
13.
Uganda’s risk of external debt distress remains low. The government’s ambitious plan to scale
up public investment remains consistent with debt sustainability, because the authorities have cautiously
retained borrowing space after they received debt relief, and have started the planned improvement in tax

6

UGANDA

revenue collection. However, the authorities need to ensure economic viability and appropriate cost
recovery of any new projects, with a careful sequencing of execution that would be compatible with the
economy’s absorptive capacity and the government’s implementation capacity constraints. They should
also avoid delays and inefficiencies that could add costs Fiscal deficits should be lowered when the projects
are concluded to keep public debt on a sustainable path. The planned increase in tax revenues and
maintenance of a stable economic environment should help reduce the existing rollover and interest risk of
domestic debt. Maintaining the country’s prudent debt strategy is warranted because of a high degree of
uncertainty about flows from envisaged oil production. We welcome the steps taken to enhance debt
management capacity, including monitoring and reporting, given the large scaling-up in public investment.
14.
The authorities concurred with staff’s views. The authorities remain committed to ensuring
debt sustainability through the long-term prudent debt management outlined in their Medium Term Debt
Management Framework, which aims to minimize costs and risks from financing large public investment
projects. The authorities acknowledged the importance of taking into account the absorptive capacity of
the economy to maintain macroeconomic stability, as well as ensuring projects’ viability and efficient
implementation. The authorities will continue to engage with IDA/IMF staff on debt management issues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by
Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Uganda
and
Gloria Gasasira-Manzi, Advisor to the Executive Director for Uganda
June 29, 2015
The Ugandan authorities continue to value the constructive policy dialogue with the Fund.
They welcome the insightful and thorough analysis of the country’s macroeconomic policies
carried out during the 2015 Article IV consultation and the fourth review of the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) and broadly agree with staff’s assessment.
The Ugandan economy has remained resilient. Sound macroeconomic policies have enabled
strong growth and supported adequate buffers to protect the economy against potential
shocks. The risks to the outlook arise mainly from geopolitical developments especially in
the region, slower recovery in advanced economies and a larger than projected slowdown in
emerging markets.
Program Performance
Performance under the PSI has been on track and all end-December 2014 quantitative
assessment criteria (QAC) were met. However, there was a breach of the lower inner limit of
the band of the inflation consultation clause and average core inflation reached 3.1 percent at
end-December, against an inner band of 3.7 percent. The indicative target (IT) on tax revenue
was met with a large margin. Although the target on the net change in stock of domestic
arrears was missed by a small margin, the annual target is expected to be met, with a large
reduction resulting from sustained efforts by the Government to reduce arrears in line with
the debt strategy. There is significant progress on structural reforms and most end of March
ITs were met. The second phase of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) was partially met in
spite of delays due to extended discussions with development partners regarding the
inclusion of their accounts.
In light of this performance and the continued commitment to the program, the authorities
request the support of Executive Directors for completion of the fourth review under the PSI
and the proposed alignment of the program conditionality with the updated macroeconomic
framework.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Uganda continues to register strong economic growth, driven by an increase in private sector
activity in agriculture, industry and services as well as public infrastructure investment
especially in energy and roads. The real GDP growth is projected at 5.3 percent for
FY2014/15 and 5.8 percent for FY2015/16. Social services have also expanded significantly
in education and health, in pursuit of government’s policy of universal access.
Inflation has remained subdued mainly due to low food and import prices. However, this
trend has more recently reversed with inflation gradually rising to 4.9 percent in May 2015.
Although the recent oil price decline lowered the import bill, this was partially offset by the

2
exchange rate depreciation, in part due to global strengthening of the US dollar. The
exchange rate pass-through and strengthening economic activity are expected to exert further
upward pressure on consumer prices over the medium term. The annual core inflation is now
projected to rise to 8 – 10 percent by the end of 2015/16, an increase of 1 percentage point
compared to the April 2015 forecast. Consequently, the Bank of Uganda (BOU) increased
the Central Bank Rate (CBR) by 1 percentage point to 13 percent on June 16, 2015, to ensure
that medium term inflation converges towards its policy target of 5 percent. BOU will remain
vigilant and take necessary monetary policy actions should the inflation outlook deteriorate.
The current account deficit is projected to widen from 8.5 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 to
10.3 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, due to lower remittances, subdued global commodity
prices, lower aggregate demand in key export markets and rising import demand. However, a
significant portion of imports is related to public infrastructure and private investment and
will boost the long term productive capacity of the country. The current account has been
comfortably financed thus far and international reserves continue to be adequate at about 4
months of imports. In addition, the development of Uganda’s oil sector remains positive. To
date, there are three active exploration licenses and one production license. Bidding for six
new blocks to attract new companies in the exploration phase is ongoing and expected to be
concluded in December 2015. Once successful, this is expected to lead to continued strong
foreign direct investment and other financial inflows.
Fiscal Policy
Uganda’s fiscal policy focuses on providing sustainable economic and social benefits to the
society in the short, medium and long term. In this regard, the budget for FY2015/16 under
the theme “Maintaining Infrastructure Investment and Promoting Excellence in Public
Service Delivery” seeks to close existing infrastructure gaps, as well as promote socioeconomic transformation while taking into account the prevailing macroeconomic conditions
and future prospects.
For FY2015/16, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 7 percent of GDP
compared to 4.5 percent for FY2014/15 mainly as a result of the boost in public investment
in infrastructure. The infrastructure investment will enhance regional integration, develop
Uganda’s oil sector, unlock private sector activity, and generate the much needed tax
revenues to finance development. Over the medium term, the deficit will average about 6
percent before it drops to about 4.5 percent in FY2019/20, in line with the East African
Community Monetary Union Protocol. The authorities continue to pursue concessional loans
as the preferred means of meeting the external financing requirements. Non-concessional
external borrowing will be considered only for the financing of highly productive fixed
capital investments.
Continuing with the momentum witnessed during FY2014/15, successful implementation of
the FY2015/16 budget is expected to yield an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio of about 0.5
percent. To generate additional revenues, the authorities have proposed amendments to the
Income Tax Act and VAT law, including simplification of the presumptive tax regime and
specification of the amount of tax payable by small businesses. The government has also

3
made amendments to clarify VAT applications in the oil, gas and mining industry to facilitate
investments.
The authorities also intend to focus on increasing non-tax revenues while improving tax
administration, compliance and enforcement. They plan to improve the capacity of the
Uganda Revenue Authority particularly to combat the challenges associated with
international taxation. In line with this, government has ratified various agreements covering
double taxation avoidance, prevention of fiscal evasion and collaboration in tax
administration with other entities in the region. Furthermore, given the large informal sector,
efforts are underway to enhance awareness to bring about a change in the taxpaying culture.
Implementation of public financial management reforms will continue to enhance the
efficiency of public expenditures. Following the approval of the PFM Act (2015) in
November 2014 and its subsequent commencement in March 2015, the authorities have
prepared the PFM regulations which will come into force in July 2015, incorporating
recommendations from Fund Technical Assistance. A Charter of Fiscal Responsibility (CFR)
which presents the government’s overall strategy on the formulation and implementation of
fiscal policy consistent with sustainable fiscal balance and debt paths over the medium term
is being finalized. It shall cover the period FY2016/17 to FY2020/21 and will be presented to
Parliament for approval according to the timeline under the PFM Act.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The authorities’ monetary policy focuses primarily on the inflation objective. They are
committed to keeping monetary policy centered on achieving the medium term inflation
target and will continue to carefully adapt monetary policy to changing domestic and external
developments. Further, the BOU will continue to strengthen the current inflation targeting
framework regime by improving its monetary policy formulation and capacity building.
The financial sector is well capitalized, reasonably liquid and profitable, however, there are
vulnerabilities from credit sector concentration and currency mismatches. The BOU is
committed to further strengthening its prudential oversight and ensuring adequate
provisioning for non-performing loans. As they continue to make progress with the
implementation of the FSAP update recommendations, the BOU is carrying out programs to
enhance financial deepening and access to bank services by improving financial literacy and
consumer protection.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
To improve the business climate, the Ugandan government has undertaken legal and
regulatory reforms including in land administration, business registration and licensing. A
national identification project is being rolled out to support efforts to strengthen revenue
collection, promote unique identification of financial sector clients and combat money
laundering and terrorism financing. The authorities are committed to addressing the recent
Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) concerns on the shortcomings in Uganda’s
AML/CFT. To this end, significant steps have been taken including the passing of the AntiTerrorism Amendment Bill, 2015 by Parliament on June 18, 2015 which seeks to amend the

4
Anti-terrorism Act, 2002 to include proposals on terror financing. The authorities are also
undertaking reforms in the financial sector, including pensions, to create efficient
mechanisms to mobilize long term capital.
Progress towards the East African Community (EAC) integration is being made and the first
annual Medium Term Convergence Program (MTCP) has been prepared. This outlines the
medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives, strategies and policies to ensure that the
economy attains a high degree of monetary and economic convergence and compatibility
with other EAC partner states and follows a stable and sound trajectory towards meeting the
convergence criteria.
Conclusion
The authorities remain dedicated to maintaining economic stability and supporting
sustainable and inclusive growth by generating employment and reducing poverty and will
continue to strengthen controls and institutional governance. They have noted staff’s
concerns on the risks stemming from the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections
in February 2016 and reiterate their commitment to maintaining election-related expenditures
to levels contained in the budget.
